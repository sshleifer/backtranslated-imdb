I do not care if you want my comment or not, but I think you write that the movie is not good. You're so obsessed with the Hollywood movies that you can not see how good this movie is I'm not a fan of Jay Chou, but I like his game and not just .... Maybe you think the idea does not make much sense, and maybe you think it's not that interesting, but look in it's more than action in the movies more than love and passion and tears are more than the US the world and it's good :) really good. And it costs a lot to do it, so please do not criticize the actors directing the directors because you do not know how hard they work for you to be happy in those one and a half hours by thanking them like you :)
