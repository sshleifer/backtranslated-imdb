I saw this movie after seeing Blue Crush and other Michelle films. I thought she had a bleak future in this business. I was extremely wrong after watching her performance in "Girlfight" a fighter, but also a warrior. In this film, she depicts the way she confronts her father with the treatment of her and her brother, the way she makes anger when she is hit and hide from love, or just because she has power she will not win. I think that role suited Michelle perfectly, although she had no previous experience. The director saw talent, I criticize himself for not seeing the talent in her.
