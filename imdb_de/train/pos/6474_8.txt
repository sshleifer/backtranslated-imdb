I was totally involved and could not wait for every episode. Acting has brought to life how emotionally a missing person in the family must be, along with the implications it would have for the next. The only problem we had as a family was how quickly everything was "explained" at the end. We could not hear clearly what was said, and had no idea what Gary's part of the whole thing was. Why did Kyle call him and why did he go along? After spending five hours in a series, we felt betrayed that only five minutes remained for the conclusion. I asked around and none of my friends who saw it was smarter. Very strange, but maybe we missed something important.
