When a little hobbit named Frodo Baggins inherits a magic ring from his uncle, the sorcerer examines Gandalf and discovers that the ring is an ancient creation of a wicked Dark Lord. If the ring is in his hands again, he will regain his power and destroy Middle Earth. Frodo and his faithful friends set out to destroy the ring with a gang of warriors. This is an underrated adaptation of the classic novels, as it only covers the first half of the story. Regardless, this is an epic and wonderfully animated movie. <br /> <br /> The animation is performed excellently with Rotoscope, which extends over live action footage. Ralph Bakshi worked well with his low budget. The film also features a great music score by Leonard Rosenman that suits every scene. There are a few storylines with the script, but that must be excused because the original deal was to turn the book trilogy into two films that had to be jammed a lot in the first one. My biggest criticism is a bit of character design, Samwise was a bit too stupid, while the other hobbits seem completely normal. The other characters are really well written for the screen, and the voice actors are doing a great job. I was pleased that Legolas is indeed a little more helpful to the plot. The rotoscoped orcs are weird rather than frightening, while the ringwraiths are scary and nightmarish. Another problem is that the evil sorcerer Saruman is called thanks to the writer Aruman. Overall, I think a little more money and better writers would have brought a lot of justice to that, but that has something sexy about it. Ralph Bakshi bravely tried to adapt the classic stories to the screen. The film suffers terribly from being overshadowed by the live-action movies, but it's still a great movie for animation lovers of all ages.
