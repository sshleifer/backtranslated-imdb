I have also just returned from an advanced show at Redeye and I have to say that I have not had so much fun watching a movie in a while. WES CRAVEN is at its best. He brings us an amazing end to the summer thriller that I longed for so much. This is THE thriller of the year ... no doubt. <br /> <br /> All the actors are amazing and the action is realistic and fun. The F / X were great. It has always built up tension. I was the biggest part of the movie on the edge of my seat. It has been a while since I heard an audience cheering and clapping and getting excited in a theater. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for thrills, action and a good plan this summer, REDEYE offers. Look at it!
