I do not want to spend too much time wandering around the conspiracy - you've seen the trailer and when you're not online. I do not recommend seeing it - it was poorly constructed and did not grab the laugh or the magic from the movie. Those who avoid this film because of its lousy follower should therefore give this film a chance. It is really funny. I was overwhelmed by the wisdom and originality in this film. For the first 40 minutes, I was hysterically on the ground - my only problem was that in the last 20 he became unnecessarily a bad Austin Powers movie. However, this is one of the few movies where the Campy-end did not hurt me the rest of the movie (which is usually the case). Everyone does a great job (especially Joan Cusack) and there are some really great moments. Personally, I plan to see it again when it comes out - just to capture all the details I laughed at first looking at!
