I could not wait to get this one in my hands as I read Fred Astaire in a movie starring George Burns & Gracie Allen with a script by P.G. Wodehouse and music of the Gershwins. It is definitely worth seeing, but lacks the cohesive quality of the Fred & Ginger films. <br /> <br /> The story would probably be better to read in a Wodehouse book where humor is better. Part of the acting is very painful (especially the boy and the girl). <br /> <br /> But ...! The Funhouse Dance is worth more than most movies. I never knew that Gracie Allen can dance, but boy makes her in this movie. Have you ever tried to stand in a Funhouse on one of these spinning discs? Imagine you are dancing in high heels! She lives wonderfully with Astaire and contributes significantly to the overall quality of the image. <br /> <br /> Some nice songs, especially fun are Nice Work, if you can get it, and Stiff Upper Lip. <br /> <br /> Recommended for fans of Astaire, Burns & Allen. I had to go back and see the funhouse dance again as soon as the credits rolled.
