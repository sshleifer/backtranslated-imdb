Leonard Maltin must have seen another movie. (Although I find his guide a very valuable resource, please ignore his comments on this.) He says, "starts well, then flickers," when it's really the opposite - "starts to fade, then it burns ". The plot is as simple as it gets. Happy Mom, Happy Dad and Happy Son are vacationing on a secluded beach, Dad is incapacitated, Mom runs away to get help, meets dangerous kidnapped convicts. Mom tries to persuade the convicted person to help while dad waits and lasts a long life. <br /> <br /> The good whiteness is surprised by an electrical jolt from Ralph Meeker that suddenly appears (director John Sturges films him in a clever way that makes you gasp, as the crafty, desperate criminal Meeker is an uncommonly funky, ruthless actor (at least here and in the classic "Kiss Me Deadly"), and he happily grabs the keys to the film's narrative, speeding it down, his character has a habit of grinning and childishly when he's especially happy with his misdeeds, there's a fun pause in the action as they get a flat tire and he instructs his hostage, Barbara Stanwyck, "Do not go away" She shoots back "Where would I go?" (They're in the middle of nowhere) and he realizes the sitcom is "Yes, that's right." The friction between them is a shout. <br /> <br /> There are mistakes something ridiculous. There's a scene in which the police Meeker has been following for some time, Stanwycks stops car and deprives himself of the discovery that Meeker rested his head on her shoulder, as a loving husband would do, and pretends as if she was interviewed. A. He looks remarkably unmasked in this pose and B. I think it's safe to say that any adult who seems to sleep during a law enforcement meeting is certainly suspicious. <br /> <br /> Still a robust man a thriller who leads to an exciting and edifying result. <br /> <br />
