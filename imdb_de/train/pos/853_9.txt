"The Matador" shows Pierce Brosnan as a burned-out assassin. He's James Bond to sow in too tight, garish clothes, golden chains and an ugly haircut. Our battling assassin, Julian Noble, is in Mexico trying to regain his nerves. Staying in the same hotel is a likable, happy businessman Danny Wright (Greg Kinnear), who is also trying to regain his balance. Danny desperately wants to make a deal and return with good news to his wife in Denver (Hope Davis). Noble and Wright unexpectedly become friends. Wright convinces Noble to reveal certain techniques he demonstrates in a bullfight. Noble is eventually targeted by his employers and appears in Denver. <br /> <br /> Author and director Richard Shepard asked the questions and answers after watching this delightful film at the Austin Film Festival. Shepard had lost his luck as well. After suffering the loss of his agent and rejecting the latest scripts, he decided to write a story no one would buy and create a character nobody wants to play. Then Pierce called Brosnan. Brosnan regains his balance in this film. (There's a life after Bond!) He has a wonderful flair for self-deprecating comedy. Do not miss it. <br /> <br /> Stay with the credits to read what the filmmakers say about bullfighting. I am looking forward to further projects by Richard Shepard.
