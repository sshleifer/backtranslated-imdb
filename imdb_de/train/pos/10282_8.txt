If your idea of ​​a thriller is chases, explosions and dozens of people being shot down by shots, House of Games is definitely not the movie for you. If you like and appreciate psychological drama and excitement then you will definitely see it. <br /> <br /> "House of Games" tells the story of a respected psychologist and writer, dr. Margaret Ford (Lindsay Crouse) trying to help a patient and interfere with the shadowy world of cheats, led by charismatic Mike (Joe Mantegna). To say more about the plot would ruin the tension. Honestly, I find it hard to believe anyone who says he sees the twists coming. Just like a clever trick artist, this movie pulls you into its web and lulls your alertness. <br /> <br /> The story is taut and thoughtful, the dialogue is smart and laconic, the acting equally good (Mantegna is superbly charismatic). Some have complained that Dr. Ford is not a very likeable character, and wondered why Mamet Lindsay would make Crouse so physically unattractive. But Dr. Ford should be cold and distant; Moreover, their comfort is, in a sense, essential to the plot (at some point, I believe that violating their sexual self-esteem is an essential part of their motivation ... I'm not saying). <br /> <br /> "House of Games" is a darker look at the underside of human nature that suggests an uncomfortable ambiguity. It will keep your attention every second while you watch and stay with you for a long time.
