This is a scary movie. David Lynch is more scary than anything, and that shows what a great director Polanski is, since this is not his usual kind of work and BRILLIANT is Paris. He soon learns that the previous tenant, a young woman, committed suicide and he believes the rest of the people living there have made her commit suicide. He also believes that they are trying to do the same to him. The result is an amazing and scary look at the paranoia. <br /> <br /> The whole production is full of classic horror: From visual language to music, the viewer can feel the horror of poor Trelkovski <br /> Are they all out to kill him? Or maybe just drive him crazy? Is there a difference? You have to find it out on your own. 10/10
