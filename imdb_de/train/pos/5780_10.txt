The Maxx is a deep psychological introspective, easily disguised as a crazy superhero story. Julie Winters is a "freelance social worker" in an unnamed, dirty city, full of crime, and she and everyone she knows has a lot of problems to solve. The Maxx is her friend and customer, a street lover who thinks he's a costumed superhero - or is it the other way around? <br /> <br /> The Maxx is for the artwork, the story itself or not to miss The excellent voice work - especially the late Barry Stigler, the deliciously urban, dripping evil voice of the main villain Mr. Gone. <br /> <br /> If you get the chance to see this, you should not miss it.
