I can no longer agree with the comments from Nomad 7 and I A HVR. A perfectly relaxed Sunday morning movie. The humor is subtle (just the opposite of "slapstick," as a misguided commentator noted). <br /> <br /> But what keeps me upset is the frequency with which I always want to return to this film. I originally copied this movie to VHS about 12 years ago when it premiered on one of those Pay Cable-free weekend previews (HBO maybe?). I had never heard of it before. I do not know why it was not marketed so well. ?? When mass DVDs were released, this was one of the first films I replaced. A great combination of cast and writing. In addition, the back of the Montana wilderness harms nothing (beautiful). It's probably not the kind of comedy for everyone, but what is it? If the stuff of Adam Sandler is in your lane, this probably will not be your cup of tea. This movie needs your full attention. The humor is mostly in dialogue. <br /> <br /> I think my next sight will probably be about my 12th. But I still know I'll lose it when it comes to the scenes where the hoods of the police cars go off (Ed O'Neill's face is PRICELESS!). Recommended 110%.
