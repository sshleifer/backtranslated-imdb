I can not agree with the one who did not like this movie. <br /> <br /> I've always loved this movie when I was little and still. It's cute, funny and warms your heart. And it proves that love and friendship can never be destroyed. <br /> <br /> And although it was not much of a story, it was still excellent, I give a 10 and a two thumbs up. <br /> <br /> Oh yes, and it proves that your deepest desires and dreams can come true. (Tearing, tearing) <br /> <br /> I love this movie, personally, if anyone says it's shitty, then I'll say "shame on you". Because it was a lovely little movie and I am glad that at least some people liked it.
