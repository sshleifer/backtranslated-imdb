As an old white housewife I can still say that Laurence Fishburne is one of our best actors. Anyone who appreciates his work, as in Deep Cover, can enjoy watching the incredible spectacle of this actor. Since I think this is his directorial debut, it could be even more interesting. Acting is pretty good. If you can not accept the bottom worlds of Manhattan or the reality of crime life (not glorified action-shoot em-ups), this is not a movie you would enjoy. It is Mr. Fishburne's usual contribution to incredibly subtle relationships. I'd like to see Larry and Anthony Hopkins meet in a movie one day.
