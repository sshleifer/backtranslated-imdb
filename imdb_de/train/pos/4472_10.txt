Right at the beginning you can see that "Anchors Aweigh" is a great comedy. Gene Kelly and Frank Sinatra form such a funny team! The songs they sing together are pure entertainment. Kathryn Grayson is beautiful and very cute. Dean Stockwell is the cutest kid actor I've ever met. If you like piano, you will love Jos√© Iturbi. This movie was the first to combine animations with real actors, and it did so wonderfully in an unforgettable dance number. Undoubtedly one of Kelly's funniest films.
