The cast is excellent, the acting is good, the plot interesting, the development full of excitement ... but it's hard to put all those elements into a movie that's barely 80 minutes long. If more time was needed to develop the plot and subplots, this would have a much better effect. Another 30 minutes of substance would have made this film a very good one and not just a good one.
