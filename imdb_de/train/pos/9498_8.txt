"Painting is seeing, then remembering better than you have seen." So says Dick Heldar (Ronald Colman), the painter in The Light That Failed. The movie is in great old Hollywood style, with Ronald Colman and a bravado cast involving Ida Lupino in her first important role, the credible character actor Dudley Digges (who also co-starred with Colman in Condemned) and solid Performance of the wonderful actor Walter Huston. <br /> <br /> The title and opening sequences of the movie pretty much reveal the fact that Dick will lose his sight. He is dazzled by gunpowder ejection as he and his childhood sweetheart play Maisie (Muriel Angelus) with a gun. Later, a wound during the fight in Sudan is the trigger for his blindness. He becomes a famous painter, but he goes blind with ambition and only reaches his full potential when he is out of sight. Enter the evil girl Bessie (Ida Lupino) and his self-destruction begins to move. Lupino is very powerful in this role and plays Colman very well. Her bad cake reminds me of Bette Davis in Of Human Bondage. <br /> <br /> This is one of my favorite Colman melodramas.
