Walt Disney's "The Rookie" is based on the story of Jim Morris, a former minor league player who made one of the most amazing comebacks in sports history. He finished his nearly 10-year retirement and debuted in the Major League at the age of 35 in 1999. <br /> <br /> The film opens with a brief summary of Morris' childhood, which included a series of resettlement - his father was a military. And even when his family settled forever in football-loving Texas, Morris' passion for baseball was strong. The childhood segment then jumps about 23 years before the adult Morris (played by Dennis Quaid), who is now a baseball coach and chemistry teacher at Big Lake High School (in real life it was Reagan County High School in Big Lake, Texas). It is mentioned that he tried a career as a baseball player, but it did not work out. <br /> <br /> Morris' team has difficulties and he teaches them to give up their dreams. They use the table and tell him to try a major league team. At several times, when he comes in the field, they marvel at the speed with which he throws. Morris seems unconvinced, but agrees to a deal with his players, in which he, when he wins the district, seeks a Major League team. Big Lake wins the district and sticks to its end, Morris attends a Tampa Bay Devil Rays test. Phenomenally, he throws 98 mph - faster than he has thrown in his career as a minor league and even for a major league pitcher an excellent pace. After another try with the team Morris is offered a contract with the Devil Rays. <br /> <br /> This makes him a difficult decision - stay in his comfortable life or re-pursue his Major League dream by going through him. The minor league mills little money and spends months at home. And the decision is even more difficult than in his first minor league scene because he now has a wife and three children. Morris signs with the Devil Rays, starts at the AA level and quickly climbs to AAA level, a level below Major League Baseball. But with the season, the chances of his being "called up" are getting smaller and smaller. <br /> <br /> For the most part I love this movie. There are many great achievements and likable characters, and it's easy to get interested in Morris. The film also does a great job showing professional baseball in both major and minor leagues. And above all, it teaches the timeless message of clinging to your dreams, even when they seem distant and almost impossible to reach. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, the film has some shortcomings. While it is generally accurate, it surpasses and even makes some things. More examples can be found at http://espn.go.com/page2/s/closer/020410.html. Apart from a scene in which he prays with his players, the film completely ignores Morris' Christian faith. But considering Disney's eagerness, that's not surprising. <br /> <br /> Presumably many exaggerations / fantasies were made to make the story more dramatic. The 20-minute documentary on Morris included on the DVD, however, contains some information that makes his story more dramatic, but excluded from the film. For example, from the birth to the final settlement of his family in Texas. When he was 12 years old, Morris was resettled 14 times. And his initial career in the small league ended after four operations that left him half the muscles in his left (pitching) shoulder, making his throw of 98 mph even more inexplicable. <br /> <br /> To fully understand and understand the story of Jim Morris, it's good to see not only "The Rookie", but also to watch the documentary of the DVD, the link above Read inaccuracies of the film and probably also read Morris' biography, which is also called "The Rookie". I have not read the book, but I hope for one of these days. <br /> <br /> But overall, "The Rookie" is a very good portrayal of a wondrous story and a powerful testament to the power of dreams and the triumph of the common man. 8.10
