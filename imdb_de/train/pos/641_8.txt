This show has a few clich√©s and some exaggerated Dawson's Creek-like moments (a 16-year-old speaks of a time when life made sense?), But overall it seems to be a decent show. Most characters look very real and the story seemed to be moving well in the pilot - and ended with a good lesson at the end. I just hope that not every episode turns out to be the first life-changing one, that would just be too much drama for this vehicle. Jeremy Sumpter does an excellent job as a teenager with a passion for baseball. I think many of us could refer to his awe and sometimes to the tunnel vision for the team he always wanted to have a part of.
