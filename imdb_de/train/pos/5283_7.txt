The premise for this film is simple and the script is as well: The script of an elderly Muslim leaves him with his teenage son in his similarly older station wagon from France to the Haj in Mecca, Saudi Arabia, bringing him before his holy Muslim commitment He can die. The father is clearly religiously religious, but the son is unimpressed; he accepts out of duty to his father and not to religion, he prefers to be with his (non-Muslim) girlfriend. The father is stubborn in many things, which the son does not understand, and the hoax between them is the device that sustains the drama, though it is often quite annoying. As with any good road movie, there are also strange characters. For example, a woman in a side street in Croatia who is questioned about the demand for Belgrade simply goes into the back seat and shows by hand a word that they suppose to be a place, but not on the map Can be found. In Bulgaria, another man asks for instructions that he can speak French, but gives a detailed commentary in Bulgarian. Occasionally there is also humor - in one country, the son is tired of eating egg sandwiches and wants meat - they get a goat, but unfortunately (perhaps fortunately for the beholder) it runs away before the father can perform the Muslim slaughter ritual , They eventually make it to Mecca - the Muslim equivalent of the Vatican, but on a much larger scale. For Westerners everything is bizarre but fascinating. The film is not pretentious, but charming in its own way, a kind of National Geographic with soul.
