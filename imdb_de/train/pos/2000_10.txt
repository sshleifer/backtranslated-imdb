I participated in a small mini-production of it when I was 8 at school and my mother bought the video for me. I have always loved it !! When I was younger it was the songs and spectacular dance sequences that I enjoyed, but since I saw this as I got older, I appreciate the fantastic acting and character portrayal more. Oliver Reed and Ron Moody were brilliant. I can not imagine anyone else playing Bill Sykes or Fagin. Shani Wallis' Nancy is the best character for me. She has accepted so much for these guys, I think she's such a strong character and her last scene, if ... Well, you know ... I always have to cry! In my opinion the best musical of all time. It has taken all the time, it will live on for many more years! 11/10 !!
