There are few comedies like these, where almost every line and character is almost flawless. This is soooo funny !! And it has a lot of satire to offer. Sally Field leads the field of truly outstanding actors and does a good if not perfect job with her TV diva during the day. Sometimes her acting is a bit too broad and exaggerated, but in 90% of the time she is uprising! In the same league are Kevin Kline, Robert Downey Jr and Whoopy Goldberg (who unfortunately has too little to do here). Downey jr does not quite convince as a comedian and does not always have the right timing, but he's struggling with his part, which, frankly, is the most ungrateful. But the shining star here is Cathy Moriarty as Celeste, a real bitch, if ever there was one who had more than one bad secret (you'll see in the absolutely breathtaking finale!) Unfortunately, Elisabeth Shue never seems quite comfortable in her role feel. I usually like Ms. Shue, but here she seems like a fish out of the water and sometimes seems to be in another movie. But it is not harmful and at least it is at least enough. Otherwise, this comedy is full of unimaginative lines and situations whenever she is on television or wherever.
