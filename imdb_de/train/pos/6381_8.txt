"Atlantis" is a new and right step for a Disney feature. It's a good choice to make a movie with such a mysterious legend as "Atlantis". I had no expectations for this movie, but after seeing it, I do not quite understand why this movie got such bad reviews. Also in my country, the reviewers were not positive. <br /> <br /> "Atlantis" is not a perfect movie, but still one of the biggest Disney's, though I doubt that movie will be "Disney classic". Well, that's another case. It's funny to think that this sci-fi movie was directed by the same directors as "Beauty and the Beast" and "Hunchback" (so Kirk Wise and Gary Trousdale try to free themselves from their monster movie reputation, he, I'm just kidding). <br /> <br /> Well, enough nonsense. "Atlantis" is a worth seeing, exciting and very entertaining movie. Again, this movie is a PG-rated action feature that I think is also suitable for children (parents who say the opposite do not kill me for writing this, he). <br /> <br /> The story is a bit predictable, but it does not ruin the movie. The cartoon inspired animation is suitable for the movie and is different from the usual Disney style. It is colorful, dark and detailed. The deep canvas sequences are pretty impressive. The movie is sometimes funny too, even I chuckled more than laugh through the movie. (SPOILERS) The characters of this movie are also very nice, but unfortunately there is not enough time to get to know all the characters, leaving some characters behind (SPOILERS). <br /> <br /> The score of James Newton Howard is absolutely great. It is daring and exotic. (SPOILER) The most impressive thing about this film is how it makes the Atlantic language sound very natural, ethnic and authentic. It's really great (SPOILERS OVER) <br /> <br /> The script is tight and well written, but there are still some questions that remain unanswered in the story. But fortunately there are not so many of them. <br /> <br /> So you yourself are a favor, do not listen to the reviewers and look "Atlantis" because it's waiting for you ...
