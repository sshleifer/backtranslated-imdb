This is not a movie for fans of the usual scary lynch stuff. It's meant for those who either appreciate a good story or become tired of everyday things with obvious sentimentalism and Oprah. "This is such a wonderful movie, you have to see it!" Then she is right!). <br /> <br /> The story goes smoothly and we're taking a trip that, I believe, most of us will eventually recognize. A compassionate, existential journey that will make up for our past as we approach our inevitable demise. The action is error-free, the cinematography also (sometimes quite brilliant!) And the dialogue leaves the viewer just enough to capture the details of the story. <br /> <br /> A warm movie. Not overly sentimental.
