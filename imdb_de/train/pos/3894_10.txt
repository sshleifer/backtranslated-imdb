I wish I could laugh as much again as I did when I saw this show for the first time. I have not done it since then. <br /> <br /> The strange thing is that I laugh almost as hard after watching the show again. <br /> <br /> Eddie Izzard is a cultivated, poignant, man of the world. He speaks cleverly about politics and yet does not feel that he needs to "engage" in the political discussion. He stands over it. I would juxtapose him with George Carlin, who uses his comedy to convince people of his ideas, and does not seem to like him trying to talk
