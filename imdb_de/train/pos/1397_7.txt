"Shore Leave" is usually an average Star Trek adventure. Nothing wrong with the episode. I just think that this is not the best way to show what the show had to offer the fans. It's easy, entertaining, nothing more. However, I'm glad to see that such a TV show had enough meaning to rid itself of serious intergalactic conflicts. In this episode, Kirk decides to give his crew a break, and a landing party is beamed to a planet that looks like the perfect place for a vacation. As usual, the planet is not as peaceful as it seems. There are some action packed and tense moments, but most of the story is laughed at. Good, but not exceptional.
