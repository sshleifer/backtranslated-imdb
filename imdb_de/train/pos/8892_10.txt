Great, great! That's all I can say about this movie, but imdb wants at least four lines of text, so I'll go into that in more detail. The cast was great (Jerry O'connel is sooo sweet!), The music was great (the sixties had the best music ever, imho), the historical material was interesting and so was the 90s actor Es Seems like they were there in the 60s. And most of all - the stories of the main characters brought tears to my eyes, and that's the size of every drama. But in one word, great!
