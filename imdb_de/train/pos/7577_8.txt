WHO IS THE GOLD? is (unfortunately) the last of the films of HANZO THE RAZOR with Shintaro Katsu as the title character - the versatile, armed Samurai officer with the "unique" technique of raping confessions of unwanted female informants until they "leak" the beans " and beg for more ... <br /> <br /> This entry starts with Hanzo "uncovering" a woman posing as a ghost to guard a lake filled with bamboo trunks filled with gold The result is that Hanzo discovers a loan sharking scheme and an orgy ring led by a blind monk, and the necessary swordfighting and rape / interrogation followed - ending with a decent end to this strange trilogy. <br /> <br /> Not quite as strong and enjoyable as THE SNARE (Part 2 of the series ...), but still great for fans of Samurai Sleaze and Japanese films in the Pinky style 8/10
