A lovingly remembered melodrama? mainly thanks to Ronald Colman's fine, Oscar-winning performance in the lead role? on an often-discussed topic: the nature of action and how it can overtake the perception of reality. In this case, we have a well-known Thespian who tackles Shakespeare's "Othello" so that the last third of the movie effectively dives into the thriller genre? with press agent Edmond O'Brien (who is really tainted with Colman's co-star and ex-wife Signe Hasso), who examines the possible involvement of the actor in the Desdemona-like choking of a prominent waitress (a very slender Shelley) Winters). The theatrical / New York atmosphere of the immediate postwar period is recognized by the man and woman writer-writing team of Garson Kanin and Ruth Gordon and the legendary "actor-director" George Cukor (all recognized by the Academy) nominations); By the way, the film has grabbed a second Oscar for Miklos Rozsas eclectic score. Colman, forever the sovereign captain, also blessed with a velvety voice, does Shakespeare do well enough? the conviction worsens, the farther his character gets into compulsive jealousy, a murderous rage, and finally paranoia; However, he is not disappointed by a side cast that includes director Ray Collins, reporter Millard Mitchell, detective Joe Sawyer, and coroner Whit Bissell. Although the middle section is somewhat tense, the film makes up for the deficiencies with a remarkably handled expressionist denouement situation.
