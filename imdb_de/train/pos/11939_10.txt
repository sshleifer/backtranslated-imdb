I always like this great baseball movie! It has a good cast, including two great actors and two of my favorites Danny Glover and Christopher Lloyd! Ben Johnson, Brenda Fricker, Big Tony Longo, Tony Danza and Matthew McConaughey are in this film too! Also Jay O. Sanders and Dermot Mulroney! The movie features great special effects and plays by all the actors in the movie! The baseball scenes are all realistic! The music of the composer Randy Edelman is very good and goes very well with the movie! Some of the actors who reminded me of baseball personalities. Stoney Jackson's Ray Mitchell character reminded me of Royce Clayton, McConaughey's character reminded me of Steve Finley and Jay O. In my opinion, Sanders's commentator resembled what Al Hrabosky looks like today. This is a fantastic movie for non and baseball fans and I highly recommend this movie!
