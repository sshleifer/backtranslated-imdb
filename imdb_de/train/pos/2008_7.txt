The original vampires (1998) are one of my favorites. I was curious how a sequel would work, considering that they did not use any of the original characters. I was pretty surprised how that worked. Continuations are, with a few exceptions, never as good as the original. Although this is not a great movie, the author has well taken care of the main themes and vampire tradition right from the start. Jon Bon Jovi was a downside at first, but he turned out to be a reasonably decent Slayer. I doubt anyone could outperform James Wood's performance in the first ... unless you bring Buffy with you! > <br /> I had two questions, but ... what happened to Jack Crow and how did Derek Bliss become a hunter? I think we just have to leave that to the imagination.
