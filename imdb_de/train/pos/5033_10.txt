This is one of the movies that you think about for a few months after watching it again. Acting is spectacular for two kids (I usually hate movies with a crying kid). Bill Paxton is great, his directorial debut is even better than what I would have expected of an actor, whose most memorable line is "Game over, man! Game over!" (from the movie "Aliens"). <br /> <br /> The best thing about the film is the dichotomy between the scenes where the actors play a family and when they do their "work". It makes the movie really believable and memorable. <br /> <br /> Keep it up, Bill. I'll wait for more movies that I'm sure I'll love!
