The continuation of the ever-popular Cinderella story reminded me a little of what they had done with one of the Beauty & the Beast movies. Basically, there are three short stories, which were summarized in 1. <br /> <br /> OK, the mice are adorable (I love Gus! He's so cute!) and Lucifer is (as usual) great. I also liked some of the newer characters (Pom Pom was adorable and Prudence pleased me.). Nevertheless, the plot was somewhat limited, but still very sweet. So I agree 7/10.
