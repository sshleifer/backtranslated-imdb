Heh, if I tell you to compare The Dark Knight to an eighteen-year-old comic-adapted movie with a score of 5.9, will you call me crazy? That's just to get your attention. Every day I meet people who complain, there are no good movies that only the youngest blockbusters seem to know. It is never a bad thing to search and explore old films, especially those with good artistic values. Dick Tracy is one of those who are not so outdated technically. <br /> <br /> The negative reviews mainly complained about DT's "dirty" story. However, it seems to me that the plot is pretty clear, and I had no problem handling it. I have not seen the comic books, but I'm not a big American comic fan, but I appreciate the first-rate filmmaking and the performances. Maybe most people's expectations were too high, which she would tell. But if you see a movie that pours Madonna and Warren Beatty together, what would you expect? I had some scratches on my head and I'm not surprised if we really saw the same movie. The title role, though not as competent as it sounds, could still pull him up and charm the audience. Madonna was more expressionless than "breathless" in her seductive role, but added a lot of humor to the story. Al Pacino was funny and wonderful for himself. Apparently he's brave enough to make his previously successful roles sarcastic. We can see a cross between Scarface, Michael Corleone, Adolf Hitler, and Robert De Niro, who are punching us in the gut to make us laugh. And many thanks to make-ups. <br /> <br /> For me, that's not bad at all. The surreal feeling really got me.
