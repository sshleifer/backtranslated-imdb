This is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. I've watched it on DVD, and the disc has no special features or even a menu, but that's not necessarily what I'm interested in. <br /> <br /> I tend to judge films on a case-by-case basis, depending on whether it's a big studio production or a smaller one. This is a smaller movie and I'm ready to forgive smaller things. However, I believe that there is one of the most inventive and original title sequences I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed the acting of all the big players. I especially enjoyed Til Schweiger and Alan Arkin. Alan Arkin has the most funniest lines. The figure portrayed by Claire Forlani may seem unrealistic to some people, but I've personally met real people with emotional issues who are happy to look at life's decisions the way their character does. That helped me to recognize the nuances in which her injuries could be expressed through the veneer of her humor. <br /> <br /> This is obviously not a movie for kids, obviously, but it's NOT unfounded sex and nudity. There is a bit of adult language, but it can be very funny sometimes. (Especially Alan Arkin's character who can not even swear.) <br /> <br /> Also pay attention to the cameos of well-known character actors.
