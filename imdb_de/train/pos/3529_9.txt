Scott Henderson (Alan Curtis) is wrongly accused of killing his unfaithful wife. The night she was murdered, he was traveling with a mysterious woman who refused to give her name. Accused of the murder, the police visit all the places he was with her, but people only remember that he was alone. He is sentenced to death and his secretary (Ella Raines) goes in search of the murderer because she loves him. <br /> <br /> This was made as a B-movie by Universal (see cast member - all character actors) and a star - Franchot Tone - in decline). The budget was small and the cast largely unknown, but what came out is one of the best movie noirs of the 1940s. It is beautifully directed by Curt Siodmak and has a fantastic script that comes from an excellent book by William Irish (a pseudonym for Cornell Woolrich). It moves fast and just looks fantastic. And there's the notorious jam session with Raines and Elisha Cook Jr., who comes straight off the screen with incredible sexual energy (I'm surprised the censors did not cut them off). <br /> <br /> There are only a few mistakes that prevent this from being perfect. Sound gives a terrible performance. He looks awful and is just terrible. Curtis is also stiff and bland as Henderson. You really wonder why Raines loves him - he is so emotionless. But Raines is pretty good in the lead role. She is pretty and full of life. Even the last scene where the killer is after her never sounds right. He is hardly physically a threat and his reactions seem to be exaggerated. <br /> <br /> I still give a 9. A really big movie error.
