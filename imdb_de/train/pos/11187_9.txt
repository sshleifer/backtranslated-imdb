Pet Semetary (1989) 9/10 The Creed family has just moved to the small town of Ludlow. The family consists of a father, Louis, a mother, Rachel, a brother Gage and a daughter Ellen. You are welcomed by Jud Crandall with kindness. Jud is 89 years old and could basically tell you all about the whole story of Ludlow. Behind the new house of the Creed a path leads to an animal cemetery (spelled half-storey). When Ellen wants to go upstairs, Jud purposely takes the family on a journey. This is the beginning of hell for the Creed family. <br /> <br /> When Rachel and the kids left, Ellen's Cat Church dies. Jud is of the opinion that Ellen is not ready to kill her cat, and therefore suggests that Louis follow him on the path, past the animal cemetery. <br /> <br /> Jud tells Louis about this funeral site that was once used by Micmac Indians. Louis buries the church without Juds help. A few days later, Church returns alive but out of hell. <br /> <br /> This movie was one of two horror films that could really scare me apart from "The Exorcist". The greatest achievement would ever have been Zelda, Rachel's sister with spinal meningitis, or Victor Pascow, a ghost trying to help the creeds, making the mistake of bringing things back from the dead. The music in this movie plays an extravagant role. It is both sad and mysterious. It fits wonderfully to the movie. <br /> <br /> 9/10
