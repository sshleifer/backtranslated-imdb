THE LADY FROM SHANGHAI is proof that the great genius Orson Welles could make a "mainstream" movie if he wanted. Compared to his other, more artistic works, this film has only modest cunning and almost no esoteric elements. The exception, of course, is the last scene in the Hall of Mirrors. widely agreed to be one of the biggest scenes in movie history. But the rent is worth it. <br /> <br /> The sweet surprise was the great spectacle of the beautiful Rita Hayworth. Her acting at the beginning and in the middle of the film is so outstanding that she made the other actors appear as caricatures rather than characters. Even the great Mr. Welles.
