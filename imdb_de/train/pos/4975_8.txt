By God, it's been a long time since I saw this. Probably about 18 years ago? <br /> <br /> The film tells (children) everything about human blood and the circulatory system. Put together very professionally - Disney-style animations and human performers - it was directed by Frank Capra, for God's sake! <br /> <br /> A kind of overkill. I wonder if the very high production value is worth the value of a film strip over the human body. But boy, will these children learn when they see it? I remember well that Dr. Baxter was challenged by Hemo himself to name what material is most similar to human blood to which the doctor immediately responds to "seawater".
