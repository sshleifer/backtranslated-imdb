I think many viewers have completely missed the fact that this is obviously a parody of Western movies. <br /> <br /> This is not a bad movie - it's a smart joke on Western. I do not think this movie was taken seriously for a moment. <br /> <br /> What makes this movie even more unique is the fact that it focuses on 4 strong, beautiful women, two of whom are black and one black is Asian and one Mexican / Hispanic. <br /> <br /> These are not ordinary western women - they are tough - they can draw quickly and shoot directly. <br /> <br /> You are so hard that even the bartender trembles when pouring in her whiskey. <br /> <br /> The plot that drives this story is typical of Western - in the sense of "you shot my brother - so I" I'll get you! "Only in this West, a woman's sister was shot and she's looking for revenge on the gang who did it, so she leaves and collects her old buddies from their bank robber days. <br /> One of them, Maria, is not really interested in avenging Rachel's sister, but she's motivated by the fact that gold and jewelry are hidden in the city they're going to. <br /> <br /> There are a few scenes that Make no sense, not that they bother so much, they can be ignored, but I was wondering why they were there, so the movie could be a bit exhausting, but on the whole, this is a well-made movie that has not found an audience My only disappointment was that the only lesbian in the movie is a villain - of the "heroines," one is obviously watching others become sexual orientations never published. <br /> <br /> 7 h ars
