Who would have thought that such an obscure little movie could be so haunting and touching? I am really impressed. It is a shame that more people have not seen it. As always, I loved the rooms of Hans Zimmer. And what a directorial debut of Bernard Rose! But I wonder if I should call that a horror movie. It could easily be said that it is also a fantasy or a drama. Well, I still love the potential for interpretation. Everything and everyone in Anna's (played by Charlotte Burke) dreams represents a real conflict in her life ... the house itself, the tree, the marrow, the lighthouse, etc. It's the many details like these that make the movie so good make for repeated visits. I hope I come across another little movie with emotions and psychological meaning like this one some time later.
