I saw this film at the Santa Barbara Film Festival, and there was not a dry eye in the house. It's incredible, not only to see what a great person Darius, but also how admirably the rest of the team is also, and at such a young age, however, when they had the opportunity to participate positively and inspire rejected it off. Shows you whether they really care about the youth and their viewers. <br /> <br /> It is a wonderful and heartwarming true story being.
