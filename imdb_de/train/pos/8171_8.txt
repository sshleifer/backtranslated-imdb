I find that this review beats me up by the critics of the movie critics who patrol this site, but I will defend this movie. Acting is not always top notch, but the thrill is good and the story is good. You'll also see Linda Hoffman's boobies. Not that I'm an expert in this field, but the direction seems good and the story makes sense. Corbin makes a big scary dentist. It makes dentists what Jaws does with sharks ... ish. It obviously had a fairly limited budget, but they did well with what they could and developed the characters well (the ones that count). <br /> <br /> the end.
