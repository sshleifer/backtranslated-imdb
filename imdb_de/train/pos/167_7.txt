"Dance, Fools, Dance" is an early 1931 Crawford Gable vehicle. Crawford plays a Bonnie Jordan, a wealthy young woman whose life consists of partying, drinking alcohol, and taking off her clothes to jump off a yacht and go swimming. This all ends when her father dies and leaves her and her brother (William Blakewell) destitute. Bonnie gets a job in a newspaper called Mary Smith; Her brother works for bootleggers. The head man is Jake Luva - portrayed by Clark Gable as he plays another rogue. Later, of course, he became a romantic hero, but in the early '30s MGM used him as a villain. Bonnie does not know that her brother is involved in illegal activities and laughs at Luva. <br/> <br/> Gable and Crawford formed a great team. Her facial expressions are a bit wild, but that, along with her dancing, makes the movie fun. Look for Cliff Edwards, the voice of Jiminy Cricket, as Bert. <br /> <br /> It's always interesting to see the precoding films, and "Dance, Fools, Dance" is no exception.
