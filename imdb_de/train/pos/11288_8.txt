Considered by almost all critics as the best of the Johnny Weissmuller Tarzan films, I have no argument, although there are a few others that I find equally entertaining. One thing: It's the longest of the series I've seen at 105 minutes. I've only seen six of them, but that was longer than I'm used to, and with the lengthy action finale, I thought it was a bit too long. Good mix of action, suspense and romance. The only thing missing is color and stereo sound. The primitive special effects do not bother me, since this was all they had in the 1930s. <br /> <br /> Among some, this movie is known for one thing: skin! "Jane" never wore such a thing after the film was introduced when the Hays code was introduced when the next Tarzan film was shot. Her outfit showed what a great figure Maureen O'Sullivan possessed. The naked underwater scene, however, was not - by far. The underwater woman did not look good at all, whoever it was. <br /> <br /> There is a lot going on here. It was not exaggerated until the final. The end, however, lasted 15 minutes and was so intense that it was almost too much to see. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, this movie offers everything except "Boy" (her adopted son) - you I want to see in a Tarzan movie, even O'Sullivan, who plays her Tarzan, screams about a dozen times. That was no problem with her pair of "lungs".
