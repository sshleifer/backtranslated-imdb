I have been watching this show since I was 14 and have loved it ever since. I love this show because it's just funny! You will really enjoy this show, because every day it shows something new and funnier and my favorite part is when Benny has his last comments on George after every punch line about his fat giant head. With my friends at home, it would be like being a merry one Watch the movie, but short. Dear George Lopez. Funny, talented, funny, spectacular. This is a cool-funny family comedy series that's fun for everyone and you'll definitely enjoy it - I did! And if you have not seen it yet, I suggest you start watching because you do not want to stop it. Although there are no brand new episodes, I still enjoy the repetitions. Still funny. Never let up. <br /> <br /> 9/10
