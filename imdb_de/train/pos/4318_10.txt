A measure of the size of a movie is when it comes to TV. Would you sit there again? My answer to the Grand Canyon is such a strong "yes" as to almost every movie I've ever seen. There are so many powerful moments, an intelligent and moving story, incredible achievements. <br /> <br /> It perfectly captures the confusion and violence that was so prevalent in the early nineties. But it also dramatically confirms the individual's ability to love, think, and care. In a way, the movie was his time. It partially shows the company as a balloon, which is about to burst. As the country was in a recession and was thus runaway, this was true at the time. The movie is also timeless. I think it could be honest against any movie ever made, and it's the most overlooked movie of all time.
