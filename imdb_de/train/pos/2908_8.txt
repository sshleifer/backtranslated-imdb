This film is a journey of discovery, depicting the life of a family living in a sleepy island city in British Columbia. Lazy and dreamy, residents are content that life around them can continue until a young, fresh-looking teacher comes with new ideas and brings them from the mainland. Slowly her indolent state is awakened, the father (and the headmaster of the local school) is looking for excitement, the mother for stability, the eldest daughter for love and the youngest for power. Although it's not an incredible or groundbreaking piece of cinema, the movie is quietly pleasing and good for a tired night when the wind blows. Unfortunately, I doubt anyone outside of Canada is easily accessible.
