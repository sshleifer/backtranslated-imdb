As if the film itself was not of value, this is an excellent way to get an overview of the novel to read to it. In the summer of 1968, I saw the movie in NYC; This fall, I read the book for the first time. The joy of reading the novel was my memory of the meticulously detailed film. And for better or for worse - and I've read and taught the novel for over three decades now - Milo O'Shea is still Leopold Bloom.
