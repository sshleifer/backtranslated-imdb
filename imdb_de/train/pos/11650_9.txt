A most anticipated film of the year 2002. After three and a half years of hibernation Rajini has starred in this film. The hype for this movie was too high. <br /> <br /> This is not a typical Rajini movie, in this movie it also gives some spiritual messages. But it also contains typical Rajini actions, style, songs etc. It is a good entertaining movie and also gives good messages. <br /> <br /> I'll rate this movie as good, rather than excellent, based on the script. It is a must watch movie. Do not miss it!
