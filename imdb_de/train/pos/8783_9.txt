Gentleman Jim is not a boxing movie. It is a vehicle for Errol Flynn as Jim Corbett. However, the boxing scenes are a real eye-opener for the modern viewer. There are no 12 round point decisions. <br /> <br /> Errol Flynn plays the Irish bank employee who gets a shot at the heavyweight world title. Flynn lends itself well to the role of the polite but unpredictable Corbett. However, his opponent John Sullivan is still better, an old-school old man played by Ward Bond. <br /> <br /> The theme of the film is a man who is looking for his big chance. Corbett leaves his earthly life behind and builds a new personality as a gentleman Jim. Jim is a chancer who can adapt to any social environment. He is a liar and an egotist. Sullivan, the heavyweight boxing champion, is portrayed as a simple beast, but his honesty and sportiness contrast with the main character. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of action and excitement and a wonderful ending with the necessary salvation for all. And Errol Flynn gets the girl.
