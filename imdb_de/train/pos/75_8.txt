The great Vincent Price has made many fantastic horror films, some of which are among the greatest genre jewels of all time. No doubt, Price's greatest successes were his films in the '60s, with films like Roger Corman's brilliant Poe cycle (still the biggest horror cycle of all time), Michael Reeve's "Witchfinder General" (1968) or Ubaldo Ragona's "The Last." Man on Earth (1964) marks the ultimate highlight of this brilliant man's career, but the films that made the man famous, making him an immortal horror icon, date back to the 1950s, with "House of Wax" (1953) marked his rise to fame, "The Mad Magician" of 1954 follows an action very similar to that of the successful predecessor, but this is not to say that this film is not an original, marvelously macabre and absolutely wonderful gemstone. As you can see from the lines above, Vincent Price is my favorite actor, and although I personally would not allow myself to miss anything the man was in, none of my fellow fans should This man's missing this little gem. <br /> <br /> Price stars like Don Galico (aka Galico the Great), an underrated magician and inventor of magical devices whose boss, a shabby businessman, stole his wife (Eva Gabor) from him. When the boss takes one of Galicos ingenious inventions and hands it over to his rival The Great Rinaldi (John Emery), Galico breaks and a murderous revenge begins ... <br /> <br /> Right? Dear Vincent Price, if he seeks revenge? Some of his most famous and greatest films, such as "The Abominable Dr. Phibes" (1971) or "Theater of Blood" (1973), were about absurd and wonderfully macabre revenge killings, and this earlier film in his horror career is further proof of that No one avenges himself like Vincent Price. This film offers a wonderfully eccentric starring role for Price, who, as always, delivers a brilliant performance and guarantees every horror fan 70 minutes of unbelievably entertaining and macabre fun. Another must for my Price fans.
