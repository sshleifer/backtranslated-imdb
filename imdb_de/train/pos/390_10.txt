The first thing I thought when watching these movies was: It's not really a movie, at least it's not what we spontaneously imagine when we hear the word "movie". it is perfectly symbolic, everything in it has a figurative meaning. So if you are not used to expressing something symbolically, you will find it strange. If you are unfamiliar with philosophy, religion and spiritual life, you will think that it is just a fairy tale ... and even a strange messy one. For me, "The legend of Zu" is perfectly transparent. And I like it. It tells us in pictures the story of the struggle between light and darkness, the battle as old as humanity, and anyone who seeks meaning in this life is confronted with it. The movie was obviously made by Buddhists. I am not a Buddhist. My religion and the vision of the world and of man are different. As far as we are all human beings and have the same human nature, we necessarily have shared experiences and can understand each other. It's a really nice movie! And I had more films like these - films that have meaning. There are too many empty stories that only serve to pass the time faster.
