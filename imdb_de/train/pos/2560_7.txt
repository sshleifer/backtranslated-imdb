Brando plays the jet pilot just after he shot down the MiGs in the Korean War. On vacation, he discovers his Madame Butterfly, falls in love. The lovers see both the folly of racism and the cruelty that conservative cultural norms can bring to human relationships. This movie is an excellent romance with a nice twist that rejects the racist, conservative standards of the time it was made in 1957. "Sayonara" makes you laugh and cry. Careful, sometimes you wish for the musical background that it would not be there, although Irving Berlin's theme song will be remembered for a long time after the re-lighting of your theater lights.
