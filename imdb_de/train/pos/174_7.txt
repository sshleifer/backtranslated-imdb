Sunny, a cocktail waitress in the DC area, is a bit bleak to be lenient. She drives an old clunker and rents a tiny room from a gay male couple. However, she saves the life of a prominent Arab by taking a bullet in the butt that was intended for the official. She charms the national press with her crazy expressions and her sweet look. Trying out an opportunity, the Assistant to the President will be deployed in the US Government's Protocol Division. Even then she sometimes misses things, but she tries hard and learns a lot. It even arouses the romantic attention of a State Department official. But is there another sinister plan involving an Arab man who wants to take another woman? A blonde? LOL LOL LOL. In this movie, Goldie is as pretty as a picture and as stupid as a fox, they say. Sunny is learning her way through the jungles of the US government very, very well. She even has important things to say about honesty and the lack of protocols in her protocol environment. Perhaps the Arab community would be less enthusiastic about this work, but for those who like to laugh, rent it today.
