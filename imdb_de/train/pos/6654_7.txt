The film took a new look at Gandhi's life, which is nice to see and shows how human he was. His relationship with Harilal was something that disturbed Gandhi, and mentioned it several times as his failure as a father in his autobiography. <br /> <br /> My big criticism is that I thought Gandhi was surprisingly uncharismatic in the movie. It could have been better played by the person Gandhi played. Some of Gandhi's statements seemed too complacent, and it seemed that in some parts of the film he was deliberately portrayed in a negative light. <br /> <br /> The film is not really versatile, but focuses only on the movie relationship between father and son. The rest is out of focus and is only used to display the timeframe and general setting of the movie. <br /> <br /> All in all nice film, considering it's not a complete picture.
