A Scream in the Dark <br /> <br /> A Scream in the Dark was a movie that I expected would feature a phenomenal performance by Meryl Streep and a solid, if inconspicuous, film. This assumption came from the fact that the movie received little attention next to Streep's best actress nomination. <br /> <br /> Little did I expect A CRY IN THE DARK to be such a fascinating drama - Designed on every level. If you ask me, this is an undervalued classic. <br /> <br /> The movie starts rather slowly, so that the audience can come to the Chamberlain at a relaxed pace and really realizes that this is essentially a movie, incredibly loving, simple family. Fred Schepisi (the director) selects random moments to capture a family on vacation that will convey a looming sense of impending tragedy, as well as attentive bliss, with Lindy (Streep) and Michael (Sam Neill) Chamberlain for their children to care. <br /> <br /> While the famous line "A Dingo took my baby!" Nowadays, this film has become a kind of punchline, the film is never nearly ridiculous. The actual death of Azaria is shockingly recorded. It is subtle and realistic, leaving the audience appalled and asking questions. <br /> <br /> The majority of the film takes place in courtrooms and focuses on the continuing struggle of the Chamberlain to prove her innocence to the press and the court suspecting Lindy of the murder. <br /> <br /> The fact that we know from the beginning that they are innocent makes the tense exams all the more exciting. As a spectator, I was fully invested in the situation Chamberlains ... and was truly angry, hurt and sad when they had to look so terrible from the media. At the same time, the media / public opinion is understandable. I thought it was great that the media was by no means sympathetic, but they always had good reasons to defend their views. The last line of the film is very profound and perfectly sums up the central element. This film is very different from other legal dramas. <br /> <br /> In terms of performances, the only ones who really matter in this movie are the ones by Streep and Neill ... and they deliver in every way. For me, this is one of Meryl Streep's best achievements. Despite her mastery of the various accents (which of course are very impressive) Streep never loses the central heart and soul of her characters. I find that this is a rather subtle performance by Streep, and she beats it outside the park. And Neill, an actor who has never impressed me, in addition to being charismatic and engaging in JURASSIC PARK, is a perfect counterpoint to Streep's performance. After all, what I've seen is undoubtedly Neill's best job so far. It's a shame that he was not recognized by the academy as having a lead actor nomination that matches Streep ... especially when the two play brilliantly together. <br /> <br /> More emotional than most films, and also incredibly exciting ... A scream in the dark far exceeded my expectations. I recommend to all who only know the movie as the movie in which Meryl "The dingo has my baby!" Watch the movie and see how much more A CRY IN THE DARK is then the one line. <br /> <br /> ... A ...
