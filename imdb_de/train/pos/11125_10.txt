What can you say about a show of this magnitude? "The Sopranos" has literally redefined television as we know it. It violated all rules and set new standards for television quality. Everything is flawless, writing, governing and, above all, acting. If you watch this show, you will find that these characters are NOT real. Acting makes you think that there is a real Tony Soprano or another character. This show is also very versatile. Some people do not look at the show because it's violent, it's not just about violence, it's about business, about family, and about a lot of deeper things, all depending on what you see as a fan. I do not like people referring to the show, a show about the mafia. For me it's a show about the family. A family that has separated itself from the crowd for generations. Overall, this is a masterpiece of a show. That's how television should be. Exactly here. Complex characters of breathtaking acting, great storylines of brilliant writing. What do you get when you mix these ingredients together? A show that defines excellence and dares to be different.
