I first saw "Breaking Glass" in 1980 and thought that it would be one of the "Movie Classics". This film offers great insight into the music industry with a large cast of performers. This is a movie that should be in the collection of everyone and everyone who wants to get into the music industry. I can not wait for it to be available on DVD.
