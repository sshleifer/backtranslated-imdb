With breathtaking cinematography and a touch of Kafkaesque absurdity, this film has shown me from the simple but intriguing opening scene. The movie is a dream, and I think that's probably why people either hate or love it. Characters are superficially drawn and the story itself is low and maybe a bit pointless. However, these are shortcomings of the film, but deliberate choices. The film works do not try to work as history, but are a deconstruction of the war films of the 1940s. <br /> <br /> I would have difficulty arguing that the movie had a lot of real substance, but the movie is such a cinematic miracle that I was completely swept away. This is one of the most beautifully filmed films of all time, and there is a wild fantasy in his style. I can fully understand why people would hate it, but I give it 9/10.
