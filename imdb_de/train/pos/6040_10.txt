I'm just not tired of seeing FREEBIRD. My husband was extra, so I was there from the start. I got in touch with Jon and helped put the movie in both the cinemas and the DVD release. Even so far, to distribute advertising postcards on cross-channel ferries and in different locations throughout France. FREEBIRD was expertly written and directed with the perfect combination of fun and serious moments as well as selection casting. Only Phil Daniels could fit in the role of Grouch. It was a great privilege to meet Jon and the cast at the party after the premiere in January. Anything else you want to do, just ask, either by email or phone. They know how to reach me. Sue xx
