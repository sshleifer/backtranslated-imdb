It's no wonder that this film has won 4 awards, it's a movie that tilts to every soul, it's no wonder why Paul Reiser took 20 years to finally surrender and agree with Peter Falk about his idea speak. I can understand every part of it, this is a movie that will only make you cry to tears or thousands. <br /> <br /> Story: 10/10 When Sam Kleinman receives a letter from his wife that she has left him to find something else, his son and he take a trip to find them, and while They do that, they find something lost, friendship, family and affection for each other. In the beginning, you know what's going to happen, but the story is not so easy to understand from beginning to end; it's a ride between a father and his son, husband, and wife. It's no wonder that Paul Reiser took 20 years to write this beautiful romance / comedy. <br /> <br /> Actors: 10/10 Well, you can not say anything but what I want to say, hey, this is Peter Falk. He's a legend in that. Everything he does in movies is magical. If you use Peter Falk in a romance / comedy, what do you think you get? A perfect result, it is no wonder that this film is so perfect and has won so many awards. Since the son Paul Reiser does an excellent job, even though he is not a great actor, it does not mean that this did not work. Peter Falk and Paul Reiser play the perfect father and son, the rest of the cast is good enough, but you do not see them that often, just say they do what they should to make this shine even more. <br /> <br /> Music: 10/10 It does not always work when music is used. Sometimes it just does not fit, but that's not the thing in this movie. The music matches perfectly, it makes the movie even more convincing. This part of the movie will look as good as the other parts, a great soundtrack for romance / comedy music. That's for sure. <br /> <br /> Overall: 10/10 There are so many romance / comedy movies tapes, DVDs, Blu-ray and whatnot, but this movie is one of the most special. It's not commonplace to be able to create a story like this, it takes years to think about it, and in fact, it's what it takes to make it, a great piece to buy and store in the human soul When you grow old and see it with your father in old age, I think, then this movie will spark like no other.
