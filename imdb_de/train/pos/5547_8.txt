Strangler of the Swamp was produced by low-budget studio PRC and is certainly one of her best films I've ever seen. A man hanged for a murder for which he had no horror returns as a ghost revenge on the people who accused him. He uses a rope to strangle his victims, and after several deaths, including the old man leading the ferry across the swamp, he disappears. The granddaughter of the old man takes the ferry himself and falls in love with one of the local men who decide to marry. <br /> <br /> This movie has a lot of foggy atmospheres, which makes it scary. <br /> <br /> The cast includes Rosemary La Planche, Blake Edwards and Charles Middleton (Flash Gordon) as Strangler. <br /> <br /> Strangler of the Swamp is a must for old horror fans like me. Excellent. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3 and a half star of 5.
