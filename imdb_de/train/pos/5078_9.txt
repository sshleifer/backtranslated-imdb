This one was characterized by originality. I am really tired of seeing Hindi films that are a hotchpotch of a whole range of Hollywood and Brit films. Some shortcomings were inevitable, yet this film is a must. Surya's portrayal of the clean, conscientious policeman (as opposed to the big-bellied, money-hungry ones we normally see) was great. He has come a long way from his work in Nerukku Ner. I liked the movie so much that I had to own it. Usually I do not deal with the mindless violence of movies, somehow I somehow feel for every character and therefore can not bring myself to call it "mindless" violence. I do not appreciate the excessive melodrama and sentimental scenes associated with most Hindi and Tamil films. I absolutely loved this movie because it is not. The reaction of ACP Anbuselvan to the loss of his wife is not exaggerated, makes palpitations and makes me roar my eyes. There are certain times when I watch a movie when I want to press the FF button. I often wanted to do that in a movie theater. I never wanted that when I saw this movie. I really hope that Ghajini will be released soon.
