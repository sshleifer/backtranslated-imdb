Bad cast, terrible script full of holes, hot blonde gets eaten alive. The evil scientist has a serious-looking mustache, a man takes on a platoon of trained marksmen and comes out victorious, awesome special effects from the monster ... awesome. The only thing missing was an unnecessary graphic sex scene during one of the murders. Haha. Good fun with predictable twists and ridiculous deposits. I enjoyed this movie very much, but before you look at it you should be sure that you will have a good laugh. I recommend this movie to people who can watch a movie and do not take it so seriously. I can not be clear that this movie was made for people to take it seriously. However, if you watch the movie, sit back and just enjoy, I think you can enjoy this movie the way it should be enjoyed. Very easy So get some popcorn and a few beers and have a fun night out with friends and this movie. It brought some joy into my life.
