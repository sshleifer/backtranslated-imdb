Just before the introduction of a moral code obscured the ghosts of writers, directors and actors, the first adaptation of W. Somerset Maugham's "Of Human Bondage" aroused countless moviegoers. It has no shock today, just good acting. <br /> <br /> Although the cast is outstanding, this is Bette Davis first major role and one of Leslie Howard's finest. Howard is the English would-be Parisian artist Philip Carey, who is gently and firmly said to lack any talent and that his dedication is not genius. After taking the lesson to heart, he returns to London and enrolls in a medical college (one that does not seem to have any female students - there would have been at least a few at the time.) Maybe not the author / Doctor Maugham.) Care for distaff medicos). <br /> <br /> Drinking a Day Carey is thrilled by a waitress, Mildred Rogers, Bette Davis in a role as a morally easy-going and basically evil Farrago. Her cockney accent is as sharp as that of Eliza Doolittle. His repeated attempts to date her are greeted with the less enthusiastic response, "I do not mind," a sure sign of any man whose head is just screwed down, that he is exploring the depths. Maugham's Mildred supplemented her waitresses tips with some old-fashioned street walking, something that was not clearly highlighted here. Carey's obsessed prostration meets Rogers' stingy need for financial support. He is desperately in love with her - she plays him as organist of the Sunday Church and effortlessly puts on her instrument. No sex here. He realizes he has nowhere to go and begins a chaste relationship with Norah, a woman who loves him. Enter Mildred again, crammed with a baby and in her usual need to be cared for. Abandoned Norah with a broken heart. <br /> <br /> Another separation from Mildred and Carey begins a longstanding friendship with Sally, who is enthusiastically welcomed by her father, who regards the later marriage as a good thing for the two young people and an opportunity for relief from one of his nine offspring. <br /> <br /> The film follows rationally, but not completely, the outstanding novel by Maugham. Howard Carey is naive and vulnerable, and for the most part of the movie, his sad eyes are reminiscent of a deer facing a double-headed gun. Mildred is unrestrainedly angry, a worst-case user. Her only preoccupation with her own needs is barely concealed as she tries to honor Carey with a thin patina of loving words (and at one point suggests that she "will do anything"). he wants "a bold statement for the time and one I'm sure the audience is fully understood. <br /> <br /> Pre-code may be, but Mildred's quick march solution would have the League of Catholic The end is conventional sin, loses basic behavior. <br /> <br /> The director John Cromwell performed excellently by his two main stars, one of whom was firmly established and the other was largely determined by this film London and the journey back in time is worth it. <br /> <br /> Available on DVD. <br /> <br /> 9/10 (for Davis and Howard's performances)
