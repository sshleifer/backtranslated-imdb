For me, this is the most perfect movie of Ealing Studio - so fresh and relevant half a century later, the day it was released. <br /> <br /> It could hardly be more up to date as a satire about the economic notion of 'growth' and the commercial needs of in-built obsolescence. And from which other movie can one say that the hero literally wears the plot? <br /> <br /> Strangely enough, there are parallels to Jurassic Park, where the interaction with the environment literally turns and bites you. But Spielberg shied away from the brilliant central attitude of the book to tackle some nonsense about 'kids'. Hmmm. <br /> <br /> In The Man In The White Suit, Alec Guiness plays an idealistic junior scientist who wears a cloth that never gets dirty and never wears out. Suddenly, workers and capital in the Nordic English mill where he works are united as never before to save their livelihood. <br /> <br /> It's obviously a comedy to be Ealing, but that was not the case. The complex interplay of undeserved interests (should that fit?) Plays a beautiful role as all parties, one after another, recognize that "progress" is a threat, and that availability and waste spur the looms. But, yes, this is a comedy - albeit a bit of a spice - and in the midst of political irony are delicious performances and a few good, old-fashioned laughs. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, it is the snappy satire that lasts - dazzling and white.
