What does the Marquis de Sade have to do with Egyptian archeology and iconic mermaids? Tobe Hooper tries to answer that question in a funny little movie. Genie is a young cutie who visits her nerdy archeology father in Alexandria, Egypt. Genie gets a mysterious hooker (and a blatant lesbian), who also provides a service in addition to her dad. Dad is sent back to the site where he discovers a grave with a mermaid. Genie meets a descendant of the Marquis de Sade and falls in love with a handsome Egyptian (who delivers the hottest scenes in the film). Eventually, Genie finds out she has to be a victim and begins the lengthy and bloody climax. Wrapped around this story are footage of the Marquis de Sade in jail, who speak with a portrait of genius. <br /> <br /> Robert Englund is terrific both as a marquis and as a descendant. His acting skills have always been wiped off his make-up needs, so he can shine here. His best performance is still in "Killer Tongue", if you have not seen it yet. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast, including the young genius, is pretty and average. The script is problematic though. You'll quickly realize that the Marquis scenes are completely redundant, unless the filmmakers may have had access to the cool set. The mermaid cult that ultimately saves genius makes no sense at all. Whoever is the mermaid is never explained, and her connection to Christianity (which is hyped throughout the movie) is nothing. The film is very anti-Christian, because the archaeologist is a father who spits out of the Bible, but he likes to be tied up by the local prostitute. There are many scenes of depravity and violence, but Hooper probably had no idea what the scriptwriters were trying to say. I know that I have no idea. <br /> <br /> Why do I recommend this movie? It is strange. There is an extended sex scene. For the ladies, the handsome Egyptian rides a completely naked horse. Englund is wonderful. Do you like snakes? This movie is full of it. It's like Roger Corman on a bigger budget. Knowing that Hooper somehow found "Crocodile" is pretty sad. "Night Terror" is not perfect, but definitely worth a winking, dubious look. <br /> <br /> This is (R) for physical violence, some sexual violence, gore, obscenity, female nudity, male nudity, sexual content, sexual cues and substance abuse. <br /> <br />
