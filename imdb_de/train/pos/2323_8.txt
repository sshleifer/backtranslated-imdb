"The Man in the Moon" is a pretty good movie. It is sometimes very touching and very well done in every way. I would not say that the movie was terribly original, but what is it today? <br /> <br /> The actors have done a great job with their respective roles. I really enjoyed seeing Reese Witherspoon at such a young age, and I did a pretty good job. Jason London is also doing a good job. And the only other person I recognized was Sam Waterston, who did a fantastic job with his role. I really liked Sam's character (Matthew Trant). Sometimes he seems to be the kind of father you're afraid of, but in the end, you really like his character. The rest of the cast was also very good. <br /> <br /> If you want to touch films that grow up with life and handle what life brings you, then you should watch this movie. I would suggest reading the plot summary, and if that looks like something that you're interested in, then do it. Anyway, I hope you enjoy the movie, thanks for reading, <br /> <br /> -Chris
