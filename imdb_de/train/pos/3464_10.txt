* WARNING * Spoiler Ahead ... The authors of this story knew these men very well. The actors have also portrayed them very well. As a result, at the end of the movie you feel like you're actually looking at John Lennon and Paul McCartney. The expected tensions are present especially in the unpleasant first moments. As the two begin to relax, the old comradeship that made The Beatles work so well shows. The bitterness is still there and interrupts at times, but when John gets the idea to convince Lorne Michaels of his offer to pay the Beatles the gag sum of $ 3,000 for "Saturday Night Live," the two could be the same boyish jokes that terrorized Liverpool as a teenager and survived playing in the harsh nightclubs of Hamburg to rise to superstardom. But in the end, this wonderful fantasy gently leaves us. We are reminded why a Beatles reunion was most likely never possible, even before Lennon's murder: the two driving forces of the group were superior to each other.
