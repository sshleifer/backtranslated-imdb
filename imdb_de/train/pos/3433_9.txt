I saw this for the first time at a foreign film festival. It is a beautiful Nagelbei√üer about a plot that relieves the Estonian treasury of one billion gold. It's all in a coarse, grainy style that Hollywood rarely uses - but it captures the atmosphere of the newly emancipated Baltic states wonderfully (note: Tallin actually looked a lot less bleak in 2003 than I was there). <Br /> <br /> There is also a lot of humor and some romance. I do not want to spoil some startling, but logical surprises. I'm just saying that this Heist movie is based on a great script, and the direction and performance are first rate. DARKNESS IN TALLIN is simply the fastest and most nerve-wracking example of his genre. I would put it against RAFIFI and TOPKAPI, and it is miles ahead of the new OCEAN'S 11, albeit (deliberately) not so shiny. RENT OR BUY NOW.
