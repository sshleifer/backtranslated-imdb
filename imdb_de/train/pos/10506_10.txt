Rated E <br /> <br /> I have never had a Nintendo 64, but I have played many times. In my opinion, Super Mario 64 together with Conkers Bad Fur Day is one of the best video games for the Nintendo 64 system. I've played this game many times and it's always good. If you have an N64 and do not have this game, you should try to find it. The original Super Mario Bros games were side-scrolling video games, but Super Mario 64 has a 3D Mario in a beautiful 3D environment. The game is kind of funny, but there are many things you can do in the game. You play as Super Mario and again you have to save Princess and the 120 power stars in front of Bowzer can do it in a 3D environment. Super Mario 64 is a very fun and good N64 game and I recommend it. <br /> <br /> 10/10
