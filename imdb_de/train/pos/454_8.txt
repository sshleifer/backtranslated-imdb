Two women decide to pool their resources in response to a month's notice for renting a villa in Italy. For financial reasons, two more women join. Two have modest marital lives; one is an older woman who prefers to live in the past; The fourth is a wealthy and beautiful woman who is completely destroyed by life. <br /> <br /> As the spell of the Villa permeates its spirits, each grows in its own way and is raised in its attitudes. This also changes the people in their lives who visited them. When you go, you know that the magic of the villa will stay with you ... and you will find that your attitude is changed for the better. A wonderfully uplifting movie!
