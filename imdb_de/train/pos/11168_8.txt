"The Bowery" was painted in New York in 1890 by the successes of Chuck Connors and Steve Brodie and is energetic and good-natured and little Jackie Cooper. The very first shot could be amazing. This applies to the time and the time when it was set. And it also speaks for the diversity of the population in this forest. This certainly adds to the pungent taste of the atmosphere. <br /> <br /> Beery as Connors is the flashing thunder in the center of the action, a loud mouth guard with its own fire department. And he has a thing for the crazy orphan Cooper. Raft as Brodie is Connors' slimmer, better-looking rival in almost every venture. Brodie could never refuse courage and loved the attention, resulting in a jump off the Brooklyn Bridge (it's still debated whether he actually jumped or used a dummy). Beery is as bombastic as ever an Irish-American accent. He is just the rugged kind of character to draw children, cats and ladies in distress. This is possibly the most exuberant figure Raft has ever played, and he can even throw in a little dancing (as well as a show of the leg). And again he confuses the main actress (beautiful Fay Wray) with a prostitute. Cooper is as tough as both, though he has a chance to cry. <br /> <br /> The highlight is not the jump from the bridge, but a tight fist fight between Connors and Brodie in close-up looks like a real brawl between the clients. It is certain that someone has hurt more than one ego.
