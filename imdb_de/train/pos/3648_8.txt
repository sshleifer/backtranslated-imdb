"Pandora's Clock" is a gripping suspense / thriller that represents a cross between a virus movie and a catastrophe movie. The film, which aired in two parts on NBC in 1996, is about an airplane flight that infects a virus when one of the passengers accidentally carries the disease. The US government is debating whether the plane should be destroyed or not, while the pilot (Richard Dean Anderson) and a virus expert (Daphne Zuniga) are trying to figure something out to avoid a catastrophe. I'm not a big fan of TV movies and mini-series, but I liked "Pandora's Clock". It's a damn exciting ride. Jane Leeves (TV "Frasier"), Robert Loggia and Edward Herrmann (as president) are also stars. <br /> <br /> *** (out of four)
