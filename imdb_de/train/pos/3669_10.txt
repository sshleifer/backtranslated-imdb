This film shows the absurd essence of a presumptuous American patriot actor - one who believes that his work (and politics) are as important to the American people as the President himself. Alan Bates captures this attitude perfectly as Michael Baytes and I will remember Bates as this character. This is a movie for Canadians and Americans. It is a valuable piece of cinema that is able to take its audience through the magic of filmmaking and to show how easy it is for the producer and the director to lose complete control through the will of the actors and countless external forces. Wonderfully, "Hollywood North" does not suffer from the theme it represents: Peter O'Brian controls with precision and complete control and masters both the serious "behind the scenes" section of the movie and the movie inside. The film "Flight to Bogota" with clarity and insight. If you're interested in the jokes and power of Canadian cinema, Hollywood North is a great place to start.
