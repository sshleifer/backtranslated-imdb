I was fortunate enough to get a DVD copy of this movie recently and have now seen it for the second time. The first time was in late-night television in Australia more than 20 years ago, but I could never forget this strange and dark movie. <br /> <br /> Not many people like this movie because it is so unconventional - the fact that there are hardly any spoken dialogues on this train - we only hear the thoughts of the characters - is just an unconventional aspect. <br /> <br /> When looking for a copy of this movie, I found out that the producer was dead, the lead actor was dead, it was not kept in any British television or film archive, it never was on video or DVD released that television stations ruined it all over the world after their copyright expired in the 1980s. When it first appeared on television in Australia, there were no writable devices for consumers. <br /> <br /> The second time I could see why it was unforgettable. Sometimes it is very tense and unbearably claustrophobic, like a Harold Pinter stage play. <br /> <br /> If someone wants to have a DVD copy of it, please email me and I'm sure we can do something (whiteflokati@hotmail.com)
