Moonwalker by Michael Jackson is a real adventure movie for the whole family! <br /> <br /> Before the actual story of the movie begins, we get a performance of the Bad Tour (Man In The Mirror) and it starts on a great movie. Then we get a kind of collage by Michael Carrier, as it was up to Moonwalker in 1988. After a few music videos (Speed ​​Demon, Leave Me Alone, etc.) the story begins. <br /> <br The essence of the plot is that Michael and his three friends (the children are being chased by the villain of the story "Mr. Big" because they discovered his evil plans to drug children around the world put. During the hunt we see fantastic segments, eg. Michael's video for Smooth Criminal is absolutely fantastic with its dance sequences, etc. But then one of Mr. Big's kids is kidnapped and Michael wants to rescue her before she becomes drug addicted. <br /> <br During the film we see special effects that are not only amazing for the then standard, but are also impressive today. For example, you see Michael coming to a robot / spaceship to protect his friends! It's so cool! <br /> <br /> The film ends with a performance of Come Together (later released in Michael's double album by HIStory), and you leave the film with a magical feeling. Amazing! <br /> <br /> I recommend it to any family who wants to spend a nice night watching TV together with candy and popcorn. And now some parents might get up and say, "But Michael Jackson is a presumptive molester!" Yes, he is indeed, but we all know it's not true! Let's wait for it ..
