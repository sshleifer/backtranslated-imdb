A wonderful movie version of the bestselling book and Broadway play about the lives of Sadie and Bessie Delany, two African-American sisters, both over 100 years old, who tell their story about a century of American history. Ruby Dee and Diahann Carroll perform very well as Bessie and Sadie respectively. Amy Madigan is also good as Amy Hill Hearth, the white reporter for The New York Times, whose article on the sisters launched the book as in the book. This is the only real drawback, combined with the fact that certain aspects of the story are not clearly illustrated, such as the inter-sisters background of the mother of the sisters and the reason why her father was so strict. But otherwise a very well made, well played, powerful movie.
