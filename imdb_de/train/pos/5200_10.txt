Rudy does it again with this hot road from the road to Dolemite. This entry is filled with the required Rudy Ray Moore fight, humor and martial arts. Rudy escapes a crazy red-necked sheriff in this movie who also features a notorious scene in which Rudy descends a steep hill. See it for laughter and for a stroke of blaxploitation magic.
