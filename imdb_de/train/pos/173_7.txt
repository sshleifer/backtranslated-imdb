Goldie Hawn actually comes from Washington (Takoma Park, Maryland), but I digress. This is a sort of Mr Smith who films Washington, with a few variations but the same premise. I recorded this movie years ago by Cable because I was very much in love with Goldie Hawn. The story is interesting, but it is highly unlikely that a cocktail waitress will get an important job in the government simply because she saved the life of Big Shot. It made me laugh and made me angry at the same time. It made me laugh because some of the situations she was in were so ridiculous that I had to laugh. (POSSIBLE SPOILER FORWARD). It made me crazy to believe that our government would set up an average citizen the way it was established. And the speech she gave in the end ... beautiful. Too bad that not many people in real life have such courage.
