I have just seen these early bugs Bunny (first mentioned here) and the Elmer Fudd cartoon on the ThadBlog as linked from YouTube. This was the first time that Chuck Jones ran the Wascally Wabbit, so Bugs has a different voice from Mel Blanc than Brooklyn / Bronx, whom we know better. According to Thad, he channeled Jimmy Stewart (his "shy boy" personality of the time). In any case, after Elmer has bought his pet, Bugs is totally rude to him, making the radio really loud and pretending to die after his master repeatedly threw him out of his shower and saying, "Those lights turn off!" Whenever Elmer gets him in his bed. Despite the other voice, Bugs is definitely his mischievous self and I laughed blue all the time! According to Thad, there was an extra scene at the end of Elmer as he handed bugs to the bugs after the hell he went through. However, this was probably considered too sad, as he suffers a nervous breakdown at this point is lost. Anyway, I recommend Elmer's Pet Rabbit.
