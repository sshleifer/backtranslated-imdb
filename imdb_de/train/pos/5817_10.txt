If you want to remember MJ, this is a good start. This movie features sweet tunes, MJ as a robot and a crazy, nasty action. I remember so many nights when I fainted in college about this fine feature film and thought about the pure Awesomenes of those who have decided to give this ridiculous piece the go-ahead. Dancing a lot. There is a lot of singing while dancing. MJ kills it the way you would expect. But there is much more to this film. There is clay formation. There are fat children (clay). There is an anthropomorphic rabbit that Michael Jackson has to fight against (apparently also clay). There is also Joe Pesci (not made of clay). <br /> <br /> RIP- we love you, Michael! It is a sad day for all of us.
