The simple handheld camera gives this film an almost documentary feel and also refers to the dogma films. <br /> <br /> Have you ever got bored by these Hollywood policeman flicks with muscular guys who received orders? would be jealous? Are you fed up with the married single policeman, divorced family member, donut personified and hard hunter? Have you ever wondered what the real police work is? <br /> <br /> Well, for Germany this movie shows you. In the north between West Germany and East Germany, the former GDR, a dismissed post office employee starts her job, fresh from the police. She quickly finds her way around the usual customers and gets used to life as a policewoman ... but that's no fun. <br /> <br /> Other German crime thrillers like Derrick, The Old One and others have quietly talked to officers with dignity. These bulls have to deal with the lowest on the social ladder. Good dialogue and realism make this an interesting point of view, even if you know this part of Germany a bit.
