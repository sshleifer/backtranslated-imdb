The day of the big studio system, the best casting decisions were made. Old American James Stewart appeared as a Hungarian in The Shop Around the Corner. Had I cast the film, Kralik's role would have been perfect for Charles Boyer. His accent mixed with all other European accents would have been nothing. Stewart also had the same problem in Mortal Storm with Margaret Sullavan. <br /> <br /> Margaret Sullavan was his most common actress on the screen. He has made four films with her. But only here none of them dies. Sullavan and her husband Leland Heyward knew Stewart back when he was struggling in New York. In fact, Sullavan's husband was Stewart's good friend Henry Fonda. <br /> <br /> I think only Clark Gable could assert himself as an American in a cast of non-Americans in Mutiny on the Bounty. Stewart in The Mortal Storm was German, but all other players were Americans too, so nothing noticed. <br /> <br /> But if you can accept Stewart, watch a good movie by Ernest Lubitsch. The plot is pretty simple, a man and a woman working in a department store in Budapest do not get along in person. However, it seems they are in correspondence with some anonymous admirers who turn out to be one another. Employer Frank Morgan also wrongly suspects Stewart of having kanoodling with his wife. <br /> <br /> Although the leads are good and Frank Morgan deviates from his usual confused self, the two best players are Felix Bressart and Joseph Schildkraut. Bressart has my favorite moments in the movie when he takes off after Morgan starts asking people for opinions. He makes himself very rare. <br /> <br /> And Joseph Schildkraut, who is always good, is just great, as the crazy little worm, who is constantly kissing with Frank Morgan. They really hate such people, I know too many like thyme that are in the office 24 hours a day. Too bad that it pays off a lot.
