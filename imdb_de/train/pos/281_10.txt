This game was really great and quite a challenge. It has a great, scary story and the graphics are very good as well. I would recommend this game to all horror fans and is very gripping from start to finish. The only problem with this game is that I would have wished for more weapons, but that's just me. <br /> <br /> A really great game for RPG and shoot'em'up fans
