I was about 12 years old when I saw this classic "Casper the Friendly Ghost" cartoon. I thought it was an early one, as Casper did not * really * look like Porky Pig * did * in the old cartoons of the 1930s. But I digress ... <br /> <br /> Anyway, this episode on the Beyond the Phantom Friendship is about making friends with a young Fox Todd, whom he calls Ferdie. I remember being happy to see a friend of Casper, as those who watched the cartoons know that most people run away from him and "A Ghost!" Screaming together until someone else shows up ... I hate to leave you with a semi-spoiler, but the cartoon is only seven minutes long, so you can not really be too ambiguous. Anyone who reads the cartoon's IMDb summary can also deduce what's going to happen next ... <br /> <br /> The finale is a bit heart-wrenching. In fact, it's probably the saddest thing I've ever seen drawing a cartoon. That just means that it moved me, which probably explains why I decided to write a comment on this particular cartoon and not many others. Or damn it, the fact that I remember the cartoon at all is due to its emotional impact on me - I have not seen it since. But the cartoon ends on a positive note, and I was happy to see Casper and Ferdie happy again. <br /> <br /> I would give this cartoon 8 out of 10 stars. In second place after the Warner Bros. cartoon "Peace on Earth," this is what has ever moved me from an animated short film.
