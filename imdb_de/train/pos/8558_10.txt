I'm always excited about Drew Barrymore's great acting and her great performance in this movie, in which she plays a very complicated young woman (Holly Gooding), "Skipped Parts" (2000), who leaves New York and travels to California and An apartment shares with an aspiring writer, George Newbern ("Patrick Farsmith"), "Far Harbor", '96. Many strange things happen to Holly and she is looking for her brother in a psychiatric hospital after he has killed her father. If you look closely, you will actually see the mother of Drew Barrymore as her mother in this picture. If it were not for the good acting of Drew Barrymore and George Newbern, this movie should only be seen on Halloween night! It certainly has surprises in the END !!
