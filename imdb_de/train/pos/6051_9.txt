This is a great British movie. A cleverly observed script with many lines that can be cited perfectly captures what magic mushrooms can do to a man on a weekend. As usual, Phil Daniels is excellent, along with the most rated among British actors Geoff Bell. Peter Bowles with a mouth-hung joint is a casting masterpiece, and Gary Stretch, with his brooding looks, gives the piece a strangely atmospheric feel. Although it seems to be charged as a biker movie, I think it will find an audience outside of it, purely on the premise that many people have been there and got the t-shirt. Also a great original soundtrack with a dazzling version of Freebird. This could really be a legacy of the famous 21st-century comedy of the 21st century. Like the weeds in the Welsh fields: it's a breeder!
