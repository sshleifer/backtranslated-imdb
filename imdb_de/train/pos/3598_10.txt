As a person who usually dislikes boxing and feels they are focused on boxing and not on the characters themselves, this movie really moved me. I loved seeing main character Diana (Michelle Rodriguez) walk through so many things in such a short time that it was amazing to me. Michelle (Rodriguez) did a wonderful job with Diana, especially since this was her first acting experience, she showed real emotion and wonderfully portrayed Diana. All actors had chemistry on screen and made this movie even more amazing. I also recommend this movie to those who do not normally watch boxing films. 10/10
