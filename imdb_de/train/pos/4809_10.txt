Is it really time for a new film about the British monarchy? Answer: YOU BET! The Young Victoria is another contribution to the British wave that has to do with the royal family. In this case, it is the early life of Princess Victoria and events that led to the crowning of her Queen of England, as well as her romance and later marriage with Prince Albert. The film also looks at the stormy lives and careers of England's Queen & Prince and various other events that happen (political unrest, etc.). Emily Blunt plays a radiant Victoria in her youth, while Rupert Friend is her beloved & best friend, Prince Albert. The rest of the cast is completed with Miranda Richardson, the Dutchman of Kent, and the ever-welcome Jim Broadbent as King William, as well as cast members of others who shine on screen. Jean Marc Vallee (C.R.A.Z.Y., Loser Love), director of a successful screenplay by Jullian Fellowes (Vanity Fair, Gosford Park, Separate Lies). I absolutely went beyond the visual look of the film (from cinematographer Hagen Bogdansker), who gave each film a quaint look (with the help of production designer Patrice Vermette) as well as a few rigorous arrangements (by Jill Bilcock) & Matt Garner). What I also appreciated in Fellowes' script is the use of a chess game as a metaphor for some of the film's political motives (the characters in the movie move like pieces on a chessboard). This is an intelligent, well written, directed, filmed, cut and presented entertainment program (and enlightenment) that will ensure a well spent evening in the cinema. Rated by the MPAA for a few scenes with sensuality as PG, for some brief violence (somewhat bloody, though nothing too bloody), a rude speech break and some smoking on the screen
