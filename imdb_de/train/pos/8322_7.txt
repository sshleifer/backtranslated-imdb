IQ is a cute romantic comedy featuring two great actors who seem to be clicking well on the screen. Plot is a typical guy who is wrong for girls, the guy gets a girl format, but makes the solid point that one must love with the heart and not with the mind. The addition of Albert Einstein and his gang genius provides an excellent comic relief. Overall, a good movie. Not great, but good
