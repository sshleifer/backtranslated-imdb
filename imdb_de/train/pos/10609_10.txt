I saw this movie on cable last night and it's extraordinary. What I love most about him is that it is unobtrusive and unobtrusive, but deeply heartfelt. The performance of Henry Thomas (he played the child in E.T.) is masterfully inarticulate (he is said to be a man in a few words). David Straithern is a wonderful crazy rogue. And miraculously (as we're talking about a Hollywood product here), a baby serves as the main character, but one who does not act or has lines, only IS (& is light). Interesting to note that Thomas's mysterious relationship w. E.T. was the core of this film; while his tie w. The baby serves as the core of "A Good Baby". <br /> <br /> Then there is the music - oh, what music !! The songs of Gillian Welch are wonderful and the whole score is beautiful mountain country music. <br /> <br /> This movie is wonderfully atmospheric. I highly recommend it.
