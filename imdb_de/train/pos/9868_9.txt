This is obviously aimed at the same market as Monsters Inc. and Shrek, but differs in their less cartoon-like feel (despite the intentionally carton properties of the main creatures). The story is not one that ended up with a tremendous moral in the face (it is more like dragging on the sleeves of a shirt), but just picks a story about relationships between different "animals." You know the result, but you can not help but move in. <br /> <br /> The characters themselves are far more than their voices (the benefit of lesser-known actors playing the voices) unlike most Disney movies. They are well rounded and completely strangely believable. The group dynamics are brilliantly presented and the character revelations and quirks are subtle and enjoyable. You will get involved with them much sooner than you would think. <br /> <br /> The animation is brilliant as you would expect and you will pray for the opportunity on the ice slide in the movie. They will fall in love with the characters, especially the comical relief of the prehistoric squirrel and his desperate attempts to bury his nuts. I wanted the compulsory goods, especially the sloth, only to be disappointed when I was disappointed the next day when I could find nothing else. <br /> <br /> Better than Monsters Inc or Shrek.
