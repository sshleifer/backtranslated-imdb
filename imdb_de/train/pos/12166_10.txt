A very strange and captivating film. It's about a very awkward and tight wounded man trying to control his life as a door-to-door fundraiser / seller. The director was able to capture a very disquieting tone that really served the story. Original and disturbing, but also a lot of humor in the pain that accompanies life. There is a sequence in a test facility that really stood out and made me laugh, which I do not do as often as I should. One of the most memorable movies I've seen in a long time. Did not leave me and I look forward to future efforts of Bronstein. All around fantastic achievements. The simple line "I really appreciate it." is now iconic for me.
