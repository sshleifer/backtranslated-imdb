Well, this movie is really difficult. To be honest, this movie does not contain much of an exciting story, and it does not let you know how it will end ... but I'll tell you something now ... never have I been so tense and jumped in my life on! This movie surely delivers the jumps and the thrill! To be honest, I almost saw it at midnight, so somehow I was a bit sleepy, maybe that explains why I was nervous ... or maybe because this movie delivers that aspect! It's basically about a couple losing their child in a tragic event. They move away and rent a cabin in the mountains. Everything looks peaceful and quiet until they have their first visitors (I think it's the main character's sister, and she brings her husband with her). At night, the husband hears noises ... checks it, and then things really start to go very wrong ... to make a long story ... at some point, they learn what has happened in this house in the last few years and decide that care must be taken. <br /> <br /> It's not a Hollywood blockbuster, nore has a huge budget, but do not be put off. It's scary, tense and very nervous! Try it out :)
