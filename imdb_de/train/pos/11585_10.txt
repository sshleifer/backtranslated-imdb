This film is full of delicious horror film treats: chained insane, pre-meditated murder, a crazy (vaguely lesbian) scientist with a still crazed father wearing a mask for his horrific disfigurement, poisoning, haunted castles, werewolves (male) and wife ), Adultery, slain lovers, Tibetan mystics, victims of an unnamed experiment, burial, mind control, walled bodies, car accident on a lonely road, electrocution, knights in armor - the lot, all with an incredibly horrible outcome and some of the worst Foley work that were ever made, crowned. <br /> <br /> The script is incomprehensible (even if it's called Spanish horror movie standards) and some edits are just bizarre. In a scene in which the fabulous, malignant scientist visits our heroine in her bedroom, she visits one of the poorly-named people: "That's fantastic, I do not understand it. Explain again how that is ...", scenes That mess up movie, there's a sudden handcut from the girl's thighs as she gets out of bed for no apparent reason, except for a cut in the "Mwahaha!" to obscure the bad scientist. All your werewolves are mine! Speech. I do not know why they went to the nuisance, because there are many other jolting jumps everywhere - even for the vile panning and scanning of the phrase I've seen. <br /> <br /> The director According to an interview with the star, most of the shoot was drunk and the movie looks like this. It's an incoherent mess. It became even more incoherent by including werewolf Rampage footage from another movie The Mark of the Wolf Man (made 4 years ago, with the same actor, but with a more aggressive role and with a different shirt and makeup - there.) a word in Spanish for "continuity"?) and more upholstery of another actor in the wolf male running around in the distance. <br /> <br /> The music is unbelievably bad and almost randomly varies from the full orchestral scary house music, bosannova, the longest piano and gong duet ever recorded. (If you think about it, it might not have been a duet, it could have been a solo, the piano part was so simple that it could pick out with one hand while the player was clapping the other with the other.) <Br /> < This is one of the most confusing trance states that has so far resulted in bad movies of the year. Have fun. <br /> <br /> Favorite Line: "Ilona! This madness and this perversity will turn against you!" How true. <br /> <br /> Favorite photo: The lover discovers his slain girlfriend and drops the candle as he presents a cartoon-style surprise. Rank amateur directing there.
