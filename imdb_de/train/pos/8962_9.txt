As a pagan, I have to say that this film has little or no magic significance. It's a funny witch movie and it's not supposed to teach us anything except that love is the strongest magic of all and should never use it in a controlling or vengeful way. This is a lesson everyone needs to learn, not just the Gentiles. <br /> <br /> After being said, this film is wonderfully written and executed lovingly by Kim Novak and the venerable Jimmy Stewart. Hermione Gingold delivers an outstanding performance as Bianca, Elsa Lanchester (with too many films apart from Jane Marbles of "Murder By Death"). She was wonderful, as Mrs. Novak's absent but capable neighbor Queenie upstairs. Also with Jack Lemmon (wonderful performance) and Jim Kovacs (brilliantly funny). <br /> <br /> "Witches can not cry, why can not they shed a tear because their hearts are full of magick, they have no time for stupid things like love." Queenie. <br /> <br /> Gillian Holroyd (Novak) and her brother Nicky (Jack Lemmon) are Manhattan witches. Deep in the secret underworld of those wrapped in the craft, they live as one of them among the other New Yorkers, without causing a raised eyebrow. <br /> <br /> But then comes Shepherd "Shep" Henderson (Stewart), a steadfast, uncomplicated, dedicated businessman who is engaged to be married to Gillian's old college rival. <br /> <br /> By a strange coincidence, he moves into Gillian's building and is immediately "enchanted" by her charm and grace. By using Magick, with some help from Pyewacket (Gillian's intimate, trained by Robert E. Blair) and Queenie, Gillian begins to work on this beautiful new dream man to get at his old enemy. <br /> <br But Magick should never be used to control or hurt, and Gillian learns that the hard way is done in the bittersweet way. Not only does she have to face up to what she has done, she also has to put Shep to blame. <br /> <br /> From the critical perspective; However, the film makes a serious turn: the effects are very old-fashioned up to the pure camp. Part of the scenery was apparently filmed in the basement of someone in a small home, but at least the characters were quirky and funny. <br /> <br /> On a personal note Pyewacket steals the show. Great cat! Great training by Robert E. Blair. <br /> <br /> As a comment from Trivia, these are the roots of the popular enchanted television series. This is the original by Samantha and Darrin. All notes of the note are present and considered. You just have to look around to see it for yourself. <br /> <br /> This is one of my favorites and I often look at it. <br /> <br /> This movie gets a 9.1 / 10 from. .. <br /> <br /> the Fiend.
