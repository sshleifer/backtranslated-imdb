I have to say, I loved Vanishing Point. I saw the original, and that's a pretty good remake. Although it did not follow the original plot (that's why I gave it 8 out of 10 points), it was still pretty good and this is probably a better plot. <br /> <br /> As for the car, well, DJ's comment at the end that the Challenger would get into the bulldozers at 185 mph is pretty unlikely (and if you see, the speedometer wobbled at 145) -150), but even though I have not seen any on the engine in any of the engines. In the beginning scenes in which the engine is shown, the original action had a charged Hemi, so it's possible. For those of you who claim that aerodynamics will not allow it, today's normally aspirated Chrysler 300C can reach up to 200 km / h. If you look at this thing, you'll ride it on a freeway MPH And if you put the Challenger in a wind tunnel test, it would probably be more aerodynamic.
