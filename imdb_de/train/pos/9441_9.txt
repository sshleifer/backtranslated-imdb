The makers of this good movie have done a great job of engaging you with the characters as they suffered from this terrible ordeal. The terrible scene in the woods was so outstanding that you forgot that these men were just actors playing roles I've never dived into a movie like this before. Burt Reynolds and Jon Voight have never been better on screen, as well as Ned Beatty, Ronny Cox and Bill McKinney, and although he appeared only briefly, James Dickey appeared. the man who wrote the book on which the movie is based, as sheriff of Aintry. It is a bit disturbing and of course children should be shielded from it, but this is a great, dramatic cinema.
