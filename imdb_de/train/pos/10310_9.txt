In the lead: Jim Carrey, Morgan Freeman, Jennifer Anniston I was really skeptical about the first movie. I mean, what a conceptual NIGHTMARE. Jim Carrey plays God? Nothing is holy anymore. <br /> <br /> Well, this movie is hardly holy, but it's not sacrilegious either, at least not so much. Yes, Jim Carrey has the power of God for a while, but he is not God. Confused? I give you the deep butt. <br /> <br /> Jim Carrey plays Bruce Nolan, a reporter who does not have his luck and feels very unsuccessful in his life. He lives with his beautiful girlfriend Grace (Anniston), and you can tell right away they love each other, but the relationship is rather shaky. <br /> <br /> Then Bruce gets a shot at Anchorman just to have it defeated by Evan Baxter. Obviously not pleased, Bruce shares his thoughts with the world through the TV in a way that is weird and definitely deserves to get him fired. Much later, God will complain about God and later get a page. After a while, he gets tired of the call, so he answers and goes to the Omni Presents building (heh). There he meets God (Freeman), who is chief, electrician and janitor of the building. I found that very amusing. God is the boss, the Holy Spirit is the electrician and Jesus Christ is the janitor. Think about it. Boss, obviously. Electrician, the guy who keeps everything running. Caretaker, the guy who eliminates the chaos that left the world. BRILLIANT. Anyway, Bruce is a little skeptical about actually having met God, but when God gives Bruce his powers and makes him play God, he starts believing a bit. Questions, why. Enter the glaring abuse of power for personal gain and abuse of enemies. Since this is Hollywood, Bruce will obviously someday smarter, learns his lesson and begins to use his powers for the good of the world. In the end, he calls upon God to take it away and pray that His will be done, not Bruce. <br /> <br /> Since it's Jim Carrey, the movie is pretty amusing and there are definitely some entertaining movies moments in there. The film is not a perfect theology, but for Hollywood it's definitely a good try. Many statements in the film can be thought-provoking and even challenging, and I welcome Tom Shadyac for his efforts in this film. <br /> <br /> Although anything but perfect, this is definitely an amusing popcorn movie with a little thought behind it. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: 3.5 out of 4 (worth one or two views)
