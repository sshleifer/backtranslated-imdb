If you're a fan of Chuck Norris and Judson Mills, then this is the movie you can see. It has a lot of adventure. It's a great successor to President's Man. The chemistry between the three main stars (Chuck Norris, Judson Mills, Jennifer Tung) is incredible. My personal opinion. This movie has become so good along with the original that the networks should consider turning it into a regular series. Recommend this movie to you. If you've seen President's Man: A line in the sand, but you have not seen President's Man, then let me suggest you do it. You will not be disappointed by either.
