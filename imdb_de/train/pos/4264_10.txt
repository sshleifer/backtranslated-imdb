I have seen this movie twice or more and found it well done! The Second World War was over and the so-called "Cold War" was about to begin. This film could therefore be described as one of the best "propaganda", patriotic films that prepare Americans, and second, people from the still to be formed "Western NATO bloc" of countries to face the next threat. The film celebrates the power of the United States through the centuries and is projected on the war that was just over. Nice and funny is the way to describe the discovery of the American continent by Columbus and the "espisode" of New Amsterdam and the purchase of Manhattan by a drunken native Indian propaganda by the time)! :)
