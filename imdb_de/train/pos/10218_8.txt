We have to keep in mind that the 50s were virtually a blank slate in terms of movies. Hollywood was in transition from patriotic war movies, Noir, two castors, etc. to films with a message. We had Blackboard Jungle, On the Waterfront and so on. Some people may think that this was an improvement. Not me. Who was the mogul who said: If you want to send a message, call Western Union. He was right. These psychological thrillers are less entertainment than some type of remote therapy. <br /> <br /> This is a pip. It's about three sisters trying to gain control over the estate of their dead father. One of them, perhaps the only one worthy of salvation, asks the company for help to keep the rest of the family in check. He is initially there for the money, but finally falls in love with her. Meanwhile, the rest of the family plans to sabotage the romance. The results are predictable. In this movie you get a little bit of everything. Sexual tension between the sisters. A little subtle masochism. Hereditary madness - if there is such a thing. We never meet with the parents, but they must have been screwed up. The cast is virtually unknown. One or two of the actors sound vaguely familiar. The spectacle is so bad that it's hard to believe. It was released under the umbrella of United Artists by a company called Bel-Air Productions. It was shot in and around LA mostly at night and probably without permission. The end was so bizarre that I thought it was a joke. It was as if they ran out of money and the producer decided to pack it in the middle of a scene trashy 8/10. I'm familiar with the phrase, "It's so bad, it's good," but I do not think I've ever met the phenomenon before. Well, maybe "Hot Rods to Hell", but this one certainly fits. You may want to try this if you love movies made in the basement by someone.
