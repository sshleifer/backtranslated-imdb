I came late to this show - I think it was the third and final episode when it was first viewed - and was hit by a social commentary that has not been seen on American TV since "All in the Family", overwhelmed. <br /> <br /> Was very surprised that CBS would even do it. <br /> <br /> That is, the last time CBS had a set, if you know what I mean, was the day of All in the Family. The most controversial decision they want to address today is how much eyeshadow Katie should wear. <br /> <br /> If you really want to make some people really crazy, let them discover the truth about yourself. And if you want them to be ready to pull strings, make phone calls, and remove a work of art, let them discover this truth by hearing their own words spoken out of their own mouths. <br /> <br /> The Aardman people have always done it was way ahead of the curve. And this show is no different. Somehow, under the CBS 'Corporate / Social / Political / Censor Radar', it sneaked out to get it on schedule (maybe the "big tin" never really saw it until it finally aired?), But once good 'Ol Middle' Merika heard and I saw myself - well, I can bet that the message or the ambassador does not last long. <br /> <br /> Well, if only the "missing episodes" can find their way into Usenet or Bit torrent ;-) <br /> <br /> Thank you BC Kelly Tallahassee Fla
