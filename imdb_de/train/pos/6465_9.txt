The film, recently voted a crowd pleaser at the Palm Springs International Film Festival 2005, is inspiring and moving. A famous conductor, who was forced by illness to retire, returns to the small village of his birth to become the head of the church choir and eventually find fulfillment in his music. This film is based on Sweden's characteristics of keeping things and the insularity of a small Swedish village. This film develops each of his characters well. Greatly directed, played and sung, it brought tears to many eyes and smiled at everyone. Hopefully it will be marketed in the United States. <br /> <br /> If you can, you can see it!
