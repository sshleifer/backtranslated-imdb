I can not understand why they decided to release this movie to introduce the American audience to the Dynamo Jet Li. Faust the legend would have been a much better choice. In any case, Black Mask is not terrible, but not great either. The final combat sequence is staged by Yuen Woo Ping, who coordinated the matrix. However, the English version suffers from rough editing and dubbing. (I ask the Hollywood studios to release these films uncut with subtitles.) Jet Li shows his characteristic charisma in the title role, and Francoise Yip has a cool, but short, role as a female 701. <br /> <br /> Black Mask has a strange goth style that arouses a bit of interest, but it's overloaded with gun battles and explosions. The focus on Lis' fantastic physical abilities was fine. Black Mask is a decent movie, but do yourself a favor and get Fist of Legend if you want to watch a great movie that really shows Li's skills.
