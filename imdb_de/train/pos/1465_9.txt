His selection of films, the basic "illusion" of production (which inserts him into the sets or simulacra of the films he comments on) and his delivery are brilliant! If you want Freud, you should know that you are getting Zizek's version of Lacan, which should not be confused with Lacan himself. As usual, Zizek delivers complex ideas with enthusiasm and in a convincing manner. The downside is that it's also pretty weird and so there may be more to it's taste than its actual content. Cinematically it is a gem. Psychologically, people of all beliefs (Freudians, Lacanians, and Jungians) will scratch their heads, but still grab popcorn. Zizek is a phenomenon and pop icon in its own right.
