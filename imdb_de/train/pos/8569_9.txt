This is just as good as the original 101, if not better. Of course, Cruella steals the show with her outrageous behavior and outfits, and the movie was probably made because the public wanted to see more of Cruella. We see much more of her this time. I also like Ioan Gruffudd as Kevin, the rather awkward male lead. Using Paris as the highlight of the film was a clever idea. The movie is worthwhile at any age, provided you like animals.
