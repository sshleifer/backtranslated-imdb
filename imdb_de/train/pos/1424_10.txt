It is quite annoying that reviewers continue to compare this to planet Earth ... Of course, planet earth is better - it has much more of it. The Earth is like an extended trailer for the Planet Earth series and is therefore inevitably inferior and simplified. But that is not like the same. <br /> <br /> As a feature-length documentary (or actually as a feature-length song), it surpasses just about anything you'll see in your entire life (unless you choose) for years in Long-range camera helicopters traverse the earth and wait months in extreme environments to catch a glimpse of the most extraordinary creatures on Earth, which is unlikely to be seen in our faces). The story goes: Yes, everyone in the UK - and me too - admires David Attenborough, and there is no excuse for not telling them here, but that does not make it worth putting down one or three stars , He was not a moderator on Planet Earth, just a narrator, and I'm sure he's humble and gracious enough to realize that anything that attracts more viewers is a good thing. <br /> <br /> Anyone who sees this will be overwhelmed by awe, majesty and fame. All reviewers agree. Those who love (ie all) will / should buy a planet. Three cheers for the movie release and a big compliment to anyone cheap enough to buy on DVD instead of the Planet Earth box set. But as artworks they are not in competition here. <br /> <br /> The earth is big enough for both.
