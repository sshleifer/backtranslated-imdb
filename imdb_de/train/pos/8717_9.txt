I have to admit, I'm not a big fan of "family movies" these days. Most of them, IMHO, are sentimental crap. But this, like TOY STORY, Pixar's previous film, is a lot of fun. The two main characters may have been a bit boring (especially compared to the two main characters in ANTZ, but otherwise this movie is better), but the rest of the movie more than made up for it. The animation looked great, the humor, though broad, was consistently good (I especially liked Hoppers line "If I did not promise mother on her deathbed that I would not kill you, I'd kill you!") And the actors The voices apart from the two clues were all great (Denis Leary making an animated film, what a concept). And like everyone else, I loved the outtakes! I hope the video has the new ones.
