After seeing this movie back in 1998 with VH-1, I just had to comment. <br /> <br /> When I first saw this movie on TV, it was around 1981, and I remember hearing it from my mother Betamax. It was recorded in black and white for some reason, which gave it a temporary look that appealed to me. <br /> <br /> I remember very well the movie that started with the song "My Bonnie" camera panning over a scene from Liverpool. I also remember the opening scene in which Paul gestures some girls and says, "Look, talent!" So it was very irritating that I came in my 1998 recorded version and "thought of it" that the film with "She Loves You" instead of "My Bonnie" begins. When you see how slow the camera is in relation to the speed of the music, you find that "She Loves You" simply does not fit. Also in this "later" version, when Paul sees the girls, he says, "Look, GIRL!" ... and somehow the word somehow did not remember the earlier version. Why they had to Americanize this movie for the American audience is incomprehensible to me. When I watch a film about a British band, I want all the British colloquialisms and those that are part of their speech, their behaviors, etc. <br /> <br /> Another irritation was how "choppy" was the cut for television. Shortly after Stu was beaten, for example, the movie cuts to a commercial 'Break-LOTS' by 'em. Yes, I know, it depends on the network, but it really destroys the effect of a movie to cut it apart, as we all know. What some people feel to be insignificant in terms of dialogue (and therefore to be handled well) may actually go the way of explaining a particular action or scene that follows. <br /> <br /> My point is "the best". The version of this movie was probably the earlier version I recorded from 1981, and that scene also included the scene "Shake, Rattle & Roll," which was not included in my 1998 version. I began to suspect that there had to be two different versions for the television, and a look at the "alternative versions" link regarding this movie proved me right. The fact that the American version had some shorter / cut / other scenes and / or dialogues is a big disappointment to me and worth mentioning if you are interested in such things. Imo, the best bet is, if possible, to get the European version of this movie and (probably even less possible) an unedited version. Unfortunately, I had to discard my old European Betamax version because I did not know how to convert it. Apart from that, I found that this movie is one of the best movies in terms of history behind the "Birth of the Beatles". Knowing that artistic and creative licenses are often used in movies and on television when portraying events throughout history, I have not disagreed with my movie enjoyment. Sure, you see the Beatles playing songs in the Cavern that make me wonder: "Did they write that then? I do not think so", but still I thought it was a great movie and the performances, wonderful. <br /> <br /> The really special thing for me was the actor who played John, Stephen MacKenna. I just fell in love with him. His looks, behavior, personality, and voice sounded exactly like that. He looked like a young John to me to make a double-take towards the end of the movie when you first saw the Beatles perform on Ed Sullivan. I actually wondered if it was actually Beatles footage or not until I saw the other actors in the scene. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for an absolutely accurate history of the life and beginnings of the Beatles, you can not do better than "The Beatles' Anthology" as it was "written" by the boys themselves. However, if you are looking for a funny snapshot from the days before Beatlemania's arrival in America and leave your anal critical assessments at the door, you can not go wrong with the "Beatles Birth". -a MUST be for every "real" or casual Beatle fan.
