What a night. Perry Mason, then Have Gun, Will Travel, followed by Gunsmoke (when it was half an hour), and at 10.30pm 'Sea Hunt' came to a new adventure with its wonderful opening music and Mike's boat. Incredible. Regardless of the story, it was the main character (played by Lloyd Bridges), strong, honest and sincere. A man and a boy. This has led to years of interest in boats. Why not show it on cable or make it available on video, no idea .. too bad.
