"Cry Freedom" is not just a movie. It is a historical account, a heroic story and insight into the cultural background of an important event in history. Not only does Denzel Washington do a great job to personify the motivating, determined hero Steve Biko, he also shares with the public a message about the horrors of South African apartheid. The story of Biko, an influential leader, and his main "influence" Donald Woods is heartbreaking. However, the ultimate success of his life can go beyond the atrocities committed in South Africa. "Cry Freedom" manages to convey to the viewer the optimistic aspect of the seemingly disturbing conspiracy. It's because of great films like this that the public can be educated about terrible events in history, great leaders who strive to end them, and how we can never allow them in the future. Because of this meaning, "Cry Freedom" is an amazing movie that should be seen by everyone.
