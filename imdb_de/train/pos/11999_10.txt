I have seen this wonderful production, and I wonder if anyone can tell me anything about the actress who played the blacksmith's wife. I went with her to BYU and lost contact with her - her maiden name was Kim Luke - and I wonder if anyone has information about her. It is not listed in the credits. This production was outstanding, a lurid joke by all means, an excellent spectacle for everyone. I guess I do not even want to classify it into the general category of acting, rather like filming the amazing events that led to the opening of Heaven for that final dispensation. If someone has worked with Kim or has a website, please let me know !!! By the way, she was fantastic in her role ... Thanks, Melissa Thorne
