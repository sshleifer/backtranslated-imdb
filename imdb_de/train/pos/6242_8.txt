I agree with the previous comment by calling the content of the film "everyday insanity", but I would like to state the following: "Dog Days" is about how women are treated in a (male) society. The episodes we see here show some differences in everyday discrimination against women, mostly by age group. There is an older man who makes his new partner look the way his late wife did and treat her like a doll wearing the former's "worthy" dress. There is a middle-aged couple in whose relationship she is almost a slave and he (violent) master. Also, we find a slightly younger man who does not communicate with his girlfriend / wife and, instead of being really jealous of their affairs, even makes friends with his rivals. A young adult man makes it clear to his friend - a girl who is really worried that he is pretty enough for him - that she has to be the jeweler at his side and follow his strict rules of etiquette. Finally, there is a man in his late fifties who calculates his own advantage. He brings a simple hitchhiking woman to an angry customer who found her guilty of scratching his car. To complete the examples, we find the man's buddy in the "master-slave" pair - after she has abused them collectively - to threaten and humiliate the former "for her sake" as they get rid of their partner and themselves as her new will take "master". During all this, the inhabitants of the recently built neighborhood where the action takes place are under the burning summer sun - absolutely motionless (sic!). Unfortunately, I have not seen the last minutes of this shocking and authentic portrayal of the archaic structures that still reign in the relationship between women and men, but what I've seen has convincingly analyzed the repertoire of discrimination. Probably a helpful tool to teach the less sensitive audience what is going wrong - thanks to good visualization.
