Spoiler!!! This film is based on the concept of What If? Of course, Mr. Destiny can answer that question. The main character, like many of us, goes through a bad day and asks that question. The chaos theory says that a butterfly in China can influence someone here by a chain reaction. The focus of this movie is based on an event during a baseball game. This event sets destiny in motion; Just like Ashton in "The Butterfly effect," except that Mr. Destiny uses the comedy about the drama. The results give a fresh, somewhat original film. If someone philosophically agrees with "The Butterfly Effect," he'll probably enjoy Mr. Destiny. I give 7 out of 10 points. Amazing, because I saw the first half of this movie 3 times and finally saw the end on TBS.
