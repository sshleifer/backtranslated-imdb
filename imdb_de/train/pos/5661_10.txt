I see many people on this site wishing that AG appear on DVD. Well, I bought it on DVD. (From Borders, not less!) Although it's great to have this terrific show in a DVD box, I'm upset that they've added just a few "extra" pilot episodes) and the episodes are shown in the order in which they were broadcast on television. The missing episodes that have never been shown before running on the sci-fi channel are included with the box but will be included on the final DVD. When you buy the DVD set you will get the actual order in which they are displayed and you will be happier. (You'll need to swap DVDs in and out of your player to watch them in turn, but you'll be glad you did.) <br /> <br /> S
