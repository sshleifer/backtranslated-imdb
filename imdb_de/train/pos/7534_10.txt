I disagree with the other reviews. Everything basically negative. I took a chance for this movie and was glad I did that. Indeed. I could not fault anything sympathetic and convincing. Dee Smart reminded me of Bradcia Bunch's Marcia Brady. But this girl can really work. The setting in the Australian outback is perfect. I've seen this movie twice in less than 24 hours. I'll probably see him again. It is so interesting. He lets think. He is probably better than nine-tenths of the so-called Hollywood blockbusters That was also traveling during this time. Back Of Beyond is a sympathetic movie. I have not photographed anything. I could not find anything wrong. Check it! My first review!
