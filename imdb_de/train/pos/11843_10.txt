Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron is a wonderful movie. The mix of animation types is unique, the plot is amazing and the music is wonderful. <br /> <br /> The drawn animation is a special thing in many animations. Especially spectacular is how they express the characters, especially the horses, through their animation. While the way horses communicate through body language is easy to understand, many children and people who have not yet learned horses may not understand. Without words, I would imagine that expressing them through the functions would be difficult. For this reason, I understand the eyebrows that they added to the horses (while real horses do not have those thick lines). One of the few things that struck me about the habits of horses that have been strangely portrayed is that Spirit leads the flock of his mother. In wild herds, the lead stallion usually hunts out the young stallions. <br /> <br /> Although some people think that depicting the white army officers as "bad guys" is stereotyping, think of all the films the Native Americans have been portrayed as. Sometimes at that time; They treated Mustangs very badly. For example, the Appaloosa race was almost eradicated in real history due to army officers. Imagine what would have happened to one of the most popular riding breeds in the world if the Indians had not saved them. <br /> <br /> I find it amazing that realism was not subtracted by the horses talking to each other. The feelings of Spirit were expressed through a bit of narration, but mainly through music (by Bryan Adams). The songs express the story very well, and Hans Zimmer and Bryan Adams have told the story very well through melodies and lyrics. <br /> <br /> The emotion I got when watching the movie, be it the first time or the twentieth (yes, I've seen it so many times), you do not believe that. Some scenes take your breath away, while other tears seem to crowd into your eyes. The opening sequence, which shows the home of Spirit, puts you immediately in the spectacular action. <br /> <br /> I do not understand why some people hate this brilliant movie. Overall, I rate it with 10/10 - a must.
