Explosive weapons, buildings explode, cars crash, and that's only the first ten minutes. <br /> <br /> This action-packed movie involving a rogue ex-CIA mercenary who does not seem to die no matter how many times he was shot (hence the title) is pretty decent. <br /> <br /> The tough and squeamish Gary Busey, usually played as a villain in these flicks, has his usual crazy charm, but is a little more subdued: after all, he wears the entire show. That does not mean that there are not many great supporting roles, including William Smith, Luke Askew, Mills Watson, R.G. Armstrong, Henry Silva, Lincoln Kirkpatrick, Thalmus Rasulala and several other "forgotten" character actors. <br /> <br /> There are enough minor action sequences to stop the story: Busey has to free a group of "kidnapped" American military elites and return a high-tech "supertank" (a normal tank with a cheesy addition) - glued on top) back to the States. <br /> <br /> But does America deserve this killing machine more than the bad guys? Of course, this question is posed as in any film that focuses on the CIA ... but without preaching.
