Was Al Pacino ever in a bad movie? His name seems to be an impression of first-class cinema. This is as good a performance as he has ever given. Pacino is an American Olivier. And that's a political thriller, as good as he can. There are no good and no bad guys. However, the system is inexorably affecting the people who believe they are leading it. Pacino's performance is not only convincing - the laudation on the burial of a dead child is unbelievably great - the film has a fast, gritty realism that enhances good performances without gimmicks. This outstanding portrait of big-city politics also manages to provide two hours of excellent movie watching without excessive violence, overheated sex or guttering language. There is murder. There are bad people. However, they work effectively without going over the limit. A movie like this restores my ruined belief in Hollywood. I do not forgive many tens. This one earns it abundantly!
