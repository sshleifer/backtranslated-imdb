Full House came to me when I was about nine years old. I remember seeing Bob Saget repeating America's Funniest Home videos and one day my mother told me that he was on a show called Full House. One day I was fortunate to see an episode when I visited my family. It did not seem to be very interesting at first glance, but since I looked at it more and more every night at 9:00 am, I would just be on it. <br /> <br /> This show really makes you want to be there with the girls, visit places with them and maybe even sing along and sing along with their little family. <br /> <br /> The thing I like most about Full House is that it's a great show for kids and adults of all ages. There will be some areas that are more for adults than children, so the whole family can enjoy it. No matter how cheesy, it's still a great show and I would definitely recommend it to anyone. <br /> <br /> 10/10
