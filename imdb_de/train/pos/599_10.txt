I really enjoyed this movie because the acting was really sincere. The writing was first class. James Arness is a great actor and he showed it here. Brian Keith was too old to be Davy Crockett, and can anyone really play Davy, except Fess Parker? Another great actor on this train was Raul Julia, who gave depth to Santa Anna, a futile and complex person, who led Mexico through turbulent times. <br /> <br /> While some think the movie is slow, he conquered the battle as it unfolded. A lot of boredom followed, followed by a few hours of horrible horror <br /> What impressed me most about this movie is that you have thought about one thing and how some people are willing to die for that I believe there was a time when people died for freedom, no matter how you feel about politics.
