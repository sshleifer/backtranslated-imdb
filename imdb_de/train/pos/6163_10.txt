This is one of the few films where I think that movie playback is an improvement over the original book. The story is clear, accessible, amusing and interesting and the music numbers are undoubtedly extraordinary. I admired the cyclic rendition of "The Old Home Guard" and the charming "Portobello Road", a great combination of early animation and real acting techniques that, though dated, do not detract from the charm of the piece. The background of the Second World War worked well and was not left out when the film began, which is so often in evacuated stories. <br /> <br /> An often much underrated film that never ceases to be enjoyable for people of all ages. The performances of the actors are exceptionally well done and the entire text is well connected and well designed. Guaranteed a smile on your face!
