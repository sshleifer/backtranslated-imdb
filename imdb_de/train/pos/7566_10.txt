The young lady is called Bonnie (Polay). She is attractive, apparently lives a pretty decent life, but is suddenly inexplicably torn from her home and life by Evil Dude and the Various and Sundry Evil Henchmen. Now she has no idea what the hell is going on except that some armed people apparently want her dead ... and she will die without knowing why. <br /> <br /> God, I hear all the time. Now that content is so cheap to produce and people can create their own films / books / comics / internal organs, there will not be anyone who cares about quality! We will drown in crap! The only people who really believe that are people who have not seen movies or read books lately - because we're already driving a dead man in the dump. It's people like Ferrari and Rodriguez who lied to those ignorant so-sos by throwing $ 8K on the table and ... well, what I'd say is a better action movie than anything you've seen in theaters year ago ... but you have not seen any action flicks in the cinema this year. I saw the box office. You stay in droves. You'd better get a copy of it, spend twenty minutes talking, and keep up with your life. <br /> <br /> It's pure entertainment. Like Bonnie, you come up with lots of questions and where it ends is nebulous. The whole concept has been done in different ways, but not in so much time and not without such a concentrated, delicious gunplay. They are there for the atmosphere, the secret and the weapons. That's it - that's all the filmmakers promise, and they deliver it. <br /> <br /> It warms the black pits of my heart to believe that this was done on such a budget. We get a good number of indie films here, but we rarely see anything as polished as this short, and we've never seen one in the action genre that looked so good. Damn, you could give these two guys MI: 3 and it could make me see it. The Bond franchise. Hell, anything. No, actually better: I'd like to see these guys make their own feature and stay away from Hollywood. Whatever kills the movie industry is undoubtedly contagious. <br /> <br /> Best indie we've seen in a long time and the most effective indie business card we've ever seen. The DVD costs $ 20 and has bonus features out of the ass. Take your movie budget budget and put it in that direction instead.
