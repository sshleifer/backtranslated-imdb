This fabulous movie has to be seen, knowing that millions have scraped together 10 cents to forget the grim economic conditions of the 1930s. Remember, 10 cents bought a loaf of bread at that time, so for many people it was an insignificant luxury. It's a testament to how Hollywood did its best to make the US feel better. You will find that the studio system in Hollywood at that time cast many of the actors and actresses in similar films, eg. James Cagney, William Powell, Ruby Keeler, Frank McHugh, Joan Blondell and Guy Kibbee. Even the branches of the US military were always respected with enthusiasm and patriotism, as in the military precision march by the great choreographer Busby Berkeley.
