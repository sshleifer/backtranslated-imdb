I watch with some hesitation romantic comedies, for romantic comedies are ancient clich√©s that make a movie uninteresting. Usually in a romantic comedy there is a girl and a guy, both fall in love, then have problems and then win the problems they want to marry, or whatever. But this movie is a different story, it really is very different from the romantic comedies I've seen lately. <br /> <br /> There is a widowed man (Dan), there is a girl (Marie). Dan meets Marie in a bookstore and talks at some point after Marie has to leave. Dan develops something for her, and when that becomes meaningful we get a turn. Marie is his brother's girlfriend. Without paying attention to the circumstances, Dan flees with Marie and realizes that he loves her, and even Marie loves him, but her love would not only be possible. How it's made possible makes up the rest of the story. <br /> <br /> Steve Carell performs well, Juliette Binoche is as good as Marie. And every other stuff is well done. It's a good movie, look at it.
