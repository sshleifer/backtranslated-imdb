This movie is a must-have classic. It certainly is not perfect. The tempo is perfect for the stage, but in film form like a turtle with arthritic knees. Jean Seberg is misguided to be too sweet and too gentle. She shows enough acting talent, skill and craftsmanship to convincingly play the smart, passionate and confident Joan, but the director has unfortunately missed the point of the character. George Bernard Shaw is my favorite playwright. In no other piece was his dialogue sharper and the lines more musical. However, to edit this movie, you must consider him a lawyer. This movie is a case, and the viewer is the judge. So this picture is to enjoy. 10.7.
