I expected a "cute little movie" from mainland China and was ill prepared. Family dynamics, community and the inevitable change were seldom studied so expertly in the film. Every character is solid and I was fully involved in the story. The organization is much more complex than the American audience. However, there is no difficulty in following the progress even if subtitles are read. Jiang Wu is a backward brother, a constant light. Leave your cynicism in your locker. It will be there when you check out.
