I saw this movie about a year ago and thought it was really funny. In my eyes, a real winner. It had the signing of a stupid comedy, but in fact it also had an action. Quite similar to the hit comedy Elf. There were a few serious moments, between cheerfulness. When Stiller shot Black's horse, a normally sober moment, they laughed at his chubby antics. You can actually find similarities, as I'm sure many people have done something they do not want a friend to know about, so your friendship does not end. People did not like this movie, I was completely stunned. That absolutely terrible films like Napoleon Dynamite had higher ratings than me, I wonder about the reason of the people on IMDb. Take my advice and rent it. If you do not make yourself laugh at least once, I will refund you the rent. = D
