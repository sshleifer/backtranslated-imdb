The 1930s. The noble, elegant Adele (wonderfully played with dignified determination by Debbie Reynolds) and the crazy, frumpy Helen (the great Shelley Winters, who gets her usual histrionic dizziness at her expense) are the mothers of two murderers. Leaving behind their midwestern past, they move to Hollywood to start their own dance school for aspiring children's starlets. Adele starts with the raging millionaire Lincoln Palmer (the always-fine Dennis Weaver). On the other hand, the religious fanatic Helen soon falls into despair and madness. <br /> <br /> Director Curtis ("Night Tide", "Ruby") Harrington works on a crafty script by Henry Farrell (who wrote the book) "Whatever happened to Baby Jane?" Based on the script for "Hush ... Hush, Sweet Charlotte" and co-writing this script, a nifty and captivating psychological horror thriller about guilt, fear, repression and religious zest. The Super cast has a ball with its colorful roles: Michael MacLiammoir as a pompous Elocution teacher, Agnes Moorehead as a stern radio evangelist for fire and brimstone, Yvette Vickers as a sneaky, overbearing mother of a brave child star, Logan Ramsey as a snappy detective and Timothy Carey as a scary bum. A lavish talent recital set featuring Pamelyn Ferdin (the voice of Lucy in the TV cartoon specials "Peanuts") serving as Emcee, and the original "Friday the 13th," the victim of Robbi Morgan, the evil one Mark, spoiled Mae West makes impression. David Raskin's scary film music, a fantastic scene where Reynolds performed an incredible tango in a posh restaurant, the atmosphere of depression, the beautiful cinematography of Lucien Ballard, and above all, the amazing macabre ending, are all excellent and effective. MGM presents this great gem on a chic DVD double bill with "Whoever Slew Auntie Roo?" Both images are presented together with their cinema trainers in pin-sharp widescreen transfers.
