This is the kind of movie for a snowy Sunday afternoon when the rest of the world can start their own business when you fall into a big armchair for a couple of hours. Wonderful performances by Cher and Nicolas Cage (as always) gently row the action. There are no rapids to cross, no dangerous waters, just a warm and funny paddle through New York life. A family movie in every sense and one that deserves the praise it has received.
