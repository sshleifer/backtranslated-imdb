"Broken Bow" takes us back to where it all started. 150 years in our future and 100 years before Kirk, Spock and McCoy. This episode of the "Star Trek" franchise is, in my opinion, the first series since "TOS" to recapture the feelings of wonderment, danger and excitement of "Going where No Man Before Done". Scott Bakula is perfectly cast as Jonathan Archer, the first captain of the first "Star Ship Enterprise". He and the entire cast really show a true reverence for the heritage of Star Trek. John Billingsley is brilliant as the extraterrestrial dr. Phlox and Jolene Blalock are completely seductive as a tantalizing, but logical volcanic science officer T'Pol. Broken Bow is in my opinion the best premiere of all treks, and I think Gene Roddenberry would be proud of it.
