This show is good. I like acting, funny parts and the cuteness of it. The actors, Lee Pace, Ann Friel ... etc, were all great on the show. The show began with her witty, illogical idea to bring back dead in the first series. And honestly, as people said, the first episodes of the second series were a little disappointed, but they came back later anyway, and now I really hate the fact that it's going to be canceled. Why does not ABC just let it end until all episodes are done? I really want to know what the story will look like. I think there should be a chance, because there are still so many viewers who love it.
