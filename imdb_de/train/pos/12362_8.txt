I'll quickly go into the film stuff here: it was a very appealing story about the destructive qualities of all-consuming passions; A young Italian who can not emotionally connect with her incarcerated political-radical fianc√© (in part due to her apolitical attitudes and liberal outlook on life) finds solace and passion in a new young lover with whom she makes an explicit sexual relationship , The fears, anger, tenderness, and passions swirling in the atmosphere of history are like the dispassionate silence that seems to mask the two main lines. This gives the film a disturbing mood that pervades all political conflicts that would otherwise be lost to the viewer (unless you are very familiar with Italian politics in the 1980s). I found the film convincing ... what ruined it a little bit is a free oral sex scene that plays the actress on the male lead role. It is not simulated and leaves little to the imagination. There are other sex scenes in the film that I think are necessary because they describe the madness and loneliness in which the characters live. But the oral sex scene disappoints the focus on the real story. Sailing was smooth until then, and as soon as the notorious sex scene appears (which caused a lot of laughter at the time), it's like hitting a roadblock. It's rough and unnecessary, and I'm in the camp who think the film would not have been harmed if the scene had been removed from it. And the unfortunate thing is that this scene can keep people from looking at this fascinating film, which I think is worth a visit, because there is so much going on beneath the surface that emotions and other disturbances are in the subtext. <br /> <br /> Overall: Wonderful movie that is hampered by a not necessarily needed sex scene.
