I think this is a kind of reworking or update of "Beauty and the Beast", but I can not say that I have ever seen a movie that started with several minutes of graphic horse sex. Impressive. Anyway, it seems that a young woman and her ... aunt? Traveled to this castle in France, where the wife is to be married to the son of the castle owner, who is the man who makes sure that the horses take their stones off. It seems that there are legends in this area about a beast that was rather, uh, playful, I think, you could say, with the ladies or at least with a certain person. There are all sorts of clues in this regard, but every time the blushing young bride gets her curious little hands on one, the groom's father takes it out of her sight. Anyway, the young bride goes upstairs to sleep while the family waits for a cardinal to show up for the wedding (a family member, I guess) and as she dreams, she dreams of an animal in the forest that has its own path their. The effects in this respect leave something to be desired, and any attempt at eroticism (not that I know much about it) is somewhat ridiculous, especially if certain attachments are about as realistic as a bedpost or baseball bat. This has a rather strange and abrupt end, but an end to the phrase, with not really any clues or clues, but it was somehow fitting and definitely not what I expected. I do not know, that's pretty hard to get through, but it has its moments and is definitely funny. 7 out of 10.
