I know some people think the movie is boring, but I do not agree. It is a biography of a very complex and extraordinary person. I liked the characters in the film and think that leaving parts of Archie's life was a mystery that took his humanity. I do not think that the purpose of a good biography should be the detailing of a person's life, but rather the complexity and the relationships that make it interesting. And what is more fascinating than to reinvent oneself so successfully? "Men become what they dream - you dreamed well." Good work for Lord Attenborough. I also wanted to mention that Nathaniel Arcand really attracted my attention as a charismatic actor and I hope to see him in other films.
