When I read another user's rating and said that it's a terrible game, I could not stay idle and do nothing! <br /> <br /> Well, this game is great, from the news clips (with two real people, full.) humor, sense, and credibility!), to the story, I think that's very good! I only complain that the enemies are blinking when they die until they disappear. and some frustrating situations in the LEILA VR missions, driving here and there ... Besides, it's a great game with a great story, good graphics, great characters, and a great soundtrack. . I recommend it! Definitely! It can be a bit old, but still enjoyable! At least on the Dreamcast ... but the PS2 version should be the same.
