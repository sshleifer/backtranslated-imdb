Unfortunately not yet available on DVD, but worth a continuation on TCM or VHS. A secretary believes her boss is unjustly charged with murder and courageously adopts many dangerous characters to find out the truth. A film with many twists and dark lanes, of which I will mention nothing! The jazz band sequence in which our heroine searches for information about the killer is one of the most erotic scenes in Hollywood history, though it has a low budget and was made in black and white during the Second World War. Despite the low budget - Long Island looks a bit mountainous - this is a film with original style and great vision. Ella Raines was a great actress, discovered by Howard Hawks, who knew a lot about these things and had the most spirited women - Joanne Dru, Hepburn, Angie Dickinson, Lauren Bacall, and Ann Sheridan - of her time. Robert Siodmak was one of several German, Hungarian and Czech filmmakers - Sirk, Wilder, Zinnemann, Lubitsch, Curtiz, Lang, etc., who moved to Hollywood and brought a very original, fresh vision. Unfortunately, Ella Raines never got such a big role again and ended up in poorly produced westerns.
