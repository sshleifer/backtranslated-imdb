After seeing this movie at the SF Independent Film Festival, I could not wait to hear how I got a copy. Jim McKay gave a lecture (Q & A) on the film, in which he presented his ironic situation: How do I get a film in which minorities (women, non-whites) are represented, who work on the solution of controversial issues (pregnancy of teenagers, motherhood of teenagers, race identity)? Single Households) and how to write a true script on all these topics, a white man in his mid-thirties. The multi-racial audience, consisting mostly of adults, raved about the film's fantastic storyline, detailed characters, and the fantastic portrayal of "real teenage life." However, most of the teenagers left the building - leading me to believe that this is a movie that can best be seen by adults with children, as a starting point for discussion and not, as many adults felt, "a movie that teen should see there is about them. "So distribution issues - how do we get it in the hands? The Internet (retail) would be a great way - this is a movie buried like "Pups" or other radical modern teenage films - and McKay seemed to respond. As for his criticisms as a writer / director, McKay's work was extremely sensitive and detailed - he linked up with the Crown Heights neighborhood in which the movie plays, and collaborated with actors to portray the characters in their own vision of what you should think to be portrayed - with the results are disarmingly realistic.
