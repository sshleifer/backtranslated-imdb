How can you not rate this movie with 10/10? I admit that this movie is not very entertaining, but the goal is not to tell you a story, but history! This is the first "real" movie in cinema history ("le Prince de Galles" was the first, but technically not perfect enough?) And undoubtedly has great international value. These people, who you can see in the movie at the end of their working day, had the chance to participate in a historical moment and became the first to move! And above all, the shot is a nice shot! And it is very moving when you think about the first ones who have seen it! What a moment! Historically for the science first (because the brothers Lumiere first invented the cinema for scientific reasons) and later for the art. A movie to worship!
