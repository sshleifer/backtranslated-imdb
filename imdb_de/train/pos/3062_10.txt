I saw this movie on cable a couple of months ago, and it was awesome. William H Macy is one of my favorite actors and his performance was amazing. He makes sure you take care of his character, even if he clearly does the wrong thing, and Neve Campbell gives a performance that is without a doubt the best performance I've ever seen of an actress this year. She is fantastic as a wild young woman who is wise over her years. <br /> <br /> Donald Sutherland is just scary as Macy's dad and John Ritter is alright like a shrink movie stuck in the middle of everything that happens. I wish that was in the theater because I think that this is a movie that should be seen by a larger audience. It's a shame, because it's unbelievable that most new films are going to the movies now. <br /> <br />
