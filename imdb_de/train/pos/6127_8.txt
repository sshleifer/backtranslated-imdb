Jack Frost is about a serial killer who is sentenced to death. On the way to his death sentence collides the prisoner transporter, with which he is filled with a chemical tanker, which is filled with a chemical that turns his molecules with the snow on the ground into a snowman. To be a murderer himself, who would turn him into a killer snowman. Jack now wants revenge on the sheriff who got him. Jack starts raving now and kills people in a small town. <br /> <br /> I do not think Jack Frost has the chance to become a horror classic, but it's an entertaining movie. Just put your brain on hold and have fun with it, but do not take it too seriously.
