As for romantic comedies, this was a sweet and winning one. I thought the writing could have been stronger to make the last connection a bit better, but that's not a big trigger. But Amanda Detmer and Scott Wolf are performing well and are as charming as ever. These are two of my favorite actors, and I was just happy to see them as romantic lead roles. I hope we will see you soon in further projects. Overall, this movie will not change your life but is sweet, warm and winning. Not a bad thing at all.
