Just Cause brings together some of the best parts of three films, Cape Fear, A Touch of Evil and Silence of the Lambs, and mixes it into a good thriller of a movie. <br /> <br /> Sean Connery is a liberal law professor, married to a former prosecutor, Kate Capshaw, and he is a Crusader against the death penalty. Blair Underwood's grandmother Ruby Dee knocks Connery out at a conference and persuades him to accept her grandson's call. He is on death row for murdering a young girl. When Connery arrives in this rural district of Florida, he meets a tough sheriff played by Laurence Fishburne, who is about as ruthless as Orson Welles was in contact with the evil one. <br /> <br /> After setting aside the verdict with evidence he has discovered, Connery feels pretty good. At this point, the movie turns from Touch of Evil to Cape Fear. <br /> <br /> To say that not everything is as it seems, is mild. The cast provides consistently good performances. Noteworthy is Ed Harris, who plays a Hannibal Lecter like the serial killer on death row with Underwood. He'll let your skin crawl and Connery reconsider some of the comfortable liberal conditions on which he has grounded his beliefs. Many confirmed liberals, whom I knew to have become a crime victim, think very differently. <br /> <br /> Of course, the opposite is true. Many conservative laws and regulations, if they participate in the wrong end of criminal justice, really want to make sure that all their rights are indeed guaranteed. <br /> <br /> Criminal justice is not an end, but a process and a never-ending one for all society. I guess if Just Cause has a moral it probably would.
