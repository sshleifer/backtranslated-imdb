I think the movie was kind of weird. In the opening scene, a person is killed for no reason. He will not be mentioned again. The special effects could have been better, but I enjoyed watching an older horror movie. It's not the best example of a classic horror movie, but it was still a good movie. I give about 5 out of 10 points on the scale.
