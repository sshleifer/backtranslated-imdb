The story of the FBI, as it is told by flashbacks from the point of view of Agent Stewart, is linked to his personal life story. Stewart and Miles (as his wife) are pretty good, as is Hamilton as a serious agent. The problem is that the episodic nature of the story makes it difficult to get involved. It's like watching a couple of dozen different films when we look at the cast of a gangster. Some of the episodes are too long, others too short and others just look inappropriate (school sequence of Stewart's daughter). Overall, it is far too long. Nevertheless, it is worth a look at its beautiful production values.
