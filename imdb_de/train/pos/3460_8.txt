The story for Columbo's first TV show is simple: One half of the successful mystery writing team abandons the other, invokes an invisible mafia group, gets blackmailed by an admirer, renounces the admirer and becomes brave Tricked Columbo. <br /> <br /> With these words, this is still one of the most entertaining in the history of the show and benefits greatly from the work of the late Jack Cassidy and the star Peter Falk. <br /> <br /> Apart from the fact that the young Steven Spielberg is a director, the episode also looks like the future of two of her stars: Cassidy and Barbara Colby. The two scenes share several scenes and it is significant that both would tragically die within a decade of filming, Cassidy in a flat fire and Colby in the hands of assailants still to be found after more than three decades /> Well, both demises are true SECRETS!
