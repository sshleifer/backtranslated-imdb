Melvyn Douglas and Joan Blondell co-star in "The Amazing Mr. Williams," a 1939 mystery / comedy that is pretty good, though it was forgotten, probably due to the number of incredible movies released in 1939. > Douglas plays a talented cop who has married his job while his girlfriend is waiting for a wedding that is being postponed. What happens in this movie is no exception - he has just been called to a murder scene when he was just going down the hall again. <br /> <br /> Both stars were excellent at comedy, worked well (and often), and helped make this sex battle fun. Edward Brophy and Donald McBride are available for outstanding support. <br /> <br /> As you can read in other reviews, Melvyn Douglas does not care much about a woman. <br /> <br /> Entertaining if a little on the long side. <br /> <br /> One of the comments here has devastated Melvyn Douglas, one of our greatest actors. He literally floated through dozens of films as the other man and best friend before he came to himself as an old man in movies. He was not lazy, but rather a diligent actor (who made it look easy), who had a career on Broadway at the same time as his film career. He just was not cast as a leading man in movies or got very demanding roles in the studio. I challenge everyone to see his devastating performances in "Hud" and "I never sing for my dad" and call him lazy or refer to his grin.
