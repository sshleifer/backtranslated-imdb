This is the first 10 out of 10 that I've specified for a movie. What made this movie so good for me? Constant action - there are no slow parts, great acting, clever writing. I also liked the style of shooting, where the shaking and different angles felt like part of the scene. Finally, I see an action movie that does not appeal to all sectors of the audience (ie, there is no forced romance). <br /> <br /> I liked the first two Bourne movies, but I loved this one. <br /> <br /> Attention - After watching this movie, you'll be full of adrenaline and you might want to calm down before you drive!
