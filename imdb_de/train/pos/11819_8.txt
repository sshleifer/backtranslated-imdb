Have just picked up on DVD and viewed again. I love the bright colors over dark pictures. Not a big Beatty fan, but this is a great popcorn movie. Pacino, as always, is amazing, and this film marked the time when Madonna was her sexiest. I wish she had stayed with the "Breathless" look for a while. Charlie Korsmo's first really big role, except "What's up with Bob?". The make-up effects were up to date then and remain for the most part. Beautiful landscapes and mood transport you directly into a comic environment. The cars, the wardrobe, the buildings, and even the street lights have a great sound, not to mention the perfect lighting, though the scenes with lots of red can get a little annoying as they blur a bit. I just wish Beatty had the chance to do a sequel. All in all, a few hours of fun.
