The world is made up of two different kinds of moviegoers ... There are the "English Patient" types who do not bother to enjoy something that is not high enough to be shown on PBS, and there are those "Happy Gilmore" guys, for whom one and a half hours of genital puns are definitely worth the $ 7. <br /> <br /> Certainly there is a lot of gray area, but you know which side you are on. If you're an English patient, save yourself time, save your money, and save us all your "oh, this movie is so childish and stupid" comments. I know you enjoy pulling down any movie you do not like and any person who likes it, but maybe you could just refrain from it. <br /> <br /> But if you're a type of Happy Gilmore. Look at this ... you'll find it funny. Tim Meadows has created a hilarious character, and Will Farrell is still funny in almost everything he does. Go and look at it. You will not regret it. And that's fine.
