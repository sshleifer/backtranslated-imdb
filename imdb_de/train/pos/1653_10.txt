I agree with everyone who says that this series was the best of espionage. My husband and I were intrigued when he aired for the first time in the US and saw every episode. I tried to buy the series back then (I recorded everything on tape), but WGBH said it was not available. I even thought about writing to Ian Holm to see if he might have a copy! Like others, I've also bought and read the Deighton series (partly to understand the complicated presentation). If the original version is ever available on DVD, I'll be among the first to grab a copy. Ian Holm's portrayal of the vulnerable but courageous Bernard Samson was amazing. (He is always amazing.)
