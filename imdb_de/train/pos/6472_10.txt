One of the most beautiful television dramas of the last decade. During the five hours, perceptions and sympathies are constantly challenged as they explore many facets of modern British society. David Morrisey is brilliant as always. First as hard copper in conflict with the heroine, but proved to be intelligent and caring, since he works with her to uncover the truth. I have never seen Surrane Jones before. I think she comes from the world of television soaps. Her accomplishments have been great as she maintains her sense of humor and serenity while trying to balance the demands of the case and the stress of caring for her mother. I could go on to talk about every member of the cast contributing to this great drama, but their efforts would mean little without such a gripping script that constantly challenges your assumptions about one of the characters. It is programs like these that restore faith in the drama of television while making it almost impossible to settle for most of the garbage that increasingly fills the airwaves.
