What can one say about a film that has one of the blackest, nihilistic, and sometimes strangest - I will not say "sympathetic". I will say "charismatic" baddies in the history of cinema and the best sword fighting ever since Flynn and Fairbanks were in their heyday? This is an epic about a stubborn, sometimes foolish, incredibly brave and honest man who fights tyranny for his honor and freedom. I loved it. John Hurt and Tim Roth were great bad guys. Jessica Lange was very moving, tender and sensual.
