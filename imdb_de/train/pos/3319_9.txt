As a longtime Red Sox fan, I just had to watch the movie. It was great! Although there is never enough live material from the 2004 season of the Wonder Red Sox, there were great recordings of some of my favorite Red Sox players. While the movie is definitely a chick movie, it has enough baseball footage from the awesome 2004 Red Sox comeback to make it one of my top 10 films of all time. I especially enjoyed the Red Sox fans who were part of Ben's baseball family. The scene in which Ben meets with his buddies on the day of the convocation to determine who can sit down for certain games is hilarious! A must if you are looking for a healthy movie that you can see along with your partner, date or other important person ... especially if you are a baseball fan ... and especially if you are a Red Sox Fan are !!!
