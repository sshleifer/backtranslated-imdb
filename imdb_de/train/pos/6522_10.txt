During the entire Pirates of the Caribbean Trilogy Craze, Paramount Pictures really dropped the ball in restoring Anthony Quinn's directed director Cecil B. DeMille and got him on DVD and Blu Ray with all the extras. It is obvious to me that Paramount Pictures execs are blind as bats and do not know that they have a really good pirate movie about a real pirate who actually lived in New Orleans, Louisiana, which was once supposed to help The Crescent City become famous again for his pirate connections. When the Execs at Paramount finally come with the program and release this movie in digital format, I'll be a happy camper. Paramount Pictures It's up to you to leave your duff and get this movie restored!
