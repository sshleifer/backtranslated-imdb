I saw something of this concert on public television and knew that I had to have it. The guys give everyone at the Royal Albert an outstanding, often exciting performance that is complete in every way. Also, no synth, no smoky lasers and strobes, no grand entrance (and an amazing, serious and grateful crowd, all of whom left their bottle rockets at home) are a cream fan (or if you've only heard of it); if you are a blues fan; if you are a rock'n'roll fan; You will not be disappointed if you watch and listen to this DVD. You will never lose this DVD either because you never give it to others. (This DVD justifies selfishness, tell them to get it for themselves!) It's too good and too often playable. You want to keep it within reach.
