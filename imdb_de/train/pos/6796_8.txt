Zodiac Killer (2005) was an interesting film by German-born director Ulli Lommel. He is a director, producer and co-star in this latest production. He not only manages to make an interesting film about cheap. He reaches a new low point, however, when Mr. Lommel works almost with his film catalog of film material. I have seen excerpts from Boogeyman I and II, War Birds, Tenderness of the Wolf, Brain Waves, and Cocaine Cowboys (even Andy Warhol makes a cameo beyond the tomb.) Although he uses a lot of old footage, he handles them well (and I want to be very creative The film follows a young man copying the original Zodiac killer, and he also corresponded with a writer (Ulli Lommel), who originally wrote about the serial killer in the late sixties and early seventies, the friend of the writer (David Hess Will this author help him find that wannabe zodiac, can this killer be stopped, will the author put two and two together and reclaim some of his old glory, is David Hess still the man, find out for yourself and the Zodiac killer? <br /> <br /> This movie is NOT about the original Zodiac killer, I also heard that people were there moan over that this movie was shot on video. So what. The old artistic style of the director outshines the fact that he was shot on video. My only complaint was the excessive use of footage from Mr. Lommel's earlier films (but I understand why "winking" "winks".) Do not believe the hype. This is a scary street-level horror movie. As the disclaimer in the initial states says, this movie does not glorify murder. You should like this statement. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended for Ulli Lommel fans.
