Aug 1, 2009 - 7 out of 10 (Dir-Sidney Franklin): Well-narrated report on farmers in China and their rise and struggles with what Mother Nature throws at them. This film is based on an award-winning novel and a chronicle of a family that begins with the son's arranged marriage with a slave. The film is a good job to keep your interest, despite the rather pounding performance of Paul Muni's lead role. It reports on Wong Long (the character played by Muni) and how he works the land, buys more land, eventually becomes very wealthy and then returns to the land where he originally started. The relationship between him and his wife, played by Luise Rainer, is (along with the country itself) the main thread of the story, and despite the obvious non-Chinese actors, the country and its people are doing pretty well. It's obvious that with his money, MGM has created a really good epic in an epoch where they could probably afford it. The scene with the grasshoppers is very well done and the rest of the movie looks really good, which justifies the Best Cinematography award at the Oscars this year. The definitive definition of an epic is what that story is, and it's pretty well done.
