Of the films of the young republic The Buccaneer (1958) is only a small number, because he is considered a fine film. Charleton Heston, with his portrayal of Old Hickory's defense of New Orleans with a ragtag force of militia, regulars and pirates, promised a reprieve. Wellington's brother-in-law invaded New Orleans. Andy Jackson had one day to put together a scratching force to defend the city behind hay bales. Charlton Heston projects Jackson's appalling presence and impressive command. Nevertheless, there are a few colorful comic reliefs. When the English lioness is about to jump off, asks a young, blond Voluteer from New Orleans: The Ruckus is about to start. <br /> <br /> The battle was imminent but not long. To form the British, they marched straight into a decaying American fire. In less than a few minutes, an attempt to retake lost North American territory had been thwarted. The fight scene in this movie takes a little longer than the actual battle itself. <br /> <br /> There are colorful side stories in this young volunteer's movie at his first dance to celebrate the victory.
