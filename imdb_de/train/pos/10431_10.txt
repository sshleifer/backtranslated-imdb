I'm not even sure what to say about this movie. It's one of just a few movies I've ever considered romantic. To try to discuss actions or performances or technical details about this film, Frank Zappa would be "like dance about architecture". It hits the nail exactly on the head, as it captures fleeting moments of life that move us and then run away from us, never to be experienced again. This seems like the movie the character version of Charlie Kaufman wanted to write in the movie adaptation. The end is open and ambiguous, no happy ending, just a mystery. No well-founded lessons for life, just some cool and intelligent kids exploring the ability to feel the most irrational and unrealistic feelings ... romantic love special lady and recommend it to a stranger ............ ....
