I had to give this movie a 10, simply because it did what so many movies thrown in front of black audiences did wrong. This movie did not contain any video whore stereotypes and also skipped the gangsters, rappers, and the evil language. It examined several relationships between doctors, African Americans and African Americans between men and women on a completely new and refreshing level. I was very impressed by the cautious mix of reckless humor and some pretty hard and heavy topics. The movie will make you feel happy and sad at the same time. I also saw it at the Boston Film Festival. It premiered at the AMC Loews in Boston and I really hope that this movie will make it accessible to a much larger audience. Black people (and EVERYONE else) would love a movie that way - if only the industry were SMART enough to put them out there! , a premedical student, married to a doctor, a sibling, a family doctor or a large doctor's office - they would love this movie as well. It portrayed the residence and practice in a lifelike way that was greatly appreciated by doctors, residents, and medical students who watched the movie. Dennis Cooper is completely in internal medicine, so he definitely applied his knowledge / experience to the film and that's obvious.
