Fortunately, I did not know anything about this movie and was curious enough to get it from TV. And then the tape went off just five minutes before the end! <br /> <br /> But I am glad that I got most of it, because this is a really great spy movie. There are the usual toy submarines and a bit foggy plans, but also very daunting and even daring moments. Considering the year of production in 1969, certain slight lesbian overtones must have raised a few eyebrows. Of course, it does not surprise anyone now, and these scenes look pretty nice. And not just because of the two George actresses. <br /> <br /> The gas attack seems to hit every viewer very hard, no wonder, and he certainly hit me. Very effective. Also, the perspectives from both sides of the opponents give the whole story more depth with the usual tension and action. This is not only a heroic war story of a victorious side, but shows what is behind the victory in good and evil. Well, a war is usually bad. <br /> <br /> This is also a must for the fans of the composer Ennio Morricone. His work is always excellent, touching, but never exaggerated. And I think I have to try to catch more films with Suzy Kendall. Talk about Miss! Let's hope they will get this on DVD soon, so I can have the entire movie in my collection and get more people familiar with this very little-known gem.
