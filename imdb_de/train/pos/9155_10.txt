Whoever invented a story is a sick person. I rented it for our sleep party and all six of us were totally nuts because we're all in a drama class together, and we know some actors from the class. Apart from everyone screaming the whole crazy night, I had crazy nightmares. I always thought, oh my god, when I get up to go to the bathroom to pee, I'm stabbed in the middle of the wipe or something. I could not even go to the bathroom because we saw this gruesome horror movie. I thought too, why are all the girls in this movie topless, but we do not have any of the youth units? You should make a horror movie in which the killer is a girl and chops off units. I would watch that over and over again. Call it hard or soft or something stupid. I only give this movie a 9 because you quit me.
