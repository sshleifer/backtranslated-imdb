I have copies of these two films, the classic, in which Robert Blake is a powerful good actor. Most of the 1967 film showing Blake is shown on a window in prison, where he tells his childhood life where he's doing, because he did not kill the clutter family. Show a lot of that in the classic What really happened, and do not tell us which one really did the murder, but it's a great eye-catcher when you see the 1996 movie In Cold Blood, the classic makes a lot more sense.
