They wait to see if the remake is better or worse. I rated the Audie Murphy movie a 3 (I'm a tough student), the second lowest I've ever given to Audie (the worst being "Battle at Bloody Beach" if you're curious). I rate this movie as "8" (and I'm a tough student). It is the story of the civil war of renegade "soldiers", if you want to call them against the North. People like Quantrell and the men who drove these outlaws. <br /> <br /> The original was a watery version, cut very clean, while still representing the horror of what these men have done. In fact, movies like the older version are best viewed by a mature audience that can tell the story. I would rather rate the original "R" and this, with its rugged nature, a GP, because the newer movie gives a very honest version, a message that is more easily decoded by a teenager than the older version. <Br /> <br /> filmmakers have praised "realism" since the early sixties, but few deliver. Instead, they only recreate the dreary landscapes, drab costumes, and dreary events, but with comic cardboard stereotypes of cardboard, the weaknesses of the spaghetti era are the case. Modern filmmakers have recognized this mistake. It's obviously in a superior Western style that we normally see today. This movie is an example. There are the realistic attitudes, but also characters that we believe exist in this era. <br /> <br /> It has a few lulls, which makes a complete sit-down a little hard, and there are some inexplicable situations. But inexplicable situations are fine as long as the entire movie lasts and the characters are intriguing enough. <br /> <br /> It starts a bit without a fight, but it really improves. The main character is one we can identify and at least have some sympathy. The character of Audie Murphy's early film really does not evoke any sympathy and is too self-righteous without motivation. <br /> <br /> The character in this film follows the lines of a true antihero. There is motivation and a method to his madness. We never feel that he is really "right", but we can understand where he comes from. <br /> <br /> The movie has a lot of action. There is also some humor. A good scene is when the heroine tells the hero that she would not lie to him, and he thinks about it. <br /> <br /> This film manages to do what filmmakers have been trying for decades. This director and writer team has done everything right. <br /> <br /> Recommended. Complete success.
