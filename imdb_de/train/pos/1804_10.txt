First and foremost, as a child, I've never been afraid of this underrated gem ("Little Mermaid" on the other side ...). As my title says, this was one of my favorite children's films that I still love as a teenager. It's a beautiful, bittersweet movie about a German Shepherd named Charlie (fantastically voiced by Burt Reynolds) killed by his boss / partner in crime (name ha, ha is Carface). By default, Charlie is sent straight to heaven because "all dogs go to heaven because dogs, unlike humans, are naturally good and loyal and friendly." Chalie is sent back to Earth for raising his life clock, where he's in even more nonsense with his best friend, Itchy, and a small orphan, Anne-Marie. I have seen this as a child all the time and sometimes I still see it. Anyway, it's a beautiful bittersweet movie, as I said, that may leave a tear in your eye ...
