Everyone has already commented on the cinematography (good to great), the personalities (greater than life) and the structure (chronologically with many references to surf culture through time). What we miss is a bigger question of sociological importance: to channel American mainstream culture to something more fulfilling and rewarding. I was a surfer in the 70s. We watched 16mm films at the local high schools in SoCal. I remember the great feeling of surfing all day, until my skin radiated warmth, put on a Hawaiian shirt and shorts, and watched the latest surf movie in the evenings. The narrator was often the filmmaker himself and read a script of paper sheets. Sometimes a surf band or proto-punk band would add music. I was never happier. Apart from the screaming and roaring, seeing 'Riding Giants' took me back in time. <br /> <br /> It also increased the feeling of living on the sidelines without having to worry about the money and climbing in the social and business ladder, not keeping up with the Joneses, physically and mentally for themselves may be the answer to the question, "What is the purpose of life?" At least for those like Greg Noll, Laird Hamilton and the like, they seem to have found something few of us are brave or honest enough to pursue ourselves: to live life according to our own ideas. Maybe the society broke apart when we all did exactly what we wanted in life, but it's wonderful to see people who actually live their dreams. <br /> <br /> It was this message that really impressed me.
