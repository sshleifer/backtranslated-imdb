This movie surprised me. Some things were "clich√©" and some technological elements reminded me of the movie "Enemy of the State" starring Will Smith. But mostly entertaining - good mix with Jamie Foxx and comedian Mike Epps and the 2 would-be thugs Julio and Ramundo (who offer some comic relief). This is a movie you can watch again ... on a Wednesday night, if nothing else works. I gave it 9 for the entertainment value.
