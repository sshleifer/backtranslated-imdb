It was in 1988 when I saw "The Ronnie and Nancy Show" for the first time (on Austrian TV). At that time, I was already a big fan of Spitting Image (since he won the 1986 Bronzerose at the Montreux Film Festival). Of course I recorded every show on tape and watched it again and again - especially "The Ronnie and Nancy Show". I remember the scene when Ronnie stood in front of a painting by Abraham Lincoln (thought it was a mirror) and said to herself "I need a shave". Or most amusing when he played ball with his dog - but the other way round! <br /> <br /> It's a shame that Spitting Image seems to be forgotten; It was one of the most fantastic and intelligent TV programs ever. Compared to other satirical broadcasts, it was definitely the best of them all. <br /> <br /> Well, almost 20 years have passed since then, and I wish I could see the show again. Can you buy it from someone ... somewhere?
