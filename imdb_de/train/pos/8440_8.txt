This is the last episode we deserve. At the end of last season things were in a 'life goes on' mood, which was hardly the post-production that had earned this realistic series. Although this is not a happy show, this series has always been one that makes you think (a rare thing on TV), and this is no exception. Is death justified by reasoning? "Is morality social or is society governed by the moral chosen by the few rulers?" "What is a just death and can it exist?" All these questions and more are asked each week by the authors of this show, and this is their final thesis. Fine acting, good writing, wonderful camera work, brilliant editing, clean direction. If you've seen the series and missed it on the first launch, then somehow grab a copy. If you've never seen the series as it ran, it will self-assert, but it can be hard to keep up with all the characters you refer to in its diverse past. For those of us who have been avid viewers of the series for the past two seasons, this is a very satisfying consideration.
