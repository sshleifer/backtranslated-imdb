"Foxes" is a serious look at the consequences of growing too fast in the 1980s. And unlike the teenage comedies that overshadowed it (Porky's, Fast Times at Ridgement High), the movie stays well against time. <br /> <br /> His topic of teenage fear is just as relevant today as it was 25 years ago and Jodie Foster and sk8er boi Scott Baio (do you remember him?) are leading a beautiful young cast that deserves to be viewed to become. The film follows four Southern California girls who move through a rootless existence of sex and drugs without parents. The teenagers spend their days in and out of school and their nights at parties, concerts or on the street. Rarely are they at home because the instant gratification is a pill, a party, or a boy. <br /> <br /> But rather than condemning them, the film is rather sympathetic, blames absentmindedly and does not bother adults because they force young people to grow up alone. And the charismatic cast can not be averse. <br /> <br /> The opening of the movie ?? a long and loving pan - sets the tone for the following. We see the girls at daybreak amidst the objects that define the teens of teens, from twinkies to a picture of a young John Travola, while Donna Sommers "On the Radio" stands underneath. <br /> <br /> From there the movie It picks up speed as the girls go to school and to life. Annie (runaway rocker Cherie Currie) is the wild kid who lives for the next party or pill. Deirdre (Kandice Straw) is the young crazy drama queen. Madge (Marlilyn Straw) is the shy girl over her head. And Foster is the one with the plan. It's her job to keep this crew together long enough to finish high school while keeping her divorced and desperate husband hunting for Sally Kellerman. <br /> <br /> It's an almost impossible job and ultimately Foster at failure. <br /> <br /> "Foxes" remains a pleasure despite its age. Obsolete hair, clothing and references to the Olympic skater Dorothy Hamill have done nothing to the film. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is simply breathtaking, with breathtaking filtered footage of the Los Angeles Basin at dawn, dusk and night. Giorgio Moroder adds an 80s soundtrack featuring Donna Summer and Janis Ian. <br /> <br /> The biggest disappointment of the film is that the young stars around Foster never broke out like the cast of "St. Elmo's Fire" (1985) or "Empire Records" (1995). "Foxes" shows why they should have. But maybe like Bowling for Soup's song "1985" they just hit a wall.
