Here's the skinny, it seems that this is a lot older than I thought. But it's cool anyway. The bike 'Mechs are cool and the story works for the most part. I hope there are some character issues that I hope will work out in Part 2. Not just the animation style, but several character designs. For example, all the girls in this movie look like LYN MINMAY of MACROSS. The 'Mechs are similar to MACROSS and the other characters. This is really not intended for small children; it has graphic violence, nudity and graphic sexual content. To make a long story short, I give this cool MACROSS knockoff 7 STARS.
