I love Ashley Judd and love her movies. Ruby <br /> <br /> in Paradise is one of her best. It's a very understated movie that you really need to see nearby to appreciate it. A story of a woman trying to do it on her own and surrendering to the temptations that would make her life easier. Some of her films like "Kiss The Girls" and "Time to Kill" were probably better at the box office and at the video rental. It was also very good movies <br /> <br />, but take your time and really look at Ruby
