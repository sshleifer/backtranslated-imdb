THE MATADOR (2005) *** Pierce Brosnan, Greg Kinnear, Hope Davis, Philip Baker Hall, Dylan Baker. Brosnan performs one of his best non-Bondian roles as a middle-aged murderer facing a midlife crisis while deploying in Mexico, where he befriends a square but likable American businessman (Kinnear to his most gracious person) and discovered that there is more life than death. Newbie filmmaker Richard Shepard makes a solid big-screen debut with a decidedly black comedy with a keen eye for visual detail and sophisticated dialogues and character development, making him a talented, fresh-wind comedian watching the formula twisted What is expected of his leads and allows Brosnan to bring out his ya-yas with devilish joy. A sleeper-gem hit.
