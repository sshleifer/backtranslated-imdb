The film is very comprehensive in what he is. He is always interested in looking back on childhood and growing up with such a bizarre father. If he gets through the tails of serial killing, you can not go wrong. The actual plot, the actual story and the essence of the movie is entertaining. It's a kind of story the director (Bill Paxton) used to do so much, and in that case, he really did a lot of it. <br /> <br /> From start to finish, you can expect more and more about what's going on and where the movie is going, and the creativity behind the story is first-rate. I felt like this movie was made exquisite from start to finish, and one of those rare jewels that seemed to be without boring breaks - the action flows neatly, fast and tight from one scene to the next. <br /> <br /> It shows how far people can go: to do such terrible things to their loved ones and to perform such acts of evil in the name of "God" if they are as disillusioned as this case. It is also sometimes interesting in its' twists and takes on the concept of morality as a whole. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's the kind of movie you can easily overlook, but I would advise you not to. And to watch this movie, it's well worth your time.
