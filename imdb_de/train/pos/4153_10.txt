That was a fantastic episode. I saw a clip of it on YouTube, and I swore that if it was ever to be shown on TV, it would stick me to the set to watch. I finally saw it with a friend of mine who happened to be gay, and we both cried in the end. This was a really well written, heartfelt episode of the forbidden love between two policemen who, I believe, really were "the lucky ones" in Coop's words. It's episodes like these that make Cold Case truly one of CBS's most intriguing and beloved works of televised spells. I'm looking forward to more episodes and a repeat of "Forever Blue" because I'll see it over and over again.
