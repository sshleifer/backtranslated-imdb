David Burton (Richard Chamberlain, pretty good) is a lawyer who knows the taxation of companies (and suffers from unusual dreams that bother him to see this dark-shrouded native) who is being asked to report a case a group of Aboriginal people accused of murdering one of their own names, Billy. We see that he tries to steal stones with ritual painting and is killed when a leader of a Native American tribe named Charlie (Nandjiwarra Amagula) uses a "death bones". to stop his heart Meanwhile, bizarre weather patterns that revolve around David turn on Sydney, such as. Rain conquering polluted dirt and rock-hail in bright blue skies (with no sight of clouds, such as one striking a school in Central Australia). Not to mention, a "deformed" rainbow, which is divided into groups (!). As David pursues the case, he finds that he is far closer to the strange events than he could ever realize. A native named Chris (David Gulpilil) appears to him in a dream with a bloody stone and realizes that this man is one of those he should represent at the trial! After some weird conversations with Charlie and talking to Chris, it's quite possible that he can be very well associated with a ghost called Mulkurul, and that his dreams are actually hunches about possible upcoming horrors. <br /> <br The absorbing apocalyptic drama builds its history methodically and is totally original and unpredictable. With Peter Weir, the film is visually intriguing as we see these very overwhelming images of a possible demise of civilization, but the compelling angle of the film is certainly David's journey to this monumental truth that plagues him as he asks countless questions to Charlie and Chris. First, to help his men get out of a crime they did not commit, and finally to figure out what to do with disasters that might happen or occur later.
