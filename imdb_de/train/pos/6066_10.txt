When I saw this movie for the first time, it was a long time ago on VHS video. I liked this movie because it was funny and exciting. Several years ago I saw another movie called: * Andy Colby's Unbelievable Adventure * Parts of * Wizards of the Lost Kingdom * were used in this movie. They called this movie "KOR the Conqueror". I searched for the "KOR" movie for many years because I wanted to see the full movie, not just the parts used in the * Andy Colby * movie. No business could rent this kor movie and no business knew this movie. I've seen my old VHS cassettes at home for many years, and what a miracle ... I had this movie for many years still at home, but the film had a different title because in Germany 3 or Has 4 titles. I was glad to find this tape at home, and this time I had much more time to see * KOR the Conquerer again. The music is great throughout the movie, but the best thing about filming in combination with the music is this moment when KOR walks drunk through the green forest. The music in the background had a kind of magic. I like Bo Svenson and also the boy who played Simon in the movie. Both did their job very well. Manfred Kraatz, 26.10.2004.
