This movie is a riot. I can not remember the last time I had such a great time in the cinema. I have seen a few good comedies in my time that are usually pretty funny. But this is a great line. I think Best in Show is the last movie where I laugh so much and so much. The film was uninterrupted until the end, when the five minutes of sentimental conspiracy were cleared up. Apart from that, it is a constant barrage of deposits and stupid situations. I'd like to see it again before it leaves the theater, because this is like the sugar movies where you do not get all the jokes the first time around. You have to see it two or three times to get it all. <br /> <br /> As for the actual movie, he might have used a better cut, he is sometimes choppy, but we must forgive that. All characters are great. It's not like being in an Adam Sandler movie where he's trying to be funny, and everyone else is suffering around him and being a joke. I think I will remember all the main characters for a long time, because they are all so nice. No victims in this movie. Thankfully, there was also a 45-year-old actress who played his girlfriend. Catherine Keener plays her and she is a sweetheart in this movie. They only wish that women like them really exist. She is not a "10" like some of the other leading actresses, but somehow her smile is warmer than Julia Roberts exaggerated overbite. <br /> <br /> If you see the trailer for this movie, you might not think about it too much. I assure you that the trailer does not do it justice. They do not give away all good jokes. Only a few mediocre. <br /> <br /> Oh and something else. I hope critics put this on their top ten list. Many of them complain that comedies do not get the recognition they deserve and then do not put them on their list at the end of the year. That means you Ebert !!!
