Surprisingly well done for an independent film, An Insomniac's Nightmare paints a stunning picture of what it would be like to suffer from insomnia. Wonderfully well written and staged, it creates the atmosphere of a dream while the viewer is led through a night in the life of an insomnia. With Dominic Monaghan as Jack we play everything he sees as the long hours of a lonely night draw. The narrative is almost mesmerizing, and from the opening lines it is impossible to turn away. Fascinating and somewhat disconcerting, it shows how someone cope with lack of sleep and creates a balance between reason and madness. <br /> <br /> With twists and turns around every corner, An Insomniac's Nightmare is provocative and captivating. It is highly recommended.
