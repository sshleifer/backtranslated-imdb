This was the worst movie I have ever seen, but it was also the best movie. Sci Fi original movies are supposed to be bad, that's fun! The line "I like my dinosaur meat well!" is probably the best quote ever! The plot also sounds like something that comes from a dream created by a pot. I can imagine writers waking up after a long night and playing Dance Dance Revolution, then putting together ideas: Space Marines came to an alien planet infested with dinosaurs and having medieval houses in it. Protect a science team that protects the planet explored. Best idea ever! In fact, the complete Sci Fi original movie checklist: Rifles Dinosaurs Medieval Space travel terrible spectacle <br /> <br /> So watch this movie, but do not buy it.
