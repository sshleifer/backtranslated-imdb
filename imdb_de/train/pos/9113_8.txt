Probably the first Portuguese movie I've seen in my life, and I enjoyed it. The conspiracy refers to how the young army officers seized power in Portugal in 1974 in order to finally defeat the fascist government of Caetano and also to end the wars in the colonies. H. Mozambique, Angola and Guinea (Bissau) - Cape Vert. Most of the events shown in the film accurately reflect the behavior of the military and military who carried out the coup, the oppressed people who were very satisfied with this new development and freedom, the resistance of the men of Caetano and also in Italy a subtle way for most conservative officials, including Spinola, who took over the new president. The Portuguese revolution can be recalled because of the action of several young officers, but the most interesting part of the film for me was when the young captain declared that Portugal should develop democratically, and that reached or did so a few years after the coup Revolution. The film also shows that the officers and soldiers never wanted to kill anyone; Even the worst enemies were respected in the end.
