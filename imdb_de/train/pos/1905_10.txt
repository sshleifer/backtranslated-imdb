Simply the funniest and most brilliant movie comedy ever ... definitely on my personal top ten list. He also gets a solid ten on the ballot. The heir to the millionaire, Arthur Bach (Moore), is a middle-aged "child" who refuses to go the long way in life, avoiding all the necessary responsibilities. He also refuses to leave the bottle. One day he goes shopping with his personal butler Hobson (Gielgud) at Bergdorf Goodman and meets the little mercenary Linda (Minnelli). Arthur and Linda's chemistry adds electricity to the rest of the movie. There are many funny set pieces. In one such scene, Arthur (most of the time drunk all over the story) knocks on the wrong front door and is threatened by a human "siren" ("My husband has a gun !!!!)." Appearances of all involved should be duly noted: Geraldine Fitzgerald plays Arthur's loving but ruthless grandmother, Sir John Gielgud steals almost the entire show with his sour drollisms (he took home the Oscar for it), and Christopher Cross delivers the song Main Theme (Oscar winner) "The Best What you can do ") It is a shame that Dudley Moore passed away last month (March 2002).
