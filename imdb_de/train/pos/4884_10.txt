For persons of a certain age, W.W. II was the crucial time of her life, and whatever followed, could never compare. When the film opens, a recently widowed but still vivacious woman (Judi Dench) listens to a street musician who playfully tries to play the classic song "Stardust" almost all girl bands who have talked between bombing raids during the war. The drummer Patrick (Ian Holm) avoided the design happily and enjoyed the ladies. <br/> <br /> Patrick and Dench meet and decide to reunite the band, leading them to a series of mini-adventures. Despite ups and downs, the band meets again and makes a successful reappearance. <br /> <br /> The film is exquisitely written and reserved, with outstanding performances from all involved. The characters are well-developed and all the people who have not stopped living despite their years. And here is all this glorious old swing music! <br /> <br /> This is not the pontification of Steven Spielberg, but it's still a serious movie. The war affected everyone and this lesson is not forgotten in a movie that is not afraid to entertain as he teaches.
