When I first started watching this anime, I never thought that anything could be interesting about making bread, but luckily I was wrong. From the moment I started incorporating the anime into the world of bread baking, I was addicted. <br /> <br /> The biggest advantage of this anime is the humor, which is very intelligent and very funny, with some recurring gags. But the animation, the soundtrack, and the character development are below average, while these drawbacks are not so apparent in the first few episodes. Because of the great work on this anime, they really show themselves in the last 20 episodes, when the reactions and recurring gags just get old and are not as funny anymore. <br /> <br /> If this anime had ended with Episode 52, I would have given it a 9, but the last episodes leave only a bitter aftertaste that the incredible 50 episodes unfortunately can not wash away. <br /> <br /> 7/10
