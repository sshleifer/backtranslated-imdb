Fred Olen Ray, Action, Horror, Sci-Fi, Exploitation Director shows he has talent as a director. Character actor William Smith is one of the best tough / bad guys in the industry. He treats the viewer with the best acting performance of his career. In terms of Randy Travis, he gives his best impression of Lee Van Cleef. He is not bad in the movie. Smith and Travis make the movie. As far as the rest of the cast is concerned, none of them really stands out. Ray did a great job directing, Smith and Travis were good, I would give this B-Western a seven on a scale of one to ten (ten is the best).
