David Duchovny plays the lead role in this movie. Well, many people who found out that this fact was found out would not even bother to look at it. Dr. Eugene Sands (Duchovny) is a drug-addicted doctor who missed a stroke for misconduct. In a pure accident, he becomes private physician of the criminal millionaire Raymond Blossom. However, the FBI is interested in catching Eugene with Blossom. Angelina Jolie is played in the supporting role of Clare-the Gangsters minor. It does a solid job. Timothy Hutton, who plays Blossom, is great and dives deep into his character. Duchovny himself is not as bad as many people would think, and in the end I would rate his performance as credible. His familiar, monotonous tone and his clear face are present, but not distracting too much from the film
