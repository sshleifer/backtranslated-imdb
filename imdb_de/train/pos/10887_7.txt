A horror movie is being shot and things are not going well. It's about a masked killer. The director tells the killer before the cast and the crew. He goes crazy and kills two people. He killed himself and the movie is never finished. Twelve years later, some film students decide to end it - but there is a curse. People who try to stop it are killed themselves. The students ignore this. Guess what happens next? <br /> <br /> The plot is old hat, but that's not bad ... for what it is (a low-budget Slasher movie). It's well done with a young and pretty talented young cast. Nobody is great, but nobody is terrible either. It also avoids the obligatory (and unnecessary) female nude scenes. It moves fast, the blood is beautiful and bloody and the script does not insult your intelligence. Molly Ringwald also plays the time of her life during this time and plays a darn daredevil actress. <br /> <br /> No big shakes, but not bad at all. I give a 7.
