I spied this short on a DVD of the best New Zealand short films, all great, but the French Doors were amazing. It starts slowly and you wonder if anything is going to happen. Just as you relax in the buzz of renovating the house, the scariest happens. <br /> <br /> EEEEkkk, I wanted to stop watching, but I was stuck. <br /> <br /> The films plunge into the original fear of the dark and with little, if not special effects. It shivers down to your bones. A simple but ingenious concept opened all these memories of my youth and did not dream of the most unlikely but most sinister situations. <br /> <br /> The visual style of the filmmaker is great and the main character leads you convincingly through the story. It's a quality that I have not seen for some time. <br /> <br /> The French Doors has all the features of a great feature, but it ends after about ten minutes. A great ending that invites you to want to know more. <br /> <br /> We really liked it and thanks for the ride. These New Zealanders really show the talent. <br /> <br /> A new fan.
