Paul Hennessy and his wife Cate have to deal with their two teenage daughters and their comic son ... But after the early death of John Ritter, the show was more about dealing with the loss of a loved one ... < br /> <I found this show when I walked through the canals one afternoon and I have to say that I laugh myself until my ribs hurt, just with the different characters. the funny lines and the situation in which Paul was mainly concerned with his daughters ... From then on, I started the rest of the show when I was free and I have to say the writing was very good. But then I read about John Knight's death ... Shortly afterwards I saw "Goodbye" Part 2 and I have to say that I was almost in tears, watching the emotions of the characters, losing a loved one ... Like Rory, a wall in Anger and frustration beats. How Cate is busy sleeping alone in her bed .... Briget and Kerry talk about what they should have done. <br /> <br /> But the show goes on and brings Jim Egan and CJ Barnes, who make great laughs when Cate's father tries to protect his family and talk to Rory about "man talk" ... But the real thing Gem is CJ ..., who is absolutely funny as a wild cousin. <br /> <br /> It will always be John Ritter's masterpiece.
