While the Christmas party has evolved over the years, whether focusing on religious or secular traditions, it is a time when people should behave a little better. Somehow the Ebenezer Scrooge, merchant and money lender, passed by in the 19th century in London. <br /> <br /> As his nephew points out to his uncle, he does not hold Christmas in any way, because Scrooge feels the whole thing is humbug Humanity in Scrooge was expelled long ago, it is a serious case, much like his 20th-century counterpart, Mr. Potter of Bedford Falls, New York. <br /> <br /> But as Charles Dickens told this story, salvation is not too late for one of us, and a lonely ghost and three ghosts visit Scrooge and show him how. <br /> <br /> A Christmas carol is such a timeless holiday classic that we sometimes forget it's so much 19th-century social commentary Britain was as Oliver Twist. The characters in this film are middle and lower classes. The Cratchits are a few sprouts above the street people in Oliver Twist, but they have to fight to stay up there. Love and happiness still radiate their homes, no, thanks for the man Bob Cratchit works for. <br /> <br /> Like George Bailey, who did a lot of good in his life and just needed to be reminded how much Ebenezer Scrooge needed a wake-up call on the potential he still had for something good. Old World. <br /> <br /> Patrick Stewart has quite taken on the role of Scrooge in his live performances and feature films. But George C. Scott catches the old miser in this movie pretty well. The vulgarity of him, but with a trace of sadness that makes us root to change. Scott has a good tradition of people like Reginald Owen and Alastair Sim, both of whom have done great interpretations of Scrooge. <br /> <br /> Among the supporting roles, I especially like David Warner as Bob Cratchit and Edward Woodward as a hearty and passionate person enjoyed the strict spirit of the Christmas present. <br /> <br /> According to IMDb, this is one of 32 versions of A Christmas Carol they have archived, and it's one of the best.
