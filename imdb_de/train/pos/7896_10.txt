This is an EXCELLENT example of Bette Davis' early talent. Production is above average for the 1936 period. I can not understand why the owners of the rights to this movie did not put him on DVD. Owner, please let go. I would buy it immediately. I have not watched it on TV for over thirty years, but I remember it well.
