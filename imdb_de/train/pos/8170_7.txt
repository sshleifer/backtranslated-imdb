As if most people in dentistry were not a bit nervous, you will surely be paranoid in this little movie. A successful dental hygienist watches as his wife has gone to the pool man (on her anniversary of all days!) And gets into an angry collapse. After shooting down the head of a fighting dog, he strolls to work and ends up with the aggression in the marriage, while he plans what he should do with his "slut" a woman. There are many close-ups of mouth bumping, tongue cutting and caressing the beauty queen as well as an amazingly disturbed performance by Corbin Bernsen. The scene in which he tied up and drank his wife out of the merciless ripping of his wife is definitely hard to observe. A dentist is absolutely the wrong person to move away from the deep end, and this movie explains that in detail. "The Dentist" is incredibly entertaining, fast and sometimes ridiculous. Listen!
