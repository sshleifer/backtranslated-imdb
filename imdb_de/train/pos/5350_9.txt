I have seen The Running Man several times as I am a Stephen King fan and have all his films, but now it's even better because I did not know about this website until two days ago and did not know that the Paul Michael Glaser who was involved in this film was the same Paul Michael Glaser that I grew up with in the television series Starsky and Hutch. For me, that's a pleasant surprise, because I can not say how many times I cried when Starsky or Hutch got hurt. The episode where Starsky (Kill Starsky) almost died, cried so much that my father had to turn away from the show. What do you expect from a child of 12 years old? Now I'm deliberately looking for movies and programs involving Paul or David Soul, and everything Stephen King has in his hand. I am so there! I just have to say happy birthday Paul!
