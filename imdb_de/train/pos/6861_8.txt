When you compare what Brian De Palma did in the 1980s with what is used as entertainment today, his films always look better. "Dressed To Kill", "Blow Out", "Body Double", "Scarface" and "Carlito's Way" are all excellent works of a cinematic craftsman at the height of his abilities. The guy had a long line of above-average movies. This is a pure Hitchcock with a '80s splash of lurid perversion, a lovingly narrated story of lust and murder with lots of twists, powerful stylistic devices, a stunning Pino Donaggio score, and a storyline inspired by trash that inspires camerawork and lush, blood-smeared images Helping to overcome the logical gaps, while Dennis Franz, Keith Gordon (himself a good director), Nancy Allen (at the time De Palmas wife) and Michael Caine all impress Let the virtuoso on a surreal, scary, erotic charged Odyssey hijack and enjoy every frame of "Dressed To Kill".
