I could see that this movie is awesome. He did not surprise himself, as it was for the truth, in this way by himself, like escaping to the one who did not have the place, but it's just a conspiratorial theory. Right? <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed watching this movie when I was the kid. I'm interesting, what if it turned out that such a flight actually took place, certainly not for a belief because it denies logic and common sense. Anyone who is healthy has sent children on space shuttle into orbit. I like to read for the topic, American and Soviet space programs. I know that some space shuttle missions were provided by the CIA with the TOP SECRET clause. Sure, these are just such deviations, but who knows?
