As much as I enjoyed the films of Hanzo the Razor, three are definitely enough: "Who's Got The Gold?", The last adventure for the Japanese lawyer with the impressive package is a rather enjoyable piece of the Pinku Cinema, but offers little New In terms of ideas as they take a big step back when it comes to outrage. <br /> <br /> The film begins with the appearance of a female mind and looks like it could explore supernatural territory, the series could take an interesting new direction; Unfortunately, after the spook has boiled up as nothing more than a Scooby Doo style (a corrupt finance minister who wants to keep people away from the lake where he's stealing stolen gold), director Yoshio Inoue is pleased to reuse familiar elements In both films, the result was pretty stale. <br /> <br /> Once again, Hanzo conducts an investigation that asks him to interrogate women with the help of his powerful penis, to chop up his enemies and to mistreat his superiors. On the way, we get wild orgies, good-natured rape (Hanzo forces himself Women who appreciate his stubbornness) and bloody swordfights. <br /> <br /> If you've already seen and appreciated this In the first two films, you can also watch this series to complete the set, but be forewarned, this is probably the least satisfying of all. <br /> <br /> 6.5 out of 10, rounded to 7 for IMDb.
