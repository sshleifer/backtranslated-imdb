I just can not get over how great Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon are. It's as if the movie does not even need extra characters, as you can never tire of dialogue between these two. Lemmon has appeared in several well-known films such as Mr. Roberts and The Apartment and Matthau was fresh from his Oscar win for The Fortune Cookie (another Billy Wilder movie, also starring Lemmon). This movie was not as good as this because the story did not take so long (I think it was almost two hours). However, this lasts for an hour and a half, even though the introduction of the events that led to Lemmon and ended in Matthaus's apartment is a bit long (that was the sentence). This is a small mistake and you have a wonderful time for the rest of the runtime. <br /> <br /> I've already commented on how the follow-up to this movie is crappy and I will not go deeper into it. The reason this is such a pleasure is likely to be the movie was made when the innocence of American films quickly fell into oblivion. There are some sexual cues, but they are treated so innocently that you can not even get a "well, I can never ..." from the prudiest person out there. It's kind of fun to watch a movie from a long lost time, and so the sequel probably did not work because you had Matthau and Lemmon saying some F-words, and that just does not suit them. Of course, both are gone now and you can just be glad that you can still enjoy them in such a wonderful movie. I think the only male actor in this movie who is still alive is John Fiedler. Edelman died recently. So there you are. Simply one of the best comedies and films of all time. <br /> <br /> Add: I have recently learned that John Fiedler has died, so all his fans are very sorry. I did not mean any disrespect and I will try to be more careful next time what I am.
