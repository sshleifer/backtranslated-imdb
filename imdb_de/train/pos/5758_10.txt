In my opinion, this is one of the best action films of the 70s. Not only does it have a great cast but it's also full of wild shootouts and explosions that are still impressive today. The story is about a Vietnamese veterinarian (Kris Kristofferson) recruited by his brother (Jan-Michael Vincent) to help eliminate the criminal element in a small town, and what happens when Kris exploits his position and so on gets sick like the criminals he hired. It's great to see how Kris plays against the guy. Bernadette Peeters and Victoria Principal both support as the ladies of the two male stars. Jan-Michael shows real movie star personality in this movie. I do not think Vigilante Force is on video, but occasionally on TV. It's a great movie for guys who like movies.
