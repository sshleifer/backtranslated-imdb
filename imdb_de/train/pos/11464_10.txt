The most worrying thing about this movie is not that school murders like the one pictured actually happen, but the truth is that they are run by teenagers like Cal and Andre ... normal kids with normal families. By using a hand-held camera technique like Blair Witch, Ben Coccio manages to bring us into the lives of two friends who have high school issues, though we've never been told exactly what's behind those issues. They seem to be typical - many people hate high school, so what? Part of you just does not think he's going to do the very well thought-out massacre on Zero Day. The surveillance camera scenes at school during the shooting are therefore all the stronger. You can not believe that it really happened and that it really happened. The hand-held camera technique also creates the illusion that it is not a screenplay film, a brilliant idea given the topic.
