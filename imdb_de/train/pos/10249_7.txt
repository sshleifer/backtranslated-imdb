This is the first movie from the Guinea Pig series and one of the infamous films from the collection. <br /> <br /> It took me a long time to finally get a copy of this notorious group of films. I bought the Guinea Pig Box Set and decided to see the collection by order in order. So I got this jerk in and sat down. <br /> <br /> From what I read on the internet and the content contained in this film, I expected to test my nerves with all my might. This was not the case in the end. <br /> <br /> The film focuses on a group of men who kidnap a woman and begin to torture her with hope, to discover the breaking point of human beings, and how long a person can endure pain. <br /> <br /> Sounds like a sick streak? Not correct. The movie is not shocking. This may be because I've been desensitized to my obsession with horror over the years, but I think it's safe to say that any real Gorehound can easily go through this with people who are unfamiliar with this kind of movie, will most likely be overwhelmed and disgusted by the pictures they see on screen. Although it did not shock me, the film contains some pretty mean, violent and graphic scenes. Including the tearing of fingernails, thrown guts of an unconscious woman and a needle through the eye. Overall, I think that for the majority of Gorehounds on this board you should get a copy of this movie for the novelty, but I suggest that you apply to all new people who come to these movie types, should work his way up to this.
