"The Groove Tube" was one of only two Ken Shapiro films, the other was the equally crazy "Modern Problems". This is just a complete parody of television. Apart from Shapiro - apparently after "Modern Problems" apparently did nothing, the film also plays Chevy Chase and Henry Winkler's cousin Richard Belzer. The three actors (and some other people in smaller roles) appear in different sketches. One of the funniest is Chase in a Geritol Spoofing commercial in which he describes medicine as his wife stripped by his wife. There's also a pornographic news show, an irritating cooking show and the epic story of some drug dealers. <br /> <br /> In any case, the whole thing is just a shout. In my opinion, the top three TV spoofing films are those, plus "Tunnel Vision" and "Kentucky Fried Movie" (though I could include "The Truman Show" as well). Really funny. <br /> <br /> I wonder what happened to Ken Shapiro.
