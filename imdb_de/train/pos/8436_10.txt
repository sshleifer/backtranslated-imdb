This movie was not only better than the last season of H: LOTS. But it was better than any televised movie I've ever seen! <br /> <br /> If you look at the "Top 250", I see that only a small movie made it: how the Grinch stole Christmas. I think it is time to increase this group to 2. <br /> <br /> I admit that the original series had several shows that were better than these, but I did not mind. I loved to immerse myself in the world of the Baltimore homicide!
