This series could be the best Britcom ever, and that means a lot when you look at the competitors (Fawlty Towers, Good Neighbors, to name but two). <br /> <br /> What made Butterflies so superior, even Best of the Best, was that she not only exemplified great, classic, stylish and intelligent comedies, but also broadened the horizons and flawless, gentle and in every way Detail reflected the great social change that was emerging in the UK Time. <br /> <br /> I remember watching this show as a teenager and loved everything. The illustrated lifestyle was remarkable in itself. This was the first time I saw real people using cordless phones. And the wardrobe of all characters was a long way from the clothes of the 1970s, which were still so small in North America. Then there were the decors, shop fronts, cars. These people - even the worldly sons with their philosophical attitude to life and their epigrammatic humor - were highly developed. They were examples of the "New Europeans" who would affect life and style throughout the world over the next ten years (1980s). <br /> <br /> Of course, the premise was strange and fantastic. The idea that someone who lived the suburban dream could be so dissatisfied and unruly was revolutionary, especially for North Americans, for whom happiness was always defined as money and other things (though the situation was portrayed in American films and on television, however not with the intensity of butterflies or the movie Montenegro). And if the premise was not surprising enough, the means by which they were expressed were extreme. A potential affair that was not really about sex or even romance? Butterflies have dazzled many, but it must have conjured up a few people who have nibbled their brows in disbelief ... at the time. <br /> <br /> Butterflies proved to be prophetic in many ways. It documented before his time - postmodern boredom, all-pervading lifestyles, the notion of emotional infidelity and generational disruption, and male dissatisfaction (perfectly represented by tense father-son relationships). It is a pity that this series has not been rediscovered on a large scale, and all participants have been recognized for having created a meaningful snapshot of a particular time and place, anticipating all the slipperiness and fear.
