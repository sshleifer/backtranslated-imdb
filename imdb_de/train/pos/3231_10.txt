Soldier is not a great movie, and anyone who hated it has many good reasons. But I liked Soldier a lot, partly because my expectations were so low that what I saw surprised me. <br /> <br /> First, the art direction is tight and well executed. As for the sci-fi backdrops, Soldier has done things with more design than 90% of the genre. The sets, costumes and props were executed consistently and competently; I did not love all their future military style, but I was impressed with the effort. For me, the movie was worth the time it took to watch. <br /> <br /> Second, I'm a fan of Kurt Russell. I grew up with the guy in some of the most memorable movies of my youth ... The Barefoot Executive and his John Carpenter movies. Soldier is essentially an action movie, and the role of Sergeant Todd is an essential action hero. It's not an award-winning role, but Kurt has to show convincing emotions with VERY small dialogues. <br /> <br /> Third, the fight scenes and battles are well choreographed. This is not an iron monkey or even just the Matrix, but again it far exceeds the average quality in the genre. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen it and like sci-fi action movies, pick it up when you pass your rental deposit of your choice. Just do not expect the next Bladerunner.
