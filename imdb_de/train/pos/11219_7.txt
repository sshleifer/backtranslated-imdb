/ * light spoilers * / <br /> <br /> Long ago, before Evangelion was made, before Hideaki Anno was an idol and household name to many anime fans, and before Gainax reached fan favorite status, Gunbuster became made. With only Wings of Honneamise by Gainax at the time and the famous Otakon shorts or course, Gunbuster had some tough acts to follow. It has not been easier to find a genre that has been played countless times before in space opera. Fortunately, Gainax chose it as a six-part OAV (direct to video) series. This allows the series to have more latitude than would have been possible with a movie. This also prevents it from becoming too boring and too long, with many pointless battles and pens along the way. In addition, they have endeavored to stay clear of the tested space mechanics mechanisms used in Macross or Gundam and many other known space operas. <br /> <br /> On the one hand, the shows with Noriko start at the Okinawa High School for Mechapiloting. Noriko is the daughter of a respected ship's commander who died in the battle when she was a small child. This makes her life at the academy rather difficult as some of her classmates start to suspect that Noriko is favored by the professors. The first episode is pretty much a comedy drama, with a very close focus on the characters and the school setting. Things change quickly when the threat of an alien invasion is announced, and Noriko and Kazumi (the best girl in class) are selected to help the assembled fleet. <br /> <br /> The Gunbuster middle class leaves our female leadership space focused on personal drama and action. A few more characters will be introduced, and parts of Noriko's past will be raised again. Besides, the alien threat is getting closer by the minute, and the Gunbuster, the last human hope, is being presented. Okada was a clever writer who introduced the principles of time dilation to spice things up a bit. In short, time slows down for those traveling at the speed of light. This means that Noriko can be part of a war that takes nearly a century to complete. The dramatic aspect is further accentuated when Noriko returns to her base to meet her friends who are much older than her. Science may not be perfect, but it's fairly believable, even between the episodes in which Noriko, Kazumi, and their trainer give a brief description of the scientific principles used in the series, there are even a few short films for SD Science Theater / > <br /> The animation for a series from the 80s is definitely good. The designs are of course retro 80's style, but it has its charm. The animation is fluent enough and the character designs are nice, though the costumes betray some of the fascination of the fan service that Gainax will later take full advantage of. The mechas during the shows are also pretty cool, with Gunbuster as the ultimate killing machine, strong and powerful. The last episode was done completely in black and white. While it is generally accepted (but not confirmed) that this was done for budgetary reasons, it does give the series a very different atmosphere that is perfect for the second part. <br /> <br /> The music is very typical of the opera room. In some places too bombastic, very generic and definitely not worth buying. It fits mostly into the series, but can sometimes get pretty annoying. Tanaka is not really a famous composer, and the only other reputable series he worked on is Dragon Half. If you think of the 80s anime music, you know what to expect. <br /> <br /> As the series progresses, the focus slowly shifts from drama to space opera to epic battle, but so the viewer will hardly notice it. Step by step the drama will be weakened and the fights will go to the front row. However, none of the aspects is ever left out. With the last episode in sight, Noriko and the crew are fighting for the continued existence of humans, and with the final battle in sight, the audience will be presented with specific questions regarding the position of the human race in the galaxy and how far it can become self-preservation to guarantee. While they will never be answered later, they still offer some interesting food for thought. The last episode is very epic and has a nice, but quite predictable ending. Of course, not all ends should contain many unusual twists. Again, it fits into the series. <br /> <br /> Gunbuster sounds at first glance like an average Space Opera anime, with alien invasions, massive battles and some personal drama, and for the majority, this is the case. But it is exceptionally well made for a change. Instead of focusing on a steady mix of earlier elements that are six episodes long, Gunbuster presents us with a transition from a small drama to epic heroism. On the way, we meet some interesting and well-trained characters whose relationships are changing dramatically due to the phenomenon of time dilation. The show is very tightly written, although it tends to slip off in some places. Too dramatic events and cheesy mecha attacks could easily have been avoided. All in all, the journey Gunbuster takes on you is a very relaxed, sometimes sad, sometimes heroic one. It may not have destroyed the boundaries and boundaries of the space opera genre, but at least it bends it a bit. Very pleasant anime classic, but not without flaws. <br /> <br /> *** / *****
