Riding Giants <br /> <br /> This documentary follows the story of surfing and follows three other well-made and acclaimed surfer movies, Dana Brown's Endless Summer, his successor Endless Summer II by Bruce Brown, Dana's son and Step in Liquid (IMAX) , I saw the first, not the others. <br /> <br /> Although the surf material is spectacular, I have most appreciated the filmmaker's historical perspective. He takes us back to the origins of the sport nearly a hundred years ago and shows how it has developed into its present form. These include in-depth interviews with leading figures and performers, how surfboards have changed over time, which beaches in Hawaii and California have been the most visited by world-class surfers, and what incredible adrenaline rushes the sport has offered. The athletes lived for months on beaches, surfing from morning to night, camped on rudimentary plank beds, fished for food and went back to their boards the next day. What a euphoric way to spend your youthful days. <br /> <br /> We see the media discovering and promoting the sport after a slow start. What was the biggest boost to the sport? Believe it or not, it was the movie Gidget, though I suspect that copyright issues prevent the attention of beachboy's surf lilies like Surfer Girl and Surfing USA. The Surfing Magazine and the Encyclopedia of Surfing (known to have such a folder) are mentioned for their contributions. We also see comments from the pioneers of sport, their families, and how the present generation benefited from its founders in the 1960s. Such a story is, as 40-year-old Laird Hamilton, who is considered to be the biggest surfer today, who was associated with a previous leading surfer, introduced him to his single mother, whom he married before becoming his stepfather. <br /> <br /> A rousing musical background of contemporary music from all eras accompanies the story. Did I arouse your appetite? Wonderful ride!
