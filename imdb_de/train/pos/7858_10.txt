TESS OF THE STORM COUNTRY is possibly the best movie of Mary Pickford's films. At two hours it was quite long for a 1922 silent movie, but it keeps up your interest 80 years after its filming. Mary does one of her best performances, sometimes the role of "Greatest Hits" appears with bits of Mary, the innocent, Mary, the little devil, Mary, the little mother, Mary, the spitfire, Mary, the romantic heroine, etc. being used in a single movie in the past. The film is surprisingly open about an illegitimate child of a supportive character for 1922, and at some point our little Maria is questioned as the unmarried mother! If the Academy Awards had taken place in 1922, the year's best Oscar actress would undoubtedly have been Marys.
