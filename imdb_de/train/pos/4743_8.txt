This is a very strange HK movie in many ways. First, many action sequences are really no fun. The very first weapon in the movie was stupid. Not cool stupid or funny, just stupid. That does not mean that there are no great action scenes, but most just do not get to the level of some of the other movies I've seen. The other side is that this movie actually has characters, not just people. All main characters are interesting (with the exception of the head villain who is flat like a pool table) and most are pretty well played. All protagonists in this movie are just fun. The dialogue is quite funny and does not seem to lose much in translation. This movie is worth watching, but I hope the American audience is not the best HK has to offer.
