This is the second part of 'The Animatrix', a collection of animated short films that tell us something about the world of 'The Matrix' not working and living together. It's a little history lesson in the world of 'The Matrix'. Not as good as the first part ('The Last Flight of the Osiris'), but still quite entertaining.
