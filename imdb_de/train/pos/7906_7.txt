Gus Van Sant has made some great films. I'm really a fan. <br /> <br /> However, I can not help feeling that the edge of the Tom Robbins book "Even Cowgirls Get the Blues" is lost in translation to the big screen. Tom Robbins and Gus Van Sant alone are incredible visionaries and talents. In the end, it just did not work. <br /> <br /> It was not that the characters were not well developed or the storyline and content did not come alive. It's just that our ideas are much more powerful at reading such a book. We are taken to another time and place, and sometimes we think the worst and / or the best, and this contributes to the roller coaster of the book as a whole, if it unfolds properly according to the author's accuracy. However, films can leave an impression where the roller coaster's imagination and sense of emotion are less distracting from the overall experience. I think that happened here. <br /> <br /> I suggest you read the book!
