Hardly a masterpiece. Not so well written. I can not find a nice cinematography. This movie was not that bad, but it was not much better than average. The main story, dealing with very immoral teenagers, should focus more on the forbidden romance and why this was so ... should really have been tricked, rather than basically scratching the surface with "because mom says we can not". Some parts should have been completely dropped or reworked to add more importance to the plight of the two main characters. A few times I wondered if the writer / director was a fan of George Lucas's classic American graffiti. It's not wrong to be a fan of this movie, but to make your movie look like that, I mean, come on! The worst part was that girl Amick had such a small part. She was the only one or two lines that actually tried a southern accent. (Listen, it was there even though her character came from California! DOH !!) If she was the star, others might have followed and we'd have had a more authentic movie. Well, what can you do if you have a director who is just a director and not an artist? Too bad. All in all, I give a B- and that's a bit generous because I'm partial to Mrs. Amick.
