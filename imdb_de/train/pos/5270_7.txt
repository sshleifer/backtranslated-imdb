This movie may be really bad, but it's a lot of fun. The bad acting and the bad orientation reinforce the hystericity of the film. The twins are very funny in their Conanesque roles. If you go into this movie with the first Conan or Excalibur, you will hate him. If you see it in a good mood and accept it as good, silly fun, you will have a good time. Pay attention to the scene in which they try to hang the brothers, the funniest scene in the movie. I wish Mystery Science Theater 3000 had done that !!
