If it came out, the movie looks good now and sounds great. A celebration of intelligent, thoughtful acting, by Gielgud, Kenneth Haigh, Harry Andrews and especially Anton Walbrook, and a moving central performance by the beautiful and incredibly young Jean Seberg. Preminger does not jump around and does not show himself - his long, slow steps encourage you to listen and think, and Graham Greene's script condenses Shaw, without compromising complexity, the worse. Too many contemporary films on "historical" topics can not resist. What would Mel Gibson have done with the damsel? Probably many drooling shots of her on the stand, then crunchy on the grill as the flames reach out. Preminger does not do that. The burning is mainly shown by a guilt reaction. There are some weak achievements, but not enough to cause serious harm. I saw this movie on TV and did not expect to go through it, but I was stuck. In our time of religious fundamentalism and sacrifice, Joan's story has an unexpected resonance.
