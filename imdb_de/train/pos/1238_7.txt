While this film has many shortcomings, it is actually a funny movie from the 80s. Eddie Murphy has a climax here in his 80s. While his character is indistinguishable from previous films, his timing with perfect partners and slides is almost flawless. <br /> <br /> Combining this with the hypnotic beauty of Charlotte Lewis makes for a fun rainy day action comedy movie. <br /> <br />
