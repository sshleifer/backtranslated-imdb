I claim that the one who is ultimately responsible for creating / approving the trailer for this movie is completely flawed. No one I knew wanted to see this movie based on the previews, and EVERYONE who really saw him (and knows I know him) absolutely loved him ... The ad campaign is shame / disaster / bug # 4 past ... <br /> <br /> # 1 rush hour, which I have not seen, average IMDb rating of 7.4. <br /> <br /> # 2-The Bourn Ultimatum I've seen a great movie, but the third week, an average IMDb score of 8.7 (I'd say) IMDb rating by 8.1 (in my opinion a bit high). <br /> <br /> # 4-Stardust, average IMDb rating of 8.4 (lower than Bourn, but that was 3 weeks long). Whether it was bad scheduling or bad advertising, I think the forces behind this movie were a big time! This should be advertised as an amazing movie that happens to be a fantasy / fairy tale and not just another fairy tale? Too bad: (Anyway - now that I've played around very pointless ... Great movie, look at it!
