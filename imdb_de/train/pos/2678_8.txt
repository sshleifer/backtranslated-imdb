Hey, I can not say I've seen all of Jesse's (Jesus) Franco's films, and there certainly seems to be a lot of them, but this is one of the better (and strangest) ones of my lots. I would say that he was in his prime in the late sixties / early seventies, and that everything has been a bit too strange for me lately, and I need a lot to explain that. Anyway, this is like a big bad dream where parts of it seem to be true in different places. This woman is an actress or something that performs in a Berlin theater where "fake" tortures are performed in front of an appreciative audience (?!), And she seems to have this problem with dreaming. The catch on what is real and what is not in this movie is apparently the real stuff in the sharp focus and the dream stuff not. She seems to exist in a state of Deja Vu. I'm not going to say that this makes a lot of sense, but it's pretty wild and funny and entertaining. Images of Berlin make it seem like a lonely and scary place, which enhances the atmosphere. The end, however, is extremely abrupt, the film is just ending and the band went black. I think you do not need to know that it was over at this point. My copy was from the Anchor Bay Euro Trash collection, and I say, give me more Euro trash, I can not get enough of that crap. But it is good crap.
