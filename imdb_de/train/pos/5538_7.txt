A couple (Janet and Richard) camp in the woods near a huge wetland. After camping and nature, the couple enjoys shelter in an abandoned farmhouse. Soon two escaped prisoners appear and after much delay in the inevitable, they rape Janet and lock Richard into a birdcage. <br /> <br /> This LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT-like movie must be one of the most underrated horror movies ever made. It is one of the sicker and twisted shockers of the early 70s. In addition, I found it pretty enchanting and beautiful in his perverted tone. I love CAGED TERROR. The music definitely helps to give the film a sense of personality and a lot of beauty. I thought the movie was pretty scary. <br /> <br /> The bugs are mainly related to the tempo of the movie, which means that the movie is rather slow and meandering. The pace did not bother me because of the beauty and excitement of the film in question, but I think most people will. The play is neither too good nor dialogue, at least in the early scenes. This movie needs a little more patience than usual and is really not for everyone. <br /> <br /> In short, this was a good movie. Not the best horror movie I've ever seen, but it's certainly a lot of fun. It's not the easiest movie to find. It is possible to find it in the USED area of ​​many businesses, if you are looking hard enough. It's not for everyone, but if you're a fan of garbage cinema, it's definitely worth it.
