This is a great movie !!! <br /> <br /> I saw this movie for the first time when it came out. I recently saw this movie again and still remember it. Many of the movies we did when we were younger did not seem to hold up when we look at them later in life. The movie is actually a great example of the kind of movies that were made back then. Keaton is at its best, all the actors have done a great job, and Ron Howard has been very good at making the story drive the movie instead of forcing it. The speed of the movie is fast with a few slow spots and seeing the cars from the 80s is too funny. I was from the 80s when I saw the ugly pacemaker again. The movie is a great movie for all comedy lovers and lovers of the 80s.
