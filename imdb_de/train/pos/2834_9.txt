I have not seen much German comedy, but if this movie is something, I have to see more! The simple but effective plot leads two very different people on a journey from Germany to Italy, after Eva, an unemployed mother of two children, discovers that her artist-husband has an affair with the wife of a wealthy lawyer. I will not reveal anything, but the result is a very funny series of events with a perfect finish. My interest in international cinema has grown since I saw this movie for the first time. I recommend it to everyone (any adult ... do not let the inclusion of small children make it a family movie) who love the comedy - even those unfamiliar with the language.
