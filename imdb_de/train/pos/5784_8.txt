I've noticed that many people on "Kerching!" Board seems to hate this show, which I find really surprising. I think it's one of the best British kids shows out there. It's a shame that it ends because it's very funny (though sometimes a bit cheesy) and has great characters. The main character is a bit like Del Boy, although she is much smarter. With his two best friends he tried to earn a million pounds for his mother by setting up an online business and adopting the pseudonym "Rudeboy". His friends are Seymour (who likes to cook) and Danny (who is open-minded and the comic relief character). Throughout the show, some characters have left and new ones have arrived, but it has always been entertaining and has improved.
