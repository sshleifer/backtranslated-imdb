Before I saw that, I was deterred from the subject, but this is not your average triumph over the adversity story. Although technically they are blind Tibetan children climbing the mountain. Everest, there is so much more to it. This film shows the very strong, often contradictory personalities of two seasoned blind adults leading the children Erik and Sabriye. Erik is an American blind climber / athlete and Sabriye is a blind German scientist who founded a school in Lhasa Tibet. They are both extraordinary in their own way, but they disagree about what will truly boost children's trust. Erik wants them to reach the summit, while Sabriye wants them to be a role model for Erik and enjoy the moment. The nuances are complicated and you're not really sure who was right or if the whole climb was a mistake or a great idea. The deepest scenes are with the Tibetan children themselves and the hardships they faced before they made their way to school. The most moving thing for me was the story of Tashi, a frail teenager who grew up in the street after his parents left him. I was able to watch a full movie about his life and was happy to learn that he is running a successful small business thanks to the school with some of his classmates. If you like Spellbound or Murderball, you'll love that.
