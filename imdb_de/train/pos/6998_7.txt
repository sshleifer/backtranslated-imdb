Looking at Seven Pounds, I was not sure what to think, because the previews were too open to understand what the movie was really about. So within the first 20 minutes, you are completely lost in action, have no idea what's going on, and you think Tim, who claims to be Ben, is just a big asshole. All this ends when the "turn" is resolved in the last minute of the movie. Basically, Tim (will smith) was disturbed and persecuted by a serious accident that caused the end of seven lives. With that, he decides to find seven new people who urgently need help, to whom he alternately gives his life. <br /> <br /> The acting of this movie is great, it seems to impress. Rosario Dawson, for me, this is one of her better films, except for the eagle eye, which I think is up there. She was good in some bad, but she delivers in this movie. Other actors, like Woody Harrelson, have very small roles and are not big enough to capture the character. Although the casting of the film was still good. <br /> <br /> This movie was definitely not what I expected, and certainly a much slower pace that I had hoped for. The movie was still pretty good though. Nothing is revealed until the last 5 minutes of the movie and everything fits together. Until then, it just seems to be a meaningless love story. Final thought seven pounds = seven stars.
