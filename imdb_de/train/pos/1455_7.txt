Mardi Gras: Made in China is an excellent film that shows how two cultures have much in common but are not even aware of the impact each society has on each other. David Redmon opens your eyes and lets you see how Chinese workers make pearls that cost little to nothing and are sold in America for up to $ 20. When Redmon asks the Americans where these pearls come from, they had no idea and seemed stupid. When they told them that they were made in China for less than nothing, with terrible pay and unacceptable working conditions, the Americans seemed sad, hurt, and a little remorseful, but they did not really seem to trust the purchase of pearls after they did had found out the truth. When Redmon questioned workers in China, they did not know that the Americans were wearing them and paying so much for these pearls. The workers laughed at the purpose of the pearls and could not believe it. This movie is a great movie that we can think about in other countries except in our own country. <br /> <br /> M. Pitts
