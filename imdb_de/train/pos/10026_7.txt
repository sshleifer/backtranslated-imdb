Without Kirsten Miller, this project was not completed. But with the impressive beauty and talent of Miss Miller, I would definitely recommend it. It looked like the other actors were just playing for their strong performance. Wagner's sad attempt to honor this film was a bit disappointing, but his few scenes did not distract the conversation. Most of the time I criticized the writing and the plot. The assembled talent group has worked heroically to save a disaster. The charismatic delivery and timing of Miller were impeccable and believable. She plays this fine line between assertive and bossy, but never offending she is actually the civil engineer she pretends to be. I wish I had seen this on the big screen, but unfortunately I was fortunate to let it out before it was lost.
