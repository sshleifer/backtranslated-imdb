I've always enjoyed Kenneth Branagh's versions of the Shakespearean classics, as he's always doing a very good job, but in this movie, the one who stars the movie is none other than the "always great actor" Laurence Fishburne. Surely he's made some bad decisions in movies, even if he's a wonderful actor, but in this movie we really got the real Othello: the passion, the intensity of the jealousy that grows stronger with Fishburnes well-made paranoia and beyond , we finally got a black Othello! <br /> <br /> I do not think they could have opted for a better Othello. Who else could have given him that mixture of sympathy / antipathy, love / hate and not to forget those fiery eyes ...? As always, Branagh is good but not at his peak, Ir√©ne Jacobs Desdemona is pretty good, but a bit bleak, while Laurence Fishburne really picks it up and makes it a very interesting and entertaining movie. Look at it.
