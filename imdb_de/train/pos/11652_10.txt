I happened to come across this movie when I listed all the movies that my sister wanted to record for me on vacation, and I'm so glad I recorded it. It deals with questions that most directors shy away from. My only problem with this movie is that it was made for television, so I could not buy a copy for my friend! <br /> <br /> It's a touching story about how people with eating disorders do not necessarily shun everyone and how many actually have diet buddies. I have pointed out that although bulimics can be relatively stable in weight, they have more serious health consequences that many people are unaware of.
