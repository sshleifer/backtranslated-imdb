A brutally depressing screenplay and some unobtrusive performances by Peter Strauss and Pamela Reed, as well as a good location for filming locations in Ohio make for a good TV movie about hard times in the rust belt. When the mills close and the union jobs disappear, the workers are threatened by everyone: management, owners, their wives and children. Strauss absolutely believes in his role, and Pamela Reed is as always wonderful. See if you can recognize John Goodman before he has gained weight. <br /> <br /> The heavy metal score - did anyone make a pun? - is sometimes intrusive annoying, but the cinematography of Frank Stanley is the knockout, especially the millenial scenes.
