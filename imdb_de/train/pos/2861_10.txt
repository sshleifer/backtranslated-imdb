I love this show and my eleven year old daughter and I LOVE it when they look together. It conveys good old fashioned values ​​in a fun, adventurous and entertaining way (albeit mostly with a somewhat predictable story). It's also really fun to make fun of it ... you know, spool it back and insert your own dialogue instead of the actors. <br /> <br /> I set my DVR to record all the episodes I met by chance Catch the end of an episode (just before the next, so ... I do not know what episode it is), but there was an absolutely TERRIBLE sequence error! Adam had handed Sheriff Coffee a small piece of leather that was torn from an outlaw's coat when he tried to find an escape route, I suppose. Well, Roy had the coat so he had put it on his desk and placed the pattern right where it had been torn off. The pattern was exactly rectangular ... which in my opinion is almost impossible to tear from a piece of leather (Naugahyde from the 1950s? Yes, leather? I do not think so). Well, the Swatch lined up perfectly and the puzzle was solved. Not 10 seconds later in the scene, we see the coat again, which is still on Roy's desk. But this time the color field is more like the shape of North Carolina and is now in a completely different place on the mantle (but still perfectly aligned with the hole in the mantle) and the seam (which was smacking in the middle) Swatch) now gone ... as well as the seam in the coat. My daughter laughed a lot as we played the short scene over and over again! It's a good figure for youtube, I'll tell you! <br /> <br /> We love the show all the same and the sequence mistakes are a lot of fun!
