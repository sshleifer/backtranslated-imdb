Although I generally do not like remakes, I think remakes are a waste of time; this film is an exception. Actually, I did not know until the last comment that this is a remake. So my opinion refers exclusively to the actual film and not to a comparison. <br /> <br /> no question: it's capote. There are no further words required. <br /> <br /> The game of Anthony Edwards and Eric Roberts is outstanding. I've seen a few movies with them, in one or the other. I was sure they were good actors, and in the case of Eric, I've always wondered why his sister is the # 1 star and not her brother. This time this certainty is made a fact, no question. His piece, as well as the piece by Mr. Edwards, is clearly the forefront of all her professions. <br /> <br /> I recommend that this movie be among the top 50 movies you can see on your DVD shelves.
