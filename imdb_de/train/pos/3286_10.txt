In short, this movie is scary. <br /> <br /> It starts off easily, looks like a study of a rebellious young girl and becomes a beautifully designed horror movie. <br /> <br /> Do not expect blood or zombies. This is psychological and as he did with Candyman, Bernard Rose manages to convey the horror that is not believed. <br /> <br /> Each time you watch this movie, you'll see more about what's going on and how the two worlds in this film are connecting. <br /> <br /> drawings have never been more frightening.
