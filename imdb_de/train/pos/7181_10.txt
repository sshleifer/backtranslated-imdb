Eyeliner was worn almost 6000 years ago in Egypt. Not really that much for the 12th century. I also did not know that the series flopped. There's a second season now, is not it? It's amazing to me when comments are made by those who are either ill-informed or do not see a show at all. It's a waste of space on the boards and time of others. The show's first show might have been a bit painful as the cast began to establish itself, but that's to be expected of every show. The rest of the first season is outstanding. I can not wait for the second season to start in the USA.
