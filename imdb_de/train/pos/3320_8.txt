I liked this movie "cute and funny". I found this movie a good family movie. The dirtiest part of this movie was when he referred to the New York Yankees. You must be in the Red Sox nation to understand that NY Yankees is a dirty word. Please tell Yankee fans. I recommend this picture for the whole family. Of course with your typical love / comedy movie moment in the movie, I'm in love and what am I doing, but the movie makes up for it with all the slapstick moments. The film show features some moments like the Red Sox Nation (at Fenway Park) like The fans felt themselves screwed up with the Soxen at the end of the season for about 86 years, and like the love of the Sox and the love with another human hand to go in hand.
