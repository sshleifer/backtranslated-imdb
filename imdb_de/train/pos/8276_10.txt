Now I'm talking about it. Finally, a low-budget horror trip that uses its limits to its advantage. Wendigo, though occasionally flawed, is a triumph of imagination. Granted, it leans heavily on EVIL DEAD style camera moves for its capriciousness, but it's still a damned sight that is better than 99% directly off video slags in a secluded cabin and threatened by a particularly furious hunter. However, director Larry Fessenden really knows how to build excitement with the legendary Wendigo and add layers of disturbing horror. Is it real? Is that all in the boy's imagination? Is it an externalization of the emotional state of the child? <br /> <br /> Some have doubted that the film is unsatisfactory because it is up to you to decide. Do not be put off by so little nonsense. A movie that makes you think is unavoidable. It is one in which one can be happy.
