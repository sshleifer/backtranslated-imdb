This is a stunning-looking movie that does it in just six or seven colors. When it came out over 15 years ago, the audience was astonished by its color scheme, which was so different from any other movie. These colors make an absolutely fascinating film for me at least. There are literally thousands of scenes that I wish I could freeze and somehow turn into a painting to study for their artwork. The characters and the story are not consistent with the size of the photograph, but with them are all exaggerated, especially the villains. The famous actors who played here had a lot of fun on the set playing Flatop, Pruneface, Lips, Mumbles, and so on. Meanwhile, Warren Beatty and Gleanne Hedley are as good as Dick Tracey and girlfriend Tess Truehart, and she's as sweet and soft as her name. Another great addition is Charlie Korsmo, as the offender boy Dick and Tess step under their wing. The colorful other characters are played by Al Pacino, Dustin Hoffman, William Forysthe, Paul Sorvino, Mandy Patinkin, Madona and other names you know but too numerous to list here. Take a look at all the credits on the main page and you will be amazed. <br /> <br /> The only negatives I found were Pacino's voice, which grins at you after a while, Madonna's off-key singing voice and the fact that the movie would do that are better at 10 Minutes have been trimmed. These "mistakes" are all minor, because overall this is a funny movie ... a cartoon that comes to life in an incredibly colorful way ... like nothing you've ever seen.
