I recently received I.Q. seen. And although I'm not a romantic comedy, I think it was just a beautiful and sweet movie. So many movies lack honesty in my opinion. Do you know that feeling when you watch a movie, and you just feel deprived because it takes something out of the story and it was like the director just threw it together like it was trash? The story between the scientists is cute and funny. How they glued together and tried to help Tim Robbins character to become smart. I liked the love story between Tim and Meg because she was simple and addressed a good point in terms of love: "Nothing is as it seems". I would recommend this for a Sunday morning. <br /> <br /> 7/10
