Larry Fessenden was beaten by most of the comments in this forum. Well, the worst mistake is obviously the marketing of the movie and the way the DVD was targeted. Obviously, this is not a real horror movie, at least not for people who expect something that will be bloody and immediately satisfying. <br /> <br /> "Wendigo" is basically a movie told from the head of the young Miles. Things that are not readily understood by children tend to stay in their young minds and ultimately control their fears and the threatening world that they can not understand. It's obvious that Kim, the mother, is a psychologist, but she has no idea what's going on in her son's head. This is also a story of alienation. It is clear that the father, George, is a distant figure, perhaps a workaholic who seems to live in another world. <br /> <br /> Miles' fears reach a crisis-related point over the weekend. This part of the state of New York with its winter landscape and sparse trees has an impact on the imagination of the little boy. It does not help that he meets a strange figure in the city, in his young mind even more doubt. In the end, Miles' world collapses on him and he can not do anything, even summon the Wendigo spirit. <br /> <br /> The film is a good one and plays well. Patricia Clarkson is excellent no matter where she is. Jake Weber is great as a distant father who has the opportunity to get closer to a son he does not understand. Erik Per Sullivan mediates as Miles the inner turmoil in itself. I thought he was extremely effective because Miles is the entire movie. After all, John Spredakos is perfect as a menacing Otis, a man who annoys the world for the way he turned out.
