Although little known today, Deanna Durbin was one of the most popular stars of the 1930s, a pretty teenager with a cheeky personality and a much admired operatic voice. This year, 1937, was her first major movie, and it turned out to be a receipt for the besieged Universal Studios. THREE SMART GIRLS concerns three daughters of a divorced couple storming to their long-unseen father The faithful mother reveals that he could soon marry again - with the firm intention of undermining his gold digger girlfriend and bringing her back to her mother. Although the story is small, the script is funny and the expert group plays it with a neat screwball touch. Durbin has a pleasant voice and a responsive personality, and such pleasing character actors as Charles Winninger, Alice Brady, Lucile Watson and Mischa Auer complete the cast. An ultra-light entertainment for fans of the film of the 1930s. Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer
