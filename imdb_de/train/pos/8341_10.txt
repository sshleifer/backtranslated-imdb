Bottom line best romantic comedy of all time. This film fulfills what all great movies are aiming for: the creation of a world and time we want to revisit, and makes us happy to be part of humanity. When I am blue, this film lifts my mind and makes me laugh (and that is always fresh even after many visits). <br /> <br /> All actors are in great shape. The characterizations are so good that the characters mesh so well that you forget the actor (usually difficult with Matthau, Robbins, and Ryan). The understudy is consistently brilliant: Fry ("agae", "a complete package for pygmies"!), Jacoby & Saks & Maher (the three theoretical physicists as "Greek Choir" - "but there is no time"), "something that We can start from NJ "), Shalhoub & Whaley (Robbins' boss and staff at the gas station) and Curits (Eisenhower - how many comedies do Eisenhower have?). <br /> <br /> Do not miss this overlooked treasure.
