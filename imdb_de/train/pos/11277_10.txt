Tarzan and Jane live happily in the jungle. Some men seek ivory and bring Jane back to civilization. But Jane loves Tarzan and does not want to leave. One of the men falls in love with Jane and is determined to take her back ... even if it means killing Tarzan. This is a rarity - a sequel that is better than the original. "Tarzan, the Monkey Man" of 1932 was good, but had some terrible special effects and a kind of drag. This has MUCH better effects and is much more adult. There are tons of blatant racism (a black man is shot dead - and nobody really cares), but that was in 1934. There is also a lot of blood, blood and violence (for a 1934 movie), and uncut prints have Jane doing one long underwater swim totally naked! There is also obvious sexual content, and Tarzan and Jane carry next to nothing and (they imply) that they sleep together and have sex - without being married. That would not bother anyone today, but in 1934 that was pretty extreme. <br /> <br /> Apart from that, the movie is well directed, very fast paced and full of adventure and excitement. Seeing Weissmuller in this scrawny lion's cloth is certainly a feast for the eyes and Jane's outfit is also pretty enlightening. I still think Maureen O'Sullivan is bad than Jane, but Weismuller is perfect as Tarzan. Everyone else is fine. <br /> <br /> This is by far the best Weism√ºller - O'Hara Tarzan. Well worth seeing, but not for children!
