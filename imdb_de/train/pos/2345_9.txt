I really enjoyed the first episode and I'm looking forward to more. Something soft in the area of ​​crime (almost retroactive and not particularly exciting or pronounced), but considered the romantic angle for wonderfully charming. Will certainly watch again! <br /> <br /> I hope they will have a bigger role for the aunts, who are wonderful actresses and a little stressed this time. The actress who plays the assistant / waitress (also by Bewitched, I think) is very sweet and bubbly and looks so dorky and sweet, instead of being stupid and annoying, which is very nice.
