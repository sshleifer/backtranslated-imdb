I love this movie. It was one of my favorite movies. The action never stops. The whole movie was very well done. The end is really good. On the action page, they even have a surprise for you. When I saw what the movie was about on the internet, I was not sure I wanted to see this movie, but I'm such a big Luke Perry fan. I'm glad I gave him a chance because this was a very good movie. It was very original. Who has thought up this movie, gets a standing ovation from me. The acting was great. Luke Perry has once again done an excellent job. I rate this film with the highest rating.
