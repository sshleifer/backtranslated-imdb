This is a really great shorts by Hal Roach. This has two main reasons: the smallest children in the short series are among the cutest ever made in the film, and the storyline contains so many fun and well-written elements. <br /> <br /> As for the smallest, I can not honestly think of a littler child than Spanky at the age of four. Although he was a rather chubby and unattractive child in later years, he was simply valuable here. And blaming the little, tiny boy for babysitting the even younger children was not only funny, but also considering the cute factor. <br /> <br /> all sorts of funny chaos breaks loose. The jokes are pretty effective and well done over time - with an accidental wake up call with murder and a final scene where Spanky FINALLY takes control of the little ones most memorable. I have not seen these shorts for many decades and I'm glad I gave those shorts a shot.
