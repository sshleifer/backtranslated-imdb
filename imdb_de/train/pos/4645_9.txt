This movie is very interesting. I've seen it twice, and it seems Glover has hit the nail on his head with what he claims. I can point out, on the one hand, the outrage that the filmmaker expresses clearly against the current, thoughtless business instincts that are on the rise in every media center, and the things that we as culture should not think about because of corporate media control. The outrage that Glover expresses through the "outrageous" elements in the films is beautiful in both his visceral aggressiveness and his poetic power. I'm glad I saw this movie, and it's even clearer that Glover is up to something interesting in the second part of the trilogy. It's okay! ALL IS WELL. See also that. People who dismiss this movie as "thoughtless" or "presumptuous" really miss the boat. This is a smart movie. When you see it with his live show, which he's doing before with his books, it's also very angry. The way you get to your way of thinking is really something. You will have an experience!
