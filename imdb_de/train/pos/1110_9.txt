I think you have to be from the USA to get a lot of jokes. But if you like Princess Bride and Forest Gump, you would like this movie. Of course, one can not compare the quality of the filming with those, but the cameraman's journey was obviously made intentionally. Killer Tomatoes is a hundred times better than Nepolean Dynamite. Just my opinion. I am sure that the people from France would not appreciate the caricatures of the French. So this movie is not for a world audience. And although I'm not a trained film critic, I know what I like. I could not stop the movie from laughing. My sides and jaws ached at the end of the film.
