This movie is underrated. It is very resourceful, creative and smart. It's just fun and in my opinion, this film surpasses the first one. But the movie was forgotten when it came out, and was overlooked even more over the years. "Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey" also bombarded the box office, with the first being a pretty good hit and very popular. <br /> <br /> I think the problem could be that this movie was released a few years late. In 1991 Bill and Ted were already working in the 80s. Although the 80s were just a few years back then, the landscape of music and style for kids had changed so radically with gangsta rap, hip hop, pearl jam, nirvana, grunge, and the Seattle sound. Bill and Ted, with their Ozzy Osbourne, Van Halen and Guns N 'Roses music along with their 1980s style, seemed out of place and outdated in '91. Nobody except Surfer still said things like "excellent!" and "sham!" "Gremlins 2", which also hit the market in the early 1990s, had a similar fate, as a good movie that was bombed at the box office because it was too much associated with the '80s. The transition from the 80s to the 90s was much faster than it was in the 90s and 00s. 1991 was not like 1988 or 1989, whereas 2002 and last year 2001 still looked like 1995 or 1996. <br /> <br /> If only "Excellent Adventure", produced in 1988, was released, the year was instead of 1989, and "Bogus Journey" was quickly produced and released in 1989, then it would probably have been just as wildly recorded like the first.
