Antonio Margheritis "Danza Macabra" / "Castle of Blood" is an eerie, atmospheric cooler that is successful on all fronts. He looks absolutely beautiful in black and white and has a wonderfully spooky gothic look. Alan Foster is an English journalist who is interviewed by American horror author Edgar Allan Poe. Poe bets on Foster that he can not spend the night in the abandoned mansion of Poe's friend Thomas Blackwood. If he accepts the bet, Foster is locked up in the mansion and the horror begins! The crypt sequence is really scary and the tension is almost unbearable. As an eerie ghost Elisabeth Blackwood she looks incredibly beautiful. "Castle of Blood" is by far one of the best Italian horror movies in the early 60s. A masterpiece!
