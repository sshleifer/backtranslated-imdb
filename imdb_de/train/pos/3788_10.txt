This movie is beautiful. It's real and heartfelt, but totally crazy at the same time. The characters are easy to fall in love with, because they have so many different thoughts, but at least each of us could refer to them. In Canada, we do not have many films from Eastern Europe, and for the few I've seen, Loners is one of the best. It is very funny and magical. If you want to see something new and refreshing, read Loners.
