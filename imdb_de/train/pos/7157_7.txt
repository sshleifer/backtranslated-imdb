This movie is a fun, entertaining and high quality movie. The film very cleverly follows the guidelines of the book and tries to keep the exact lines. The actors are all suitable and you would expect them to be the part. They use some famous actors who have a great influence on the movie. The graphics are somewhat unclear in some places, and there are a few mistakes throughout the movie. For example, there is no yellow spot lizard. The camp is not as cruel as explained in the book, and it does not show up like the book. All of his group are mentioned a lot in the book but are not in the movie. Overall, a great movie for a rainy afternoon
