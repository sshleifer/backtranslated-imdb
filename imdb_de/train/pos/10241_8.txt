I try not to take the IMDb reviews to heart, but I was stunned to see the rating of 5.4 as one of my favorites from my childhood. At 17, I'm not so excited, but as a family movie, this is a sweet and well-meaning film. Kids will definitely love it and not worry about the shortcomings, and adults can guess the actor behind each character and admire the subliminal message of the movie. None of the films was preaching in any way, in fact he has a great message that adds to his sweetness. However, I admit that the story is rather meager and some scenes like Screweyes' death (which still drives me crazy) can be a little bit on the scary side. The animation is however above average with beautiful colors and good character animation. The music of James Horner is very beautiful and the song is catchy, catchy and amusing. I really liked the characters, Louie is probably the deepest of them all, but the dinosaurs were at least captivating. Martin Shorts Clown was both hilarious and emphatic, the part when he told Screweyes, "I quit!" But my favorite is Screweyes, an effective villain who's cunning and intelligent. If anything, I wish the film would stay in the part where it explains how it has lost its eye and why it is afraid of crows because it could have been further developed in terms of depth. The script, though not Oscar-worthy, has its funny and heartwarming parts and should entertain children and adults alike. The voice that played for me made the movie. John Goodman, Martin Short, Rhea Perlman, Felicity Kendall and Yeardley Smith all performed well, but especially worth mentioning is Kenneth Mars, as he was absolutely outstanding as Screweyes and almost unrecognizable. All in all, this is a good movie. I do not get the rating, honestly not. Sure, this movie is not perfect and is not as good as a dinosaur movie like Land Before Time, but it's a lot of fun. 7.5 / 10 Bethany Cox
