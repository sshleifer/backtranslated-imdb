I really love this show, it's like reading a book and every chapter makes you want more. They are thinking about what will happen in the next episode, and about the struggle to maintain friendship over the years. After each episode ends, it leaves a sweet, bitter taste in the knowledge that: - The show was good, you can not wait for the next episode, and you'll really think about what's going on with your friends in the twenty years , And two - the fact that the show was put on pause and we will not see that the show is finished in its entirety. Of course, Fox does not know what they did, claiming they're losing viewers in the 18-49 category. You obviously do not know what people want to see when they get rid of a good show like Reunion. However, I have a question that I would like to address. If they were going to bring the show back and it would take another season, how would it work, since each episode will be completed in a one-year period and the story is based on the events that will happen in twenty years? Your answers are very welcome. Bring Reunion back! Bring Reunion back!
