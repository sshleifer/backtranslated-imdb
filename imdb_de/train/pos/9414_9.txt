Although most Americans, apart from Star Wars, know very little about his work, Alec Guinness has created amazing works ranging from drama to bizarre comedies, especially in the 1940s-1950s. I especially love his comedies, because they are so well made and look so natural and real on screen - very different from Hollywood. <br /> <br /> This is the movie that piqued my interest in these movies. The plot was so strange and cute that it's very unlikely the movie would have been made anywhere except Ealing Studios, which had a penchant for "little" movies like this one. <br /> <br /> Guinness is a nerdy little scientist who works for a textile company. He wants to experiment to create a synthetic material that is indestructible, even though he does not work as a researcher for the company, but for the janitorial work! So he sneaks into labs (either during the day, when no one suspects or at night) and tries to invent himself. Repeatedly, he gets caught (for example after blowing up the lab) and gets the boot until one day he actually succeeds! However, despite the significance of the discovery, it sets in motion a completely unexpected chain of events - and then the fun begins. <br /> <br /> The film is a wonderful satire that makes the industry, the unions, the government for fun and the people in general.
