This show is so incredibly funny that I could not stop watching the marathon on Comedy Central tonight (though I've seen all the episodes before). I have always considered Silverman to be a great talent, and this is ultimately an instrument for this talent that will appeal to a wide audience. I watch this show and laugh very often ... I can not say that about many TV shows ... can you? This show is finally something new and interesting and (most importantly) funny! This is a show I will never miss and which I will buy on DVD as soon as it comes out. You owe it to yourself to see this show ... I expect a long series for this series ... And just to be clear, the people who are insulted by this show just do not understand ... maybe they lack the intelligence to understand it ... they should stop fooling themselves by attacking something they do not understand. Anyone who uses the word "bigot" in relation to Silverman, or who claims that he just wants to "shock" ... is completely wrong ... it's just the opposite; If you search her on Google, you'll soon find out she's a big proponent of civil rights. If you do not know that she ironically embraces all these vile points of view, you do not understand it. And if you do not understand it, do the rest of us a favor and be quiet with it, so that we all can enjoy the joy ...
