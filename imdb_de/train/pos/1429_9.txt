I loved how the EARTH is made. Photography is incredible, editing has been an interesting challenge and Patrick Stewart's voice is PERFECT. In addition, music and sound make EARTH's reputation a profound experience that you do not want to miss. You are really on a journey where you would probably never end alone. <br /> <br /> And even though I was rather surprised at the audience's laughter when we saw animals in their daily struggle for survival, sometimes I could laugh myself. Nature just seems too impressive to understand. But instead of laughing, I left the cinema with a profound question: "200 years of industrial revolution can destroy natural systems that have come here for thousands upon thousands of years?" <br /> <br /> With this question in mind, you'll understand how I felt a little bitter and powerless after seeing EARTH. I had the immediate need to change the world, to help all these animals in their struggle, to undo the changes we have undergone in recent centuries and to stop global warming immediately (all this is not an NGO at all). Activist!) ... <br /> <br /> So I immediately visited the website mentioned at the end of the film to see what I could do to save our fantastic planet (and the polar bear) from its oppressive fate , (www.loveearth.com) <br /> <br /> I was a little disappointed to find no direct answers to my questions there. Nevertheless it was very interesting to learn more about the film and the fight of his crew. <br /> <br /> I hope that I can reduce my energy consumption. I do not know how to shorten the distance polar bears need to land before drowning or attacking animals they can not beat in their depleted condition ... <br /> <br /> An inspirational movie is it, but I have not left the cinema very happy.
