A haunting piece that the demanding horror movie fan will be grateful for. Keep your Freddys and Jasons - this movie is in the same company as "The Haunting" (the original). Lyrically and honestly, it stays with you long at night, much like those terrible CBS Radio Mystery Theater shows. A clever rent.
