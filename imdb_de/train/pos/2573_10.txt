When my 14-year-old daughter and her friends get together for a movie night, there's a movie they want to watch over and over again: you guessed it, K-911, the third installment of the hugely successful K-9 series Everyone's favorite TV dad, Jim Belushi. <br /> <br /> Guys, I knew it was possible to carry a VHS cassette, but a DVD?! This has been played so often that it starts to skip; no joke! But of course you have, if you own a movie that is so charming and brilliant. <br /> <br /> Of course we must thank the only Tom Hanks for introducing us to the popular genre of Cop Dog with Turner and Hooch; But even this film can not keep up with the outstanding quality shown in all three K-9 films. <br /> <br /> Some naysayers claim that Belushi had no power with this third film in the series. Poppycock, I say. While you may suspect that a third part, direct-to-video, may not seem valuable, you should prove wrong after watching this quality movie. <br /> <br /> I will not do it Give the conspiracy, but I'll say that Belushi and his partner, who is only interested in wheezing, are showing their best performance yet - one that laughs at you Will bring laughter! It's a shame that John Belushi is not living to see how much progress his brother made in the drama world. Do not forget the puppy food!
