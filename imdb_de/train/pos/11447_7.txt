This movie is probably for you. It had a general meditative quality from music to beautiful photography to the often clich√©d things of life that Andy Goldsworthy would say during his work or between shots. If you are familiar with Buddhism, this is the kind of feeling I got from this movie. The instability of life, the beauty of nature, the interconnectedness of all things, etc. But what I did not understand, confused, and finally forced myself to go to the end (I saw over an hour of it) was the dismissal of the whole thing. They only learn what he has been asked to do and how he can even afford to live off this kind of work. The artwork comes alive, but all its conversations without conclusions lead to dead ends.
