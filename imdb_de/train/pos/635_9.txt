On July 19th I went to a small preview screening of this film. I only knew the names of some actors and knew it was a fantasy / adventure search. <br /> <br /> The plot is really nothing I have seen, and a unique story is certainly appreciated with everything else that is currently in the cinemas or coming to theaters soon. Despite the first impressions it is not cheesy, kitschy, cheesy or ridiculous and is actually very entertaining and funny. The river is pretty well done, nothing seems to be rushed or pulled out. The soundtrack is magical for lack of better words and contributes a lot to the film, rather than filling the silence, as is often the case in movies or on television. And although I might have known what would come at points, I could not stand watching the screen; To my knowledge, not a single person has left the theater throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> My only criticism is that there is virtually no marketing for this film, and as brilliant as I can find out why.
