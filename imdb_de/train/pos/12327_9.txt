In 1987, Hong Kong had given films such as Sammo Hang's "Weird Encounters" Chow Yun Fat in John Woo's iconic "A Better Tomorrow," "To Warriors," and the classic "Mr. Vampire." Jackie Chan has had international success on video, but with "A Chinese Ghost Story" HK Cinema has had its first real crossover hit movie in the West for many years. <br /> <br /> Western movie-goers have never seen anything like me. It was a film that combined various ingredients that HK Cinema had used for years (flying swordsman, wildly choreographed martial arts, and the supernatural) to create a film that is unique in looks, feel, and performance. Forget the poor and unnecessary sequels that it produced. This is the original and the best. Director Siu-Tung Ching (still known as an action choreographer, including Woo: A Better Tomorrow 2 / The Killer) has created a masterpiece of fantasy / horror cinema under the watchful eye of legendary producer Tsui Hark. And with such an experienced crew (no less than 6 Martial Arts Coordinators), the chances of the movie being anything but wonderful are unthinkable. <br /> <br /> Editing the amazingly productive David Wu (who wrote / directed) "The Bride With White Hair 2" and publisher of classic titles like "A Better Tomorrow 1/2/3", "Hardboiled" and the cult hit "The Club") is just a brilliant work. His production of perfectly choreographed soaring, high-climbing sword fights makes it one of the finest HK cinemas ever created. Fast, unconventional, but never confusing, they are still the highlight of their art today. <br /> <br /> The camera crew has also done wonders. This is a movie in which each shot is a professionally made painting. There, where beautiful, blue toned night sequences surrounded by a ubiquitous, ghostly fog are the breathtaking platform for our story. It's a movie that uses everything to weave a beautiful beauty. Even the silk robes and dresses worn by Hsiao Tsing become living parts of the film, whether in romantic sequences or battle scenes, the ubiquitous silk flows across the canvas. Even a simple scene in which Hsiao Tsing changes the robes becomes a fluttering beauty, as every skill on the set joins into a memorable scene of such a simple act. The sets are also amazing, giving the woods a different worldly feel, and the temples and harshness of the burned, flag-filled desert desert of Hell for the amazing finale. The production design of Zhongwen Xi deserves the highest praise. <br /> <br /> Another important factor in the film's success is the music of Romeo Diaz and James Wong. Hong Kong movies have brought us fantastic music and songs that have contributed so much to the success of a sequence, but with "A Chinese Ghost Story" the music is just essential. From the opening song, the music becomes as important as the characters. The score is a perfect blend of modern and traditional instruments. Drums, bells, and guitars hammer across the action sequences with great effect, but they are brought to bear in the slower, more painfully romantic pieces. Here; Flutes, strings and female choir effects create perhaps the most beautiful pieces of music that can be heard in a HK film. Add the female, atmospheric, beautiful song that plays on Tsau-Shen and Hsiao Tsing's lovemaking (nothing is ever seen, but the effect is wonderful, this is a lovingly innocent movie romance), and you have a shining example of power The music of a movie can have. <br /> <br /> And of course we have the acting talent. Leslie Cheung ("A Better Tomorrow 1 & 2" and a very popular singer) is outstanding as an innocent tax collector. His work in the (fortunately mild) comic sequences is never overdone and his scenes with Joey Wang are played with just the right amount of passion and innocence. <br /> <br /> Joey Wang (who would later be largely relegated) to support roles in films such as the Chow-Yun-Fat / Andy Lau classic "God of Gamblers" has never been as radiant as here. It is the epitome of ethereal beauty. Her portrayal of the tragic Hsiao Tsing is breathtaking. She shows the grief of her characters about what she has become and what she should do, but she also gives off a subtle eroticism in the scenes in which she lures the men to their cruel deaths. Veteran actor Wu Ma ("Mr. Vampire", "Swordsman") is a lot of fun as the wise, brave, but also so surly, yen. He moves with practiced ease between the eccentric and the annoying. And what could easily have been a character who could have hurt the movie is actually wonderfully entertaining and memorable. <br /> <br /> But what about monsters and beasts? I hear you cry. Well, they range from the rather crude but fun stop-motion / animatronic zombies that inhabit the temple (which leads to a great running gag with constantly thwarted attempts to chew on the amusing, unsuspecting Tsau-Shen) up to the rather cheesy, surprisingly effective Lord Black. Complete with an arsenal of wicked flying heads and excellent wire work. Most of it has never been surpassed. <br /> <br /> But the most outstanding effect and creation is the killer tongue of the Tree Spirit. We first encounter this thing with an "Evil Dead" style that accelerates the camera effect by squeezing the victim's throat to deliver a deadly kiss, turning the victims into zombie-like pods. But later it is shown in all its crazy splendor. It can become so big and long that it shoots prey through the forest, tearing trees, wrapping around buildings and looping around people in slippery lengths before picking them up and throwing them against tree trunks !! It may even split to reveal a catch-filled mouth! It is a vile idea that nothing should work in the face of the deeply romantic main presentation. But it has a fantastic and unforgettable effect. <br /> <br /> What this brings together is a classic example of Hong Kong filming. A true team effort that gave us a truly groundbreaking movie. It's a movie full of wit, inventions, action, monsters, martial arts, ghosts, fantastic ideas, lush looks, beautiful music and, above all, its enduring charm, one of the most moving romances of cinemas.
