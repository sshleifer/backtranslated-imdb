That's a good movie. Something fun to see how money is blown for a super price, especially from a child's point of view. Take it for what it is, a funny little movie about a childhood dream that comes true and what a kid with a million dollars could do. Do not like it, do not look it. They make films for the audience, not the people who have nothing better to do than to complain in their lives.
