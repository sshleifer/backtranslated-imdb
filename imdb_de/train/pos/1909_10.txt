I originally looked at 8 simple rules on the Disney channel UK for the first series and I was thrilled. When they did not show it, it was annoying, but then 1 stopped with the second series. I did not think another series would start after I read that John Ritter had died. The 2nd series, however, was not amazing. I hope they will produce more shows soon, though I could see every show a thousand times. Kaley Couco is my favorite character as an Airhead Bridget and also excellent in Charmed. Rory is good too, he shares my name and Grampa. I'll keep watching until it ends and I hope it stays as funny as ever
