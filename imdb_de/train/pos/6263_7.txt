The first collaboration between Schoedsack & Cooper is a compelling documentary about the migration of the Bakhtiari tribe in Persia. Twice a year, more than 50,000 people and half a million animals cross rivers and mountains to gain access to pasture. You will feel like a spoiled weakling after watching these people guard their animals through freezing cold water and walk barefoot through the snow to cross the mountains as they try to walk their animals on steep and narrow mountain trails.
