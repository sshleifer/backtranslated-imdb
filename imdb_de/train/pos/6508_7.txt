I grew up with Scooby and I'm a fan forever. This cartoon moves away from the old routine that can be boring for the crowd. The Crooks in Mask routine is getting old and this cartoon is a change of it. It's not meant to replace the Scooby gang, it's just a break from the same old crime scene for viewers and writers, I'm sure. The focus of the cartoon lies on Scooby and Shaggy, who inherit a large sum of money and use this money to prevent the world's conquest schemes from a mad scientist and his thugs. From time to time little tributes are shown by the gang and the gang themselves. If you're a fan of Scooby-Doo, you can still see the connection between a boy and his talking dog and their jokes. Just enjoy the cartoon and support the creators / writers and producers so this is not the last Scooby cartoon.
