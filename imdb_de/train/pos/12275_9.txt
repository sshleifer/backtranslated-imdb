I've never heard of the book and I do not want to read it, but I'll probably see that movie often. <br /> <br /> This movie is unforgettable with perhaps the richest images I've ever seen in a movie. It was like looking for paintings often, which I thought was the idea. <br /> <br /> Great movies, stories, actors and movies. Full of profound emotions from all angles. Although I do not like romance movies, I loved that and was deeply touched by Winona Ryder's appeal to her father. <br /> <br /> Mr. Irons had earned a prize for his performance and Close was never better. <br /> <br />
