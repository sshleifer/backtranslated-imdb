A woman comes from this world and was alone. They were both alone because a boy had a gift and a curse in a package - he could pull the sword from his arm. There has always been a wound on his wrist in the cause of this "gift" - the wound of the deadliest weapon in his body. First, he kills his drunk stepfather, who always hurts his mother. Then he grows up and decides to find his real father. As easy as all the time for a superhero - he achieves justice ... but society decides that this justice is not necessary and dangerous, which is in fact right, because it is not like in Hollywood movies that the Figure not tempted kill everyone - Sasha (he is the main hero acted by Artem Tkachenko) kills if the person who in his opinion deserves death, but is accused by the authorities and runs. In such an escape from the authorities and mafia, he meets a girl (played by Chulpan Hamatova) and falls in love with her. Everything else is to be observed ... not told. Keep in mind that this movie is more about feelings and emotions, not about actions. This movie is full of pain from his main character and his vision of life.
