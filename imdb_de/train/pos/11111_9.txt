The sopranos are perhaps the most revealing series you'll ever want to see. It's smart, it's weird, it's funny - and it carries the mafia genre so well that most people can not resist watching. The best aspect of this show is the overwhelming realism of the characters who live in the subterranean world of New York crime fiction. Most of the time, you really do not know if the sages stab someone in the back or buy them a lunch. <br /> <br /> The realistic approach of the characters in this show adds the depth of their personality. These are dangerous men, most of them murderers, but of God, if you do not love them too. I laughed at their secrets, was torn to pieces when they made a mistake in court, and I was afraid of the sheer ruthlessness of a serious criminal. <br /> <br /> The New Jersey area is absolutely perfect for the subtext of this show. People do not always look the way they seem, and the sharp contrast between everyday life and the actions of these seemingly small criminals even outweighs the opportunities. <br /> <br /> If you have not already done so, you should definitely do so.
