"Fever Pitch" is a sweet and charming addition to the small genre of sports romances such as date films or movies that a son could visit with his mother (though the guys in the audience became noticeably restless during the romantic scenes). <I've been through a milder version of such a story. My first encounter with baseball was to meet my husband in the spring after Mets first World Series win. Then I saw the Mets pick up their next one because I was still early in the morning with our two little sons who grew up to teach me more about baseball through the other heartbreaking failure of our local neighborhood national team to get it back (and I was the one who made our older son play his only game at Fenway Park when I got a bit of Red Sox fever as a student in Boston. <br /> <br /> Compared to reality, that does So script credible that two people work with real jobs.It is particularly impressive that Drew Barrymore's character is a busy workaholic who has anti-Barbie skills, although she with her three mild girlfriends during fitness workouts that much wobble let's not have much to do and the minor side stories with her parents are not complete work. <br /> <br /> It's even believable, as she jimm Fallon's math teacher meets and falls in love with his "Winter Guy" - though it's surprising that his apartment filled with Red Sox paraphernalia did not fool her into his Jekyll-and-Hyde "summer guy". Her relationship crisis during the baseball season is also erupting in a refreshingly adult manner, from compromise efforts to her sincere challenges to him. Fallon surprisingly rises to the gradual emotional maturity of his character. <br /> <br /> While the end of O. Henry is heavily borrowed, screenwriters have done yeomanic work, quickly turning Sox's incredible 2004 season into a reworked storyline (with much collaboration from the Red Sox organization for the Filming in the stadium). <br /> <br /> The script does everything to explain why Fallon as a New Jersey immigrant does not have a Boston accent that does not explain why his colorful friends do not. The most authentic-sounding Boston sounds come from most of his "summer family" of other holders of season tickets, who kindly borrowed the foundations of Sox lore to Neophyte Barrymore (and such an audience). <br /> <br /> The Song The selection includes the favorites of many Red Sox fans, from the opening notes of the classic "Dirty Water", though most are listened to over the credits as if you were listening to local radio and it's worth it to sit through ,
