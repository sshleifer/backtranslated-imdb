Ernst Marischka, one of the most respected Austrian directors of that time, made films full of beautiful scenes, tender love and everything valuable in life. <br /> <br /> Nowadays, when people hear about him, they associate the name Marischka with the SISSI trilogy (1955, 1956, 1957). However, he also made other excellent films, such as THE DREIMADERLHAUS (1958), EMBEZZLED HEAVEN (1958) and definitely this, MADCHENJAHRE A KINGDOM, which shows the young years of Queen Victoria. Although it's a slightly different topic than SISSI movies, I do not see much difference between this film and SISSI. They are strikingly similar. <br /> <br /> The movie is almost identical. The style, the music, the photography. In fact, the crew is almost the same. Anton Profes, Bruno Mondi! <br /> <br /> The cast ... Romy Schneider is one of the first leading roles. It was a nice introduction to her role of Sissi, as this film was filmed one year before the first part of the trilogy about the Austrian Empress. It is also a movie in which Romy plays with her mother Magda Schneider. But Ernst Marischka was not the first director to occupy Romy with his mother. Romy's debut WHEN THE WHITE LILAC AGAIN BLUHN (1953) was also her appearance with her mother. Therefore, there were some voices that Romy began her Austrian career due to the fame of her mother. In fact, there is something true about it. <br /> <br /> Again, as in SISSI, love is very gentle. Victoria meets Prince Albert at a small inn in Dover. Her sympathy is based on pure elevation in the dance and gentle smile. And now...? How would it be shown? Only sex ... But is the only thing love is based on? I am grateful to Ernst Marischka for these films. They had a soul and a message. Some people call them cheesy, but I'll never give up on admiring those movies. They are impressive !!! INVALID, DIFFERENT!
