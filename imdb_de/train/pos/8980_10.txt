I have to admit that I'm a big fan of The Dandy Warhols, and that's why I watched this movie. <br /> <br /> The uniqueness of this film compared to other modern Rockumentaries is that it's not just about a side of the band's story (like "I'm trying to break your heart", about Wilco), but rather the long period of band history. In this film, director / producer Ondi Timoner has accompanied his friends / rivals The Brian Jonestown Massacre (BJM) and The Dandy Warhols (DW) for more than 8 years (1995-2003) and shot an enormous 1500 hours of raw material 1:45 hours (the future DVD release will contain much more material than the original movie). The result is amazing - there are no fillers - the film is 100% pure and authentic archive footage so you feel like you've been living with the bands over the years. <br /> <br /> Both Bands At the beginning of their careers, they promised to "make a revolution" in making music and not sell their souls to the devil of the "record industry". However, their paths diverged quickly - The Dandy Warhols signed a contract with Capitol Records and became relatively popular (especially in Europe) after only one album, while The Brian Jonestown Massacre (with his self-destructing leader Anton Newcombe) was forgotten (at least like it shown in the movie). And the film follows the descent of The Brian Jonestown Massacre, which is juxtaposed with the rise of The Dandy Warhols. <br /> <br /> First of all, I was very pleased with the film and its approach to telling the story of Anton Newcombe (for example), Courtney Taylor - the leader of The Dandy Warhols - but after some thought came to me Clear that something is wrong with this movie. First, he treats Anton Newcombe as a disappeared person. The project began in 1995 as a documentary about several promising emerging groups in which Anton Newcombe and Ondi Timoner were equal partners (which is why Ondi Timoner had unrestricted access to both bands over the years). It was Anton Newcombe who introduced The Dandy Warhols to the project. In the end he was completely ignored, as if he was thrown out of the project. Everyone talks about BJM but does not participate in the discussion. I think he was not even informed when the group started the last editing process. There are always two sides of the story, and here we have only one ... Of course, as one would expect, Anton does not endorse the end result and sees this movie as a betrayal of his former friends. <br /> <Secondly, the movie is very much influenced by Dandy Warhol's. Sure, the winner takes everything, but the fact that Courtney Taylor (leader of the DW) tells (although this is a good choice - gives the feeling of a closer involvement) and that the late history of the bands is disproportionately portrayed (BJM) 1997 and DW - until 2003), adds no objectivity to the film. <br /> <br /> Third, the film is (slightly) superficial. What does it want to teach us? One critic said, "... the film explores old questions: where does genius fit into a normal world, can it thrive and get its right, or must it destroy itself to maintain its integrity?" No, these questions are not checked! It only depicts the story of a brilliant but unsuccessful musician, told by a less brilliant but successful, indulging in the self-assurance and eternal coolness of an ego larger than the mountain. <br /> <br /> Film was fun - it's raw, it's fresh, it's stylish, it's just damn interesting, at least for DW or BJM fans. For the rest of the crowd - I do not know ...
