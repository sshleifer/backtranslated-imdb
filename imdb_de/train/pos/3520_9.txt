This is a "B Series" movie Noir, and my voice reflects his membership in this genre. I saw this movie last night in a cinema on the Left Bank in Paris, where he opened a two-week film Noir Run. The film has some shortcomings, yes, but far too many delicious elements that you can ignore. <br /> <br /> As the previous reviewer noted, the drum scene is incredible! (B-movies could be where A-movies were not allowed!) And the plot is intriguing. However, I can not agree with Franchot Tone: to me he is adequately mysterious; just the right shade color. One has to keep in mind that there is a kind of German expressionism here (director Robert Siodmark was a German who came to Hollywood during the war), and so a touch of exaggeration fits into this film. At least for me. <br /> <br /> However, it is the great Ella Raines who, in only her third performance, carried this viewer throughout the movie. A "Girl Friday" type with a strong resemblance to Gene Tierney, it's a miracle that she has not become a household name. But she's so good here that I just ordered another movie ('Impact') from the internet, and I can not wait to see him too.
