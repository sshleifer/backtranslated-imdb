Purple Rain ... what else should I say, the title speaks for itself. But I think all the actors were well chosen. The movie had a great story. I loved it! Since I saw the movie, I got stuck in the eighties, and I'm only 13! My favorite part of the movie was when his dad died and he recorded all of his musical compositions and Apollonia was sitting in the stairwell with his ear in his hand. Critics say it's a drama, but I think it's more of a romance. Murphy Brown has done a great job in the movie, he actually behaved like himself. I'm so glad I saw this movie. The song Purple Rain, beautifully sung, was so warm. I cried more than once.
