Joseph H. Lewis was one of the best directors of Film Noir. This is certainly his best. <br /> <br /> It does not have some of the standard features of today's Noir movie. Although made in America, it is completely settled in England. There is a lack of gangsters. It lacks a femme fatale. There is no lack of crime. <br /> <br /> The title character answers an ad. She is overjoyed that she will earn some money as a secretary. Instead, she wakes up days later, when the farmer in a frightening act. Only a very strong person could survive such a terrifyingly worrying test. And Nina Foch gives as Julia the feeling of a strong woman. <br /> <br /> Part of the excitement comes from casting against type: Ms. Foch has an elegant manner. She is not a screaming, crouching victim. She is actually a bit icy and patrician, if unsuccessful. The more credible her character is. <br /> <br /> The most intriguing element is certainly the casting of Dame May Witty. She was (and probably is) most famous for the charming title character in "The Lady Vanishes." She has a sweet nature and a harmless, slightly unsteady manner. But here she is far from a heroine. <br /> <br /> George Macready is excellent as her extremely distressed son. The entire cast is indeed outstanding. <br /> <br /> It seems that this famous and brilliant movie was created almost by accident. No doubt the director knew exactly what he was doing. But he did it on a low budget. That's the thrill and charm of Film Noir, the real film Noir: it's small, convincingly cheap and, in this case, unforgettable.
