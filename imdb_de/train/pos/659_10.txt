One of the last classics of the French New Wave. The director, Cin√©ste Jean Eustache, drew on the simplicity of early-century cinema. For the story, Eustache relied on the agony of his own complicated love life. So much can be said about this film - watching brilliantly; self-indulgently over-long; occasionally weird emotional stress ... etc. etc. In my opinion, any complaints that can be raised against this film, easily overshadowed by its many strengths. Any movie student, writer, or just anyone who's ready to handle a 3-hour movie without abrupt cuts, music video, soap opera like plot twists, banal dialogues, should definitely watch this movie. Everything is admirable: writing (concise, clever, surprisingly funny), acting (everyone is just perfect in their respective roles) and the simple alignment (the viewer feels like a casual observer inside the movie) makes this movie memorable. This is undoubtedly a movie that stays with you.
