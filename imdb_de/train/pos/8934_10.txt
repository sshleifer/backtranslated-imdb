In L'intrus (The Intruder), you're following two things: who is the intruder and is it a movie or a dream you are watching? The end is so shocking that for a while you have no answer to any of these questions. The intruder appears as different characters, different men in different circumstances, who are not in the scene, so they are friendly or brutally excluded from it, but often without emotional involvement. The main character Louis is a contemptible man. He has rough ways, a certain job and no heart. He needs one and goes after that. He has transplanted a heart and then decides to start a new life. Can this man succeed in his quest for salvation? A guy like this could cut a neck on his neck. You know it, but Claire Denis does not encourage you to judge him. Occasionally there is a young Russian woman - a pretty girl who seems to live somewhere between heaven and earth - who judges him. She can even punish him. But not Denis. There is the character played by Beatrice Dalle who wants nothing to do with him: do not touch me, she says. But Denis lets this man be himself, filming him in his selfish quest. I do not know if what she's filming is the heart or the mind, but it's not the traditional plot. Whatever she films, you'll end up getting it. You know who "the" intruder is, you know more or less why, and some scenes come to your mind with full meaning. But was it a movie or a dream?
