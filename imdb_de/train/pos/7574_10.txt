This is one of the best in the series, with Resident Evil 3: Nemesis (or Biohazard: Last Escape) at the top. The game has a very good story in which you call Claire Redfield in search of her brother Chris Redfield (whom you probably know from the original Resident Evil.) It's as scary as the other Resident Evil and contains a lot of other cutscenes. <br /> <br /> My rating: **** by ***** stars (rating based on comparison with other video games)
