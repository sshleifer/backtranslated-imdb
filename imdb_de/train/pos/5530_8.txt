A must for anyone who loves photography. breathtaking and breathtaking, lets you in ore. have seen it twice in a movie and now on DVD. It sticks well to DVD, but on the big screen this was different. <br /> <br /> I saw my two daughters to see it, and they loved to see it again tonight when they saw it in the video store. His simple telling of a child's love for nature and especially a fox is well told. In a way, it reminded me of the bear by telling a story that was not documentary. which works very well for children. Not preaching is very important, you decide for yourself. <br /> <br /> But the star of this movie are the cinematographs. How did you do what you did? unbelievably incredible.
