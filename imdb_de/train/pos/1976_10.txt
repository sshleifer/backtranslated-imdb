The man who directed "The Third Man" also ran the sequence "Who Will Buy" in "Oliver!" Well, that's talent. <br /> <br /> I take my hat to Carol Reed. <br /> <br /> I know that 'second units' are involved, but still ... <br /> <br /> And he had to deal with Orson Welles and Oliver Reed ... <br /> <br /> I suppose quality will fail. <br /> <br /> (It turns out in the closing scene with Nancy [avoids.] Spoiler - everyone has to see Oliver for the first time at some point].) How many lines do I have to enter. <br /> <br /> If people are asked to over-type, this is not encouraging. <br /> <I hope that counts as "10th line".
