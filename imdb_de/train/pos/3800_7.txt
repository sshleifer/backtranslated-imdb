The world of the dragon hunters is a 3D gravity world. Planetoids, parts of buildings and strange flat plants float in the atmosphere, while the ground on which most of the characters fall is nowhere to be seen. It's a world reminiscent of Neverending Story when nothingness eats away the world. <br /> <br /> Strangely, the bad guy here is the World Gobbler. This time it is a huge skeleton dragon with fiery eyes. Heroes are a tall but silent warrior, an annoying and greedy buddy who manages the duo's entrepreneurial side and a strange, useless animal. You are associated with the most talkative girl in the world who, to my chagrin, did not experience a terrible painful and hopefully untimely death. <br /> <br /> The animation is great. The voices and sounds are first class. Too bad that the story is as simple as you can imagine. They want to stop the World Gobbler, they reach him almost immediately, they defeat him. The end. No real character development or story turns. Not even the ones I would expect from a movie with such an action. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: It's a cute thing to look at, children would probably enjoy it, but that's about it. No depth in this world (pun intended).
