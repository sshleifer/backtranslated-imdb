Lupine travels to Morocco in search of a legendary treasure. His only clue is an interesting gem given to him by an old man. It's a nice place for Lupine, with the desert and the hot, exotic feeling. <br /> <br /> An interesting thing about this movie is that Jigen plays a much smaller role than usual and is generally in a different location than Lupine. On the one hand, their classical dynamics are missing together, but it is a change of tempo. Plus, that way, Lupine can focus on the ladies ... <br /> <br /> Fujiko rules in this. Throughout the film, she seduces Lupine and us viewers. Then there is Lara, the girl of this particular story, and she is very personable. This one has more nudity than any other Lupine anime, which is an entertaining distinction. <br /> <br /> There is a very entertaining, feminine Ninja type who is the best villain in this area, as well as some fun scenes with Fujiko. Of course, Inspector Zenigata is also on a warpath, in good shape. <br /> <br /> Pretty good, that's a quiet ride with lupine. The plot is average and there are some slow spots but overall this movie is a real treat. Enjoy.
