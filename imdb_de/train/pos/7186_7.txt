Many Zorro films have been made over the decades, but it is a shame that one of the best is probably one of the least seen. <br /> <br /> Zorros Fighting Legion is a bit different from other Zorro movies. First of all, it's a republican series in 12 chapters. And this time Zorro is not played by a top studio star like Douglas Fairbanks, Tyrone Power or Antonio Banderas, but by the worker-like actor Reed Hadley. While Hadley does not prioritize the process as much as the others, he does adequate work, aided by the fact that he is not the only hero here; As the title implies, he has a fighting legion to turn to. <br /> <br /> Another big difference is that the venue is not California. The story takes place here in central Mexico in 1824, when a man posing as a living god incites the indigenous population and a band of outlaws to help him in his plan to overthrow the newly formed Mexican republic. Something, Zorro, and a handful of followers plan to do everything to stop. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, there is at least one unbelievably cheesy moment per episode, from a stupid "twang" bow sound effects to ridiculous action. But overall, this represents one of the best series of the Republic of all time, and probably the best Zorro series. <br /> <br /> The action is stronger than most series and will never be incomprehensible or meandering Action fans of the Indiana Jones movies will notice MANY bits from this series.
