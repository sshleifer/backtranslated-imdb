If only Eddie Murphy was born 10 years later. Then we would all remember it. But even I was only 4 when it came out. If you have not seen it yet, rent Dr. Dolittle, Showtime, I Spy, Pluto Nash, and all Eddie's family comedy films - then take a look. No doubt you laugh 90% of the time. The other 10% you wipe the tears from your eyes. <br /> <br /> It really needs to be observed more than once to understand all the jokes. From rough humor to a joke for kids (if you've seen it, you'll laugh here) - you'll love its stuff. If you can (or are a big fan), try downloading clips from Eddie's files. All shows are different than you imagine, and he has even more funny jokes. <br /> <br /> But this is like the "best" of Eddie Murphy's "X-rated" if you want. <Br /> <br /> And all I can say is please not look at Delirious, if you do not like comedy, have no sense of humor, or do not have fun with. They will just drop this great Eddie Murphy classic and possibly miss someone. <br /> <br /> If you want to know how Eddie Beverly Hills got cop and became famous about it - it's Delirious.
