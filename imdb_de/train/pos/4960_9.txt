This movie is a small ray of sunshine in a dark season. It celebrates a quality that is best described as old friendliness. Morgan Freeman plays a character that is very similar to Freeman himself - a successful actor driving 70. He has traveled to a small, rather dirty grocery store to explore a role as manager of such a place. Soon he infatuates the employees and the customers, especially the pretty, if quirky, young woman (Paz Vega), who runs the "10 Items or less" cash register. <br /> <br /> 10 Items or Less does not have a big message to make and does not pretend she's doing it. It follows Freeman and Vega when they become friendly, and when the older man offers his advice in return for a ride home - the movie company who is to pick him up never appears and Freeman has forgotten his own phone number he can not help call. I had a little case of blues on a gray Sunday afternoon in New York City, and that streak cured what hurt me.
