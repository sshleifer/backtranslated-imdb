If you have not seen Eva Longoria from the TV series "Desperate House Wives" you will miss. Eva will be one of the biggest stars in Latina and you will soon see her in the cinemas. This was Eva's first movie and she does a fantastic job as an actress. She was 24 years old when she shot on it, and then looked hot. As far as this low-budget movie is concerned, this is pretty good for the first director to release another movie "Juarez, Mexico," which is currently running at many film festivals in the United States. In fact, there seems to be limited freedom of motion in some news. What would be nice to see is a "Snitch'2" with a higher budget.
