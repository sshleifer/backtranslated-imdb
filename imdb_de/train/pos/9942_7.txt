A good Korean movie not only about taekwondo, but also about what it takes to be good, like the style of a racquet, can not beat a taekwondo guy in his sport. <br /> <br /> The martial arts in the movie is not that good, but it's passable and enjoyable. Friends who continue to achieve something that they once ridiculed become stronger through the mind and heart. This film should not be taken too seriously, as it has slapstick, but it also has a message. <br /> <br /> A good movie from Korea.
