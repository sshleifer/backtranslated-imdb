This is one of the best episodes from the second season of MOH. I think Mick Garris has a problem with women ... He kills everyone, they are often the victims (Screwfly's solution, Pro-Life, Valerie on the stairs, I do not remember the episode of Argento in season 1, etc (obviously imprint) I think he enjoys seeing women burned, tortured and mutilated, and I do not know, "Right to Die" is never one of the best, with good twists and graphics and suspense (especially The acting is like the whole series, regularly I could be the worst like "Pro-Life" or "We're screaming for ice cream." I also think the plot will be made for a movie The episode's ideology is terrible, women are killed and killed, animals mutilated and so on and so on ... In the first season it was better than the second with episodes like "Cigarrette Burns" (Best of all), "Home coming "The funniest)," imprint "(really shocking).
