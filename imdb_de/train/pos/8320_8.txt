Farrah Fawcett spent most of her career after Angels baffling us, occasionally adding a remarkable theatrical performance between her Playboy jokes and Letterman escapades. But when it comes down to it, there's no denying that this girl can act. This well-made TV movie is far from a story of epic proportions, gentle, quiet and occasionally moving. Fawcett plays the headstrong black sheep-daughter, who only comes home to find that she has missed the last days of her life and the funeral of her mother, much to the chagrin of her more stable and probably more sensible sister. Brad Johnson plays the love interest, and a story unfolds with all the typical elements of the telefilm drama - but then there's always that confusing farrah to look at, and it's indeed perfectly observable. (And yes, I admit it, I had this Farrah poster on my wall back then). Silk Hope receives three and a half stars (out of five) on the Corkymeter. Bosley would be proud.
