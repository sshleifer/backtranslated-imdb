I saw this movie last year at the Taos Film Festival and was just overwhelmed. It is a rich, warm-hearted novel that is brought to the screen, looks beautiful and well-directed. It particularly reminded me of David Lean's films, both in terms of the ability to handle a complex story and the ability to create powerful scenes that affect you on different levels. The best movie I have seen in years.
