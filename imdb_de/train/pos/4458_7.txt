This has some excellent spots, but the length of the film can not sustain the thin wafer application. It's another sailor on vacation, zippier than Astaire's 'Follow the Fleet', but not as good as 'On The Town'. <br /> <br /> Kathryn Grayson is bland, but Kelly and Sinatra work well together. Their "If you Knew Susie" number is weird when they make the song while they sing it. 'I Betted Her' is also fun with Sinatra, showing how skilled he was when hoofing. Sinatra's solo songs are boring and seem to be inserted to present his singing rather than as part of the story. Fortunately, there are savvy actors like Grady Sutton, Rags Ragland, Carlos Ramirez and Pamela Britton and an unlikely but unwavering Jose Iturbi who observes himself third-party bill and it's interesting to see how he interacts with children, something Astaire never did Has. Dean Stockwell plays a kid who wants to be in the Navy, and attacks the Kelly character. He also visits a school where he tells the children a fictional story from his life in the Pomeranian (!) Marine, which leads to his wonderful dance with an animated Jerry Mouse. In another scene he dances a charming Mexican hat dance with Sharon McManus, a little girl with sublime faces who is adorable and sweet. <br /> <br /> Very pleasant then a little too long. A taste of better musicals.
