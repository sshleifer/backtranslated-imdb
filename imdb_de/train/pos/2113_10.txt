The location of the store around the corner is specified at the beginning of the film in Balta Street in Budapest, but it could be anywhere. The small number of sets reflects a Central European design, but could be a shop around every corner. The film is not about Budapest or leather goods retail, but about the ups and downs of love that are reflected in most of the main characters. Letters to each other are full of hope and ambition and romance, and the story deviates from those two To bring aspects together nicely. Hugo Matuschek, the owner of the store, has problems with his wife, she has only one voice at the end of the phone. Ferencz Vadas has a secret affair. Ilona Novodny has a gentleman friend who buys her fur clothes. Mr. Pirovitch's life revolves around his wife and children. Pepi Katona plays a girl at Christmas for Christmas. They even feel the calm Flora Katchuck as she stays home with her mother's dreams at home. <br /> <br /> The script is a masterpiece of comedy and drama. It moves effortlessly from scene to scene. It's one of those quiet movies that keep coming back, simple yet profound. The dialogue reflects the speaking character that is not common nowadays. <br /> <br /> The spectacle is great. Even the minor characters such as the waiter in the caf√© and the policeman on the street are perfect. James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan are playing out perfectly. At that time he had really gotten on as an actor and gives a sweet and sharp performance. Margaret Sullavan was a terrific actor and was very much appreciated these days. Some of her other films are worth a look. Frank Morgan is unbelievable as Mr. Matuschek. His moment of truth is very moving. Gold stars around the cast. <br /> <br /> It's a worn-out phrase that they do not do it the way they used to do it. In that case, it's true. The director Lubitsch is not grateful in the Farce mode, but delivered a classic film of spirit, charm and heartfelt humanity.
