I knew about it, but had never seen Gray Gardens before I saw the eponymous Broadway musical. Friends warned me that the musical would not make sense if I had not seen the movie. That did, but I also rented the movie. At first I thought it was a train accident, full of strange, screeching characters, and it was extremely hard to watch. But being able to stop, digest, and go back, I realized why Gray Gardens is a memorable documentary. <br /> <br /> Both Big Edie and Little Edie are memorable and their complete lack of self-esteem is testimony. Both remain very beautiful despite their age. You have a relationship that will cool any woman (and certainly some men) and make you re-examine your own dealings with your mother. In a time when reality television and cinema are commonplace, it is fascinating to see the work of the Mayleses from three decades, and to realize what influence the film must have had: how could they get their family into such agony ? But how could two people living in the 1970s escape reality completely? Or were they just too crazy to be helped? I would highly recommend watching this with the commentary track, which gave me additional insights into the movie.
