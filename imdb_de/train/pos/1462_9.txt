In this documentary we meet Roger, the rich manager of a factory in China that manufactures beads and other trinkets that are sold in Mardi Gras in New Orleans and traded. Roger claimed that the factory girls love their work and are grateful for the opportunities, but interviews with four of them tell a different story. The dreary life of the girl stands in stark contrast to the bizarre excesses of Mardi Gras itself. The filmmaker David Redmon should be commended for that he will receive excellent and rare footage of everyday life in a Chinese factory site and a revealing interview with the head of the US American company, which imports and sells the pearls, has led in front of the camera. The film is told convincingly and clearly serves as a window, what's behind the ubiquitous "Made in China" - puts labels.
