Before we start, I am afraid of dentists. This movie makes me scary and even makes me flinch. I like that movie. The movie is kind of boring. For this I prefer 3 stars! <br /> <br /> * Spoiler Alert * <br /> <br /> The film revolves around Dr. Alan Feinstone, who found out that his wife cheated on him. Soon he has hallucinations and tortures his patients, kills colleagues, and he even tortured his wife to death and killed the man he had an affair with. * End spoiler * <br /> <br /> The movie is very bloody and bloody. I would recommend it if you are in Gore. <br /> <br /> I give this movie 7 out of 10 stars. Dr. Alan Feinstein is not a normal dentist for everyday life!
