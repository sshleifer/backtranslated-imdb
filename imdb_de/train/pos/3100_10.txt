At the end of the first hour, my jaw nestled comfortably between my feet. The movie never lasts and I never never say. It can be a mild action, but it is an action. Again every member of the cast suits perfectly. The explosions were realistic, the chases were feasible and the fighting was unbelievable. Matt Damon will forever be Jason Bourne. <br /> <br /> All I have to say is that every Bourne movie gets better and this is no exception. The action, the stakes, the plot. How they do that, I'll never know. I applaud the man who wrote the screen for each of these films. Because if he had not done such a good job with the first movie, we would not have any of this movie. <br /> <br /> So do not go to the cinemas, but to the cinemas. If it's still out there, where you live, but if Bourne does not come home to you on December 11th!
