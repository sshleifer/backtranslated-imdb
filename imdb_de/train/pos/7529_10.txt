Two years had passed and mostly everyone looks different, some for the good and others for the bad. I still had so much fun like the original. <br /> <br /> Some mistakes they had, even though they had liked to exchange the Joker, he does not have red lips now and looks like blacker hair and black pupils, is still pronounced by Mark Hamill, that's one Plus, I think. They made Poison Ivy whiter, suggesting that it is becoming more of a plant and Catwomen looks a lot different and is not as "attractive" as the original. <br /> <br /> Although costumes like Batman, Batgirl and Killer Croc and Scarecrow look bad, especially Scarecrow. <br /> <br /> The show is not as dark as the original, because Batman does not work as lonely as before. Most of the time she worked with Batgirl and the new Robin, Tim Drake. While NightWing (Dick Grayson) often comes to the rescue. Batman gave up the yellow logo and the black wing on his suit and seemed to have grown a bit taller but still had a great butt. <br /> <br /> The show is not as good as the original, mainly because of some of the reworked characters, but the stories are as exciting as ever and the dialogue is still elite. "Over the Edge" could be one of the greatest Batman episodes ever. So make sure you take a closer look. <br /> <br /> Total 8-9 / 10
