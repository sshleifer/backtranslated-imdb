If the Lion King is a serious story about a young lion growing up to avenge the death of his father, the Lion King 1 and 1 is the complete opposite, full of humor and jubilation. The Lion King told the story of Simba, the young lion, 1 Â½ years old from the point of view of Timone and Pumbaa, an imperfect duo consisting of a Meercat who left the house because he could not dig tunnels, without burying his tunnel friends and neighbors and a warthog that has a smell problem. The film has little substance, but Disney manages to fill the time with various sketches with Timone and Pumbaa while "watching" the film with us. My favorite is the sing-along that happens in the middle of the movie. Make sure you see the bouncing error! Disney has announced one and a half as "the rest of the story," though it really is not. It's just another perspective of The Lion King, without all the serious stuff that has permeated the second half of the original Disney classic. We thank Nathan Lane as Timone and Ernie Sabella as Pumbaa for their language work. Without her efforts, the movie may not have worked. The singing, they entertain and make us laugh. They also give us a reason to avoid a whirlpool with warthog.
