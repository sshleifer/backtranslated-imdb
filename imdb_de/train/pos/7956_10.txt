This is simply a classic movie in which the human voices of animals are truly what they think. I do not know if my video copy is missing a scene, but it never shows how the dogs came out of the box. It also shows a survival instinct of the animals and tracking capabilities. If humans are in the same position, the helicopters would be disabled. For once, an original movie is enhanced by a remake because the synchronization for the first movie has been removed. Only the use of animals can work in a film of this kind, because the use of humans would have to season the story with a murder, proving that animals are more interesting than humans
