I never knew of a movie that caused such a debate in my life. Believe me, when I say that this movie will someday be remembered as a classic of all time. I've waited in anticipation of this movie as I had previously loved both Lock, Stock .... and Snatch, but after some negative reviews, I thought I was very disappointed. I absolutely loved this movie and can not wait to see it again. This movie is fundamentally different from the two aforementioned Ritchie movies and is much better as well. I have a selection of favorite directors, but none of them has taken a step as much as Guy Ritchie has just made this film. I think he has taken the film to another level (I know that most people will laugh at this comment calling the reaction to this film, but I think time will prove me right). This movie is very confusing and takes much longer than the approximately 2 hour runtime as I could not stop thinking about it or trying to put things together. I now have a pretty good view of everything that's going on in this movie (some answers from endless hours of thinking, some answers from reading other films) and can not wait until Sunday when I see him again. I just hope people with an open mind go to the cinema and hopefully get rewarded, like me and many others.
