This movie is far better than the original The Jerk. I highly recommend it to anyone who likes quirky humor. We included almost as many lines from this movie in our daily discourse as Monty Python. <br /> <br /> The card game with the hobos and then Mr. Suicide. The scene at the dining table and his dislike of turtle soup. The original The Jerk was choreographed and staged. While I like Steve Martin, he seemed to be trying. The Jerk Too is a parody and is enjoyed by everyone. The Jerk Too is family-friendly unlike the original The Jerk.
