This movie was almost a great imaginative movie. A mix of Shakespearean, pop, jazz and fairy tales. This film was an imaginative variation of the Cinderella theme. With a strong cast, led by the perfect cast of Kathleen Turner, this movie had everything that mattered. Everything except production values. I almost never think that a movie needs special effects or big budgets, but with an outstanding production like this one, it had the same dubious quality as any other made for a television movie. In addition to better cinematography, this movie was almost perfect. <br /> <br />
