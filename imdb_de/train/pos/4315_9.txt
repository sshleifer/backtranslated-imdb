I just watched this movie again and am still upset about the number of cynics dismissing it as New Age pap. A great movie that takes time to evolve, it is increasingly approaching the edge, but never becomes and is ultimately meditative, poignant, and livelier than most movies that people who reject their "coincidences" can see , I was angry at the time when films like "Prince of Tides" and "Bugsy" (though I liked the latter) were nominated for Best Picture this year (not to mention that "Silence of the Lambs" won) ) and that this was completely ignored except for a nomination for the best script. I think the story supports my first reaction!
