This is a very entertaining movie considering the budget and its length. The plot is barely touched in the film world and also brought with it a sense of novelty. The acting was great (P'z to Dom) and also the camera was very well done. I can recommend this movie to anyone looking forward to thriller, it will not disappoint you!
