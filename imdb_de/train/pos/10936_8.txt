Most of the '70s and' 80s martial arts of Kong Kong hardly work as films. Usually there are some well-planned combat sequences, but the plot is pretty thin to fill in the gaps between these nodes - like porn movies. Really. <br /> <br /> But this one does some good things. The most obvious is the direction and choreography that limits each fighter to a "style" - it's really based on Chinese circus acrobatics and comedic theater, but the effect works. Secondly, there is the language of the camera, which uses some impressive techniques (even by today's standards) that change real-time slow-motion projection rates and unfiltered to filtered views to show the direction of the story towards the past or toward the future. <br /> <br /> At least open, but the strongest and most unexpected is the construction. The winner of this competition is determined by who "unfolds" the story. The master (the author) builds up a game in which the main character does not know whom to look for. This is the same situation that viewers are in. One by one, he determines who is who, and as fast as we who is who. It all follows a tragedy / noir arc. The end tends to irony, a la "The Sting". Much smarter stuff than what we normally get from this genre. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​"five poisons" is the template for Tarantino's "Deadly Viper Murderers" from the "Kill Bill" volumes.
