The world is a terrible place. But this movie is farce and fun. And if you do not like it, you do not understand it ... and if you do not understand it ... it does not matter. It's up to you if you want to play. Every actor in this movie had fun. It's just a joke. And that's good enough for me. Gabriel Byrne is priceless. Byrne and Paul Anka, who play MY WAY, are, as "Vic" says, "... the best version of all time". Okay ... it's not a masterpiece, but it's not bad. I warned against seeing it, but I am sure glad I did.
