For those who have seen Disney Productions only in a beautifully animated version of "Beauty & The Beast" or even the surreal fairytale vision of Jean Cocteau, this French version (with a director from Poland) from 1975 will be surprised. The conspiracy concerns a French family of fading aristocracy who fit into a wealthy English family. The main catch is that the groom carries an old curse on the family. The movie also contains many flashback sequences (possibly) that explain this family curse. From the opening balance to the end, it's an almost endless erotic fun ride with VERY explicit and graphic sexual content (hence the X-rating of the film in the US is in its first edition, which is not rated now). The somewhat contemptuous feeling of the film in the ruling class is likely to recall Bunuel's flights to a similar area. If you have a predilection for the really bizarre and are not offended by "taboo" material, this movie can scratch that itch for you.
