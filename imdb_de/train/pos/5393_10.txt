I was probably one of the few Australians who did not see tennis when this series aired. I must say, when William McInnes first appeared, I thought, this is a crappy actor! But as the series continued, he reduced his performance and I totally loved him. He was such a damned guy, but he made me laugh. I watched the show to see Hugo Speers (Heart and Bone, The Full Monty) and Tom Long (SeaChange, Two Hands). It was interesting to see Speers playing a nice, quiet man and even more interesting to see Tom Long's curling muscles! Sigh ... Seriously, the performance of Long was a total shock and really brilliant. He stole the show. Martin Sacks was also good in a small role, and the lead actress performed a fun performance. I would recommend this program if you enjoy stories with a twist and want to watch Tom Long while walking without a shirt ...
