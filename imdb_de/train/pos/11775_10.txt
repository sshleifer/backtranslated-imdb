Together with "Hare Tonic" this is considered one of the best bugs cartoons, in fact one of the best bugs of all time. There are some comments on how bugs are "basic" in these cartoons, meaning that they are not fully developed yet. I prefer this "base" version from the mid-40s (Chuck Jones was the best version), which actually has more rabbit size and is far more amusing than the later leggy version that stood above Yosemite Sam and Daffy Duck. The bugs of the last days were for my taste too polite and demanding. Also check out "Hair Raising Hare" (1946) and "Rabbit Punch" (1948) for great examples of classic bugs and the classic Chuck Jones.
