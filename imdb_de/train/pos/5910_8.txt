OK, OK, do not bend out of the round. I was a joke. <br /> <br /> "Bustin 'Out" is actually a better and more true title. <br /> <br /> Racism and thrillers get the satirical treats meant by our X-rated entertainer friend Ralphie Young. And he does a better job here. <br /> <br /> At the crime front, it shows the truth. They build it up, defend it, then boredom and stronger rivals cause them (perhaps) to lose it. See for yourself what's going down. <br /> <br /> racist? I dont know. Since Scatman (RIP) and the Love Walrus (also RIP) were black and the most important point of view, I considered it mainly as an attack on racism. The fact that Richard Pryor liked it says so too. And the younger Phil Mike Thomas (in front of "Miami Vice") was a nice surprise. <br /> <br /> It's an animated "Blacksploitation" movie. It's good. Well done and well done. It'll be a bit windy (like the lynch scene), but unfortunately it's based on facts. <br /> <br /> But Ralphie really REALLY should reconsider this title.
