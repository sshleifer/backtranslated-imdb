This documentary depicts the life of Big and Little Edie Beale, a mother and daughter who lived as a hermit in her family mansion in East Hampton, NY, from the mid-50s to the late 1970s. When the filmmakers find them, the mansion breaks up and the women, one 78 and the other 56, share a miserable room. The older Edie Beale is the aunt of Jackie Kennedy Onassis and the younger is her first cousin. The women were originally supposed to be driven out of the house because of the poor condition, but Jackie sent them money for repairs so they could live there. <br /> <br /> Sometimes, like any woman, this movie may seem exploitative in the best sense of mental health, but at other times it's hard to look the other way. "Little" Edie accuses her mother of her present condition, and her mother fights back that Edie would never be the success she thought he was. "Little" Edie often seems trapped in the past, focusing on decisions she made decades ago, and loves showing pictures of her youth when she was clearly a beautiful debutante. Her mother seems more ready for her destiny to live the rest of her life in terrible conditions. There is clear evidence of the glamorous life that once led both women, from the pictures showing a happy family, to the great portrait of the elderly Edie by her bed. After all, what we see of the house is that most of the rooms are empty, the walls are breaking and falling apart, and "Little" Edie leaves food in the attic so the raccoons can feel comfortable. And of course many cats are running around. <br /> <br /> At heart, this documentary is incredibly sad. While neither of the two women seems particularly depressed, the misery they live in is absolutely terrible. It is not very clear if there is even running water in the house, and one gets the impression that they were essentially abandoned by their family. <br /> <br /> As a documentary, however, the film is a miracle and is highly recommended.
