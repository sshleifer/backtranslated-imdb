It is noteworthy that for "Young Mr. Lincoln's" supporting players, Ford plays lesser-known actors, with the exception of stars. This not only reinforces the focus of his film on the central figure of Lincoln, but also gives the audience a refreshing glimpse of Lincoln as a man of his time and place, a man who, like us, is relentless in the problems and life feelings of his time and seek his way to solve them. It is not so much through Fonda's words and deeds, but in the faces, the reactions of the supporting players that Ford describes the story of the emergence of the Lincoln's young world view, a sense of place in society and for the community, and how that People responded to Mr. Lincoln's words and deeds, trusting in the man they deserved for their respect and attention. <br /> <br /> Give it a try: Instead of focusing on Henry Fonda, you'll see 'Young' next time. Mr. Lincoln shifted his focus to the minor characters - I believe they will be valued more deeply Rewarded enough for Lincoln and Ford. I like to think that Ford's narration about the minor characters 'reactions to Fondas Lincoln may have appealed to David Lean when he referred Omar Sharif to' Doctor Zhivago ', where the secondary characters' reactions to Zhivago actually do tell about Zhivago.
