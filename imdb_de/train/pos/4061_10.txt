This is the best dub I've ever heard of Disney, as well as the best adaptation since the biggest misuse of soundtracks, themes, characters, and dialogs in the Kiki Delivery Service. Urrrghhh <br /> <br /> This has a different atmosphere, especially the deviation from the ordinary heroine. He has both hero and heroine (though I do not really support the use of hero and heroine here, since Miyazaki has no stereotype and no common theme). As usual, after being introduced by Spirited Away, amazed by Mononoke, troubled by Grave of Fireflies and deeply moved by Majo no Takkyuubin, this one begins with some doubt in my part. I wonder if this will be the first Ghibi dude. Well, in the end, just like Only Yesterday and Whisper of the Heart, I ended up with 10 points. I would give 9.8 points, but the extra 0.2 is there to share the good feeling by encouraging people to watch the movie. the lonely robot, the abandoned place and ends with the destruction. It's as if humanity really could not live with too much power. The collapsing scene brought me spots of Metropolis to the end. It's just kind of sad. The storyline is obvious in most reviews and soundtrack rules (as always). Joe Hisaishi really belongs to Uematsu, Kanno, Williams caliber. People who can bring a movie, a game, an event to life, even through the amazing composition a lasting moment. <br /> <br /> This is a good feeling movie that was part of the US Cinema during the Classic Days (It's a wonderful life, etc.). Well, things are changing ....
