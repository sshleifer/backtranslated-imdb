Man in Flames, is definitely one of the best drama / thriller I've ever seen. Despite a slow start, the story is so amazingly complex and sensitive that it holds together pretty well. This is Denzel Washington's perfect role in playing a bodyguard called Creasy, tormented by his past and an alcoholic, who never abandons his duty to save his new protégé, Pita. Dakota Fanning plays Pita, the very smart, enthusiastic little girl who loves so many things and acts very convincingly. She has a great future ahead of her. As I said, the story is a bit complicated to fully understand, you have to look at it a few times. <br /> <br /> This movie has two parts, the first hour everyone is happy. Nothing is wrong, everyone just lives happily until Pita is kidnapped and Creasy is almost killed. And then there's the second part, the rest of the movie where suddenly everything gets complicated and gets a bit cruel and disturbing as Creasy recovers from his severe injury and hunts and kills the numerous criminals and "La Hermamdad" who are planning for it were responsible and carry out the kidnapping of Pita. <br /> <br /> Denzel Washington shows us his cutting edge acting talents alongside many other talented actors who have a great future ahead of them. It is a pity that this film was not recognized enough. Washington earned another Oscar for his performance. Fanning and the director were too. And maybe the visual effects, which were of a very high quality. <br /> <br /> If you like excellent, slightly distracted, thrilling thrillers, this is the place to go. The most amazing thing is that elements of this movie are actually based on a real story and real characters! 10/10
