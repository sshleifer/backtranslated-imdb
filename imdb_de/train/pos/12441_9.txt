That was the modesty we did not know! It was hinted at and summarized in the comic strip so that the syndicates could sell newspapers! Lee and Janet Batchler were real Modesty Blaise fans who were awarded The Dream Job - tell a prequel story by Modesty that fans have never seen before. In their audio commentary, they admitted that they had made changes to their origins to make the story smoother. The "purists" should also note that we really do not know if everything she has said to Miklos is true because she is "standing still for a while". I did not rent or borrow the DVD like other "reviewers", I bought them! And I do not want a refund! I have seen it three times and have not slept! Great dialogues and well drawn characters that I worried about (even the evil Miklos), just like in the novels and comics! I can not wait for the next movie by Modesty (and Willie), especially if this "prequel" is a sign of what's coming!
