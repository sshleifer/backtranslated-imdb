The debut of Claire Denis is courageous and confident. In this portrayal of life towards the end of the French colonialist Cameroon, she explores the relationships between men and women, black and white. <br /> <br /> With the black servant 'Prot√©e' as the main object of desire and oppression The movie enters taboo from the beginning. Denis creates a picture of life through a series of character relationships that fix the informed viewer on the screen. The mood of the film is perfectly captured by the camera work and (missing) lighting. <br /> <br /> A great discourse.
