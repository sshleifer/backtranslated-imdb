There are many police dramas that make the rounds. I do not know why. It probably has something to do with the old basic theme of good versus evil. <br /> <br /> This film has a documentary style as we follow the difficult introduction of Anne, a pure recruit, to a police force in the Baltics. No attempt is made to charm the police. They are really down to earth, sometimes tough and unyielding, but Anne has a soft heart, maybe a little more understanding of the human condition. Contrary to all the rules, it sometimes holds incriminating information found during streak searches and other investigations. <br /> <br /> This is not a nice movie. Not to relax. There is not much optimism. The police seems to be involved in a lost battle. Tomorrow will see more assassinations, more murders, more family breakdowns and more desperate children. Let's be honest. This is the world in which we live. <br /> <br /> As the days go by, Anne becomes more intimate with the police and the families they inspect. The only real warmth in the film is that of Benny, a 12-year-old character from a broken family. Anne has her own way of repairing things. She closes Benny's shoplifting eye and tries to help him as much as possible. I was surprised, however, that she went so far as to seduce Benny's father. It asked me if it was the father or his own needs. Finally, the film makes it clear that she urgently needed a partner and loving children. <br /> <br /> Well occupied, but not my idea of ​​an evening entertainment.
