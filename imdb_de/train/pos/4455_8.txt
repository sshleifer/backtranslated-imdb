Although I liked On the Town better, I really liked it. I'm a freshman when it comes to Frank Sinatra and Gene Kelly. Although I had heard of them, until recently I had never seen anything. The first one I saw was Singin in the Rain, which made me a fan of Gene. I think that's better too. But I thought this movie is good and like all the movies there are some parts that are better than others, but in my book it's a great movie and I love it. Frank and Gene form a good team. I have not seen her together yet. Take me to the ball game. But I stay with my weapons and say that I really enjoyed it and that I love it!
