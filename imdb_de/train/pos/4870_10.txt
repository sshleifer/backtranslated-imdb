The movie celebrates life. <br /> <br /> The world is adjusting to the innocent and the pure and everything has "happy ending", just like in the final scene of the movie. <br /> <br /> The film has a wonderful soundtrack, a mixture of Serbian neofolk, gypsy music and jazz. <br /> <br /> This film is a very refreshing piece of visual poetry. I sucked in another colorful, romantic and sometimes rough world. <br /> <br /> How Mr. Kusturica should be the movie.
