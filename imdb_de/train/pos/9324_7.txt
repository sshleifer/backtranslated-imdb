I've read a few reviews and am somehow sad that many of the stories are gone. It's easy to do because it's not a book, it's a movie and there's only so much that can be done in a movie - in the US or Canada - or anywhere else. <br /> <br /> Colm Feore makes it at least for a recovery "F @ g-Hag" like me, a great job not only to play the gay man of the "friendly neighborhood" but to play sick. I mean, the man really can not grow paler! You may never know it from the Strip near the ... um. <br /> <br /> If you are a little decrepit, there are a few sking movies you might like. <br /> <br /> As the daughter of a recovering alcoholic, the drug-pilot {David Cubitt} was the trick for me. I'll believe him, he grew up fast - and believe me, that's good. As an aspiring author, Moimeme, I can dig up many of his insights and reviews. But I'm more prosy than poetry. <br /> <br /> I like it easy, but I enjoyed it. A beautiful story that was pretty well put together - by the Canadians, a surprise. I just thwarted the line of the "Movie of the Week" because it was not pumped out that way, GREATLY appreciated. And it was pretty clever.
