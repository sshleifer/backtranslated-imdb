The man, who is often tagged as a comedy, does more than just a giggle here and there. <br /> <br /> Sidney Stratton is an eccentric inventor who does not have the chance to unfold his inventions the world because nobody pays him, he's just one or the other job worker who sees the place, so to speak. After showing up in the Birnley textile factory, he uses his laboratory to invent a fabric that not only never wears out, but never needs to be cleaned. He is first called a genius, and those who ignored him at first suddenly want a big chunk of him, but then the fate of an out-of-control industry is wrenching and becoming more frightening. <br /> <Yes, the movie is very funny, some scenes are damn funny, but it's the satirical advantage of the film that sets the scene above the norm. The contradictions regarding the advent of technology are a crucial issue here. Do we want inventions that save us money during the closure of industries? You just have to see what happened to the UK coal industry to know what I'm doing. The decade the film was filmed is a crucial point that states that producing nuclear weapons was more than hearsay. Science developed to alarmingly new proportions. You see this movie and see the rapid turn of events for the main protagonist Stanley, from a hero to an enemy in a bad shot, a victim of his own pursuit of better humanity! It's so dark that the movie The Man In The was called Black Suit. <br /> <br /> I honestly can not find anything wrong in this movie. The script of Roger MacDougall, John Dighton and director Alex Mackendrick could be filmed today and would not be inappropriate is the sharpness and thinking of the mind. The sound and the setting are enormous, the direction is seamless and the sound shift is accomplished by Mackendrick. Some scenes are just wonderful, one tugs at the heart strings and brings to some scene 29 years later in David Lynch's Elephant Man, and yet, after such a downturn of events, the film still manages to bless the genius of Alec Guinness, who Let the movie fade away so that viewers not only reflect on Stanley's future, but also the rest of us in this fast-growing world. <br /> <br /> A timeless masterpiece, themed and as a work of art, 10/10.
