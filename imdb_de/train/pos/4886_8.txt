The last of the blond bombshells is an entertaining bit of fluff. Judy Dench plays Elizabeth, a freshly widowed woman with loose ends. She spent most of her life being the dutiful wife and mother, but never really happy. Shortly after her husband's funeral, Elizabeth regularly bids her kids bats when she sees a street artist. This brings back memories of the time she was a member of an all-girl swing band in London during the Second World War. We soon learn that the band was not exactly a girl, as the drummer was a man dressed as a woman ala Some Like It Hot. Elizabeth takes off her saxophone (which she secretly practiced during her marriage)) and joins the guitar-playing street musician. Elizabeth is a lot more talented than the guitarist, and the money flows in. She does not take money because she is rich and does not need it. Their play is exclusively for artistic fulfillment. <br /> <br /> Elizabeth is one day seen by Patrick (Ian Holm), the band's drummer. It looks like Patrick was and is the man of the ladies, and Elizabeth - only fifteen at the time - was the only band member who did not experience Patrick's "talents" except drumming. <br /> <br /> Elizabeth is inspired by her granddaughter to reunite the old group to play for the granddaughter's school dance. So a wonderful journey through memory begins in combination with aspects of a humorous road trip movie - all with really good swing and blues. <br /> <br /> I think I'm at the age where I really enjoy older actresses doing their stuff, and this movie is a treasure chest, seeing not only Judi Dench Stars, but also Olympia Dukakis , Leslie Caron and a number of veteran British character actresses. This is rounded off by the extraordinary voice of Cleo Laine. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's downy, but totally adorable and very entertaining.
