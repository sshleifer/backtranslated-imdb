As a big fan of Japanese singers Gackt and Hyde, I was terribly upset when I found out that they had made a movie together, and made it my mission in life to see him. I was not disappointed. In fact, this film has far exceeded my expectations. I knew that both Gackt and Hyde were more vocal actors than actors. Although I was prepared for courageous, but not really fulfilling performances. However, I am pleased that both have managed to captivate me and believe the story. Moon Child has just the right amount of humor, action, romance and serious, heartbreaking moments. I can not say that I've cried more in a movie, and these tender moments are admirably proven by the couple in my view and definitely prove their ability as an actor. The fighting scenes are absolutely stunning and although there are some moments of uncertainty, you are quick in the movie and begin to connect with the characters. I highly recommend this movie to anyone, especially those who are fans of Gackt and Hyde.
