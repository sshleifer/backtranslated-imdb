This western is made in a different way than most others. Realism is the key here. Conchata Farrell comes to Wyoming to work on his ranch for Rip Torn. How this is presented makes up a very interesting piece of Americana. I would rather have seen this on the big screen than on tape, but it's worth seeing how life in the West really was. The cinematography is excellent. Solid 9. Torn & Farrell excel in this movie.
