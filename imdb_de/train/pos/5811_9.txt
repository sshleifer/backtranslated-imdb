Only a 9/10 of me, a perfect ten would have been if the movie would contain more action, but still remains Moonwalker to this day a fun party of music, dance and entertainment. Beginning with the montage of video clips from Jackson's long career, it reminds the viewer why he is often considered the "King of Pop." From his hit "I want you back" to "We are the World", the award-winning charity record for Africa. After this short film, which is considered lackluster in an Oscar-winning screenplay, it still offers a fantastic and entertaining drama for the audience. End a perfect (sexy!) Rendition of 'Come Together'. Something that the whole family can observe and enjoy.
