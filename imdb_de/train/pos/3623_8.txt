Disney could only have something to offer here. First, they had "Remember the Titans" with Denzel, a story based on sports and a small town in Central America. Well, with Quaid and The Rookie ... another sports story based on the truth. <br /> <br /> Both movies sometimes bring you tears and they both make you smile and feel warm after seeing them. My wife and I recorded The Rookie and we expected it to be a great movie. We were not disappointed when asked if we would buy this on DVD, if it came out, it was a breeze. Most definitely.
