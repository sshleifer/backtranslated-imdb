Some movies seem to be done before we are ready for them. When I saw this film from 1988 and 1999, I thought I was going to O.J. Simpson debacle (though I have very different opinions about the innocence of individuals in every situation). The Australian news media, if this film is to be believed, consumed the case of possible infanticide and truth was left behind. It was scary to see the scenes of invasive, swarming media hordes, ridiculous reports of half-truths and lies, and debates about the alleged merits of the case of individuals at all levels of society. Equally appalling is the presentation of the media as indifferent and incomprehensible of the technical information in the case. I wish more of the issue of religious prejudice in the case (the defendants are Seven Day Adventists). These circuses have become commonplace today, but that makes the lesson even more important. <Br /> <br /> Streep is excellent as always and that's the best thing I've ever seen. The Australian accents are sometimes a bit thick, but not incomprehensible.
