This step actually made me jump out of my chair, in anticipation of what the actors would do! Acting was the best, Farrah should have won an Oscar, she was fabulous for that. James Russo was so good that I hated him, that he was the bad guy and played it wonderfully. There are not many films that have fascinated me so much. The cast was great. Alfie looked shocked with the big eyes that looked like a victim to Farrah, and you saw her terror again as she went through it. Farrah made you feel like you were there, feeling the same anger she felt she wanted to hurt, but you also knew it was the wrong thing. The movie took you on a roller coaster ride and you went up and down with each scene.
