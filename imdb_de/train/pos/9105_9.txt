Women have never been as attractive and pathetic as in Salazar's film Piedras. Although editing the editor here and there might help the film, it is exciting and enjoyable as Pedro Almodovar's latest films have an intense touch. 5 different women cope with their male partners and families. Starting with various stories that will gather in the course of the plot, Salazar portrays his female characters in the same neurotic and cross-border behavior that Almodovar is known for. A kleptomaniac high society lady with thick to small shoes, a burlesque housewife caring for her disabled daughter, a drug addicted dancer, obsessed with her former boyfriend, and a taxi driver who cared for the distraught children of her deceased husband, all of them through the streets grazed Madrid in well-designed scenes. With some well-known actresses of Almodovar, the director manages to give depth to all the characters who share the film in his first film and to genuinely sympathize with each one of them. The women control the storyline, and the men are inevitably left alone, after all ... Surprisingly good for a first movie and worth in every way. It is striking that Salazar has delayed some necessary guidelines for the actresses, but the screen is showing an impressive plot anyway, especially by Monica Cervera, who starred in his earlier short film. <br /> <br /> A must for all Almodovar fans, and fun for everyone.
