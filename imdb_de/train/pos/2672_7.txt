"Journey of Hope" tells the story of a poor Turkish family and their odyssey of hope, which falls into despair as they travel to Switzerland in search of prosperity. Although the Oscar-winning movie is pretty well made, it lacks substance and there are many implausibilities. Much of the film's 1.7 hours is to get on the bus, get off the bus, get on the boat, get off the boat, get in the van, get out of the van, etc. Time that could have been better spent or left out altogether. History has a predictable conclusion, especially for those who are aware of the frequent crime of illegal trafficking in illegal immigrants. A rewarding and quite entertaining watch, but overrated.
