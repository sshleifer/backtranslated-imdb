I remember seeing this movie a long time ago, even though it had no special effects, the acting was really good. And it still has the same message for today, even if the technology has changed, maybe they should make a remake of this movie, it would be interesting to see a remake. I also enjoyed the music from the movie. Larry Norman was a really good songwriter at the time, though most Christian music is now worship and worship. I've always been curious to know what happened to Patty after the series ended. Did she shoot more movies, did she eventually marry and start a family? I would like to have an update.
