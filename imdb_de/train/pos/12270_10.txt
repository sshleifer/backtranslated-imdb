I've searched for this movie for years, apparently it's not available here in the US, so he bought me a copy of Ebay. Four young hunters and three of their girlfriends venture into the forest and look for a bear that has apparently killed several campers. What they find is a Vietnamese veterinarian who has gone crazy (he kills some of his victims with a metal long finger nails glove a la Freddy Krueger). As night falls, one of the girls goes for a walk with her boyfriend, she is killed. After one of the group has found their body, they all hide in their tents and wait for daylight. As the sun rises, everyone tries to make it, but they fall victim one by one. <br /> <br /> Seven bodies, not much blood, but some good killings, especially the girls. Deaths The boys are killed in a bloodless manner (blown up in the car, shot, knife through the head). <br /> <br /> Overall, INFERNAL TRAP is a beautiful slasher movie from the late '80s. Nothing new, just played well, fast and some pretty ladies. 10 out of 10.
