Henry Fool surprised me. I did not expect it to entertain and amuse just as well as it did. Fay Grim continues to surprise that she continues a story she does not seem to need. However, once the viewer watches the first 20 minutes of the movie, he blindly realizes that this is one of the BEST sequels to the brilliant indie movie. At least as good as Ginger Snaps Back, if not better. <br /> <br /> I am a little disappointed that Jeff Goldblum's part is so small, but I am happy that he is part of this short distance. As Agent Fulbright, he is convincing and enjoyable. Another pleasure is Liam Aiken, who portrays Ned Grim, the son of Fay and Henry. <br /> <br /> This movie is a pleasure for many reasons. For example, I'm happy to find out that Henry is not really the loser he seems (until the end of Fool), and further figuring out that he really is a genius ... well, that's really lovely pen stroke. <br /> <br /> I hope they make a third ... like the end of the trilogy. It seems to be missing. They should authorize Ned Fool Grim, and Liam should be looking for his father to confirm the incredible change in his mother and the sense of genius that he himself feels. Provided, of course, that Fay continues to hold back many of her son's most important facts about his father. It feels like it needs to be done. I would buy it. <br /> <br /> Even with more action, this is still not an action movie. It's more drama and intrigue ... a secret. I will see it often. <br /> <br /> It rates an 8.3 / 10 of ... <br /> <br /> the Fiend.
