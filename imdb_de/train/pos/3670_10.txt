I borrowed this movie on DVD without knowing what to expect - and since I'm going to study film in Canada right now, I'll certainly address this in class. <br /> <br /> The story, centered around what is probably the most unlucky film crew in the history of the film itself, is brilliantly written, and the very talented actors manage to deliver every single word on time. If you just could not laugh during "Hollywood North" I suggest you visit a psychiatrist - you might have serious problems In addition to the wonderful script, I've also noticed the great chemistry between actors Deborah Kara Unger and Matthew Modine - where they really are only actors? Jennifer Tilly (a weird bad actress) and Martin Landau also delivered a very nervous but funny performance. <br /> <br /> Great movie, even better cast.
