One thing is for sure ... you should not see this movie if you have a bad day. The story is based on a sad event and follows a character who has to live with a sin he can not handle. The story is not soaked in the usual dumb explanation, so you wonder what's going on. Finally, the points are put together and the performances make sense. All the characters were fine and Wil Smith made another good day at the office. <br /> <br /> There are undoubtedly many moral issues to ask, but if you just accept and indulge in his agony, it's easier to accept what he has chosen. Whether you agree or disagree is irrelevant. The journey you are taking here is interesting enough, if not overwhelming. <br /> <br /> A movie that is good enough and that makes you sad at the end. I would recommend this movie if you like the sort you need to think about and not just watch explosions and fights.
