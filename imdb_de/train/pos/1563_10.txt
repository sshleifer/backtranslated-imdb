I loved this episode. It's so great that all five team up and stop LutherCorp and save the world. I also love this episode because Kyle Gallner (Bart Allen / Impulse) and Justin Hartley (Oliver Queen / Green Arrow) are guests there !!! I just hope that Clark will join the Justice League and we will be able to follow this group of heroes around the world !! =) It was really exciting and keeps the audience thinking of what's going to happen next. I think Chloe should also join the team as a Watchtower, which would be such a cool thing for her except the Daily Planet, because she has no superpowers. I also want to find out what types of topics Lex will use for 33.1. I wonder what other types of forces other people in the world have !!!
