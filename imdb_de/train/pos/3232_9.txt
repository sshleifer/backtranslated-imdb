I wanted to see this Finnish movie and I have to say it's one of the better movies I've seen this year. The intrigue consists of 5-6 different stories, all taking place on the same day in a small Finnish town. The stories come together very well in the end, perhaps reminiscent of the way Tarantino's films are made. Most actors have performed very well, which is most likely needed in realistic dramas of this kind. I especially liked the acting of Sanna Hietala, the leading actress, and Juha Kukkonen. By the way, I noticed that IMDB has the wrong information about Sanna. Her name, as you may have noticed in my review;), is NOT Heikkil√§, but Hietala.
