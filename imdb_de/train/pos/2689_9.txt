This is a warm, funny movie that is about the same as Almodovar's works. Sure, it has a 10-year-old boy who sucks milk from his chest, but the style is so playful that I can not understand the readers who were sick or perverted (but I would be willing to play my 10-year-old son to leave.) the part?

I think if we Northern Europeans had the same attitude, we would be much better off as a result. This liberal attitude is also reflected in the witty 'Fartman Maurice' figure. As his lover says to him, "Most people are embarrassed when they fart. You make it an art form. '
