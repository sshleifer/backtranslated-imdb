The great talents of Michael Powell and Emeric Pressberger make themselves felt in their wonderful "A Matter of Life and Death". It was part of Mr. Powell's tribute to Walter Reade in New York. In particular, this film shows us one of the best British films from this or any other epoch. <br /> <br /> "A Matter of Life and Death" has a brilliant filmography of Jack Cardiff, a man who knew how to work wonders with a camera. Particularly striking is the contrast between the monochromatic tones of the scenes played in the sky and the colored ones when the action returns to Earth. This was quite a coup and way ahead of its time. The black and white sequence, which includes the long flight of steps where Peter and the conductor chat, must be one of the most amazing things in any movie. <br /> <br /> Much has been said about the film in this forum, so our commentary is about the great acting that Powell and Pressberger have taken out of the large, well-respected line-up, which responded magnificently to the directors' instructions , David Niven is Peter whose plane is hit and his best friend dies as a result. This film was one of the highlights in the career of Mr. Niven. He was a great movie actor, as he shows us in this movie. Kim Hunter is surprisingly good as June, the woman who spoke to Peter when his plane fell from the sky. As fate wills, Peter and June fall in love at first sight. <br /> <br /> Some of the best British film actors adore this film with their presence. Robert Coote is Bob, the man who was taken to heaven, but he is surprised that his friend Peter never traveled with him. An outstanding star of Marius Goring, who steals the film as a conductor 71. Mr. Goring, who worked with the directors, is one of the best things in the movie. Roger Livesey is Dr. Frank Reeves one of the best performances of his career, as well as Raymond Massey, who is considered Abraham Farlan. <br /> <br /> "A Life and Death Question" is a timeless film that will always be grateful to its creators.
