I'd like to start with this being wrongly heard by just about everyone! The fact is, that was not what anyone expected, especially Guy Ritchie. What everyone had expected was Cockney-Geezer and good singles, "Do you like Dags?" etc, but this is far more mature than his previous works. I would admit that it is confusing, but all the facts are there for us, we just have to see them and hear harder, this movie requires your full attention! Look beyond the film's cool and dazzling look, try to listen to the dialogue instead of admiring the performances, and I think we'll all get a deeper understanding of the whole movie. <br /> <br /> Yes, that has its influences from modern classics (Fight Club, Pulp Fiction, etc.), but it's all in the original in both directions and in tune with an unparalleled musical score. I feel that if everyone had seen this movie over and over again, they would understand it a lot better and maybe appreciate it for the fine piece of modern cinema, and I also hope Ritchie will continue in this futility as I do this to his Prefers to preface "masterpieces".
