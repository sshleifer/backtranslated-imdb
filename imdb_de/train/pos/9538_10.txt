Why are not more movies (especially American movies) more like Meatball Machine? <br /> <br /> This is my first official online review and I'm charged with "electric ecstasy" after being the first to select "Meatball Machine". This is a review, so I try to focus on mere reflection and inner feelings. <br /> <br /> I mean, this is a creative piece of work, even though it's clearly inspired by the now classic TETSUO! What if it's not all original? I own these two films, and though Tetsuo is a weird son of a bitch, Meatball Machine is far superior and can be persisted without the strong desire to persuade itself with a dose of mental prevention to clarify the movie's meaning. Meatball Machine is as thoughtful in its history as in its high influx of blood and blood. Thank you, Jesus, for the Japanese cinema! <br /> <br /> Simply said, the last time my dreams were flooded with horror visions when I saw Nightmare on Elm Street at about 7 years old. In my dreams, I could imagine a tongue coming out of a telephone for weeks. This time (at age 31) my dreams were pleasantly awesome. <br /> <br /> In this movie, the human body harbors aliens whose sole purpose is to try to fulfill their never-ending desire for human flesh and blood. People become carnivorous cyborgs !!! There is more !!! Fight scenes !! Great music!! Great point-of-view shots! Decent spectacle of the woman Cyborg (at least better than her male counterpart). The fight that is seen at the end is worth ten or twenty views. Oh, and forgot to mention it's a love story! Wow, I hate love stories, but that needs the cake! <br /> <br /> I can not wait to have friends watching this movie again just to see the reaction on their faces. Unfortunately, I took the time to write this review because I'm afraid most friends and family do not understand Meatball Machine. The truth is that America as a whole is not prepared for Meatball Machine. <br /> <br /> Finally my wife came in, while I finally saw the scene of the fight and she was speechless. Usually she says something like, "Why are you looking at this garbage?" This time she had nothing to say. I was glad! <br /> <br /> This is not junk. This is not just SPLATTER (splatter for splatter is great too). That's art, my friends. Art. <br /> <br /> CHACHO
