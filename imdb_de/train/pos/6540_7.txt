To be honest, I had to watch this movie backwards, did not expect so much, but hey, I was not deceived, I had a good time. <br /> <br /> I would say that this film is a kind of fresh breeze, despite some facts that they had tried to modernize Nancy Drew, but that reminded me of these youth films of the 60-70s from Europe and Quebec, where they have children interacting with adults. In this case, a 16-year-old teenager tries to do justice by trying to solve a mystery about the death of an actress who died 25 years ago. However, since her father had business in Hollywood, why not rent a house with a secret behind it? At least Emma Roberts does a great job here. A bit like the chubby kid who's naively made to support his sister's pranks on Nancy, but in the end Nancy thought she was pretty cool enough to stay with her, even in her affairs ... < br /> <br /> The rest of the minor cast is great and was pleased to see Rachael Leigh Cook in another role this time: a single mom (she did it in Family Rescue, but this time she plays a mature woman .. Anyway, don't do that, it's fun!
