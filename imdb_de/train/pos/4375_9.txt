Mel Gibson's Braveheart was a spectacularly accomplished film, but with a sour taste in the mouth. Rob Roy, on the other hand, is a bit less polished, but by far a better movie. This is a historical film that combines timeless themes with truly historical values, while Braveheart lends a coarse and unpleasant contemporary glow to an ancient story. What makes this movie is the cast. Liam Neeson plays the hero, in a role that he essentially replicated in the phantom menace (in a watered-down manner). The character is heroic, but neither the greatest fighter nor the most demonic lover. Admirable and yet human, he commands the screen. Against him is a selection of equally human opponents set, including Tim Roth's Cunningham, the obnoxious, but brilliant, and John Hurt's moral bankruptcy. Also praising Jessica Lange as Rob's pragmatic wife: Also strong and noble, but 300 years away from a modern heroine who is just as she should be. This is not the most original movie you'll see, but it has the guts to convince yourself, and the strong performances attract attention.
