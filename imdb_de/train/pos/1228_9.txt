This 1991 NBC TV movie aired six months before John Goodman's big-screen movie Babe Ruth's Life. For my money, there is no comparison between the two. The TV production is not perfect, but it presents Babe's story with more depth and complexity than Goodman's one-dimensional narratives. I particularly liked the film's portrayal of the complex love-hate relationship Ruth had with Yankee manager Miller Huggins, who always understood the brilliance of his star player and kept trying to figure out why Ruth's own character weaknesses never made him a manager or leader The TV movie rightly notes that Ruth never realized his dream of leading the Yankees because of his mistakes, while the terrible Goodman version tries to urge the lie that Ruth has been denied what him that should be. </ Br> This movie is a great companion to "Eight Men Out," as the story begins with Ruth's arrival in New York in 1920, a year after the Black Sox scandal and when his home run literally saved baseball from ruin , In fact, continuity between the two films is compounded by John Anderson again criticizing his role as "Eight Men Out" as Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis.
