This carefree comedy should be enjoyed for fun entertainment. Sometimes it gets pretty hysterical, but if you have not spent time on this side of the tracks, you'll miss the comedy if it breaks out. <br /> <br /> are quite believable in their roles. How Grace deals with the dead man's girlfriend was played well. She is a real lady. My favorite is Grace's white pimp suit, which she wears. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants to laugh out loud, who cheers for the outsiders or just wants to see something different.
