I'm not at all fussy about horror movies, and I'm ready to watch pretty much everyone. That does not mean that I'm willing to look at many of them again, or that I have no criticism for it. This movie is scary and is very well done. In fact, I think this Session 9 movie would be an excellent double count. Before I come to my comments, I should state that I have seen this alone. I started to look at it before going to bed and had about 15 minutes before I realized it was too effective and saved the rest for the morning. Even when it was viewed in broad daylight, it was still scary. However, I can not vouch for how effective it would be to be in a larger group. Upon the death of her daughter, a couple moves into a secluded cabin to try to come to terms with this death. Let me make a note of this death - this is one of the rare films that does not shy away from the death of a child. This is more important as it both sets the tone and explains much of the drama that permeates the movie. <br /> <br /> The couple is not feeling well. The woman has distanced herself from the relationship and the husband does what he can to get her back. While some of the comments have complained about their behavior, it was stated that they behave more like a father and a daughter than a man and a woman, and that's legitimate. He tries to give her more direction. It is a role that men sometimes take. <br /> <br /> There are a number of horrors in the film, and most are fairly non-violent, though they are in some ways grotesque. The story itself feels very straightforward for most of the movie and ends up taking a strange turn. While the turnaround is not absurd, it certainly is not what you expected from the advances. <br /> <br /> Moody, atmospheric and very well done for something that was shot on video.
