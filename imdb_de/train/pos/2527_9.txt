This is what I call a "pre-sci-fi" sci-fi movie. It does not get better than Lugosi / Karloff in this incredibly good "mood" movie. These two real artists are at their best, as is the story. <br /> <br /> Karloff does amazing work as a scientist, who is in a zeal of vanity, pride and scientific competition. I came up with the idea of ​​watching a man drown himself in the three aforementioned concepts. I was sad and at the same time fascinated by the two stars in which they find themselves. <br /> <br /> This is the kind of movie that is begging for a remake. This time, Harrison Ford was inducted into the Karloff game and possibly Kieffer Sutherland as Bela Lagosi's role. It might be possible to do it almost as well. <br /> <br /> This is one of the best Hollywood EVER has ever produced. As I said ... it does not get better. Under no circumstance.
