I do not know why some people criticize this show so much. <br /> <br /> It's a great, funny show - probably not the material for the mainstream prime time, but still ... <br /> <br /> The family dynamics are funny and all in all What you see in most comedy shows. The secondary characters are absolutely funny. The acts of each episode and the frequent Siegfried & Roy-Jibes are just over average, but often you have bargains or one-liners that make you laugh on the floor Show was worth the 8 pounds I paid for it. <br /> <br /> Rating: 8/10
