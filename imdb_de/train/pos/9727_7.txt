Simon Pegg plays a rude and often out-of-control celebrity journalist who was brought from England to work for a major American magazine. Of course, his successful ways create all kinds of complications. A witty, fact-based comedy starring Kristen Dunst, Danny Huston and Jeff Bridges. It works primarily because we like Simon Pegg despite his bad behavior. We fully understand why Kristen Dunst continues to speak with him despite his frequent seizures. I liked the movie. It's not all about it, but it was a nice way to spend the evening on the couch watching movies. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10 points
