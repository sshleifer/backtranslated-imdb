Grand Canyon is a very strange bird. It is a completely unique urban piece in which the entire plot would not convey much. <br /> <br /> The central theme seems to be the inherent uncertainty that life brings to people of all races, backgrounds and wards. But to announce that the subject of the film would terribly underestimate its scope. Similarly, in a given genre, it is useful to include it in a particular genre. <br /> <br /> The film has volumes to say, though probably different volumes for each viewer, and says it all in such a non-preachy way from so many angles that I end up not even the central message for myself can define. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, it does business with such laser precision; Each prop, dialogue line and background music add to their pervasive vibe and powerful message that I am pleasantly surprised and look very thoughtful after each viewing. Still, it does not feel stuffy at all. A sparkling movie with a great cast and everything that works.
