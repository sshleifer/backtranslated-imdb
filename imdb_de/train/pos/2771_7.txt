David and Bathsheba is a lavish Hollywood Biblical image produced by 20th Century Fox Darryl F. Zanuck. Directed by Henry King and Gregory Peck (King David), Susan Hayward (Bathsheba), Raymond Massey (Nathan), Kieron Moore (Uriah) and Jayne Meadows (Michal). <br /> <br /> The film is based on the second book of the Old Testament by Samuel from the Holy Bible. It follows King David, who killed the giant Goliath as a child, and now we find him in adulthood as the second king of Israel. David is a tough and secure king, but he causes heart affairs that cause great problems. For the first time, he spies Bathsheba showering, marking the beginning of a journey that includes adultery and betrayal; A journey that ends in the judgment of God called. <br /> <br /> David & Bathsheba is a big, terrific production, typical of the genre. From the excellent set designs to the absolutely stunning Technicolor photography {Leon Shamroy}, it offers enough quality to bring out the best in the genre in terms of production values. However, as a rule, the movie is quiet and relies on 99% of its value to be guided only by dialogue. This is not for action fans or anyone who needs a bit of swing to go with their buckles. This is a very humanistic image that does not strike around the burning bush, but a biblical love story full of sins of the heart. But that's not bad at all, because we think it's handled very well. Peck has a stoic but vulnerable thing that goes really well, and Hayward pushes it to the extremes}, and it's a beautiful story with knowledge of skill by the oft-forgotten Henry King. And although some of the dialogues are sometimes scary, the character flow is never interrupted, as the script was nominated by Phillip Dunne (The Ghost and Mrs. Muir) Oscar, which pervades the attention. <br /> <br /> Sometimes forgotten from the Biblical / Swords & Sandals genres (most likely because it's a talkie piece that has heart as its main selling point), but it's really worth the time for everyone who are interested in the richest genres. 10.7
