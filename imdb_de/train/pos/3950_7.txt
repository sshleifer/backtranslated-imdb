I finally saw this classic TV movie on an unofficial CD recorded by an old VHS. It's a classic horror. It's a pity more of this neglected corner of horror regarding official releases on DVD and VHS ... the TV horror movie. Recommended for all fans of the 70s TV movie, similar to the trilogy of terror. Interested parties should receive the book on this subject from David Deal - Television Fright Films of the 70s. Email me for a chance to see it ..... it's fabulous to see it again. <br /> <br /> It has problems, as with many TV movies, that they have to be rather resourceful in the effects section and even in the effects 70 minutes it seems to be dragging, maybe we're all used to more modern edits, but always still great material and far better than many of today's cinema fever.
