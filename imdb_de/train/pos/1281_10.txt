This movie is as good as hard to find. The hero (and writer and director) of the film is Simon Geist - a man "with an agenda". He's creating a fake magazine just to get the power to interview the Los Angeles pork - the actors, the models, the musicians - who think their own defecation does not stink. With clever dialogue succeeds Zucovic. Sure, the budget for this movie was probably what he paid for a used car, but this movie is so solid and so well written that it works very well. Anyone who can reenact Edward Muk's "The Scream" in the mirror of a silver trash can at a local coffee house should be nominated for a kind of prize. Give this movie a chance and listen to what it says ... because they built the same car since 1986 ... it's called "the car". Bravo, Zucovic, Bravo!
