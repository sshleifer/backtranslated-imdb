This is an excellent little film about the solitude of the single man. Phillipe Harel as Notre Heros is a bit of a mix of Robert de Niro in Taxi drivers, Inspector Clouseau (in his stoicism) and Chauncey Gardiner in Being There (also Peter Sellers). He is single, but has no idea how he can attract the opposite sex - in fact he makes no effort at all! <br /> <br /> He has a stoicism and fatalism that defies any hope of ever reaching Coupling - his friend Jose Garcia as Tisserand finds himself in the same plight, but at least makes the brave effort to maintain his long virginity to overcome (he is 28 and admits that he has never had sex) Rouen, where the two software people are traveling on business. They try different nightclubs and places, but all without success. My theory is that they try the wrong places - they go into more or less "youth" nightclubs. You should try the guy who has older people, more at their own age. Harel is getting increasingly isolated and is making a little de Niro effort, like in Taxi Driver, and urging his friend / colleague to stab something guy who has pulled a pretty-looking girl into the nightclub. <br /> <br /> Worth seeing.
