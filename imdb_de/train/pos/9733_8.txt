"How to Lose Friends and Alienate People" is an entertaining, albeit loose, adaptation of the eponymous memoir by Toby Young. It's also a great title for meeting the line requirements in IMDb reviews! The basic core is the same as the book with certain dramatic events, but a romantic plot is added and the ending is certainly Hollywoodized. Although Simon Pegg plays an essentially irritating person, he is his usual sympathetic and funny self and carries quite a bit of the movie with him. Strange to think that he was just a TV sitcom guy a few years ago, and now he's rubbing himself with Hollywood names. There is a good minor cast and it's an amusing, easy watch - a kind of male "Ugly Betty", but funnier.
