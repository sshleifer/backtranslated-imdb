Of all the breakdance / hip-hop films released between 1983 and 1986, the 1984 Beat Street Street is undoubtedly the best. The story tells of a DJ, his younger breakdancing brother, a graffiti artist and a popular showbiz promoter through a winter in which they try to break out of the ghetto with their "street talent". Acting is not always up to date and the characters are not fully developed, but they are more than compensated for by down-to-earth dialogues, a plausible story, fantastic dance sequences and a timeless hip-hop soundtrack. It should be noted that this film was filmed in the birthplace of Breakdance ("This is not New York, this is the Bronx!") And features performances by the breakdance dads, the Rock Steady Crew dance group and the rapper Africa Bambaata. Rock Steady Crew offers the best scene in the movie when they dominate a dance fight in the early 80's breakdance club, the Roxy. A must for hip-hop lovers.
