This is one of the great 80's movies in the MY collection that I keep thinking about. <br /> <br /> The Running Man is still one of Arnold's best and most diverse films. When I saw The Running Man for the first time, I was so excited to see a movie like this one. I love all the fights and that is really a special movie. It also has Jesse Ventura, the legendary Professor Toru Tanaka, Sven-Ole Thorsen, the beautiful Maria Conchita Alonso, Yaphet Kotto, Kurt Fuller, Richard Dawson and Thomas Rosales Jr., who always like death in his films because he has been is killed in such films as Universal Solder, The Lost World, Robo Cop 2, Predator 2 and others. All Arnold fans should love this movie from start to finish because it's full of action, stars and one of Arnold's best.
