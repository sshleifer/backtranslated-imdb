This is one of the greatest children's films ever made. I cry every time I see Shadow screaming, "Wait, wait for me, Peter!" how the family car departs. This is a must if you love animals! Best movie ever! The lines in the movie are sometimes stupid. As if Sassy says to chance; "Cat rule and dog drool!" Lines like these that I could do without, but when I was six, I was sure I loved that line. The plot may seem addictive for some, but I like it. Shadow as the older dog preparing the chance to take him over when he's gone really moves when you think about it. It reminded me of my dog ​​of childhood. I think everyone can find a piece of themselves in Homeward Bound.
