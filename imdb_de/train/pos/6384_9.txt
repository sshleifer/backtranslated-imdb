It's written in stone that Disney animations just have to be musicals. Law? From where? Show me. I found this experiment much more enjoyable because it did not contain Disney's five year old standard music. <br /> <br /> Although the story was not as exciting as it could have been, it was still pretty good, enjoyable and adventurous. I had hoped for something more, yes, given the subject, but this movie is not ~ the bitter disappointment or utter failure that was billed to it. <br /> <br /> The quality of the animation is average, but the dialogue is just as compelling as the storyline, plot, negotiation, and amazing creativity that I have found in this production. I will not outline the plot as it was done and done, but this movie is worth a look if you are a fan of fantasy. <br /> <br /> I think this is THE BEST Disney Animated Feature (<br /> <br />). It rated 9.4 / 10 of ... <br /> <br /> the Fiend.
