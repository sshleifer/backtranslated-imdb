I have seen this episode more often than any other TFTC episode, which is gratifying. And it's pretty scary, but all in a good, scary mood. A woman kills her second husband, but encounters a problem when an escaped maniac in a ragged Santa Claus outfit decides to visit her and her little girl at this moment. Mary Traynor, whom I seem to remember from SNL or another TV comedy sketch show, is the evil woman, and Larry Drake plays the lunatic in the grubby Santa outfit. I forgot that Santa Claus had been played by Drake over the years. His Santa Claus is an unstoppable force and sometimes quite scary. You can probably guess how Santa finally gets into the house. The episode is laughable, but it can also be quite intense.
