Back to the roots with "as in heaven" - what are the true values ​​of life? These Swedes draw a message that appeals to every heart. We have now seen it twice in a cinema that has been put together to the last place: pure love and joy in the music of a choir that is simple yet powerful as soon as everyone has found their inner tone. <br /> <br /> From the glittering glitz to the school of his youth, now empty and ready to be adapted to his new home after collapsing on stage, Daniel wants to start listening and turning life into the simple one , warm and rough people of the north. <br /> <br /> He wins hearts with music and gains the ability to love and be loved unconditionally. <br /> <br /> Do not go if you've been tempted to Hollywood. This stuff contains no extras, just your laugh, your compassion, your tears!
