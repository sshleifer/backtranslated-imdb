Cassandra Peterson originally founded Elvira as a television presenter for late-night horror movies. When the character became unexpectedly popular, she suddenly did everything from beer ads to spots on the Tonight Show starring Johnny Carson. It reached the peak of its popularity in the late 1980s, and the film ELVIRA, MISTRESS OF THE DARK was the result. <br /> <br /> The plot is flyweight. TV horror movie hostess Elvira dreams of success in Las Vegas. When her great aunt dies, she travels to New England in the hope that the estate will provide enough money for a stage show. She is disappointed that she has inherited a rundown house, a poodle and an old book. It happens that beyond all descriptions, the city is Puritan, and everywhere it causes outright outrage. It also happens that her great-uncle is secretly a wicked sorcerer and is very anxious to take "the old book". Throw some teens, a stud muffin and a hateful woman with falsies and let's go. Nobody would blame it as a cinematic masterpiece, and it's going on and off. But Cassandra Peterson shows an enormous flair from beginning to end: shaky, sexy and mixing humor with sharp comedy flashes. She dances like a ringmaster through the movie in a stupid circus and often even mocking jokes. From a FLASHDANCE disaster to witchcraft madness, she is never less than wildly entertaining. It is a lot of fun, and the conclusion of the film even creates considerable tension. Will Elvira defeat her evil uncle and save the day? Well, I do not want to reveal anything, so let's just say you enjoy finding out. <br /> <br /> DVD quality is fine and bonus material is limited. If you are in the mood for something stupid, this will surely answer the urge. And if you've never seen tawdry, you'll be looking forward to something. Recommended. <br /> <br /> GFT, Amazon Reviewer
