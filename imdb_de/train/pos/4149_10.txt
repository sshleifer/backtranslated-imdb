While reading some of the comments in the message boards here, I expected this movie to be an absolute flop - but when I saw it, I could not stop laughing! It has officially become my new favorite movie. <br /> <br /> I do not know what this hate is all about, maybe because there has never been a movie like this before. I can not call another comedy comedy. Many comedies will feature one or two actresses, but many male characters will be supported. These were almost ALL women - with the exception of Seth Meyers, Justin Hartley and the short appearance of Will Arnett - and it worked. All the actresses delivered very funny performances (especially Missi Pyle) from a quirky and lovable script. <br /> <br /> The charm of this film seems to me to be in its subtle feminist message: accepting who you are, female success in public, the strength of female friendships, and the breaking of gender roles. Despite their lightheartedness, each of the main characters faces a challenge, as their attempts to make more 'fun' conflict with their feminist values ​​and who they know them. <br /> <br /> Missi Pyle suggested this movie missed a theatrical release because of its female cast and the absence of a great actor to bring the studios behind it, and I have to agree. Everyone I've recommended this movie loved, and I think it's a shame that a comedy celebrating female dorkiness was not universally accepted and successful. <br /> <br /> I can recommend this movie to anyone who is open mind or a love of woman-centered comedy.
