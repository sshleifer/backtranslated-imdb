This show started with big mystery episodes. I think everyone is in the first 15 or 16 episodes. After that, the show started playing short episodes with Shaggy, Scooby doo, and Scrappy doo. I think Hanna Barbera Productions had to turn 20-minute episodes into short episodes. Some of the speakers were no longer available. After 15 or 16 episodes, Frank Welker (who played Fred) became unavailable. I think Velma's voice changes after the first 12 episodes because the first speaker Velma played was not available. <br /> <br /> And the network ordered that the Hanna Barbera Studio with Shaggy, Scooby doo and Scrappy doo, because the reviews were high. So they had to do more shorts. I wish they were secrets like 15 episodes. Still, it's a good show.
