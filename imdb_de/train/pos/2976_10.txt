For a comedy this has a decent and imaginative storyline and Trey Parker and Matt Stone's comic timing is perfect. There are dozens of funny moments in this fantastic movie. I especially like the color variety and the way the clashes occur in the sports stadium scenes. Robert Stack's Unsolved Mysteries parody is also very amusing.
