This is an irresistibly great, cheerful and technically powerful movie! <br /> <br /> The film contains some of the best-looking sets you'll ever see in a '30s movie, though it's all too obvious that they are, rather than real places. If a character were to overturn or shake a jamb too aggressively, the entire set would naturally move. <br /> <br /> The best moments of the movie were the quieter, more old-fashioned slapstick moments. It shows that René Clair's true heart was in the silent movie. All humor is really great in this movie. Of course, the musical moments were more than great. This is a really pleasant, light and easy pleasant early French musical. Although the best moments are the quiet moments, this does not mean that the film is not filled with a great humorous dialogue that is well conveyed by the main actors, who all seemed to me to be stage actors, which in this case worked extremely well for the film its general style and a pleasant, carefree atmosphere. No wonder that worked so well, because this film is actually based on a play by Georges Berr. <br /> <br /> It's a technically really great movie that also includes some great innovations for camera work and some really great editing that will see some quick and pleasant, enjoyable sequences. There is never a boring moment in this movie! <br /> <br /> René Clair was such a smart director who knew how to build and plan comic moments in movies. It's a very creative film that, despite its simplicity, still feels like a totally original and cleverly constructed movie that never inspires entertainment. <br /> <br /> The last half hour is a particularly memorable fun, without spoiling too much and is one of the best and most creative moments in the early comedy movie. <br /> <br /> The film is full of really funny characters, who are of course very stereotypical and stupid and obviously were cast for their looks. All this contributes to the pleasant, light, funny atmosphere and cuteness of the movie. <br /> <br /> One of the most enjoyable movies you'll ever see! <br /> <br /> 8/10
