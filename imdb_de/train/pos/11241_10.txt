I recently purchased one of my favorite movies on DVD and, as usual, it just blew me away watching it. <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of Hazel O'Connor and the soundtrack to this movie just made me cry, especially the "Will You" track. It is a pure nostalgic journey for me, back to my youth. This is the second best of Quadrophenia (which also played Phil Daniels). <br /> <br /> A great soundtrack and a great view of Britain in the that-erotic years of the 80s when I grew up. The end is so sad that for hours after the end of the movie I'm like a bubbling baby. <br /> <br /> I expect this DVD to be worn down by repeated reputations, I can see it over and over again and never bored, just for the soundtrack alone. <br /> <br /> Hazel, I am sorry that I have heard from your father. God bless you all. xx
