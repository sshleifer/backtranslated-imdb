I have only recently seen this but have been aware of it for a few years and have always been fascinated by its title. It's one of my favorite movies now. It's hard to describe what incredible topics the Maysles discovered, but everything in it works wonderfully. There are so many memorable images and moments when you feel like you have entered a very private world. I fell in love with this movie and the characters. It's as if filmmakers have captivated audiences and drawn into the strange world of the eccentric Beales, a true aristocratic family. It has a noticeable atmosphere and I wish I could be far away cooking my corncobs at my bedside table. It has a touch of sadness that permeates itself. A crash the size of this once esteemed family. The money was gone, but her air, grace, and beauty remained. It attracted me from the first picture and I wondered long after the end of the film about her fate. If I'm wondering if I'm walking along East Hampton Beach, I could still hear Old Edie's voice in the night and see the silhouette of Little Edie dancing in the window behind the thick hanging climber. Unforgettable
