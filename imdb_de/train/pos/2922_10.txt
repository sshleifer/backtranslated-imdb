This movie is a perfect example of a movie that divides people into two groups. Those who get the joke and those who do not. People usually attack what they do not understand. This film has a strange style and charm that has not been matched since. It's a great comedy ... and a great romance. It's a perfect date movie. A perfect movie for someone who wants to laugh in a good mood. And if your perspective is too tense, this movie may not be for you and you may need advice. It is an injustice that Paramount has kept this movie on the shelf since the early 80's and has never seen the daylight on DVD. Still, they find an urban version of "The Honeymooners" a good idea. I find it strange that my two ever-popular romantic comedies have never been released on DVD. The other is Gene Wilder's "The Greatest Lover" of the world Fox has been in since the early 1980s ... But "From Justin To Kelly" can be found in almost every video store in the country. There is no justice in the world. Maybe those who have taken the time to do so will love "From Justin To Kelly," I'm sure you have enough water to "get it." With age, people sometimes lose their sense of humor ... or sometimes they become stale and they find comical satisfaction in repetitions of "full house".
