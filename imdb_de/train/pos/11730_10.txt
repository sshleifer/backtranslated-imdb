What can one say about Elvira, which has not been said in the world press yet? The classic comedienne that delivers IS Elvira full-length with her first big budget comedy masterpiece. <br /> <br /> From the very first movie frame thing, Elvira packs a theatrical punch that clearly says, movie Great Heart Out, Bette Davis! See a deserted Elvira, see an exciting Elvira, see a jealous Elvira, see a murderous Elvira. You can only marvel at their acting! <br /> <br /> At the heart of this comedy masterpiece is Elvira's desire to be a Las Vegas show star. Although Elvira puts "the fool back in the breast tube" as a horror hostess (with the most), Elvira finds the small screen emotionally limiting ... and PHYSICAL! Nuff said she packs her bag and heads east. A hot dog in one hand and a letter from her aunt's lawyer showing her inheritance "Windfall" in the other. <br /> <br /> I've seen this movie so often, I can almost recite it verbatim .... (Literally one would just perform)! <br /> <br /> Grab a copy, laugh silly, learn the lines .... <br /> <br /> I do not care why she did not win the Oscar for Best Actress for this role.
