This is a real character and story drama on a level that embarrasses most of what we see on TV. <br /> <br /> I was impressed from the beginning. Do not be put off if you're not a sci-fi nut (like me ...). This could happen on Earth, the fact that it is in another galaxy just makes the show more interesting. There are no spaceships or laser rifles. (None yet). So far I have seen up to S01 E04 and wonder what will happen next, as there are so many options. <br /> <br /> The cast plays roles with Pasion. Eric Stoltz is especially strong. <br /> <br /> This show is really good on its own, whether you looked at BSG or not, in fact they are different. I've read some negative reviews from sci-fi freaks who reckoned with less drama and more aliens and blasting guns, etc., but I would say ignore them. Let's hope they can not take it after one or two seasons, as is usually the case with good shows.
