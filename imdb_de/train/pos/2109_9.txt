I've seen this several times since I thought it was a stupid, juicy, dated romantic comedy. Well, it's a romantic comedy and maybe a bit old-fashioned. However, it is not overly sentimental and does not touch the themes of office politics, adultery and loneliness. You think you know exactly where things stand, but there is an element of unpredictability that sustains your interest. But there is enough wit and charm to touch the diehard cynic. If you meet someone who does not like this movie, seriously consider how well you want to know it.
