Some genre films have to be disguised. This was an exception. It is a standalone version of the horror genre movie. With minimal special effects, it's a kind of psychological study with a simple but existential theme - who gets hit by the bus and why? It's not a great movie, but with little thought, the story works. Subtle and all about the interactions of the characters. In fact, there is a facility in the opening scenes, but it may have been placed there just to set the tone for the upcoming one. I appreciate the balance of male and female energy very much and I do not recommend this story to anyone who is more interested than people who respond to a physical and psychological challenge. You will enjoy the movie if you have some empathy, appreciate the need for a bit of adventure in your life, and ask, "What would I do in this situation?"
