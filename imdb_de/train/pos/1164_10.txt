I saw this movie when it first came out. It was an official selection for the Temecula Valley International Film Festival and I voted for the best picture. <br /> <br /> Justine Priestley is hot like the psychotic but complex Amanda. This is not an ordinary psychofilm. Many interesting and original slants of the genre. A kind of "fatal attraction" for the younger ensemble with great blues music, interspersed as an object of Amanda's affection, is married to a rising blues singer who has less time for her husband as her career picks up. <br /> <br />
