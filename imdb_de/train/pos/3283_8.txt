As a lover of the surreal (in art and film), I was delighted to discover this film on the IFC. It is definitely a keeper. Most other reviews point to the general plot (not all right) so I will not bother boring anyone with it. The main thing is the concept of alternative worlds, which is caused by Ana's impending illness, and the way she manages to connect with someone else after she was so "alone" and finally with her family, mine Opinion is still a little worried. It can only be called a horror movie because it has frightening scenes, but it's a fantasy (with a hint of "coming" just because Ana is a teenager who "hates boys"). I heartily recommend those who appreciate their imagination.
