The movie is supposed to affect the audience and this movie left me speechless. Greatly photographed and treated with a dialogue that approaches poetry. The film includes lust, hate, murder, rape, theft and fraud. It weaves an intensive network that could not distract me from the screen until the end of the credits. The story is sweeping. It leads the public from the atrocities of the Spanish Civil War to the human debris left behind. Roger Casamajor and Bruno Bertanzoni are two young actors who dominate the screen. Supportive players are superbly staffed and convey a sense of authenticity. Sets, lighting, scenery and film are wonderful. I absolutely love photography.
