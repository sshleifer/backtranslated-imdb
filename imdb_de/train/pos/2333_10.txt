I recently started watching this show, and I have to say that I was really made to laugh. You have to appreciate the unrealistic aspects as well as everything else. Some people said that the show should have more realistic reactions from the dead. If you accept that Ned can bring the dead back to life, you must accept that the other completely crazy parts of the show. After every episode I saw, I always had to smile. I think it's really great that there's a show that can record a very strange topic and that makes it really great to see it. I absolutely love the narration, I think they add a little more wonder to the whole show. You can not always compare an author's old shows with his new ones, you have to consider everything as a separate entity. Definitely give it a shot and just enjoy the ridiculous parts as they are.
