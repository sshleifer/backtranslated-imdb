I expected this film to be decent and possibly clich√©, but I was totally wrong! Charlie Cox (I had never heard of him before) played an incredibly good leader; he was so serious and romantic, me and my friend, who saw the movie with me, totally fell in love with him. <br /> <br /> Claire Danes I liked before (LOVED in Romeo and Juliet) made i enjoy her even more. Her acting was fantastic, I could not even say that she was American. The chemistry between her and Charlie Cox was extremely good, the casting was perfect. Robert DeNiro and Michelle Pfeiffer were equally well staffed; DeNiro as a gay pirate ... priceless, priceless. I laughed so much at this one scene where Septimus gets on the ship ... oh my god, wow. Pfeiffer played a decent villain, I liked her as a saucy mother in Hairspray. But she had the right amount of melodrama and slipping comments throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> All in all it was funny (but no slap stick!), romantic, the special effects were not too common, but if they were, they were great; The cameos of Ricky Gervais and Peter O'Toole were also well placed. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes fantasy movies like the Princess Bride or even Lord of the Rings. It has aroused my interest all the time and I will buy the DVD when it comes out!
