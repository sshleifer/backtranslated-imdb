Clara Lago is wonderful as the title character of the film, essentially a film about a Spanish / American girl moving to Spain with his mother during the Spanish Civil War. It turns out that the mother goes home to die and she stays with her grandfather. She also makes friends and experiences in a short time. Tomiche (Juan Jose Ballestra) is a nuisance to them first, then they get close. The film is beautifully filmed, mostly dipped in soft colors. Carol longs for her father, the pilot of the war, and you can feel the love he has for him. While the war in this film is somehow pushed into the background, it envelops the life of the character. I think you will like it. Especially for Clara Lago, who does a great job as Carol. It is definitely one to watch.
