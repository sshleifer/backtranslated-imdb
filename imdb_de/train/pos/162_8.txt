For a "no-budget" movie this thing rocks. I do not know if the Americans will like it, but we laughed the whole way. Some really funny stuff. Really not Hollywood. <br /> <br /> The Actors and Music rocked. The cars and gags, and even less the stuff in your face, blew us up. Whooo Whooo! <br /> <br /> I've seen some actors before, but never in such a thing, one or two of those I think I've seen in commercials or anywhere. Basically it rocked! Fortunately, I saw a copy of an actor's friend.
