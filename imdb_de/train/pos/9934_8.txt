"Domino" was often condemned on this website because of its frenetic cut style and the "ailing" photography. The critics cite their superficiality and criticize their use of "style over substance", which I could no longer contradict. I believe that "Domino" represents the absolute height of the career of Tony Scott. <br /> <br /> After creating the prevalent Hollywood action film style in the late eighties and early nineties, Tony Scott gradually took on a more subjective theatrical style. Even in "Crimson Tide" Scott used his stylistic talent to depict the inner worlds of his characters - the claustrophobia and drama inherent in the conflict aboard an atomic submarine were anchored in the superb use of long lenses in combination with angular optics. This was then done to "Enemy Of The State" and "Spy Game", which visually represented the worlds of surveillance and espionage respectively. <br /> <br /> "Man On Fire" was an extreme departure, a step into an expressionist-painterly aesthetic. Here, Scott squeezed an antiquated, hand-cranked camera and lightning frame to express his character's explosive rage. Although not quite successful, the techniques were introduced that should find their full expression in "Domino". <br /> <br /> Inserted into the framing device of an FBI survey "Domino", "Domino" presents the notorious bounty hunter's life via her narrative of disjointed fragments of memory. It attacks memories of how we all make fragments, flashes and short snapshots. When Domino tells her story verbally, Scott tells that she not only visually illustrates the events she describes, but also the point of view that guides her. She has "traces of mescaline" in her system, but her individual vision is uncommon anyway - that of a woman who avoids the life of luxury for bounty hunting. <br /> <br /> When Domino begins to report the events leading up to her imprisonment, Scott really lets it go. Together with cinematographer Dan Mindel and composer Harry-Gregson Williams, Scott orchestrates a postmodern canvas of contemporary Americana. We are beginning to realize that, unusually, even though she may be domino, she is no longer disconnected from the "90210" culture she rejected. As she moves through this cultural mix, Scott draws the viewer's attention to the innocence he destroys through the underprivileged children who introduce the narrative. Finally, Scott portrays her salvation as the only escape from this surreal journey. <br /> <br /> If you criticize this film for overly stylized, that is synonymous with criticizing a Picasso or a Pollock for not being the recognizable human. As with any large painting, the meaning in Domino lies in the surface and the surface is everything. <br /> <br /> I'm not affiliated with Scott Free at all, but I've always been a great admirer of Tony Scott's work
