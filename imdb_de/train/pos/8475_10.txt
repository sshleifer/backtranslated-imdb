This is a children's fantasy movie based on the Boggy Creek Legend, though I do not know why they called Return to Boggy Creek a sequel. This film has nothing to do with the documentary and its fantasy children's tariff. Dawn Wells plays the mother of 3 children who lost themselves with two other men in the swamp around Boggy Creek and the monster comes to their aid. Yes, it is very stupid and the plot is hackneyed, but this kind of movie is perfect for the group of 8-12 years it was aimed at. It's harmless for G-rated kids, and at least you do not have to worry about leaving your kids alone while they watch it. Strictly for the 8-12 year olds, older children will be bored and think that it is lame.
