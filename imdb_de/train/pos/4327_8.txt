I like this presentation - I've read Bleak House, and I know it's so hard to portray the entire book as it should and others like Little Dorrit. I love Diana Rigg and I could see the pain of Lady Dedlock herself through the expected arrogance of the aristocracy. I'm sorry, I think she's the best Lady Dedlock ... I'm not sure who could have done Jarndyce better, but I'm fine with Mr. Elliott. It is not easy to introduce these long Dickens books - Oliver Twist would be simpler - this is a long one, and if you are not interested in all legal situations, it can be bleak or boring. I find this presentation entertaining enough not to be boring. I just loved Mr. Smallweed - it can be entertaining. There is always a child - Jo will break your heart here ... I think we should have a chance to judge for ourselves ... <br /> <br /> I have to say that I loved the show , Maybe I can get more critical if I read the book again, the way I usually do after watching the movie. In the meantime, I think it's a good presentation.
