I think when "Beat Street" had a national gig, "Flashdance" came at the same time. The problem with "Flashdance" is that there was only one breakdance scene and the rest jazz dance and ballet. That was one of the reasons why "Beat Street" was better. The only film that could compete with "Beat Street" seems to be "Footloose," as both films focused on how people used the dance to express their ultimate feelings. <br /> <br /> The breakdance scene in "Beat Street" comes just before the middle and at the end of the strip. And I loved everyone. Almost all of the break-tricks were seen in the break-jam scenes: the jackhammer, the flares, the head spinning, the suicidal seat, the crazy legs, the mortal, the forward flip, the number four - almost everything <br /> Like "The Warriors", "Beat Street" has power gang life in the hip-hop world ... but in a much less violent way than the first one. The only major battle scene in "Beat Street" was when the graffiti artist Ramon (who was shortened in the movie as "Ramo") was persecuted by a rival gang member on the New York subway tracks ... and fought each other out third rail and both died by electric shock on this rail. Well, even though this scene of persecution ended tragically, it was better that they died that way than bleeding blood through a shotgun. <br /> <br /> Most of the gait material in this streak consisted of graffiti related to hip-hop culture and rap music. A lot of rap music surfaced in the movie because hip-hop members used rap music as a distraction to the negative aspects of gang-life. Even the title song of the movie that closed the curtain on the tee was not only a tribute to hip-hop culture, but also a tribute to Ramon's death. <br /> <br /> By the way, during the dance scene 'tango, tango', I appreciate that the female drummer in the pit orchestra, who was conducted by actress Rae Dawn Chong, was Sheila E., who made a cameo appearance.
