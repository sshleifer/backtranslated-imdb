On the surface, "Written on the Wind" is a dazzling, brilliant soap opera about sexual disorders in a Texas oil family. Below that, however, is a deep social commentary on the life of the 50s. Director Douglas Sirk scores again with another Univeral Sudser. Robert Stack falls in love with Lauren Bacall. The problem is that Stack's best buddy, Rock Hudson, loves her too. When Stack finds out he's sterile and Bacall gets pregnant, the fireworks are flying. And the overly good Dorothy Malone won an Oscar for her portrait of Texas's biggest nympho, which Hudson shunned. Good epic soap opera.
