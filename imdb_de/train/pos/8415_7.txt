If "The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari" is the father of all horror films (and German Expressionist cinema), this film before the First World War is the grandfather. The titular student, starved to death in an empty garret, makes a deal with the devil - the devil gives him a bottomless sack of gold in exchange for "anything in this room". The devil selects the mirror image of the student in his mirror. He goes away with the doppelg√§nger of the student committing crimes for which the student is blamed. <br /> <br /> The film is hampered by some limitations resulting from the technically primitive state of filmmaking in 1913; the action screams for chiaro-scuro effects, but the film is necessarily virtually everything in the shadowless daylight. But the scene where the reflection comes out of the mirror is still an eye-catcher. <br /> <br /> More interesting for the trends that exist than for yourself, is worth the student from Prague.
