The part where Meg visits the mechanic and says, "Is the piston short?" (which suggests a bad sexual energy on the part of her fianc√©) was hilarious. I love Meg Ryan and she is as cute as ever in this wonderful movie. Very adorable and also very intelligent. Your innocent, indignant expressions wish you she was yours. The hero treats the garage mechanic well for the physicist transformation. Einstein had a romantic side of his psyche? The puzzle round in front of the press and the audience was well done. It is terribly underrated and deserves awards and revival attempts. She loses a voice as she includes the most unlikely far-fetched theory of the US government. I do not understand why it does not belong to the 20 most romantic comedies of the century. Great movie, it has the seal of approval of the president!
