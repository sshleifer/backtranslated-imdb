Although I really enjoyed Jim Carrey's latest "serious" performances ("The Truman Show," "Man on the Moon"), I've always thought his ingenious lie was in the physical comedy. That's not to say he's a fantastic, talented actor: these Bozos at the Academy Awards do not seem to like him so much, he's never had a (well deserved) nomination or distinction. Well, any "institution" that proposes a hole like "Titanic" for 11 Oscars should not be taken seriously. <br /> <br /> Continue with the review. "The Grinch" is the cutest, best-looking, best-played and entertaining season movie since The Nightmare Before Christmas. Both films seem to be very similar, with their highly stylized sets and the premise that someone steals Christmas. Both make their protagonists look like the villains (one to a higher degree than the other), both have a strong moral lesson and both are really enjoyable. That is, until you realize that Jack Skellington is a doll and The Grinch is a human. But a man so incredibly expressive, so fluid in his movements, so cartoony, so unreal, that he never gets in the way of the movie. He can be weird, he can be a sad soul, he can be angry. He lives in a 3-dimensional world where 3-dimensional people live. He jokes, he laughs, he cries, and in the end he saves Christmas. I loved this movie to pieces and I can not wait to see it on DVD. This is one of those movies that you will really enjoy in 10, 20 years. As timeless as they come.
