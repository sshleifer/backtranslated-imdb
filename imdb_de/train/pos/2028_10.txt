Burlinson and Thornton together with Dennehy make an outstanding performance in this film. Although it's all about love at first, it really goes deeper. The beauty of nature captures this movie and is one of the best I have ever seen. The horse scenes are absolutely fantastic !! All horse lovers will love this movie! <br /> <br />
