After Fatih Akin's first work "In July," which was pretty good, he developed a really great Italian family epic. It is a German film, which unfortunately is a bad condition, because we rarely produce more than moderate films;). But this movie makes some very good snapshots of that time. "Solino" is about an Italian immigrant who arrived in the Ruhr area in the 60s. The immigrant and his family then found the first pizza restaurant in the region. The characters are excellently drawn. Especially Gigi, the main actor. You live every second, every feeling he does. His brother, played by Moritz Bleibtreu, is not so good. Well, you just do not believe him. But the character is well balanced and fits in perfectly with this script. I have an urgent need to compare the style of this film with the style of "The Godfather". Many people will probably hate this movie, saying it's boring. Not much tension? - yes, but an outrageous movie. 9 out of 10.
