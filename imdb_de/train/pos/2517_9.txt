I got this movie after a long wait from Netflix, so I was very much looking forward to it when it arrived. My worst fears were that it would plot, and ... Well, you know what all those screaming fan girls babbled about? GACKTnHYDE = hawt yaoi love? This kind of thing? Fear it. I was very, very positively surprised. The film was surprisingly good to see, though the filming and the music gave the impression of someone throwing out a pair of nun chicks every two scenes. Hyde, um, Hyde, acted as a quasi-romantic friend / gang member that would hardly surprise anyone who saw him on stage. He's one of my two big cattle with the movie itself. But the rest of the cast (including the children actors in the opening scene) was very good at doing what they did - which was mostly shot and shouted at. But my second problem was very small, which had to do with the malice. It seemed too exciting to me - a horror for me - like any scene where someone is shot. But Sho just does ... repeats the shots, tilts, MUCH bubbles as he talks and makes Hyde cry. All in all, if you're an actor fan or just a J-movie fan, it's definitely worth a watch.
