Who says that Pokemon is stupid, can die. This movie is superlative. I even shed a tear when Celebei died. I do not scream a lot! This movie is a touching, animated thriller. <br /> <br /> In this fourth installment of pokemon, Ash and his friends need to prevent Celebei from becoming the ultimate evil weapon with his dark ball. In time, Sam and Celebei travel through time and are constantly being hunted by game hunters. I like the role in the double fight and Sam has the apricorn pokeball (if you played pokemon gold, silver or crystal, you know what it is.) <br /> <br /> Miramax was also fun instead of Warner Brothers. To place the mini-film at the end was a great idea. The Pokemon in this movie will come alive more than ever.
