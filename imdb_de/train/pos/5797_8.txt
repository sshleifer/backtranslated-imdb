And I do not say it bad. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie at the age of 6 or 7 years in the cinema. For me and my cousins ​​it was magical, beautiful and scary at the same time. When we left the theater, Michael was our best friend, although we knew he had no idea. Over the years, I've seen this movie air a couple of times, but I always switched channels. Even if I only saw it for a few seconds, I would bring back that feeling of magic and warm my heart. And I liked it that way. <br /> <br /> So I only saw this movie once and I think it was a good decision not to look at it again. When I saw it today, I know that I could not help but criticize MJ's acting, the plot (if there was one) and this and that. For me, this is a childhood memory, so my feelings are those of a child of 20 years ago. <br /> <br /> I see my adult intervene in my rating and give him an 8 for the memories and the wonderful music. For the little kid who was awed 20 years ago, it's definitely worth 10.
