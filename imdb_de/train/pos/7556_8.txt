Okay, that was a damn good episode. Much better than the credit it gets. <br /> <br /> The camera work is great. Best yet. I love this last shot. The atmosphere is fantastic, the costumes are great and the guest cast (without the helpless victims) is strong. <br /> <br /> What I do not like about this episode is that many things go unexplained. Why does gender change it? What is the purpose? and they are aliens? which type? Why were they never shown again in later mythology? <br /> <br /> I give THIS episode THREE stars. One of my favorites still, but the storylines bother me. Still ... do not let me ruin my conversation.
