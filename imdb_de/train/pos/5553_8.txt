Slow but beautiful story of the American Revolution. Griffith's storytelling seems to be much more cumbersome than in his earlier historical epics, and his tableaux works are fully integrated into the storyline. Lionel Barrymore is an absolute pig, Neil Hamilton is poor but dashing and Carol Dempster is ... Well, Carol Dempster is most of what's wrong with Griffith at this time, but she does not show up often enough to keep up the pace slow down and drama. <br /> <br /> Note that the minor details in this movie say that the movie originally appeared a little more than 2 hours from the first release, but there is no cut that lasts more than 90 minutes. However, the DVD release was presented at a slower FPS rate, which increases the voltage and returns to just over two hours. <br /> <br /> Much better in storytelling than sound versions like THE PATRIOT. Although not quite in the league of the best of Griffith, like WAY DOWN EAST and BROKEN BLOSSOMS, an excellent way to spend a few hours.
