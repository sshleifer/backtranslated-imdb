Surprisingly good early performance by Alfred Hitchcock. As one of the few original screenplays by Hitchcock himself, this film shows a remarkable structure in the story. It begins with a rousing boxing match in which carnival champion "One Round" Jack loses a challenger from the audience who happens to be a professional prize fighter. The movie then slows down to develop the characters and introduce a love triangle between Jack, his girl and the professional boxer. The rest of the film is a dramatic build-up of the rematch between the two men, this time for the heavyweight crown. Already in this early film Hitchcock shows his talent for meaningful cinematography and prop placement. An armband that the boxer bought for the girl appears as a symbol of her unfaithfulness throughout the movie. The only major disadvantage of this film is that the art of shooting a boxing match in 1927 has not yet been perfected. The final is a bit anti-climactic. The story, however, carries this film.
