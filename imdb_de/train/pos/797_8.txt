To those who did not follow the murder case of Anne Marie Fahey. They miss one of the saddest, but most complicated murder of all. The killer is the well-known lawyer of Delaware, Tom Capano, and the victim is the planning secretary to the Governor of Delaware, Anne Marie Fahey. Her relationship was a well-kept secret until her disappearance and murder. She wanted to leave him, but he did not let her go so easily. On the other hand, he had a lover, a wife and four daughters. Where did he find the time for two lovers and a domestic family life? In addition, the case for a four-hour mini-series is extremely complicated and intriguing. While the actress playing Ms. Fahey does a good job, she does not have dark, long hair. His other lover is definitely more attractive than the real woman. Mark Harmon looks better and has an Emmy award-winning performance than Tom Capano. It would be better with the actual locations in Delaware and Philadelphia. With production running on Ann Rules, she adds to Anne Marie's characterization of the organization and her personal struggle with an eating disorder. This information can be overlooked by any other executive producer or director. If you have not read the book, it's worth it. Ann Rule is a fascinating storyteller of the real crime. It's ironic that Mark Harmon plays Tom Capano. He also played Ann Rules former friend and theme, Ted Bundy, in another book adaptation many years ago. He was brilliant then and now. He does an above average job with an amazing story. Even President CLinton offered his support in the case of Anne Marie Fahey. And now, former governor Tom Carper is the US Senator for Delaware, who defeated longtime, popular Senator Richard Roth in the November 2000 election. IF you do not find the movie interesting, then the book of the rule.
