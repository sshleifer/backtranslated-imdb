My rating: 8/10 <br /> <br /> I really like this movie. Compared to today's mindless movie (Action and Special Effect only and nothing new about ideas), ask "Soylent Green" for something that no longer exists today: reflection. <br /> <br /> Well, it would not be big Surprise a day people eat "biscuits" that are created with the human body. With all that happens on this planet, and to see how people are so indifferent to all, this future is possible. <br /> <br /> Sure, this movie needs some time, but the idea behind the movie is up to date again. Rich in paradise, other in hell. Well, today they are TV and idiocy like "Reality Show". <br /> <br /> TV is a good wash brain. It is a shame to see that human intelligence does not evolve like technology. Since writing, stop everything. <br /> <br /> If you like reality show, this movie is not for you. If you believe all politicians alike. If you do not like to ask questions about the present and the future, never look at this movie.
