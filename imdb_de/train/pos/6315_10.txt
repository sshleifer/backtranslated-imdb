Welcome to Collinwood is a lot of things, but it's none of the following: <br /> <br /> A George Clooney Starcraft Unfunny Un-Original <br /> <br /> And yes, I know the basis for that Movie is another movie. But as far as Hollywood is concerned, this can be one of the most authentic results in this decade - and for me too. <br /> <br /> The film is an absolute gasoline from beginning to end. Here is the reason. <br /> <br /> There is no bad performance in the movie. The funny parts are funny. The edged parts are edgy. The script does not contain a boring dialog. The cinematography is fresh and very nice. And it does not conform to the Hollywood standard (you'll see what I mean when you watch the movie.) <br /> <br /> When I was a kid, I remember being promoted to the movie , This film went under the radar after not earning much at the box office and is not even a cult classic. The reason why Transformers 2 is considered acceptable by average moviegoers is that they are used to seeing Transformers 2. If the film is as original and funny as this, so many millions of pieces were pumped out Cinema experience would be a much fresher place - <br /> <br /> If "they" say they do not do it the way they used to did, "they have not seen" Welcome to Collinwood. <br /> <br /> An entertaining mini-masterpiece of capers comedy that makes no compromises. One of my favourites.
