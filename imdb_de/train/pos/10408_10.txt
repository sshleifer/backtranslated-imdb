I saw this movie for the first time when I was a little kid, and instantly fell in love with it. The sets are stunning and some of the scripts are damned funny: "You sons of a thousand fleas". <br /> <br /> It is always shown on TV late at night or very early in the morning when I woke up around 3 in the morning and it had just started. TV companies need to show a little more respect and put it to prime time on Sunday, so everyone gets the chance to see this good work. <br /> <br /> 10/10
