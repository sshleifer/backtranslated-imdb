I was bored one night and Red Eye was on and thought why not. <br /> <br /> Red Eye has been one of the best movies in a long time. <br /> <br /> I mean, I just got in The movie was awesome. <br /> <br /> The story is new and different. <br /> <br /> The film also has two great leads in the movie with Rachel Mcadams as Lisa Reisert and Cillian Murphy as Jackson Rippner. <br /> <br /> The acting is awesome and you get the feeling for the people in the movie. <br /> <br /> The music is just excellent, it gives you a shiver and it also makes you feel relaxed. <br /> <br /> I just love how the movie was done so well and never gets boring. <br /> <br /> Red Eye is just phenomenal. No more and no less. <br /> <br /> It's an excellent thriller. <br /> <br /> Overall, I enjoy Red Eye so much that I can watch it over and over again. <br /> <br /> If you like Red Eye then I recommend Elektra and Cry Wolf. <br /> <br /> I'm giving out Red Eye 9 10. <br /> <br /> Great movie
