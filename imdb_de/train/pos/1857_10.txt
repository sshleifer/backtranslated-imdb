This movie was amazing. I would recommend it to anyone, much better than what I had expected. It was definitely a heartwarming spectacular movie. It's an amazing story with amazing actors and creators. Definitely another great movie with Denzel Washington. (should surprise no one) Derek Luke has also done a wonderful job.
