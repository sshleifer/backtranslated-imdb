For those of us Baby Boomers who arrived late in the scene to James Dean et. al., Martin Sheen showed us The Way in this great feature. <br /> <br /> The premise is simple enough: cool hood meets town sheriff and all-hell, but the be-all and end-all of this movie inspires us in all of us. <br /> <br /> No, this is not Casablanca or great literature, but it's a serious film about cars, rebellion and the genius of Martin Sheen. <br /> <br /> Enjoy it and appreciate it for what it is and for what Martin will become. I loved this movie as a teenager in the 70s, and you will.
