I loved this movie because Corrine and Sean are newbies in the business. It was full of action and a bit of romance, but there were some points when Corrine did not speak very clearly (as she threatened Sean with the movie) gun) and she clenched her teeth ... maybe she should? I think the roles of Joseph and Sonny were very well represented, and there was an obvious contrast. Also, as I watched the next action star, I'm sure Corrine and Sean did their own stunts, which were played very well , I'm looking forward to another movie from the couple as they form a great team or maybe a sequel to vying for your life - possibly titled 'It Grows Big in the Big Apple', this time it could be about Carmen. Your life is EXCELLENT!
