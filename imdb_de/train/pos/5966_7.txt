Actually, I never cared about Metal, it was satanic and stuff, but this movie somehow played with this idea. Although it is certainly not a serious movie or is really highly rated, it serves its purpose by entertaining while playing. The story has burned a metal band in their hotel, one of their fans has a dream and says the band is starting a killing course from outside the tomb. So, yes, a little bit of "Nightmare on Elm Street" is planned here. Granted, Freddy has never bothered a girl in a car. There was another movie that contained a heavy metal band, but it was very different when there was a band that took over a kind of children's village and drove them crazy. He just has one fan of the band who first supports the killer spirit and then tries to stop him. Nothing terrible because I do not remember so many bloody killings. Honestly, the scene I remember most is the scene where the girl wears headphones and then gets molested by a band's creature incarnation. Nothing great, but a nice Zeitf√ºller.
