Aro Tolbukhin burned seven people alive in a mission in Guatemala in the 1970s. He also said he killed another 16 people (he killed pregnant women and set them on fire). <br /> <br /> This film is a documentary that portrays the personality of Aro in several interviews with people who have met him and through scenes played by actors. <br /> <br /> "Aro Tolbukhin" is a serious work, so analytical, not at all pathological. Such a terrible testimony of how childhood trauma can turn a man into a monster. <br /> <br /> * My rating: 7/10
