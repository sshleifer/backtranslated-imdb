Hey guys, what's up? It's me, the only Mike "Sonny Sakura KIller" Kelly. You know ... you can not really write a review on the Sakura script because we did not have one there. As far as I know, the story was just invented in our course. I had the best time of my life shooting this movie and I had so much stink that Jisma fell victim to me. I'm so glad you liked the movie. I really could not handle the fights I had imagined. Each time I built some moves, the Fighting Director kept changing them. Nevertheless, I had a great time and met some really great people. Especially the violet female ninja who seems to be falling out of the movie scene.
