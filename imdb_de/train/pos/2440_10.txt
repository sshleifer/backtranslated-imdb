OH WOW. I saw this movie on March 12, 2000 at the Irish International Film Fleadh in Manhattan. Both stars were present and were then available for questions. What a great movie! Although Ireland is in the midst of a Catholic / Protestant antagonism, the story could have happened somewhere between two groups of people who hate each other. The horror of how quickly people can be abducted when given the chance to relinquish their hatred and anger has been beautifully woven with a moving love story tainted with humor and fun. If this is not picked up in the US, that would be very unlucky. <br /> <br /> As for the stars and supporting players ... FIRST RATE. I heard Orla Brady is Irish Meryl Streep. In my opinion she is BETTER than Meryl Streep. You should call Meryl the American Orla Brady! And Liam Cunningham's steady and powerful portrayal of a simple and private man drawn into a political war was brilliant. <br /> <br /> SEE THIS FILM.
