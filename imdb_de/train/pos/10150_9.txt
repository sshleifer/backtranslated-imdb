Sure, this movie is juicy and cute and full of clich√©s, but it's entertaining and I watch movies for it. Be entertained. Natasha Henstridge is stunning, even with short hair. Her smile shines and her beauty can not be disguised. I'm sure Michael Vartan loves women. The two seemed to really like others in this movie. I do not understand the comments that there was no chemistry between them. I think we see what we want to see. <br /> <br /> Olivia d'Abo and Michael Rigoli were fun, even though the British accent of d'Abo had crept into their alleged Bronx speech. To be honest, I did not notice it until I read those comments, but I went back to the DVD and now her dialogue sounds more British than American, but she was perfect for her role with this one exception. <br /> <br /> It's a story of two nice people marrying important people but finding their soulmates together. It may be an unlikely story, but who says films should all be like documentaries? It is no less realistic than any of the dramas shown every hour in the subway. That's why we watch them, to escape for a short time everyday life and to enter the world of the characters on the screen. I thought these actors did a good job, but hey, I'm a sentimental guy who easily rips apart. Do not get me wrong, it has to be a sentimental scene, and this movie had a lot of them. <br /> <br /> I'll give him 9/10 just because I save my 10/10 for not watching this awesome movie that I know he'll come with someday. If you see it being announced in the Movie Channel or in Lifetime Movies or whatever, make a note to see it. I think you will like it.
