* Possible spoilers * Although previously (and better) done in 'Midnight Express' and 'Return To Paradise', Brokedown Palace still strikes a chord with me. <br /> <br /> Here is the story of two young girls who travel through Thailand and are arrested for drug dealing. Was it the Alice of Clare Danes? Was it Darlene by Kate Beckinsale? Was it the pretty stranger they met on their journey? None of this is really important, because this is a story of friendship and trust and the limits to which they can rely. Throw Bill Pullman as an indecent lawyer and Jacqueline Kim as his Thai bride (and a better lawyer than him), and we have a nice little story that gets the attention of the audience. <br /> <br /> Brokedown Palace is nothing out of the ordinary. or notorious for some reason - it's not an original concept, it does not show any sensational violence that causes the wannabe avant-garde crowd to speak about "gritty realism" or "hard-hit truths" - it's just a good story with some good services. Bill Pullman is the weakest with his lazy and shabby conversation - I was pretty bored with the character. <br /> <br /> Kate Beckinsale is decent but nothing special. It works well, but it's not a memorable achievement. <br /> <br /> Jacqueline Kim, however, is in good shape and develops a sympathetic and defined character, which really is not much to do. <Br /> <br /> But do not make mistakes - this is Clare Danes' movie. I've been a fan of their work for a long time, and that's not a change. She captivates in every scene she appears in, and if it were not for her, the movie would probably turn into boring pleasure. I especially welcome her performance in the scene between her and Darlene's father. <br /> <br /> The movie also has a brilliant soundtrack. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10
