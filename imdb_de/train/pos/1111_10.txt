That's not "so bad it's good," it's just fine! For those who do not understand why, you have the intellect of a four-year-old (in response to a specific comment ...) Anyway, Killer Tomatoes Eat France is a parody of itself, a parody of you and a parody of mine , It is the most ingenious text in film history. I have it and the three prequels next to Duke and Kurosawa on my DVD rack. It embodies the recognition of absurdity and undermines everything that you or I call the standard. I write screenplays, and this movie opened a genre of comedy for me that we've never seen before. It can only be taken in portions ... its kind of exploitation ... I'm just trying to reach the minimum of ten lines now. My comment ended some time ago. Hopefully it will work if I submit it now.
