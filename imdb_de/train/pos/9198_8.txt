B movie? Yes. DIY? Yes. First movie? Yes. But aesthetically A +. This movie definitely had a bad sound / cut / lighting / drama / etc etc issues. However, this movie has many positive aspects. First, the most annoying character dies first! Second, it's a parody / funny B rated horror movie. The comments made by our killer on his victims made me and my friends roll around on the floor, laughing. <br /> <br /> The problem is that many people are trying to take any independent movie with them and expect it to be a masterpiece. Take it for what it is: A bunch of kids right in high school did their first movie. For what it is, it is really good.
