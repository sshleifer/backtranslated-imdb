The problem with the 1985 version of this movie is simple; Indiana Jones was so close to Alan Quartermain (or at least a type of Alan Quartermain) that the '85s director made the mistake of plundering the IJ films for dialogue and story too deeply. What you received as a finished product was a jumbled confusion of the name Alan Quartermain, in an uneven mix of a cheap imitated IJ saga (with a touch of Austin Powers-squeezing cheese here and there). <br /> <br /> It has been described by many critics as a "great parody" or "unintentional comedy". Unintentionally, the word is. This movie should never be humorous; funny, yes, but not humorous. Unfortunately it is funny and not funny. <br /> <br /> With this new M4TV mini-series you get much more story, character development of your lead role, solid presentations and a fine, even, entertaining mix. This story is a bit long. much longer than its predecessors, but rightly so, since this version carries a real plot and not just action and eye candy. While incorporating both Action and Eye Candy, it also corrects the mistake made in the 1985 version by forgetting IJ all together and returning to the source material for AQ, resulting in a fine, thoughtful storyline and some nice additions leads undergrounds. <br /> <br /> Now, this is not the whole action extravaganza that Indiana Jones is. It is not a bad attempt to be like that either. This vehicle is equipped with plot and character and is a beautiful reproduction of the AQ / KSM saga. Filmed on location in South Africa, the audience will be presented with beautiful (albeit barren) vistas, aboriginal cultures of South Africa, and a few beautiful wildlife shots that blend seamlessly with the performances and plot here. Steve Boyum totally surprised me with this because I have never joined one of his vision. In fact, until this attempt, I did not like most of his work as a director. I hope that this is more of a new talent than the coincidence that it seems to be. <br /> <br /> This version rates 9.8 / 10 on the "TV" scale of ... <br /> <br /> the Fiend.
