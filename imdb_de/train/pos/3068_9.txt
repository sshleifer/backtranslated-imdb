I read from the previous comments that this movie went straight to the cable. Well, I've paid to see it in a theater, and I'm glad I did it because it was a visually eye-catching movie. Most settings seem to have been made as in the early 1960s (except for the office, which was dated differently), and if you omit the sequences of Neve Campbell, the entire film has a washed-out ambiance of the early 60s. The use of restaurants in the movie was fascinating. For a first-time director whose background I think is in writing, he has a big eye. Within the first ten minutes, I felt that the plot was not plausible, so I deliberately stopped my disbelief and took a ride. In terms of acting and portraying father-son-mother-son-husband-wife-parent-child relationships, the movie was just right. William H. Macy, to see a pleasure, seems to close the gap left by the late Tony Perkins, if this and Magnolia are signs. Tracey Ullman as a neglected woman was very moving for me. It was a three-dimensional representation of a character that society too often considered two-dimensional. Donald Sutherland can of course add this to his collection of memorable portrayals. The portrayal of the parents (Bain / Sutherland) indirectly reminded me of Vincent Gallo's BUFFALO '66, albeit somewhat toned down! I would definitely pay money to see a second movie from this director. He has the self-discipline of a 50s crime movie director (something that P.T. Anderson will never have!), Yet he has a visual style and a pathway with actors that attract attention.
