Kudos to the authors of this film for creating a very engaging drama. The strange character development points to a nuanced and well-trained writing team. The onlooker can only help feeling that he has to make emotional decisions by placing the cerebral against the libidinal. The viewer has the opportunity to develop the character himself, although his predictions are rarely confirmed. <br /> <br /> Credit is also due to the filmmakers who brought the setting to life. The woodshop turns into a unique personality as the film evolves, with its own characteristics, faults, a multitude of highly charged relationships, and of course, a fate inexorably linked to that of other clients. <br /> <br /> Make sure you find this at your local art house.
