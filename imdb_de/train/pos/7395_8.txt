Almost the entire movie takes place in a public bathhouse in China. There are no extravagant sets, explosions or glamorous people - just good writing, acting and directing (Hollywood, please note!). An alienated son returns home, believing his father would die. He is surprised to see that dad looks good and leads the family business as usual. In fact, he realizes that his father and his retarded brother have really made a close and caring relationship, and it quickly becomes clear that he is unable! Dad is very traditional and this visiting son comes from the big city and does not really see the value of the old bath house. It is extraordinary and believable how their relationship changes and where the action comes from. <br /> <br /> I was glad to see that not every Chinese movie is an action image (such as those with Jet Li or Crouching Tiger, Hidden) Dragon), as these frenetic films do not particularly suit me interested. The shower and spring in a small town are two wonderful examples of good Chinese films about PEOPLE!
