Anyone who desperately looked at the emptiness and weaknesses of Disney Studios recent productions, here's something that should heal your wounds ... Once and for all, A Bug's life proves that purely synthetic imagery is a good scenario Good scenario, offering more than fake "Disney-themed" drawings (see The Lion King, Pocahontas, and all recent productions regretting that Bambi's magical backdrop and atmosphere have disappeared forever). <br /> <br /> The Life of a Beetle (1001 Pates for my French Companions!) Eliminate all the imperfections that make you awaken in the middle of the movie and say, "Hey, this thing is computer generated!". No faint parts, a tremendous amount of effort that shows its efficiency in the backgrounds and overall look of the sets, an amazing 3D bird (almost perfect in imitating reality) ... and there are only the technical aspects to mention. <Br /> <br /> The scenario, my friends, the real backbone of a movie, has some thickness! Oddly enough and obviously thanks to the team of Lasseter, there is practically no musical sequence in A Bug's life. Which means that the story is long and rich enough to free itself from those 3 or 4 minutes that some children appreciate but most of them do not like (the same applies to the parents or the anime fans like me). This movie reminded me of a really old movie with Steve Martin and Chevy Chase: The 3 Amigos; It basically had the same backstory story (a whole Mexican village living in the fear that some bad guys hire armed men (who eventually turn into actors) to protect them, etc.). Simple but efficient and brilliantly adapted to a colony of fearful ants, who face the wrath of malignant insects. <br /> <br /> Since Microcosmos, many films tell insects, their lives, their fears and hopes, but I think the life of a beetle is the funniest and best of all. The process of humanization has been perfect ... And the entire audience has been fascinated by Flik's adventure (aka Tilt in France). <br /> <br /> A big thank you to Lasseter's team, especially for the last 30 seconds. ..it's so strange and great at the same time to see a whole theater laughing, while the beetles / actors forget their lines or beat the camera ... <br /> <br /> And finally, especially for those of you who The French version also goes to the dubbing actors who have done a great synchro-work on this film. The life of a bug is a really good conversation, and I think it will soon be part of my video collection (a privilege granted to a few films, and that's no problem with the storeroom :). Go and look at it, that's an order.
