Some movies that you know you'll love the first few seconds. This is one of those movies. Back in the 1940s, "Double Indemnity" and "The Postman Ring Twice" - a great example of Modern Film Noir in the 90s. Nick Cage plays the main character "down on his luck", who is involved in a murder plan between husband and wife - and his luck gets worse every time he tries to get away from the people, the city, the violence and the Bringing violence to the Red Rock West threat. Many twists, great performances by Cage, Hopper and Walsh, a hypnotic slide-guitar background and seamless directing make this a real pleasure. Favorite Line: As Cage looks at the empty gas gauge in the escape car, shakes his head and says, "F *** in 'story of my life.'
