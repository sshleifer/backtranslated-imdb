I thought that was one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. It was a great story and showed that people are so complicated in different ways. I have recommended it to all my friends !! I always like a good story and this movie had one of the best I've seen in a long time. I could see how I had a daughter and did the same things that Natalie did to find out more about her life and her love. It turned out that we are not just living with our families; But we also have parts of our lives that we do not share with them - because it is not in their best interest to know all the details of things we are not so proud of. <br /> <br /> I'm looking forward to another movie and will keep my eyes open.
