Me and my groovadelic 20-pals just can not get enough of this great Parker Posey CLASSIC! I tried to borrow this on DVD, but I can not find it - too bad, because I'm sure the features would be "special"! :) We all recommend this over-cool Comedy Flickerino for a date or just for a cozy night alone! This would also be the purring movie you watch with your cat, or even have a party based on a party like "Party Girl," just like the movie the lovely, huggable, squishy Parker Posey offers to the end Oh, and you are looking for a gripping and HILARIOUS surprise ending. Watch out, The Sixth Sense, you've just been outdone by a Radder movie! Sorry, no offense, just call it what it is! Take it from an old movie lover, Comedy just does not get better than "Party Girl" with Parker P! Feel it! Her Ronald Marie MacDougall (aka DJ Cyber-Rap)
