If the answer to this question is yes, you should enjoy this excellent film. I just saw it a few hours ago here in Paris (where the action of the movie is taking place) and I can still feel the huge trauma I got in the back of my mind ... What a visual shock! I have never seen such a beautiful black and white photo and such a drastic change in the way of animated films. I firmly believe there will be a "renaissance" before and after, similar to Pixar films or experiences with Akira and GhostInTheShell. This is a real breakthrough in the small world of animated films, and I hope that this French initiative (a small unknown French studio with a few young people who had a dream called the "Renaissance") will receive the success and recognition, who deserves it. Vive la France!
