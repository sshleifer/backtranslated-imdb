Shame, before I saw this movie, I was not familiar with Helena Bonham Carter. good?), which she had to suffer. I was absolutely impressed by this beautiful lady. She pulled it out flawlessly. Who would have thought that sexually explicit circumstances concerning the final wishes and needs of a unique young woman could be interpreted as tender and romantic? Well, they can, if the right actors present them in the right way, like in this wonderful movie. I forgot to mention how dynamic beautiful Miss Carter looked in this film. I have often said that she is the most beautiful creature that has ever adorned the face of our earth, but she seemed to have done herself in this movie. Enjoy it just like me. Thank you for giving me my opinion.
