I swear, when I saw this movie for the first time, I pulled my eyes out! A STAR IS BORN is the movie that lets you know what love really looks like, though John Norman (Kris Kristofferson) and Esther (Streisand) encounter obstacles. They also experience what it's like to lose such a love at the end of the film. Streisand and Kristofferson have such great chemistry and the music is fantastic! When Streisand sings With another look at you / Look closely now, it's just pure magic! This movie made the song Evergreen one of my favorites, and Queen Bee is such a funny song. I also love the fashion of the 70s (except Streisands Afro, and she is also a beauty). A star is born is my favorite movie. This movie is a pleasure to see and ends up being a heartbreaker.
