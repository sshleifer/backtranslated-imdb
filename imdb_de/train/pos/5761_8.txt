I swear, the zombie was killed twice and kept coming back. I gave this movie an 8. Let's be honest, folks, that's exactly what the other reviewers say, d. H. A "mobile cam," a movie that was shot. Hey, hey, hey, welcome to total Indy movie production. The fact that Todd Sheets received over 700 zombies for this film is a tribute to his talents. Yes, history has gaps, yes, we see the same zombies again and again, but who cares? Take it for what it is, a funny and bloody horror movie, a movie that can be shared with your buds, or spend the people that really interest you in LOL. Sophisticated people, I suppose you liked trash like "Titanic" or "Twister" instead. Support peace and independent filmmaking !!!
