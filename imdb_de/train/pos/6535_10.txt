That was a great movie! Although there were only about 15 people, I was great! My friend and I laughed a lot. My mother even enjoyed it. There were two middle-aged women and a middle-aged girl, and they seemed to enjoy it. I love the part where Corky and Ned both like Nancy and sweet lol. And when she gets her roadster and Ned is there. Yes, that was a great movie, even though people underestimated it. Look, I bet you will enjoy it! I really enjoyed it and my girlfriend too. <br /> <br /> People were so tough in this movie and they did not even see him. I bet next time they give the movie and the actresses a chance. They all did a great job in my opinion. But if you have small children, it is still appropriate. I will probably take my 7 year old niece with me.
