This movie was extremely funny, I would have liked to own it for my vintage collection of 1970s movies to see a list. I know this cast of characters. These are people I've met over the years that cause me to find this comedy Unfortunately, this has never been done on DVD or VHS. Redd Foxx has always been a clown of comedy, Pearl Baily a great game for his wife, witty and cheeky. Norman is a son with a secret who is not sure he will have a future when he comes out. Dennis Dugan is a crazy, funny man. Miss Dobson hooker with heart and little conscience. Love, lust, strange family ties This film is suitable for an upcoming encore, a situation comedy with a mix of events, as this could and should find its way as a remake. I think it would be very difficult to find a cast unless Jerry Seinfeld plays Dennis Dugan's role. This is a hallmark of a couple of Seinfeld episodes that also brought me back to Norman: holding them close was certainly impossible, as it was impossible to reform a whore's girlfriend and the unfaithfulness of a parent. This movie was a wild piece of advice from a taxi driver. Remember the episode in which Kramer advises his caddy about his lawyer. (Episode from Seinfeld) The parents have a stunning moment, fun over fun. It screams, bring me back.
