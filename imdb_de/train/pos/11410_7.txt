EDMUND LOWE (who reminds me a bit of Warren William) leads the beautiful cast of an intriguing little puzzle that moves fast and takes just over an hour. Douglas Walton plays the unfortunate jockey who seems to be thinking of his own demise (hypnotism, anyone?), And the suspects include a large number of the bystanders - all by Virginia Bruce, Kent Smith, Frieda Inescourt, Gene Lockhart, Jessie Ralph, Benita Hume and Rosalind Ivan and HB Warner As an added bonus, there's Nat Pendleton as a fool detective - plus lots of art deco decorations for the chic interiors of a wealthy home. It must have been a set used in many subsequent films. <br /> <br /> On the plus side, the puzzle is not so complicated that any act can reasonably be sure not to be confused. Suddenly Detective Philo Vance knows everything - and then he has one last confrontation with the killer, which gives the film five minutes of tireless suspense. <br /> <br /> Nicely done and gives time in a fun way.
