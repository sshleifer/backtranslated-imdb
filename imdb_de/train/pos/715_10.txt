All the people who sit here and say that the weak link in this movie are the Ramones would probably say that Amadeus would be alright, if not that irritating harpsichordist. Rock and Roll High School focused on the Ramones. As anyone can observe, and Joey Ramone can not kick, eating bean sprouts from behind the scenes to keep him in good shape is obviously a wet square dad-o. Ms. Trogar exploding white mice, patrolling the hall ... instant classics. Do not forget the reef Randell character. <br /> <br /> If you do not like the Ramones, you do not know Rock and Roll and you do not deserve to watch a movie called ROCK AND ROLL High School.
