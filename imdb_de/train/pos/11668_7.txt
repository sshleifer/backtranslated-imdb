After 1945 and after a series of solid propaganda pieces from World War II, Errol Flynn's hold on the US box office had subsided, so that despite the increasing burden of diminishing glances, he began a series of films that had referred to this genre made his name: the Swashbuckler. The first of these was actually a good one - ADVENTURES OF DON JUAN (1948) - but it also turned out to be his last big-budget Hollywood star vehicle. The rest of his sword-wielding days were spent all over Europe: in England for KIM (1950), THE MASTER OF BALLANTRAE (1953) and THE DARK AVENGER (1955), in France for ADVENTURES OF CAPTAIN FABIAN (1951) and Italy for the aborted DIE HISTORY OF WILLIAM TELL (1953) and the little-seen CROSSED SWORDS (1954). Hollywood, however, lured him one last time to his old seafaring ways - but to a humble universal image rather than to a Warner Brothers 'A' production that he had grown accustomed to at its peak ... <br /> <br /> Still Here the glorious Technicolor cinematography jumps out of the screen, and while an older and more flabby Flynn looks like the pale shadow of his former self, his red-haired lead actress Maureen O'Hara has a day as a bombastic Buccaneer leader. Whoever is deep in heart longs after romance and would like to be treated like a woman. Anthony Quinn was a few more years away from his larger-than-life starry vehicles, so he is usually considered the villain - pirate captain Roc Brasiliano, a role he enthusiastically attacks. Like THE BLACK SHIELD OF FALWORTH (1954) - a tour that preceded this - AGAINST ALL FLAGS, it brings me back to my childhood days of constant television, as old Hollywood movies in both the local and neighboring Italians at the Agenda were channels. <br /> <br /> By all accounts, this may have been the very first pirate movie I have ever seen, and I am thinking of the current generation of youths who allegedly believe the grossly overpowered PIRATES of KARIBIK trilogy is what the buccaneering is all about! As I said earlier, AGAINST ALL FLAGS may not be the best pirate yarn ever brought to the screen, but it's a solid example of this productive genre. Nowadays, the amorous perseverance of the childish Indian princess (Alice Kelley) may be a dreadful dumbass to her pirate catcher Flynn, but the rest of it - though she obviously does not exceed the highlights of THE SEA HAWK (1940) and THE BLACK SWAN (1942) Calling the best seafaring adventures of its respective stars is lively and sensible. By the way, the movie was later replayed as THE KING'S PIRATE (1967) with Doug McClure. <br /> <br /> For what it's worth, the unparalleled box office success of this unappetizing, modern franchise has most likely led to reluctant cinema studios dusting off their catalog speculation and releasing it on DVD and indeed publishing it AGAINST ALL FLAGS themselves A trinket in a poorly thought out Universal's Pirates Of The Golden Age Movie Collection series, which included obscure cinders such as BUCCANEER'S GIRL (1950, with Yvonne De Carlo), DOULE CROSSBONES (1951, with Donald O'Connor), and YANKEE BUCCANEER (1952, with Jeff Chandler)! Value for money maybe, but so far I have acquired the Errol Flynn strip only from other sources; If I notice the mood in the future, perhaps I would like to have similar adventures at sea like Edward Dmytyk's MUTINY (1952), the aforementioned YANKEE BUCCANEER and PIRATES OF TORTUGA (1961).
