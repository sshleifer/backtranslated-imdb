A meteor crashes in Crater Lake, the heat of the impact makes a prehistoric egg hatch. <br /> <br /> Okay, so the conspiracy is just garbage. Despite the apparently low budget, this looks like one of the most gripping and entertaining monster-on-the-lose movies out there. There are also some good moments of humor. In an age full of so-called "monsters" that are no more than ridiculous creations of man-in-rubber suits, or lizards dressed in ruffles and tearing each other apart (cheap style of exploitation), it's refreshing to discover it The plesiosaur in this little gem is an excellent Harryhausen-style stop-motion creature. <br /> <br /> It's a tough movie, but worth it to find it.
