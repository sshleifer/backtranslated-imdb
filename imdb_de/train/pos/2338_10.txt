Many of these other viewers complain that the plot has already been tried. That may be so, but the addition of the narrator and Dr.Sess-like scenery makes this show a must. With allusions to adults throughout the show and a touch of childhood through the set, the show is reminiscent of both the music and the empowerment. The investigative part of the show is not what captivates the audience. The twisted acts and lines of love scattered throughout this apparent paradise keep faithful viewers back for more. This is a success that ABC should never let go. Bravo ABC. LOST was getting old to revive the prime time. 9 episodes before the writers' strike left the audience more.
