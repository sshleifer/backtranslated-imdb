A classic cartoon, always enjoyable and funny. It has an interesting plot with lovable characters. Road Rovers is a show worth seeing, it's a short 13 episode, and if you ever have a chance to see it, you should do it. Unfortunately it is very hard to find. I think Warner Brothers Studios should release a DVD with all 13 episodes. I would definitely buy it if they did, and if they did you should buy it. If you have children who like dogs, they will love Rover! Road Rovers should have received more attention during the broadcast, it was definitely an original and very special show that was much more than expected.
