After a slow start, BRUCE ALMIGHTY is a very funny movie that had something positive to say. It was not one of Jim Carrey's best performances, but he was still fine. Morgan Freeman was right, as was God. Jennifer Aniston had some good moments. I miss Steve Correll on "THE DAILY SHOW!" <br /> <br /> I like the film choice of director Tom Shadyac. He has also made LIAR LIAR, PATCH ADAMS and THE NUTTY PROFESSOR. With all these three and Bruce Almighty he takes a big comedy star and tells a human story with him. A director who knows comedy can get the talent he gets and can tell a meaningful and intelligent story that's hard to find. <br /> <br /> My biggest complaint is that they should have used more biblical references. I just remember three specific biblical references and they were the three funniest parts of the entire movie. My guess is that the first drafts of the script had more biblical references, but they were cut off because the producers were afraid of offending people. That's too bad, because I thought it was a missed opportunity. <br /> <br /> My degree: <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10
