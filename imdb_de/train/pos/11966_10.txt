This is an excellent series. You will laugh, you will cry, these wonderful people will be part of your family. The way this family looks after each other and helps each other in their crisis is a good example of how we should live our lives. There are many good things they do and a lot of bad decisions, but they never turn their backs on the family, they work through problems. Michelle, the youngest daughter, is the cutest thing I've ever seen. Stephanie, the middle daughter, suffers from middle-child syndrome and with the help of ALL people in the family, it is better. DJ, the eldest daughter, grows up, no matter if her father wants it or not. One thing they all share is that they miss their mother. Danny (Dad), Joey and Uncle Jesse love these kids so much, and that shows in every episode.
