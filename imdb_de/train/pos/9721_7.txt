How to lose friends and alienate people is a decent comedy with a romantic approach. <br /> <br /> It's actually a story in which Sidney Young (Simon Pegg) breaks through in the journalism and magazine business, which is interpreted in a fun way. Simon Pegg made an OK, a little worse than usual. The movie is not funny or funny or anything, but it has its moments, and those moments are really funny. <br /> <br /> I recommend this fun and it is worth seeing Americans with an English comedy of comedy to all people. I just want to sit, relax and enjoy the movie as it is. If you watch this movie critically, you should be passed, unless you want to be disappointed and throw away the garbage.
