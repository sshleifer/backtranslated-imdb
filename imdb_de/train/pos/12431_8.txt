Okay, frankly, I saw the previews for this movie and thought, what do the producers think? Hutton, Jolie and Duchovny? How could the monotonous actor possibly compete with Jolie's natural power on the screen? But surprisingly, the two had a kind of chemistry that showed intense care without kissing. Even David's humor matched Jolie's sparks and fire. In terms of Hutton, he played the psycho very well, in contrast to David's quiet delivery of life-threatening situations. All in all, I was very impressed with the development of writing and character. I gave him 8 stars.
