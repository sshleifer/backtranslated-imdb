The Oscar-winning film was released two years ago and offers it all - lavish technicolor sets and costumes, stunning cinematography, great wall-to-wall Gershwin music, superb choreography, a less-than-air script, and great performances by Kelly, Levant , Foch, Guetary and Caron. Hollywood does not make her that way anymore. In any case, this is my favorite movie of all time, after which I can judge all other films. ENJOY, ENJOY, ENJOY!
