Fantastic movie. One that stimulates all 5 senses. Is not a true historical report and not all information is to be understood as factual information. Real Hollywood conventions, such as A-list and VERY attractive actors as "heroes", such as Naomi Watts (Julia Cook's lover), Heath Ledger (Ned) and Orlando Bloom (Joe Byrne - Ned's right hand). and unattractive (sorry Geoffrey Rush) actors play the drunken and corrupt Victorian police. This also adds a very unreliable love story to the mix between Ned (Ledger) and Julia Cook (Watts) to attract all the romantics, with women being particularly vulnerable. Even from the first scene, when Ned rescues the fat youth from drowning and his father calls him "Sunshine" and has a "glint in his eyes as he looks down at me, his hand on my shoulder," he is very romantic and convinces viewers to the side with Ned Kelly, the underdog. Besides, do not all Aussies love an underdog?
