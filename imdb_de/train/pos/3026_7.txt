Charles Boyer is said to be a Spaniard and come to London to buy coal in "1945," a film entitled Confidential Agent, which featured Lauren Bacall, Katina Paxinou, Peter Lorre, Dan Seymour, and Wanda Hendrix , Boyer is Luis Denard and everyone wants to stop him, except Bacall. His papers are stolen, he is charged with murder, but he is determined to raise money for his people to fight the fascists. <br /> <br /> This film has its good and less good points. It is high for atmosphere and excitement and it is very entertaining. Bacall is unbelievably beautiful, Boyer is passionate, Paxinou is mean, Lorre is slimy, Hendrix is ​​downright pathetic, and Seymour is unbelievably wonderful. <br /> <br /> The not so good points: Bacall should be English and Boyer Spanish. Oh no. Boyer is great in his role even with the wrong accent, but Bacall is 100% American and not in the British upper class. The two have no chemistry. Conclusion: Bacall is wrong. Her acting is also no snuff; She is better in other films. But she is an amazing looking woman and much can be forgiven. <br /> <br /> Paxinou is almost over the top and hateful. Dan Seymour steals almost the entire movie as a hotel guest studying human nature. It's a great part and its performance is perfect, while the direction of the other actors is not so good. This was definitely a case of not small parts, only small actors. Seymour was not a small actor. <br /> <br /> Despite its shortcomings definitely worth seeing.
