Finally, we get a TV series in which we can see the acting talent! Episode one was excellent! The script gave us a little more than usual, yes, there was still the "I'm not your dad - I'm your dad and your omigod you betrayed me!" Nonsense, but the script allowed the actors to actually feel and live those real moments instead of showing us how it would feel if, like so many TV soaps. <br /> <br /> The camera work also gave us a little more than usual, there were no boring shots of repeating angles for hours, but there were no unnecessary 'shots in shots or handheld camera shit' to be an 'artistic' one. rand gave us what we needed to see and some beautiful scenery too! <br /> <br /> Nothing was overly dramatized or melodramatic. They were real people in a real place, dealing with real situations. The show lacked nothing dramatic and was completely relevant. It was such a relief to be confronted with real acting and it was so nice to show our country how talented our actors can be when they get a real script, a real chance! Thank you, Tony Tilse, Sam Miller, channel ten and all cast and crew - wonderful work !! Carry on what you do, your efforts will be greatly appreciated and will not go unnoticed!
