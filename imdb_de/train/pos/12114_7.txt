This film is obviously low budget and was filmed in British Columbia, Canada. The obstacles that needed to be overcome to make this film compelling (in California and the late 1960s to 1980s) were well thought out. I believe that this is the best and most accurate version of the Zodiac killings that plagued the city of Vallejo and the Bay from 1968-19? (He was never caught.) Edward James Olmos (Det. Dave Toschi) and George Dzundza (Zodiac - at the time when Arthur Leigh Allen was believed to have been cleared by DNA and fingerprints) are playing another crime with cats and Mice scenes together, each trying to trigger the other in an emotional revelation. Olmos, who died of some kind of incurable disease and knew that Dzundza did, still completely obsessed with losing his family and becoming a full-fledged alcoholic on the way. Zzzza completely ignorant and selfish (like all serial killers) on that Slaughter he leaves. The only disappointment was the "over-the-top" end, which was otherwise pretty accurate, listen.
