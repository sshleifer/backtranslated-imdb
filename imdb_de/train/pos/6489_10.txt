I saw this series when it first appeared in the 1970s. I was 14 years old and saw her at my best friends' house when my dad did not want to see her. It became a weekly ritual every Sunday, and as everyone wants to, I tell you, two fourteen-year-olds have to watch a documentary in almost reverent silence. This means that this was something special. <br /> <br /> The vastness of World War II events makes document.so a difficult subject The makers divided it into what they considered the most important key event, each dedicating one episode. Some episodes included long periods such as Wolf Pack, which covered almost every six years of the Battle of the Atlantic from Stalingrad had an episode in its own right. <br /> <br /> This documentary could not be made very easy today because most respondents are dead. The list of important actors that appear gives an amazing insight into the thinking of that time. Anthony Eden, the Foreign Minister, Carl Donnitz, h Before the submarines, Albert spear, trusted animal architect and later Minister of Defense for Hitler. In one of the later episodes we see Traudl young, Hitler's secretary, who was in the bunker with him and dictated the last will and testament - she left the bunker after Hitler's suicide and fled through the Russian lines. These and many others play a major role in the realism of the events depicted. <br /> <br /> If I'm critical of this series is that the code breakers of Bletchly Park are not included, but the revelations of their role in the war have only emerged after the series was created, so I recommend the programmer can not blame. <br /> <br /> The opening credits and the music are great, and the narrative by Lawrence Olivier gives the script a natural gravity. <br /> <br /> the best documentary series ever made? without doubt. inadmissible
