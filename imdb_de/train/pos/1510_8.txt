Yes, this is a horror anthology movie and it was a lot of fun! Because although the movie was clearly horror, some stories had a light mind - and occasionally even some laughs were laughed at. That's not so bad, because horror movies are sometimes stuffy and too serious. Because of that, and because all four stories were pretty good, it's one of the better movies of this style I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The connecting theme that connects every story is the house itself. Four different stories are people who either rent the house or investigate what happened to the tenants. <br /> <br /> In the first section, Denholm Elliott was seen as a writer-writer horror writer. For a change of scenery they rent this house. Almost immediately Elliotts block disappears and he is constantly working on a story about a serial killer. Amazingly, shortly after the disappearance of his block, he actually begins to see his fictional character! Again and again, the psychotic killer appears and then disappears - it seems as if he loses his mind. This could only be the best of the stories, because the beautiful end of the story brings the story to life. <br /> <br /> The second, if not bad, is probably the weakest. Peter Cushing plays a bachelor who longs for a friend who died some time ago (although the picture of her seemed amazingly contemporary). When he enters a waxworks of the city, he sees a wax figure that reminds him of his lost wife, and he is fascinated and scared. Later, a friend (Joss Ackland) visits the character and is also thrilled. All this leads to an end which, frankly, was a bit disappointing. Christopher Lee then plays an incredibly tough and strict dad for a pathetic little girl. For most of this segment, Lee looked like an idiot, but in the end, you can understand his behavior. Although slow, this one ended very well. <br /> <br /> The fourth segment was the dumbest and should parody the genre. Jon Pertwee (the third "Doctor" in the DR. WHO TV series) is a very spirited actor known for his portrayals of Dracula. In his opinion, however, nothing about the film, and in a touch of pomp he stands out from the set to find better props for this vampire movie. It's actually quite interesting that he played this role as it seemed to be a matter of course for Christopher Lee, who played Dracula or other vampires (one or more times). I enjoyed the line from Pertwee when he basically said that Lee's and other recent incarnations of Dracula were all crap compared to Bela Lugosi! Maybe that's why Lee did not take over this part! Despite some very stupid moments, it was very entertaining and fun - possibly as good or better than the first segment. <br /> <br /> Considering that the film started and ended so well, that he had a great acting and writing skills, it was hard not to like this movie.
