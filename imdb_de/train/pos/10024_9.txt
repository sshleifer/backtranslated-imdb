There are so many things to fall for in Aro Tolbukhin. En la mente del asesino (In the murderer's head) that it is very difficult to talk about it without giving any warning. Let's just say that this movie is like an exercise in the cinema, but really very well done. It consists of Super 8 shots in black and white, 35 millimeters, color, interviews and flashbacks. Aro Tolbukhin, it's like a movie that made a documentary or a reversal, and the strangest aspect is the doubt that lets you ask if it really existed? The film depicts the later life of a Hungarian sailor who arrived in Guatemala, worked on a religious mission and then killed some people. An act for which he was caught and sentenced to death. The film begins because some French documentalists are interested in this character, so they interview him before his death. Today, more people are involved to explore the character more deeply. We are witness to the film. <br /> <br /> For the main part of the story, we are led by a semi-slow phase to look into Aros' thoughts, mainly to decipher why he did what he did. Most important, though, is that the filmmakers never give us a one-sided view. They have left the judgments to all of us, and even if we understand his actions, we obviously never justify them. So the first half is based on collecting information. Later, things turn into Aro's childhood, giving the film such incredible new power (even hard times never became weak or boring). I do not mean - and I do not want to spoil - anything; The only thing we have to say is this: if you happen to have this movie by chance in your area, believe me, seeing the journey is more than worthy.
