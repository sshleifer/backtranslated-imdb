Cat soup seems at first glance to be a very random animated film. The best way I could explain it is that it's pretty pissed off. Although it is not completely coincidental. The story is about Nyatta, a young cat boy, and his sister Nyaako. Nyaako is very ill and dies, but Nyatta sees that her soul is being taken away from death and he can bring back half of it. The story is about her quest to bring Nyaako back to life. <br /> <br /> Although many of the content in this movie seems completely random, this is not the case. Most of it is a symbol of life, death and rebirth. You can also see references from other stories, such as Hansel and Gretal. This oddly cute short film has an interesting story with a deeper meaning than on the surface of the canvas.
