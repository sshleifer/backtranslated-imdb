What a perfect example of "less is more ..." Kurt Russell (Sgt. Todd) has only 72 lines and about 104 words. What a challenge! Like a black-and-white photograph, when the mind's eye has to fill in the gaps, the facial expressions, the physical drama, and the emotional gesture work together to create a stronger impact. This is one of the top 5 movies I can not live without, with classics like Road Warrior. If you like it, check out "Mad Max 2, The Road Warrior" and "Braveheart" with Mel Gibson. Also "Gladiator" with Russell Crowe and Connie Nielsen, who was also in Soldier. The "thirteenth warrior" with Antonio Banderas and "Blade Runner" with Harrison Ford.
