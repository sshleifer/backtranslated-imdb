Renny Harlin's first American film was one of the best horror movies in prison in the late '80s (like "Death House" or "The Chair"). Twenty years ago, Overseer Lane Smith falsely executed a convict. Now he is the overseer of the newly opened prison, and the man's mind is back to seek bloody revenge. This atmospheric and very moody movie offers much cruelty and violence for entertaining slaughter.
