It's funny how your life can change in a second ... Attending "The Waterdance" for the first time was an unforgettable experience. The way you have to get used to a new lifestyle can be scary to notice that there are other people in a similar situation, it can help you to keep going. <br /> <br /> Eric Stoltz's performances and especially of Helen Hunt (oh man, Helen is the purest and most graceful woman in the world ...) are wonderful. Wesley Snipes also surprises in one of your last serious roles. A film, simple and deep at the same time, which does not leave us indifferent to the message that is transmitted: Enjoy every moment of your life ... <br /> <br /> Really not going to a movie as of any hour! !! (Sorry, it's a Brazilian expression ...).
