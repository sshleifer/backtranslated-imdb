Stargate is the best show ever. All actors are absolutely perfect for their roles. I love the connection between the characters. If you have not seen this show, I highly recommend it. Although this program is often compared to Star Trek, it can not be, because it is completely different. I'm a Star Trek fan, but I'd definitely rate the show well beyond the Star Treks. Unfortunately, I live in New Zealand and we do not get Stargate on our TV. So if I want to see it, I have to buy the DVDs and the 10th season is not out yet, so I can not see it for long (which is depressing). However, this program is very good and a must, but be warned, it is addictive. So in summer I Love Stargate (and Amanda Tapping).
