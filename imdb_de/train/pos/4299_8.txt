In your video library you will find this gem. <br /> <br /> The human condition in the modern day of LA. No exaggerated drama, just a breakdown of events that could happen over time to a group of individuals are cutting-edge. Cinematography and music very closely follow the mood and situation. And the CAST !!! <br /> <br /> Excellent casting and excellent acting. Nobody is out of place or out of character. <br /> <br /> And it's NOT really a downer, as you would expect. I gave it 7 out of 10. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen it yet, do it!
