It's a great Swedish movie. It was the first Swedish movie I saw. It's easy and deep. What a great combination! <br /> <br /> Michael Nyqvist did a great job as a celebrity conductor looking for peace in his hometown. <br /> <br /> Frida Hallgren was great as an inspirational friend to help him never give up. <br /> <br /> The struggle between the conductor and the hypocritical preacher who loses his fight with Michael when his wife confronts him and defends Michael's noble reason to help his locals find their own peace in the music. <br /> <br /> The only thing I did not like was the end .. it was not that good, but it has a deep meaning.
