This is a sublime piece of filmmaking. It flows everywhere at the right pace. The accompanying music fits perfectly and is very pleasant to the ear. The humorous parts are hilarious and even more influenced by the largely depressing tragic nature of the film. <br /> <br /> Despite many comments on the plot's inherent tragedy, however, it was anything but depressing for me. I really enjoyed it in a way that I have not experienced in a long time. That is, it is great and yet without the usual features of modern films, such. Sex, violence and unnecessary special effects. <br /> <br /> 'Dan In Real Life' does not lack the normal vice. It has a fully mature plot that requires no further beautification and is indeed ruined. At the same time the topic is completely grown up. It is a work of art in itself that completely encloses you and you want nothing else than it already offers. <br /> <br /> There are some scenes that feel a bit like 'Waltons', but they really make sense In the long run, they contrast the dysfunctional moments. The Rosige makes room for the tragic, which then passes to the idyll, which turns darker, etc. This rippling landscape of emotional cinematography creates a perfect balance and keeps the viewer in a state of lithium-like stability. The peaks and valleys are gentle, but more than sufficient for the pleasure they generate. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie regardless of the genre you normally enjoy. Save all prejudices, because this is a must!
