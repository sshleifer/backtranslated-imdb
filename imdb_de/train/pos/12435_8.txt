I was glad to see that she had black hair! I've been a fan for about 30 years and am disgusted with the two previous attempts to film the stories. <br /> <br /> I was pleased that the scriptwriters revised the period with a computer. it spoils it at all. In fact, I've seen the movie twice in a day, a sure sign that it's standard. This is what I do with books that I like too. <br /> <br /> I thought all the characters were well represented and represented very well the early days of Modesty Blaise, which can be seen in both the book and the comic. I would also disagree with a comment from a previous reviewer that villains must be ugly. Did he actually read the books? <br /> <br /> I thought that was a very good movie and looking forward to the sequel with anticipation.
