but just as entertaining and random! Love it or hate it, but do not expect a clever plot or a nagging cliffhanger. Imagine this as Seinfeld, but without the persecuted and repeated performances of crazy characters (well ... until now, I feel like I'm going to develop favorites over the season). <br /> <br /> "Creature Comfort" is not for the faint of heart - it should be enjoyed with the least amount of brain effort. That's why this show embodies everything I need in a program when I get home from work in the evenings: superficial conversation in the background with just the right amount of "sweet" for the characters that I can enjoy when I finally get off the computer to see what I'm missing. <br /> <br /> More fun than most sitcoms today, quieter than an evening at NASCAR. Just the right mix of dead air and comebacks. I can not wait for the next one.
