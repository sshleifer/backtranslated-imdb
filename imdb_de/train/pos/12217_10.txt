I visited Ashura as Fantasia Festival Kickoff in 2005. Man, that was a cool kick. The director should be for the Canadian premiere in Montreal, but for health reasons he is still in Japan ... oh sir, I hope he gets better and makes many other films. <br /> <br /> The plot is pretty simple, but somewhat original ... the demons roam Edo in Japan and Swordsmans, called "demon guards", kill them and fear the rebirth of Ashura, the demon goddess, which is sleeping and supposedly very annoying /> <br /> It brings us to Izumo ... a sort of elite swordsman called "Demon Slayer" and his buddy Jaku, who is the typical violent jealous asshole ... <br /> <br /> Seems boring? Well, it is thickening ... Izumo retired when he killed demons because he had killed a young child with the impression that he was the demon, he did not know it, but he killed her. So Izumo continued his life and recycled in Kabuki Theater. On a boat trip on a beautiful night, Izumo discovers a girl hiding on a bridge and it changes his life and starts killing demons again ... for the good cause, the cause of love ... and damn .. The guy knows how to handle a sword and make an entertaining massacre. <br /> <br /> Izumo wears the movie as much as he plays ... it's the big package ... he knows how to fight (hell, yes, he knows), he's funny, he's smart and he has that sand. You never have to shout: "NO IZUMO, IT IS A TRAP" The guy already knows, he has this common sense. He is really the perfect hero. <br /> <br /> With regard to cinematography, the aesthetics are quite interesting. It's by far the movie that most resembles a manga. It's full of special effects and nothing. At any cost, this movie will look realistic ... it's pretty amazing. Many colors are an "unreal" photograph, unlike that ... it's pretty straightforward ... but as I said, the main character wears the movie A must see, a story that is led by masterful hands
