"The Woman in Black" is one of the scariest British ghost stories ever made. A young lawyer who has arrived in a small town to work on a dead client's estate is being followed by a mysterious black-clad woman. The film is charged with an extremely eerie atmosphere and the fear is calculated and gives the maximum effect. The action keeps the viewer deep and the finale is quite disturbing. The spectacle is excellent and the tension is sometimes almost unbearable. So if you want to see a really scary horror movie take a look. I dare to see "The Woman in Black" alone at night with the lights off. We recommend. 10 out of 10 points.
