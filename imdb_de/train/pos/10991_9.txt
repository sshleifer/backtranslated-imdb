Cypher is a movie worth watching because it's not the usual sci-fi movie. The artistic approach is painted with dark scenes and a kind of macro-view of the action. In the close-up of the camera, the plot is kept unclear by the director. The sci-fi aspect of the film is secondary to the plot of the film. The technology used in the film is not particularly impressive, but the director uses the props well. <br /> <br /> The character development is deliberately flat. The main character Jeremy Northam decides to immerse himself in the world of espionage. It's up to the audience to figure out its enigmatic character, and it's the mystery that keeps the audience interested until the end.
