Here is a popular Tom & Jerry cartoon, perfect for Halloween. I know it's not scary much, but it did the "trick" as in "Trick or Treat" as Jerry did with Tom with the blind and vacuum cleaner with a collar shirt to make it a ghost; but still like to put on my list of Halloween cartoons. In this short version, Tom heard the "Witching Hour," a ghost story broadcast on the radio, and was startled by the horror story that was told. Halfway through the story, the drama (hair on the head, heart jumps in the neck, icy chills on the back) with Tom. , , literally. And Jerry watched the whole thing and laughed to himself. He thought he was afraid of Tom, startling him. <br /> <br /> I love the end, it was a bit funny. And you know, this short is the first of four cartoons in which Tom Mammy attacks Two Shoes; the others are the lonely mouse, a mouse in the house and Nit-Witty Kitty. And also this short is the first of 25 cartoons in which Tom speaks. The others are The Lonely Mouse, The Zoot Cat, The Million Dollar Cat, The Bodyguard, Mouse Problems, The Mouse Comes For Dinner, Calm Please !, Trap !, Solid Serenade, Mouse Cleaning, Texas Tom, Mucho Mouse, and The Cat Above And The Mouse down, directed by Chuck Jones.
