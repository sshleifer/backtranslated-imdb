I had intended to commemorate the 10th anniversary of Marcello Mastroianni's death with numerous unseen films I own on VHS. However, in light of my carefree Christmas marathon, I had to settle for this. Coincidentally, there is one of his best achievements - and he was rightly nominated for an Oscar (the film itself is also honored). This was also one of 14 collaborations with Sophia Loren, the most famous and well-known star from Italy; By the way, both play against type - she is an unladylike housewife and he is homosexual! <br /> <br /> By the way, the movie title has a double meaning: the main characters are brought together on the historic day when Hitler came to Italy to meet Mussolini (the event itself is shown in long archive footage). But it particularly refers to the Stars' "brief encounter", in which they share moments of friendship, revelation and, in short, passion - though everyone knows that a return to their normal existence is inevitable, resulting in a sudden bittersweet ending to the film , This is virtually a two-hander (with all the other characters - except for the curious concierge of the block of flats in which the story plays in its entirety) - including Lorens rugged and eager patriotic husband, who is surprisingly played by John Vernon, only at the beginning and end sequences appear); However, the close frame does not scare off director Scola (for the record, this is the 7th movie I've watched and 3 more on VHS) and the cinematographer Pasqualino De Santis, so the result - though essentially low - is. key - is anything but stagy: The camera is allowed to roam through the various areas of the large building and watch the proceedings accurately or relentlessly, depending on the situation, but always sharp. The narrative, of course. depends entirely on the performances of the two stars to be convincing, and both deliver (their chemistry on the screen is quite unparalleled); However, it is interesting that while Loren has left the prizes behind in his own home, Mastroiannis is a moving, but unsentimental outsider (the film seems somewhat doubtful to equate his sexual aversion with anti-fascism!).
