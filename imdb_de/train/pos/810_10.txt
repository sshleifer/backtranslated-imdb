This is probably the best of all Star Wars movies. <br /> <br /> The film's starting point was almost like Episode IV - Spacey Cabaret Music and thoughts of a cabaret court, where the seriousness of gangster Jabba the Hutt became more and more serious. He ordered Luke to die in a basement pit on the bone-breaking teeth of Bantha, which looked almost like a cross between a bear and a shark. The Jedi forces of Luke finally finish the monster. Jabba, who had frozen to death at the end of Episode V, was very angry that Luke was sentenced to death in the Sarlacc Pit outside. <br /> <br /> But all Star Wars "good people," especially R2-D2, had other ideas ... and those other ideas prevented Luke's execution. In the end, most of Jabba's soldiers died, and Princess Leia could use the power to fatally kill Jabba. <br /> <br /> As in Episode IV, the Death Star appears in Episode VI. As I analyzed the rebel fleet attacking the Imperial fighters near the Death Star, Star Destroyer's personnel sped up the main-laser armament and used the Imperial fighters as a distraction. The 20-25 Star Destroyers lined up in a row were ready to attack, but were stopped and instead the Death Star's laser weapon was fired surprisingly. After firing, the Rebel Fleet's only hope was for the Death Star's deflector to be launched. This had affected Lando so much that he wanted to destroy the Death Star. However, he did not succeed until the shield was removed. And it was taken with Lando's growing impatience. <br /> <br /> As in Episode V, the Imperial Walkers make their threatening appearance with their twin cannons and kill at least one of the Ewoks ... but the Ewoks found an ancient, unusual way to deal with them. For example, Chewbacca, like another Ewok, was able to command one of the wanderers (and actually destroy the destroyer behind one of the wanderers), and the other Ewoks used logs to kill two other wanderers. <Br /> <br /> It's amazing what Luke could do with his Jedi powers on his Lightsaber, such as the scene on Endor, where Luke distracts the incoming laser shots from a Storm Trooper speeder and the Saber Shut down uses part of the bike. Or, in a climax, use the Saber to break off his own father's arm during the last Saber fight with Sith Vader. <br /> <br /> You probably know the Ewoks celebration after the Death Star was blown, displaying firecrackers, drumming on the spoils of victory (such as Storm Trooper masks), and Luke finally finds Leia after Lukes own enemy: Darth Vader, who is now dead, is burned at a stake. The festivities include Ewok's singing, but I believe that Lucas did not buy that - even with the great respect of film composer John Williams. <br /> <br /> In the home movie version, I wanted Lucas himself to want another end. In addition to the celebration on Endor, he wanted shots of festive scenes on the various surviving rebel planets, including a festive laser shot that destroyed the statue of the Sith. The Ewoks song has been replaced by an alternative instrumental piece. Probably he wanted to prove with the extra stuff that with the destruction of the Death Star, the balance of rebel galaxies was restored.
