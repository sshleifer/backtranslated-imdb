The only reason I give this movie an 8 out of 10 is that, in my opinion, few movies are perfect. This little B-picture is a tight story, well told. I have always been fascinated by Alexander Knox, but have seen only a few films. Here he plays Wilhelm Grimm, a sad little man who turns into a monster. He betrays everything and everyone without remorse. The performance is one of the most exciting performances I've ever seen. Since World War II, actors who played Nazis or other evil types in movies have occasionally been nominated for Oscars. I imagine that when the academy was made during the war, it had the feeling of honoring such achievement as if it had been honored by evil. But Knox introduces this kind of performance - a man so embittered and guilty that he does not think others are suffering. I still can not get over it. <br /> <br /> Marsha Hunt, who usually plays the leafhopper or butterfly butterfly, is cast in type in probably the best performance I've ever seen. Maybe not Oscar worthy, but the best of her career. Nothing against her; I enjoyed them in the "easy" roles she often played. But here she proves that she lives up to the task of a heavier drama. <br /> <br /> If you like human drama tales or stories about the fate of those who suffered under the hands of the Nazis, I recommend this fine little piece of film.
