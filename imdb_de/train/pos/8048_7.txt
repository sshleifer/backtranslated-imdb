COME ON!!! They did it on purpose !! Two of my current faves on TV (Meloni from "Oz" and "L and O-SVU" and Janel from "West Wing") are joining in for a nice little sleep / character study. Plot is nothing special, but the spectacle is just right. Tim Busfield appears for some nice little things. Worth a look.
