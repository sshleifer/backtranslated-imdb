Once there were different types of films. These different movies existed side by side, though everyone had something else to offer ... <br /> <br /> That's obvious at first, but I thought I would point this out in this review because it seems like a few people have forgotten to do this. This is just a funny movie for Pavarotti fans. That's all it is. There is no claim to anything else or something great. People who mock it as something that does not live up to a promise do not literally see the whole picture. Hollywood is always making films that are shameless vehicles to people (Bodyguard or The Preacher's Wife with Whitney Houston are two examples that come to mind.) First, I'd like to turn to the film as a vehicle for Pavarotti. There are worse things in this world - and worse movies. The singing is fabulous and the selection of arias is fun. The film begins with Schubert's Ave Maria and then Leoncavallo's Matinatta. Pav sings arias by La Gioconda, Manon Lescaut and Turandot, but also sings popular music like "I've left my heart in San Francisco" and the song that was nominated for an Oscar & Golden Globe, "When we were in love" with Music by John Williams & Text by Alan & Marilyn Bergman - all three previous Oscar winners. <br /> <br /> The story is not that bad. It was built for Pavarotti, so of course it's not profound or universal for the average movie viewer. It's the story of a famous opera singer who was traumatized years ago by a bad night in the opera. When he was asked to sing again in the same place, the "MET" in New York, he loses his voice in fear. Doctor Pamela (or Pah-MAY-lah in Italian :)), played by Kathryn Harrold, gives him a shot to heal his psychosomatic response. He offers her the chance to meet with him, and she reluctantly accepts. <br /> <br /> They are having an affair, they know that he is married and promises not to fall in love with him, and he believes that she will only do justice to another woman. Nevertheless, they fall in love (so the song "IF we were in love") and with their help, he overcomes his fear and goes back to the MET, where he triumphs. I will not say how it ends, but it's pretty predictable. Which is not always a bad thing. <br /> <br /> The services here are not that bad. Pavarotti (who plays Giorgio Fini) is not an actor. So if you're expecting an idea of ​​Spencer Tracy or Tom Hanks, you're seduced, not Pavarotti. He knows he is not a Thespian. What he is is sweet, charming and charismatic. He's having fun himself, and if you're just kidding, it's not so bad. A funny line is when he tells Pamela (Harrold) that she is a "thirsty plant, Fini can pour you!" and of course she says, "I do not want to be watered by Fini!" Kathryn Harrold is very nice and does a good job as a half-sincere woman who learns to live a little from this extravagant man. One of my favorite lines in the movie is, "Life never has to be life-size." And there's Eddie Albert doing his usual good job as manager of Fini. There are several "self-made" cameos of real conductors, singers, etc. filmed on-site at the Metropolitan Opera at the Lincoln Center. <br /> <br /> If you like opera, if you like Pavarotti, or if you just let yourself go and enjoy a "little swing" as suggested in the movie - then you can enjoy this movie. I know, I do EVERY time. :) <br /> <br />
