This is neither the weird Robin Williams nor the quirky / crazy Robin Williams of the last thriller. This is a mixture of the classic drama without over-dramatization mixed with Robin's new love for the thriller. But that's not a thriller in itself. This is more of a mystery / suspense vehicle through which Williams tries to find a sick boy and his keeper. <br /> <br /> This suspense drama, which also stars with Sandra Oh and Rory Culkin, resembles a message, except for William Character almost approaching his target. <br /> <br /> I have to say that I was very entertained, although this film does not teach, guide, inspect or amuse. It felt more like watching a guy (Williams) while actually doing the actions from a third person. In other words, it felt real and I could subscribe to the premise of the story. All in all, it is well worth the clock although it is definitely not a Friday / Saturday night fare. <BR /> <br /> It rates a 7.7 / 10 of ... <br /> <br /> the Fiend.
