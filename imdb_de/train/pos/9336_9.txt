German private television is poorly known for copying Dutch and ?? Naturally? US formats. Well, in the case of Edel & Starck, xeroxizing went only as far as the basics: screwball. You can not stand a screwball comedy? Do not look at Edel & Starck. Serious. If you expect another Lawyer drama thing that resembles Law & Order, go elsewhere. (Or look at Law & Order, as it's pretty brilliant at what it does, but I digress.) E & S is funny, often thought-provoking, funny, romantic, funny, funny and funny. <br /> <br /> Frankly, I'm pretty upset that the authors did not find any better deals after the series finale. And my cynical nature has to be reoriented in private German TV productions. German inhabitants will understand what I'm talking about. <br /> <br /> In short: look at it. I do not know what the English dubbing is supposed to look like but it's worth learning German just to see it in four seasons. Pseudo-happy ending included.
