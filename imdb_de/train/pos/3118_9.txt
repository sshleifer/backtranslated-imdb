I had not seen the two previous films in the Bourne Trilogy and did not want to see the Bourne Ultimatum. <br /> <br /> However, it was a very exciting experience, and I did not have the problem of not understanding what happened because the first two films were not seen. Every part of the story was easy to understand and I fell in love with The Bourne Ultimatum before it reached the interval! I do not think I've ever seen such an exquisite and gripping movie, especially an action movie. Since I usually hate action and thriller movies, that was such good news for me. Ultimatum is one of the most exciting movies and draws your attention from the first second to the last minute before the end credits. <br /> <br /> Matt Damon was just fantastic as Jason Bourne. I've heard a lot about his great performances in the Bourne 1 + 2, and now this fabulous actor has another entry on his list. I look forward to seeing more of his films in the future. <br /> <br /> The stunts were handled in style - each of them was brilliant and I was just shocked by the impressive effect of this movie. Well done.
