After seeing many Greek films, I am very suspicious of most people. But after seeing that, I was astonished. The movies are great without a big try. You can not say that the script is so great or the photography is perfect or technical. It's a real story happening in Greek rural areas in places forgotten by God. The movie is like a punch in the stomach and I would really wish that things are not like that. It obviously speaks of the xenophobia of the Greek people (ignorance) to something else. The problem of this man is not that he is an ex-convict. The problem is that he is not one of those people. He is different and they do not want her (so all the good things he does do boomerang). And also speaks about the apathy of the people, because there are people who are against the king's hunting, but they do not dare to express their opinions. In the end, one sees clearly the hypocrisy of the society, which is religious and tries to act as God says, but at the same time acting so unfairly to the king. This shows how easily people can rationalize their feelings or beliefs according to the established system. In the end, you can learn a positive lesson from this very bad story, which means that you can only understand and be part of that society if you want to be one of them. If you want to be different and also alone, you are lost (and it is not far from reality). I find it tragic that the story is real and this should be a bell for all. No comment for the lead actor, since he has already been honored and I think his game was great. Little commentary for Hatzisavvas (playing the cop), he's like a dinosaur, he played a lot of roles and I'm sure that role was very easy for him, but he plays it so great that you can not deny him a big bravo , I definitely recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see a good Greek movie.
