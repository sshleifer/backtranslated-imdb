My rating of 10/10 is just for the fun factor and assumes that you already rated "Slaughter High" as "Like" before watching it. Yes, it's the typical revenge-several-years-after-a-dirty joke story, but how can you dislike some of the stuff they're pulling here ?! I could not have predicted this bathing scene in a million years. <br /> <br /> OK, maybe we could be cynical and say that this movie is nothing new. Well, it does not work that way. It's a kind of movie the characters in "Scream" probably saw, and it contributed to their rules on how to survive a horror movie. Who does not want people to suffer when they do these things? Obviously, it has a reactionary undertone because people are punished for what they did in the 60s. But you have to love this stuff! With apologies to Don McLean, this joker did not sing for the king and queen!
