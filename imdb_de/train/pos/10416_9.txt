Like the Arabian Nights, this film plays with narrative conventions to give the feeling that there is action, action and even more action: it opens with the seemingly framework of a blind man telling his life story, and then plunges into a flashback leads us to the presence of the blind, where we discover that about half of the story is yet to come. (One has to admit that the second half does not quite live up to the first one's promise.) Like the Arabian Nights, it tries to stuff as many folk motifs from the Middle East as possible into one work. A liberated spirit, a beautiful princess, a flying carpet, fantastic mechanical toys, sea voyages, a crowded marketplace, a wicked Vizier, jewels ... I do not know why everything works, but it works. Everything is so beautiful. The sets are beautiful. June Duprez is beautiful. Rozsa's score is especially nice. It sounds Hungarian as always; But somehow he manages to persuade us in a Persian way that he is Hungarian.
