I just watched this movie at TIFF (Toronto International Film Festival). Fans of Hal Hartley will not be disappointed !! And if you are unfamiliar with the oeuvre of this director ... it does not matter. This movie can definitely stand alone. I have to do the second screening ... it was unbelievable that I have to see it again - and fast !! <br /> <br /> This movie is very funny. The dialogue is very clever and Parker Posey's performance is outstanding as she plays in the title role of Fay Grim. Fay Grim is the latest feature that revisits the world and the characters of the film Henry Fool (2000). Visually, the most striking styling feature uses the familiar use of the tilted (or Dutch) angle that is often seen in earlier Hartley works that appear in various short films. and in The Girl from Monday (2005). <br /> <br /> I saw this movie the best on September 11th. The adventure of Fay Grim in this story will be pushed back after September 11, 2001 textually against the changed world. if anything, it was placed in the mainstream fiction cinema after the year 911 (see Syrianna: by the way - Mark Cuban Exec. Prod in both films ... most interesting, to say the least). <br /> <br /> For those who are closely associated with the characters of Henry Fool, Simone, Fay and Henry, this movie is incredibly confident and self-centered. The character of Fay Grimm begins in the film, exactly where it was when Henry Fool ended, but at the end of the film ... Fay's knowledge and experience have changed and expanded throughout the story. What can the future of Fay and the Fool family expect ... ?? I can not wait for the third part of this story!
