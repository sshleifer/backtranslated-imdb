After reading just two of the comments, as a lifelong Bronte fan, starting with Olivier's Heathcliff and ending with the many versions of Charlotte's "Rochester", it's more than just a feast to see it was the UNsung Bronte sister that gave the lie to male-chauvinist time the trio. Of course, the "miracle" in all three versions of nineteenth-century British domesticity is that the "girls" were all "philistines" and their only realistic brushes with "men" were their vicar father and their wastes? Brothers. Ultimately, it is ANNE Bronte who, in her only assay, has proven the "feminist" point that is far ahead of contemporary types, including the "voting franchise" ranks. However, there are more than a few who were before him, including the Greek Heterai and Sappho and the likes of an ancient Emperor Yang Kuei-fei. And how about "Eve" and her apple?
