Angels With Dirty Faces is just a continuation of the name. The angels washing their faces suffer something from the usual phenomena of the Dead End Kids. In fact, with the presence of Dead End Kids and Ann Sheridan, this should have been a real sequel to Angels With Dirty Faces, at least for the sake of continuity. <br /> <br /> Speaking of Ann Sheridan, she is the only true light of this movie. To describe a clich√©, Ann Sheridan could read two hours from a phone book and I would buy the DVD! <br /> <br /> Another virtue of this film is the chemistry between Ann Sheridan and Ronald Reagan. Unfortunately, this aspect of the film is kept too far in the background. For a better example of the Sheridan Reagan duo, I would recommend Juke Girl or Kings Row.
