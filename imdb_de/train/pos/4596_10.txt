This is Jackie Chan's best movie and my personal favorite. After the US was disappointed by James Glickenhaus under the title The Protector, Jackie took over the concept and placed it in Hong Kong. This is probably the most violent film of Jackie's and the audience is writhing in front of the broken bones. <br /> <br /> The action is fast and furious, Jackie and his crew are really into the fight design. The bones were broken and blood was shed during the making of this film, as you will see in the credits. <br /> <br /> The script is a simple affair between cops and robbers, nothing special after everything was written around the movie action. I have to say that the English version was a bit dubious, but it should not scare you too much. <br /> <br /> So, make the boys, open the beers and enjoy it. Incidentally, the film was called "Glass Story" by the stunt crew. Why? I let you find out for yourself !!
