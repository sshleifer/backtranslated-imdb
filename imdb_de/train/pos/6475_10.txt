It's only 2 episodes in a 5-part drama, but I can say that this is one of the best things I've ever seen. It's on TV, on the screen or even in real life. <br /> <br /> As a writer, it's so good that it's almost demoralizing! As a spectator, it's so entertaining that I'm upset that the episodes are no longer from Monday to Friday over fourteen days. It is clear that all these negatives are actually positive. <br /> <br /> I'm a modern guy who came from TV dramas before. Compared to movies, TV dramas always seemed outdated, pretty tame and good, generally boring! "Five Days" has really brought TV drama into the 21st century, so that at least my consciousness is changing. Look at it.
