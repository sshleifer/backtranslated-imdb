How I got to it: When I started watching this series on the Cartoon Network, I have to say that I've never seen anything like that, and it was the best. But when I started collecting the series on VHS and years later on the DVD from Bandai's Anime Legends collections. It was amazing and really worth seeing. There was a lot of exploding action that will blow you out of your seat. And of course the title songs "Just Communication" and Rhythm Emotions were the best. <br /> <br /> Characters and Gundams: My favorite characters on the show were: Heero, Duo, Relena, Treize, Lady And, Noin and Zechs. My favorite Gundams in the series I liked the most are Wing Zero and Epyon and of course the Altron and Deathscythe I and II. Importance of the show: What this series also shows is that real life wars are very tough and We can sometimes win or lose, but peace can be difficult to achieve, and I believe the Gundam pilots are doing the right thing and trying to achieve world peace. <br /> <br /> But this show is really the best of the best. When you complete this show, watch the movie Endless Waltz.
