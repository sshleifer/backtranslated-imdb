Hooray! A space movie that does not take you too seriously and anyone can join in for the thrilling ride in the space camp. The movie begins slowly, the usual mix of idiots and high flyers is mixed into a dodgy soup. But when the going gets tough, it's difficult to get rid of the characters, and it's not an incredible change in the characters. One can assume that there is some responsibility in their young minds. <br /> <br /> The film says that Kate Capshaw is extremely annoying because the instructor says, "I'm right and you're wrong." I would recommend this as a nice night in the movie and as a 7 vote.
