This movie offers great acting, great photography and a very powerful storyline that really makes you think about who you are, how you define yourself, how you adapt, whether you play a role or free yourself from life. There are already excellent comments on these aspects. I would like to comment on the formal setting of the film. Basically, there are two people on a roof. There is a unity of place and time, with two protagonists and the radio as choir. Many directors have turned Greek tragedies into films, many directors have filmed contemporary stories such as a Greek tragedy, but none of my directors have succeeded, as well as Ettore Scola, to approaching the purity and power of the great Greek tragedies in history and formal setting , A masterpiece.
