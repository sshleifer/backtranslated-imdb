This movie has been on my wish list for ten years and I recently found it on DVD when my partner's grandson received it. He looked at it and was thrilled to hear that it was my generation - born in 1930, evacuated in 1939 and he wanted to know more about it - and me. Luckily, I borrowed it from him and looked at it myself and I cried. It not only captured the emotions, the class difference, the hardships and the warmth of the interpersonal relationships of those years (as well as the cruelties (spoken and unspoken)), but it was also true! I come to ARP uniforms, ambulances (LCC) in the correct color (white) and all the obstacles in managing bomb sites and the work of the heavy rescue brigades Anderson Shelter and the WVS canteens brought back everything: the difference between the relative untouched life in the village and war-torn London was also keenly presented to Gold's work of course, and one would expect him no more than this meticulous detail, but went far beyond the precise presentation of the facts and touched deep chords about human reactions and the He was one of the great highlights of John Thaw's acting career and of Gold's direction and deserves more fame. It's a great movie, and I've already ordered a few copies to send to friends.
