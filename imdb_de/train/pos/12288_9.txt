The House of Ghosts is a gripping story about family intrigues, South American politics, and supernatural powers. Meryl Streep, Glenn Close and Jeremy Irons bring the novel by Isabel Allende to life with all their passion and excitement. This, in my opinion, is one of the best films of the nineties. Jeremy Irons as Esteban Trueba ages and murmurs very believably, while Meryl Streep in the role of Clara maintains her gentle, loving warmth during her relatively short life. Winona Ryder and Antonio Banderas form a pretty couple who fight for family acceptance in a racist culture. Glenn Close, sister of Esteban, shows a very moving performance. The landscape of Portugal is an appropriate substitute for a non-tropical country in Latin America. The settings of Clara's house and Esteban's Ranch are effective and the time when US cars complement the post-war atmosphere well.
