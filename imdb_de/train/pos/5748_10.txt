This film was excellent - the emotional power of Tom Hulce's and Ray Liotta's performances brought tears to my eyes and joy in my heart - this film shows us that there is still hope in the world. If this film had come out in late 1988, Hulce would have been nominated for at least the Oscar for Best Actor instead of Rain Man. Definitely a must!
