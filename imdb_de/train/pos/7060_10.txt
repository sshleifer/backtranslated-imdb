Many people have commented that this movie was not nearly as good as the first one. Well, maybe it's not for you. How does your child react? Well, my loved it more than the first ones. <br /> <br /> Disney movies of the past can sometimes be a bit hard for little children. (For example - Bambi's mother is shot.) This movie was really great for my sensitive little girl who likes humor and happy endings. <br /> <br /> If you want to make Snobby what Disney's standards should be based on past - skip this movie. <br /> <br /> If you have a sweet little girl or a soft-hearted little boy that you really want to like, buy this movie and treat your little kids. This movie is great as a bedtime for happy dreams instead of nightmares. I am happy with a movie that pleases my child and does not have to impress the parents all the time.
