I can truly say that I felt the film in its true essence, where the mind games from dreamy reality enter into the surreal aspect of the future facing Tom Cruise. Tom Cruise's acting knowledge did not interest me much, but I have to say that he seems to impress at every point of the movie ... not just because of a captivating plot, but also because he himself is taught the main character. ..you merge and then talk and it is beautiful. However, I have to say that this movie does not fall under the "average of the weekend", which you choose randomly and look on happily; It has strong emotions and characters, so do not rinse it with beer and popcorns. It certainly needs more than that.
