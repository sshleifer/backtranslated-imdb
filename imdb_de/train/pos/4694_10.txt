If you're a fan of airplane-type movies, this is a must! Johnny Dangerously plays not only great actors in the 1920s and 30s, but also great lines. "tear down dat wall, tear down dat wall and tear down dat # @ $% # @ $ wall." "You should not hang me on a hook Johnny" or "Sounds like Johnny's being laid". It's definitely a parody of the old James Cagney movies and references them a lot. There is a great scene when Jhonnys goes to death row and a priest is set up for his escape. Listen carefully to the wrong priest readings, it's pretty funny. Another great scene is when Dom Delauise plays the Pope. Look at his reaction to Johnny after tipping the Pope, a lot without sound.
