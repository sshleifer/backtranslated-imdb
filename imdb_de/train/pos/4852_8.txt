Well, this is one of Big's Best, Jack Hulbert's only role, which was split in 1931 in two roles for the band wagon radio team Askey & Murdoch. It has a great, sturdy cast that restricts the game to anything they're worth, especially for Askey. Histrionics were provided by Linden Travers, Melodramatics by Herbert Lomas and Pragmatics by Richard Murdoch. The group of railroad travelers stranded in the lonely land station at night found more than they expected spectral carriers, hairy sausage rolls, and Arthur trying to entertain them all. His retaliation with everyone falls between side shivers and terribly boring. If the formula works, it's very good, but sometimes it's very thoughtful and forced, so the movie looks older than it is. But those damned treacherous fifth columnists - thank God, God does not have one today! <br /> <br /> Finally, a beautiful harmless movie that you, as an old friend, can receive again on the TV screen, but if you expect that. Tremble from your woods, you will probably be very disappointed!
