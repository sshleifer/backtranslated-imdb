Jess is 18, very smart and wants to play nothing but football. If she joins a local team, she has to lie to her parents over and over again, as she would never agree that she is chasing her dream of a nice Indian boy and is learning to cook. <br /> <br /> Bend it Like Beckham is a fun-filled movie that does not have to be deep and complex. The cast is very good and they play their roles very well, the story is simple and predictable, but it works perfectly and the script is very realistic and very funny. <br /> <br /> A great family movie 8/10
