"Opening Night", published in 1977, tries to be an ambitious production. It only succeeds in the really impressive performance of Gena Rowlands. Her character, Myrtle, is not necessarily someone we would love in real life. She is absorbed in herself, often obnoxious, and makes life unhappy for the people around her - in other words, not unlike some actresses! Myrtle is also a woman on the brink of collapse - we're not quite sure the demons she's fighting against are real or conceited, even though we're being briefed early on. Rowlands is obviously well loved by her talented husband, actor / director John Cassavettes, who also plays a role in the film. This film is not without flaws - it is too long and the last part of the film, in which Myrtle goes on stage while he is very drunk, looks almost cruel. The "improvisation" in some dialogues - at least on stage - takes much too long. Some of the minor characters perform well, especially by Ben Gazarra, the Myrtle producer. Joan Blondell's character is never fully developed and I could never figure out why she was in the movie except to appease Myrtle. Just look at this movie for Rowlands - it's always fascinating - and it's hard to take your eyes off it, even if you sometimes want it.
