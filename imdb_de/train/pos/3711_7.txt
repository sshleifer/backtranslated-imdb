"The Gingerbread Man is the first thriller I ever did!" ?? Robert Altman <br /> <br /> Charles Laughton staged "The Night of the Hunter" in 1955, a creepy piece of southern Gothic in which Robert Mitchum plays a sinister serial killer. One of the film's most famous sequences consists of two children escaping from Mitchum on a rowboat. The kids paddle desperately while Mitchum wades them like a monster. <br /> <br /> Seven years later, Mitchum played a scary killer in "Cape Fear," another movie set in the American South. This film showed a lawyer trying to protect his family on the ground and ended up with Mitchum terrorizing people on a boat. In 1991, Martin Scorsese tries desperately to look for something mainstream, "Cape Fear," the boat scene, and everything new. <br /> <br /> Now we have Robert Altman's "The Gingerbread Man", another piece of Southern Gothic Town. Altman says he consulted "The Night of the Hunter" for inspiration and dealt with such a mainstream movie just because he wanted to "spread his wings and try a popcorn image," but secretly he's trying to do the canonical films here the Southern Gothic genre. <br /> <br /> Instead of a showdown on a small boat we get a showdown on a huge ship. Instead of kidnapping two children, two children are safely taken to the police. Instead of hiding money, we can provide money through a last will and will. Instead of the righteous lawyer of the 1961 film and the lamentable lawyer of the 1991 remake, Kenneth Branagh gives us a more three-dimensional lawyer. Instead of the monster chasing the family, we get the hero who chases the bad guys. Instead of breaking the monster into the family houseboat, we're chasing the hero who hunts the monster aboard the monster's "ship of the house". Similarly, instead of a murderous serial killer, we get an innocent ridicule played by Robert Duvall. , etc etc. <br /> <br /> Altman goes on and on, turns everything around a bit, pulls on the edges and does his own thing. His touch is most evident during the first half hour of the movie. The film is set in a troubled room between conventional plot-driven filming and Altman's penchant for overlapping dialogue, casual narration, moving camera movements, and the fact that characters are not that much introduced, as they are simply part of the action. <br /> <br /> Despite Altman's best intentions, the film never rises above mediocrity. Altman is too closely tied to the thriller-format conventions to do much damage, his style is too lethargic to excite, and the film is simply not radical enough to contradict other canonical films of the genre. "Gingerbread Man" is therefore too mainstream to work as a pure Altman movie, and to Altman to work as a mainstream thriller. <br /> <br /> The movie is not a complete waste though. Robert Downey Junior, Kenneth Branagh and the usually unbearable Daryl Hannah bring juicy performances. The film also has a nice atmosphere against an approaching hurricane, and the last act contains some interesting twists. Although Scorsese's "Cape Fear" was not the only disaster, the movie is still nothing special. <br /> <br /> 7/10 ?? In the late '90s, Altman shot three consecutive films in the American South: "Kansas City," "Gingerbread Man," and "Cookie's Fortune." Unlike "Gingerbread Man," "Kansas City" and "Cookie's Fortune" deal with the broader, looser screens that Altman felt most comfortable with. <br /> <br /> "Kansas City" is the more important of these two films. His hierarchy of class, politics, and crime, as well as his desire to radically break away from the typical gangster-genre framework, would prove influential to all serious 21st century film crime writers (see, for example, "The Wire"). "Cookie's Fortune" is a much slower story, but maybe the better picture. <br /> <br /> Note: Altman claims that this is his first thriller, but he directed "Images," an art house thriller, in 1972. <br /> <br /> Worth a visit.
