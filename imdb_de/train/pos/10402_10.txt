I first saw Thief as a kid, which makes me almost as old as the jinn, I think. Like every child, I was thrilled with the imagination, the ingenuity and the energy of the film. A few years later, I realized how much of the satire and wit of the script had been missed at that first look. I have never missed the opportunity to see it in the following years. In addition to the script, the production exceeds the fantasy genre. This is Korda, the storyteller at its best. If you see Thief as a kid, you know you had a great time. If you see Thief as an adult, you know you've seen a masterpiece. It is as timeless as the story that treats it. An amazing job. <br /> <br /> Thomas McCarthy
