House of Games has a strong history in which obsession and illusion play a big role. A psychologist offers a patient with his gambling debts and gets caught by the game. <br /> <br /> Have you ever felt for something that was both dangerous and wrong? Watch what happens when you pursue this urge and go all the way. Sit on the edge of the chair while tricksters are tricked into making victims perpetrators. You're never sure who in this movie is exactly who. <br /> <br /> This is both a quality and a disadvantage of the script. When the movie comes to an end, you feel that the story lacks consistency. All this, however, is largely compensated by the excellent psychological development. <br /> <br /> This is definitely one of the best feature films.
