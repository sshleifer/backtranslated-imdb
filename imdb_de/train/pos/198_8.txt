Oh, it's so cool to see a Silent Classic from time to time! Director Vidor is simply adorable and even makes (at least for 1928) a long cameo like himself. The story is about success in life and the way it changes you. Marion Davies plays a girl who leaves his friends in a small comedy studio to become part of a larger "drama" studio. She becomes a big star and the consequences are that she is really alienating from the real world. For a moment she even denies her (poor) past! The cameos are just funny, surely the scene in which the main character (Marion Davies) can be seen ... Marion Davies in the studios and concludes that she is not special ... The movies here and for real freaks it's great to see the cameras and the material of yesteryear A must if you ask me !!
