I have seen the first 17 episodes and this series is just amazing! I have not been interested in an anime series since Neon Genesis Evangelion. This series is actually based on a h game. I'm not sure if it was done earlier or not. I did not play the game, but from what I've heard, it follows very well. <br /> <br /> I'm giving this series a 10/10. It has a great story, interesting characters and some of the best animations I've ever seen. It also has some great Japanese music in it! <br /> <br /> If you have not seen this series yet, have a look. On some anime websites, there are submerged episodes that come directly from Japan.
