A wonderfully bizarre film with enough twists for a sack of pretzels. Parker Posey plays Fay Grim as a sexy, vulnerable, loving mother who may be what she seems. The story is very tongue in cheek and the dialogue skilfully skillful. A touch of humor and intrigue, both of which do not overwhelm the traits that make Posey so good. The side occupation is outstanding. The disadvantage? This movie needs your full attention, almost to stopping the movie and recording notes. Posey has more sex appeal when raising an eyebrow than most actresses in the whole body. It's worth your time, even if you do not understand the resolution.
