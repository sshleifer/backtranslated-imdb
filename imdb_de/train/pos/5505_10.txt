This is something new. <br /> <br /> There is a coup and some Irish documentary filmmakers are in it right now. <br /> <br /> A democratically elected president who uses his power The literacy of his people, and encourages them to read the constitution, is slandered openly by the private media as a dictator, as mentally unstable, new Hitler, etc., without that this is influenced by the government (such as silencing bullets and other traditional dictatorial methods)). Oh, and they still say they are being suppressed. <br /> <br /> See how the media make fun of their own role in the coup d'etat on TV after they overthrew the government with the help of Rouge Generals (how much stupider can you be?). <br /> <br /> And see how the Venezuelans march to the palace, hold the Constitution in their hands, and reinstall their elected government. <br /> <br /> This sounds like a Hollywood fairy tale, but it was against the explicit wishes of the USA. The documentary is a historical masterpiece, filmed from the very heart of the action, acute and absolutely embarrassing to the main proponents of the coup: the good, democratic, freedom-loving, benevolent US (who still draw large sums to Chavez's political opponents). > <br /> Also very entertaining and exciting, 10 points.
