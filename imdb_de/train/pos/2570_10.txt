Well, this is probably one of the best movies I've seen, and I love it so much that I put the bulk of the script (especially the scene in the storage unit where Jerry Lee breaks the wind) and even the script in mine I still like Jerry Lee to see that German Shepherd is hysterical and really put to the test to see who is smarter. The tag line also applies. Not to mention that the acting is great, although Christine Tucci sounds different in a whisper (see filmography under CSI, if you do not know what I mean). It's too bad that this movie contained only the only issue that Dooley and Jerry Lee had to work with. It would have been pretty cool to see the tricks that Zeus and Welles had up their sleeves.
