What an incredibly funny and original show. The cast, which begins with the hysterical Julie Brown (Got A Gun of Homecoming Queen), is just perfect. Add Amy Hill, who plays a lesbian who always quarrels with her partner and business partner (Asian Restaurant WOK-DON "T RUN") (including Newhart, one of my favorite shows of all time) If you like movies like Naked Gun and Airplane, you will love this series. One of the best moments of the show is Cindy Williams, who plays herself. Tammy in the dry Tammy finds a picture of Cindy Williams in her coat as a cleaner. The picture shows Cindy Williams doing an inhumane act with a bowling pin-up-down. I just hope that this will one day be released on DVD with special, many bonus special features. The funniest series I've ever seen !!!!
