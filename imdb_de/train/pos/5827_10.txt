This triangular film is the same as my other favorite movie "Disorder in the court". This is an outcry of laughter for every Three Stooges fanatic. <br /> <br /> The boys are janitors in a recording studio when they hear Christine McIntyre singing the wonderful version of "Voices of Spring". She is being offered a record deal, but she is worried that she will be honest with her father as far as her career choice is concerned and prove herself to be a real singer. When she and the others leave the studio, the henchmen decide to have some fun and play their record and put Curly on as Christine. The contract woman who can make Christine's career sees Curly and confuses him with Christine and invites Curly to sing for her party. Of course, there is a man they angered at the party, and they destroy his solo in front of the crowd, so he'll find a way to attack them again. <br /> <br /> What a great glove strip you should not miss! <br /> <br /> 10/10
