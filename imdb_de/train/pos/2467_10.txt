Why did not that take a bag full of Oscars? It's an amazing interpretation of a much filmed / played piece. The visuals are stunning (especially with widescreen screens ... the Pan & Scan effect really brings the wonderful cinematography and sets of this movie to a standstill). Each frame is a painting. Amazing. The piece is almost completely intact, and Branagh's passion for it is evident from the opening credits. No Zefferelli here, just great stories, as only the movie can do, which is rarely the case. Jacobi is particularly well suited as Hamlet's murderous uncle: he does not play him as a bad Villian with a mustache, but as a charming politician who shows us why only Hamlet suspects a bad game. Branagh also captures the subtle line between Hamlet's real insanity and the burning revenge in him. And the many cameos are well received, everyone from Billy Crystal and Robin Williams to Gerard Depardeu and Charlton Heston, inconspicuous if you get so involved in the vision of Branagh as I am. A fascinating piece.
