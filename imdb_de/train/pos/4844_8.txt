One of my favorite movies first saw him at the age of ten, which probably tells a lot about the nature of the humor. Although dated, the humor definitely has a charm. Expect the usual Askey & Murdoch banter to be so popular at the time, with many interesting, quirky co-characters. The lady with the parrot, the couple is supposed to marry and is in trouble with "her", and my favorite, the stationmaster, "Nobody knows where he's from ... nobody knows where he's going ..." was by Arnold Ridley written by Dad's Army Glory (Private Godfrey the Paramedic). After lunch, watch on a rainy Sunday afternoon and smile.
