When I went home after the movie, I hummed the familiar waltz music to which Natalia and Alexandre danced. I've heard that before - where? Ah, from Kubrick's "Eyes Wide Shut" (Track 2), I just got it when I arrived at the door. It is "Waltz No. 2 from Jazz Suite No. 2", composed by Dimitri Shostakovich, performed here by the Prague Philharmonic Orchestra. Yes, I took the soundtrack from Tower's with me. What a reward; what a pleasure! The soundtrack of Alexandre Desplat was fulfilling - besides two tracks of the delightful waltz there are fifteen tracks. It is not often given a soundtrack for a comprehensive score today. Reminds me of favorite notes by Maurice Jarre, Ennio Morricone (starting notes of track 6 have traces of "Nuovo cinema Paradiso"), Georges Delerue and John Barry. There are subtle nuances of trunks and notes of strings, celeste, piano and harp. <br /> <br /> Emily Watson and John Turturro delivered a credible consuming performance. The love story, her intimate connection, is very much between Alexandre and Natalia - his childlike but agonizing inner world and her generous and courageous understanding of him - a relationship with both of them. Director Marleen Gorris of "Antonia's Line" (1996 Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film of the Netherlands) has shown us a quietly sensitive film - not without disturbing human conflicts, intrigues, obsessions, family aspirations, love and respect. The front-end theme is the thinking game and the mathematical logic of chess. Among them may be a mild tear-hunter of a drama from the late 1920s. The cinematography captures the tranquil beauty of Lake Como in northern Italy near the Swiss border. <br /> <br /> I strongly recommend the soundtrack if you do not feel like going to the movies. Alexandre Desplats lyrical film music for "The Luzhin Defense" is complete.
