I know it's crude, and I know it's not a PC at all, but it's so funny. If you can put it in the right perspective, that it's from the early 80's and carries all the stereotypes of the time - and the movie is still making you laugh - then it's really a good comedy. The theme of this film is exaggerated in the tradition of comedies for thousands of years. If you can put off your political correctness for an hour and a half, just to laugh out loud, then please take this into account. <br /> <br /> P.S. Would someone please publish this on DVD, so it is hardly to find on VHS.
