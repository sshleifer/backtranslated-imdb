A number of contributors have mentioned the age difference between Stewart and Novak. She was 25 and he was 50 when this movie was released. I think the difference did not matter for an exciting drama like Vertigo, but for a romantic comedy. We can easily understand why his character is attracted to her character, but it is less clear why her character is attracted by his character. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, the film looks like a slight romantic fantasy. The scene in which she stares at him over the cat's head, with her dark, painted eyebrows and the sounds of her humming and the cat's purring, is true magic. So it's a bit shaky when the scene moves to the top of the Flatiron building and we see the age difference very much. As he hugs her, she reaches for her fingers through his hair, but stops that movement, brushing her fingertips lightly against his toupee.
