A stunning movie of high quality. <br /> <br /> Apparently based on true events that, as I said, contain the clear ring of truth, this movie is very emotional and deeply moving. <br /> <br /> An abused and neglected child often becomes obstinate in adulthood, as it is a failure of life, be it as a gangster, drug addict or as a burden on society. Antwone Fisher is troubled as a young adult in the Navy's case. He is about to be a loser. He is counseled in therapy by a psychiatrist, and it is this relationship that is central to the game. In flashbacks and therapy, the source and the remedies for Antwone's anxiety are revealed. Excellent results from the entire cast. The story is a family tragedy with emotional and physical torment. All actors perform with conviction and realism. <br /> <br /> One message from the film is how important it is to educate children properly. <br /> <br /> The real answer deserves success. Having a bad time as a child, but rising above it, shows a great character. <br /> <br /> And all those who have endured such torments but have survived and succeeded: they are all winners. 10 out of 10.
