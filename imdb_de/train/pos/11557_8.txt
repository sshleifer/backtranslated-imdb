Often laugh loud, sometimes sad stories of two working divorced men - Lemmon, a neurotic, clean "Hausmann" and Matthau, a sloppy sports journalist who decide to live together to cut costs. <br /> <br /> Nicely photographed and directed. The script is very spiky - that is, almost every line has more than one page. In a particularly funny scene, two British sisters (Evans and Shelley) are amused, who seem amused by everything anyone says, but when Lemmon throws out his photos of children and, yes, his future wife, he has the girls Matthau can come up with the promised drinks! <br /> <br /> Very entertaining.
