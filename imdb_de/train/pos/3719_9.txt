I just caught it at the Toronto International Film Festival. This is a good story told convincingly. The hand-held camera approach to action scenes added to the intensity of these scenes (in a documentary style, not the Blair Witch style). Joel Schumacher shows that he does not need a big budget to produce a gripping film. <br /> <br /> The actors were strong, especially the actor who played the focus of the events in the movie, Boz.
