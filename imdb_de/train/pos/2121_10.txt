This is a beautiful movie that is wonderfully played by all players. It will make you laugh and make you cry. The end of the movie always blows me up. If you want to see a great movie, this is the place to go. Jimmy Stewert delivers a wonderfully funny performance and Frank Morgan as Mr. Matuschek is fascinating. Morgan's diverse character traits are amazing. William Tracy as Pepi is a great comic relief and delivers some of the most important lines and performances. Felix Bressart does a fantastic job as Perovitch, a stumbling, lumbering shop worker. It's a simple story of how close colleagues can become and how two people who are very hostile fall in love with one another in unusual circumstances.
