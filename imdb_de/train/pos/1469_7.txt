I admit to creating big expectations before I watch, because some friends have it (and they are not perverted!) As a must have seen. And it is a must! Just do not expect anything outrageous. <br /> <br /> Freudian psychoanalysis is interesting in many parts of the movie, but there is just too much perversion and it does not end up. <br /> <br /> Some of the good things are the analysis of Kieslowski's Blue, most of David Lynch, some of Hitchcocks and maybe a few more that I've missed (I just remember ... Dogville), and I usually miss nothing unless they are too obvious or loose in the air. <br /> <br /> Apart from repeating itself, which is too long, the documentary is fun in the sense of observing some perversions that are fed by our unconscious Most thrillers studied and served as the basis for this theory. <br /> <br /> I have very much enjoyed the energetic tone of the narrative and Mr. Zizek's efforts to revive Freud's theory, North America. Once again, it's overkill and I do not think it's a waste of time, because I think most people have a dark appreciation for death and blood.
