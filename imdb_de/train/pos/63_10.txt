This movie is so misunderstood that it is not even funny. If you remember seeing this for the shootings, stay clear. This deals with the effects and traumas that the survivors suffer. Even the detectives are looking for the answer we all make ... WHY? Fantastic spectacle of the two leading ladies as we see how those we ignore are affected by the same things we are concerned with. Yes, the language is sometimes tough, but it goes well with the characters. There are some loose ends that still remain unanswered, but all the movies have these. The main topics are covered, and this film gives an important statement about how all adults feel after such incidents. Highly recommended for teens and adults.
