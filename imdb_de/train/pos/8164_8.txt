This movie was very enjoyable, but you will like it only if: - you do not hate going to the dentist but do not be afraid of a movie where one of them is occupied - you love horror movies <br /> < I particularly liked the fact that the rude actions of the main character were explained with some care. The fact that he is totally obsessed with cleanliness (especially in the mouth) and then gets his wives pampering the muddy pool man is a pretty credible reason to go overboard. <br /> <br />. I give an 8.
