Cinderella is a beautiful movie, of course, with beautiful songs. In fact, it is one of the best films of the fifties. <br /> <br /> I think all characters are presented amazingly. You can see the cruelty of Cinderella's step-sisters and their stepmother, the sweetness of Cinderella. The mice are also funny and cute. <br /> <br /> I think they've changed the story a bit, but I think it's best. It's such a beautiful movie, and I do not think anyone could resist in the deepest of minds. <br /> <br /> I give him an 8/10. I do not think it's the best Disney movie. But it is certainly a true classic.
