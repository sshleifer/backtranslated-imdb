I was glad to see Jim Carrey in a movie that was not meant to be over the top. His character is like us all. Want more - better things will happen to us and expect God to do something. <br /> <br /> Morgan Freeman made a great god. With a sense of humor and a sincere love for each one of us who is willing to spend a little vacation when the opportunity presents itself. <br /> <br /> I thought that Jennifer Aniston's character is a bit too vulnerable and understanding for Carry. Basically self-centered TV presenter Wanna-Be, but that's the way it was written. <br /> <br /> I think the thumbnails have ruined some potentially very funny scenes because everyone who saw them knew what was going on before the event. <br /> <br /> I read some of the reviews and it seems that some people are looking too deeply. This is a summer comedy and is not meant to solve the world's problems, though there are a few messages we could all take to heart. <br /> <br /> A funny movie.
