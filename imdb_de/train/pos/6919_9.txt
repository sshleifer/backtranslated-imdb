"Winchester '73" was the first in a series of westerns involving James Stewart and director Anthony Mann. As in most of them, the hero of Stewart has a violent edge that threatens to explode at any moment. The title refers to a "one-in-a-thousand" rifle that can compete in a gun-shooting Dodge City on July 4, 1876. Entering town are Lin McAdam (Stewart) and his buddy High Spade (Millard Mitchell), who are on the trail of the Dutch Henry Brown (Stephen McNally) because of a deceitful act. They arrive just in time to see Marshal Wyatt Earp (Will Geer), who runs the saloon girl Lola (Shelley Winters) outside the city. It turns out that Dutch Henry is also for the gunshot in the city. Lin and Dutch Henry try to win the coveted prize with Lin, but Dutch Henry robs Lin of the gun and flees. Lin and High Spade follow Dutch Henry across the country, where they meet Lola with her cowardly beau Steve Miller (Charles Drake) is in a camp of the US Cavalry and awaits the attack of the Indians, led by Young Bull (Rock Hudson ), who acquired the coveted rifle by murdering the cunning gunner John McIntyre. He had gotten the gun by cheating Dutch Henry on poker. Young Bull is killed during the attack, and the gun goes to Steve. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, Lola and Steve meet with the infamous shooter Waco Johnny Dean (Dan Duryea), who kills Steve and hits the gun, rifle and Lola for himself. When Dean meets with Dutch Henry, he allows him to "take back his gun" to assassinate him later. In the city of Tuscosa, Lin Dean kills badly while Dutch Henry's plans to hold the bank run bad, and he flies with Lin into the mountains. In one of the best final shootouts of all time, the two meet in the last showdown. <br /> <br /> I think this movie was the only one by Stewart / Mann shot in B & W. It is beautifully photographed, especially the scenes in the "wide expanses" and especially the final showdown. Stewart plays against the guy and plays the hero with a violent revenge campaign, an emotion he would take away in future movies with a man. <br /> <br /> As with most Westerns, there are a number of experienced veterans here as well as contract players of the day. JC Flippen acts as cavalry sergeant Steve Brodie, James Millican, John Doucette and Chuck Roberson as various retainers, Ray Teal as Sheriff, Duryea, Tony Curtis and James Best as rookie soldiers and Edmund Cobb. Chief Yowlachie and John War Eagle in various roles in the Dodge City sequence. <br /> <br /> A classic Western in the truest sense of the word. It was responsible for reshaping Stewart's career as an action star.
