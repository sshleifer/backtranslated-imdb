Not a serious movie, but still a great little movie. <br /> <br /> It's definitely NOT a RIVER. The acting, IMO, is excellent. <br /> <br /> One of those movies you would not afford to see, but it always makes you smile when it comes to cables. Like an old friend. <br /> <br /> Definitely worth seeing, if you have the chance. <br /> <br /> - - - - - - - - -
