The film and the efficient Confucian crime drama enjoyed the old order, which survives the threat of a young greedy young man who undoubtedly represents modern society. I found the final scene strange and could not understand if we believe that Big D is being punished because she is greedy or that it was a long part of the plan. I loved the scene, and in a Chinese movie, violence was not a choreographed martial arts festival. The thing that always amuses me about HK movies is that the British influence seems to be mainly to introduce "yes, sir" and "sorry" into the local language.
