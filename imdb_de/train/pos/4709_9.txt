Okay - I admit. This is the movie that made me love what Michael Keaton could do. He makes a beautiful parody of someone who makes a parody of James Cagney, with a lot of charm. <br /> <br /> The supporting performers are all solid workers and will work properly in this' 80s comedy. As a parody of the gangster films of the 30s-40s, she is constantly breaking new ground with remarkably original material. (Well - some of them have since been copied - but when this movie was made, it was original and many of them were not copied elsewhere.) Watch out, as Joe Piscopo warns people, to do nothing with one of the big taglines of parodies. See how Roman Moronie, with English obscenity, does things that would make your Spinster grammar teacher laugh. Watch amazing eye gags, z. For example, pet store owner Johnny Kelly uses his puppy's price tag weapon to dust his kittens. Watch the biggest "sex warning" movie ever made. Look at the most amazing falsifications of church Latin, while a guy who has never attended a class builds a Thompson machine gun out of pieces. Look at lines that you'll use in random conversations over the next decade. Watch as Maureen Stapleton encounters the perfect juxtaposition of the hardworking mother with surprising gags you'll never see. <br /> <br /> If you see a gag that does not hit your funny bone, be patient - another one will happen in 30 seconds or less, and chances are you need to take a break until You rolled several times on the floor. Duckies and bunnies? They also. Watch out for the subtle stuff - some of the sight gags can go unnoticed from the first observations. <br /> <br /> There are a few minor flaws - but it's probably the best of the parodies. Some come close, but none of them are so good.
