Tip number one - read the title as "the time of the crazy dog" or maybe as dogs. This is a pretty good ensemble piece (look at the actors and hire them - you know you're curious), and the first-time director Bishop gives them the chance to take their time, let the characters interact and chew the scenery Wait - not excited - for the return of the "Big Boss" and for revenge. <br /> <br /> For some of us, the highlight is seeing Christopher Jones film after his self-imposed exile; He remains an outstanding film presence. And yes, with Christopher Jones, Larry Bishop and Richard Pryor this is the reunion party "Wild in the Streets"!
