According to The Last of the Cowboy Heroes on Joel McCrea, Audie Murphy and Randolph Scott, the author says Albuquerque was the only film he personally did not review because he claimed he was lost. Have not seen for years. <br /> <br /> Good thing for western fans someone has been doing some spring cleaning at Paramount because a print has apparently been found and now it's out in the open market. Albuquerque is a pretty good western with Scott involved in a family quarrel with Uncle George Cleveland. George Cleveland has his nephew Randolph Scott intending to make him part of his New York-based freight forwarding company, a fast-growing Albuquerque settlement. Cleveland is more than just an entrepreneur, he's the city boss he leads from a wheelchair. He even has the sheriff in his pocket. <br /> <br /> Randolph Scott is not a cowboy hero for nothing. This also includes not supporting relatives if they are villains. He goes to work for a rival team led by siblings Russell Hayden and Catherine Craig. Cleveland is full of tricks and he even sends a Western Mata Hari in the person of Barbara Britton to wind himself in the confidence of his rivals. Barbara is a great character for the homely vixen who is developing her own agenda. <br /> <br /> Randolph Scott's original home studio was Paramount, with whom he had completed his first studio contract. Albuquerque marked the last movie he had ever made for Paramount, and they gave him a good one. <br /> <br /> Also note Lon Chaney Jr., the chief genius of George Cleveland, a rather vile bully of a man and Gabby Hayes who is just Gabby Hayes. Albuquerque must have been loved by Republicans across the nation in 1948, with his chief villain sitting in front of a wheelchair as city chief. A certain democrat from a wheelchair had made hashish for four presidential elections, and he was gone. They had high hopes of winning the White House again this year, but things went awry and they had to settle for a replacement boss who got his skills in Albuquerque. I'm not sure why Cleveland was in a wheelchair because nothing was really done on the property. My guess is that he was injured and played the role because he had to. Nevertheless, Albuquerque must have found favor with the GOP market.
