What happens if the average Joe finds out that he has supernatural powers? The premise may be familiar. The Guardians Unbreakable? However, the Russian sci-fi action film The Sword Bearer is far from standard. <br /> <br /> The story revolves around a man named Sasha, who as a boy was expelled from society, his colleagues and his family due to a supernatural power he possesses. If he wants or his anger permits, a sword sticks out of his arm and pierces his own skin. Very much eating? Maybe ... but that's not the interesting part of this movie. Shunned all his life and driven by anger (and a rage he has), our "hero" returns to his hometown to turn his life around or find a reason for it. The only thing he encounters here is trouble when an encounter with the new friend of an old flame bleeds him on the ground. This is where revenge and anger come into play. This is a man you do not want to cross, and at this point the mafia and police are on his tail. He meets a girl and immediately falls in love with her, and that's what the movie is all about. <br /> <br /> The film is very impressionistic with rich colors and noir overtones, which are associated with short but extreme action sequences. This is an art house at its core, filmed with so much attention to detail, with cruel sci-fi action in every scene. It is this strange porridge that interests me so much in this film. The directorial approach to this genre is refreshing and focuses on Sasha's emotional journey rather than a pure action movie. Do not worry, the action is there and plenty. However, many of these sequences only show implied violence with images of the terrible consequences. This does not mean that no action is shown. These scenes are here and are fantastic (especially at the end where we see Sasha's full powers unleashed in despair). The director chooses the violence of many scenes to keep track of the character's emotional struggle. This is a tragic love story and a refreshing entry into the genre.
