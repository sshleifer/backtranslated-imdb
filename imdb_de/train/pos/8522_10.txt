I found this show very late at night and tried it out. It's a refreshing change from the other things shown late at night when you notice my drift. The simplicity of the values ​​and the sweetness of the heart remind me of how friendships were as children. It's something I froze whenever I find it (which is rare, maybe I should actually check the listing! Haha) ... and the tension between Joe and Nick is so cute. As with any good chick movie, you are really emotionally involved in the characters. Good old Louisa May Alcott still inspires good stories :) So I seem to have to fill out 10 lines of text so my opinion is valid. I think I'll tell you a little bit more. The kids are played by talented actors and actresses, and the settings are lovely and full of nature - something that you do not see much on TV. I hope everyone has a chance. I recognize and know that it is juicy, but it is a good heart. As I said, it's refreshing.
