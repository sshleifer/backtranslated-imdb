This is a movie everyone should see. Apart from very important points (while South Africa is on the road to recovery, there are still many countries in similar situations), it is superbly geared, while I think Denzel Washington achieves the best performance in his career so far. Kline also performs well, though not as impressive as Washington's. John Thaw is also a good turnaround as police chief. <br /> <br /> There are so many possible areas where a movie about apartheid could fall, but all that has been avoided. It would be easy to portray white people as the bad ones and blacks as the good ones, but Attenborough did not do that. Sure, there were some white characters who were inherently evil, like the captain of the Soweto uprising, but adding extra dimensions to all the characters would make the movie unbearably long. Some people complain about the duration of the movie, but I think it takes two and a half hours to tell the whole story because it's really incredible. <br /> <br /> The best scene In the movie is the funeral of Steve Biko. When the whole crowd starts to sing the South African national anthem, this is probably one of the most moving scenes I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen this movie yet, look at it. It may not be pleasant to look at, but definitely worth it.
