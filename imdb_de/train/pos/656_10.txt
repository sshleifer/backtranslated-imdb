Of all the reviews I read, most of the people at Alexandre were extremely tough. Neither Marie nor Veronika ever seemed particularly desperate to keep Alexandre. He was just a little bit intelligent, if not intellectual at all, as most of us are, no matter how hard it is. Alexandre lives perfectly with the life that he cares completely about him, gets and gives what he wants. the girls allow that, veronika loves sex, marie is his patron. is anything wrong with anything? is someone in love? Really? I do not think French New Wave cinema is prone to presumptuousness, etc. However, it's just wonderful because there's no lack of a plot to create emotions. Ease is absolutely beautiful and anyone in Alexandre's position can ask in a city area. I am looking for a patron. Interested?
