I have to admit that when I read the description of the genre on Netflix as "Steamy Romance" I was a bit skeptical. "Steamy"? In a movie from 1968? I was prepared for disappointment. And when I realized that it was completely shot in black and white, I knew that my erotic hopes were being destroyed. <br /> <br /> Boy, was I wrong? Not only does this film contain all the elements of a steaming romance - the discovery of first love, the fear of the mystery, an unexpected end - but sometimes this film was downright erotic. You will soon forget that it will be recorded in black and white. Cinematography deserves every award she has received over the years. And the performances of the two stars (Essy Persson and Anna Gael) are intense and unforgettable. OK, so they're both in their mid-20s and trying to play schoolgirls. It's 1968. Do you really expect teens from the 60s to effectively explore a lesbian love story like this one? Many adult women still tried to deal with their sexuality. Anyone looking for real teenagers here expects too much. <br /> <br /> I think this movie was way ahead of its time. The level of eroticism was an unexpected pleasure; Still, it was still possible to leave much to the imagination, instead choosing to give us poetic descriptions that were added to what we were shown. I have no doubt that lesbians will identify with the characters here. And you just, who love to see lesbians in action: Although not everything is what you expect, I do not think you will be too disappointed either.
