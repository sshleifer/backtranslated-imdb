Man, if someone has been expecting a great zombie movie after reading this title, then you are aloof and you deserve to be disappointed. I myself expected a cheap zombie zombie strip - and that's exactly what I got. I was not disappointed at all. I thought it would be a cool little movie. The zombies were exactly what they should be, because all the zombies had just been turned over, so they're fresh undead zombies. Obviously they did that because it would have been quite expensive to have done rotted zombie FX. I understand the whole thing, I have no idea how anyone can seriously nod this movie. It's called "HOOD OF THE LIVING DEAD" for the love of God! Would you watch "Redneck Zombies" and EVERY Uwe Boll movie and EXPECT that it's great? Of course not! I'll never understand why there are some idiots in IMDb who whine about this movie like schoolgirls. Oh and yes, there are worse movies out there, so stop saying that this was the worst thing you've ever seen because you know you're full of it! You ever see "ZOMBIEZ" ???? Or "Feardotcom" ????? Or "house of the dead" ???? These are some of the worst I have ever seen. If you can not see that this is just a cheap zombie movie that was obviously made by zombie movie fans, something is wrong with you. I just had fun with it. Thumbs up from me and I would also like to see a sequel.
