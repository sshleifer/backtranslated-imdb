I really enjoyed this movie. (That's why it surprised me that so many users on this site rated it so low!) I'm not saying that it's a cinematic masterpiece, but it was a great way to spend a cold, snowy Saturday night. It's funny, poignant and a great story about the ups and downs of friendships that last in difficult times and the bad things that girlfriends do to each other! (Fess up ladies, we've SEEN EVERYTHING!) Bill Paterson shines as Reverand Gerald Marsden and Andie McDowell prove she can be a good actress if the role is right and she chooses to. (And truly, there's the best "wedding" I've ever seen or thought of in this movie ... more courage than anyone I've ever known!) They'll laugh and you'll cry - ignore any marketing campaigns and how this movie is marketed .... it is a hidden gem that TONNES of the box office should have done. (Now I have to look around to buy a copy!)
