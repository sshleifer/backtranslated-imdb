It's an extremely entertaining 1930s tune that turns the classic cliffhanger series into "Raiders of the Lost Ark" and is made only by low-budget members and lots of campers by director Michael Anderson. The opening scenes are rich in Gothic art objects that were two decades ahead of Batman. With Ron Ely (Tarzan) as the perfect hero and the gorgeous Pamela Hensley as local Latina Mona, who met our hero during a gold hunt in the non-existent Latin American country Hidalgo. Best Line, our hero for Mona, holding a fist on the chin as you expect him to be tender with her and hug her, "Mona, you're a brick!" Paul Wexler's Captain Seas is an absolute delight for ham and cheese. Expect a little "Raiders ..", a shot "Batman", a little "The Lost World", a little "Lost Horizons" and a lot of Campiness and you will find just the right thing. Watch out for cult favorite Michael Berryman in a small role as a mortician and enjoy the Campy dedication of John Philip Sousa's patriotic music. A prime candidate for DVD release is certainly overdue. An absolute must for the whole family. 9.10
