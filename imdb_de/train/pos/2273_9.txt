I have not seen a movie with Nolte in it that I did not like. Nevertheless, he has made many films and I have only seen a few. In my opinion, I keep the pictures of his performance here and those in "The Thin Red Line". Nolte has quite a few acting talents. When it's necessary to scream, he roars like a wounded lion. His best moments are the ones I like about actors: when he emulates only through facial, hand and body gestures, without saying anything. Having concluded that our current generation of actors by and large has no appreciation for what an actor can do without speaking, and does not enjoy the conscious appreciation of Keaton and Chaplin's championship, this generation of actors relies a great deal too much for the mechanical magic of computers. Of course, it's just an indication of the time we live. If Chaplin had spent our time ... who knows, he might as well become a lover of CGI tools. <br /> <br /> I did not read the Vonnegut novel that made this movie come to the screen. However, the plot is not so far-fetched or devouring that despite all its surprises we can not follow the path we have taken. Of course it seems absurd at first sight. However, it is not impossible. <br /> <br /> Consider this as a starter: a spy in the heart of the Third Reich: the extraordinary life of Fritz Kolbe, America's most important spy during the Second World War by Delattre and Prichard (see Amazon for more details). Consider: History Undercover: Piercing the Empire: American Spies in Nazi Germany (I've seen this here: http://store.aetv.com/html/product/index.jhtml?id=75054) seems to have a history channel To be production. <br /> <br /> Is the story so ridiculous? Far fetched yes, impossible, no. Back to the story. Nolte's character is recruited and accepts an incredibly dangerous mission, and unfortunately the script does not give us enough reason to accept it. Was it a kind of passivity that he was drawn into this role, it is said, because it was the best story he had ever written and he could play the part? It is hard to imagine that each one of us would understand something. However, it was an unusual time and people did extraordinary things. <br /> <br /> The acting of the entire cast is excellent and as Alan Arkin, always fantastic, is described, he plays a very good role in a small area. <br /> <br /> I was really shocked by the end of the movie (no - I will not ruin it), and I felt terrible in the election. Does this person feel that the road is finally over and that she has spoken all that is necessary and that more chapters are added to a life that is already filled with many burned pages? Hard to say, but it really bothers me. <br /> <br /> Nolte offers one of the best performances you can expect ... The space of the movie lets you think about many things. It is very entertaining and provocative. What great movies should be. A bit long, but worth it. By the way, the film music has a selection of the best living composers: Arvo Part.
