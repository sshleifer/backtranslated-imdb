I love the series! Many of the stereotypes that Southerrners portray as turns are very obvious, but such people exist too often. The portrayal of the southern government is all too true, but the sympathetic characters are reminiscent of one of the many good things of the South. Some things never change and we see the "good old boys" every day! Every city in the south has a Lucas Buck who just has to make a phone call to get things started. Apart from the supernatural elements, everything else could happen in the modern South! I somehow believe that Trinity, SC must have been in Barnwell County!
