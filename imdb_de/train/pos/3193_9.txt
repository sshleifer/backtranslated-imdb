The short film, which opens at the beginning of this film, is the real material of a guy named Gary, who apparently happened to be in the parking lot of a TV station where Gary works in the town of Beaver. Gary is a bit "different"; He is an impersonator and drives an old Chevy named Farrah (after Fawcett). And lo and behold, the filmmaker gets a letter later from Gary inviting him to return to Beaver to get some pictures of the local talent competition he has put together, including Gary's breathtaking performance as Olivia Newton Dawn. Oh my. The next two shorts are Gary's story. The very ones you've just seen, only the first is shown by Sean Penn and the second by Crispin Glover titled "The Orkly Kid". If you feel like making fun of someone, this is definitely the movie you need to watch. I was doubled by most laughs, especially Crispins Performance, which could definitely stand alone. When it was over, I had to rewind the movie to see the real Gary and all his shiny silly things again. Although Olivia was the center of attention, I would have wished that one of the "fictional" shorts in Gary's Barry Manilow impersonator had experienced a shock that was equally ridiculous.
