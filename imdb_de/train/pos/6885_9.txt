It came as a surprise. , The impact and determination that this film had on my automatic way of responding to people and situations. The liveliest was the stirring up of feeling madness. Similar to a spoiled child, if you react to the fact that you can not make it. , A tantrum if you want. To think that I was hiding that anger from others was the most ridiculous farce of all. What did that cost me? Soooo much love. , , so many blessings. Now I am present how incredibly I feel humble and have a lasting gratitude for life. , For what is happening right now, without my wild expectations of life being a certain way, as I think, life or people should "should". This film has contributed to the freedom that I now feel to communicate with others without limitations and expectations. , .and to connect with real love. , without fear of loss. , Love first and accept what love is given.
