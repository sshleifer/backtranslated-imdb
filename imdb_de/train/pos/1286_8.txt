This well-known story of an older man / woman is surprisingly sharp-edged. Bikers, hippies, free love and prison bait mix surprisingly well in this forgotten black and white indie effort. Lead actress Patricia Wymer Titular "Candy" shows the best performance of her career (she covers all three drive-in epics). Wymer was precocious in THE YOUNG GRADUATES (1971) and picked up, but made a more serious performance in THE BABYSITTER. The occasional acts of violence and periodic nudity are somewhat surprising, but well-handled by the director. Leads Wymer and George E. Carey credibly sell the May / December romance. There is enough in common between THE BABYSITTER and THE YOUNG GRADUATES to wonder if the same director has made the last movie. Patricia Wymer, where are you? <br /> <br /> Miss Wymer, from Seattle, Washington, was a dancer on the MALIBU U TV rock and roll show before she graced the cover (and appeared in an eight) ( Page spread) of the August 1968 issue of "Best For Men," a tasteful adult magazine. She also appeared as a coven witch in 1969's popular coaching trumpet THE WITCHMAKER. THE BABYSITTER has finally made its home video debut as part of the eight-tiered BCI boxing set DRIVE-IN CULT CLASSICS vol. 3, which is available at Amazon.com and some retail stores such as Best Buy.
