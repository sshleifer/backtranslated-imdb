The film is exceptional in its gay iconography and extends it beyond the aesthetics of music and occupation. There is a childlike miracle throughout the movie, as seen through the eyes of the main character. Your carefree attitude towards the world around us is funny and beautiful. In a way, it's a laid-back movie for girls. Take a look at this, if you are interested in a relaxed entertaining midnight movie. Buy this if you like other media and the combined love (?).
