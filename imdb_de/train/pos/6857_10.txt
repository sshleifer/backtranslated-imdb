"Dressed To Kill" is one of the best thrillers of all time. Dealing with sex and violence makes this movie a movie for adults. Brian De Palma once again proves why no other director can match his camera to tell a story. He directs many scenes without dialogue, and he tells much of his story, exclusively through his visuals and the brilliant score of Pino Donnagio. The film filmed in Panavision MUST be seen in widescreen format, since De Palma uses the full width of the film to tell its story. Cut on video, "Dressed To Kill" is hardly the same movie. Solid performances, great direction and perhaps the best film music ever written make "Dressed To Kill" a must.
