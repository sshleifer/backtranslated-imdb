Anna (Charlotte Burke), who is about to reach puberty, begins to have strange dreams that affect her in real life - especially with a boy named Mark (Elliott Spiers) whom she meets in her dreams. <br /> <br /> Very unusual fantasy with some really scary moments. Despite the fact that it is a young girl and has a PG-13 rating, this is NOT for children. Even if you hate fantasies, stay away. But if you decide for something else, that fits perfectly. <br /> <br /> A good director of Bernard Rose with a beautiful music score and some nice, weird thrusts. The only thing preventing this is a really great movie is Burke - she's not a very good actress (it's no surprise that this was her only movie), and it hurts the movie. Everyone else is great, though. <br /> <br /> Spiers is very good as a mark; Glenne Headley (who fakes a British accent very well) is also very good, as Anna's mother and Ben Cross are scary and likable as Anna's dad. That's too bad - it's really good.
