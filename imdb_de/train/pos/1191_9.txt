Robert Taylor as the crazy buffalo hunter Charlie Gilson is the main character in this movie. At the beginning, I thought that Charlie would end up redeeming himself like John Wayne in The Searchers or James Stewart in The Naked Spur. But as the movie progresses, Gilson continues to cruelty until you realize there's no hope for him. Stewart Granger is Sandy McKenzie, who wants to stop hunting because he realizes that the buffalo will soon be gone, and he is disgusted by the act of deterrence. Gilson is a natural murderer who makes no difference between animals and humans. Debra Paget as an Indian is a surprising figure considering the self-imposed censorship of the time. She is in total resignation to Gilson, even though she hates him. The last scene of a frozen Gilson is unforgettable.
