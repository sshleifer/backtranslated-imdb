It is predicted that between 2000 and 2020, 68 million people will prematurely die of AIDS. The planned toll is the largest in sub-Saharan Africa, where 55 million additional deaths are expected. Beyond the grim statistics, there are personal stories that we rarely hear about. Christophe Honor√© describes one of the most moving films in Close to Leo, a film produced for French television as part of a series with questions from young people. Although it is fictional, it is a situation that is unfortunately too frequent - the impact of HIV diagnosis on a loving, close-knit family. <br /> <br /> When twenty-one-year-old Leo (Pierre Mignard) informs his parents and two teenage brothers, Tristan (Rodolphe Pauley) and Pierrot (Jeremie Lippmann), that he suffers from AIDS, the family is devastated. Concerned about his youth, they decide to refuse the information to his youngest brother, 12-year-old Marcel (Yannis Lespert), but he overhears the conversation and begins to talk and act unpredictably. When Leo goes to Paris for treatment, he takes Marcel with him, but the boy introduces Leo and demands that he learn the truth. Leo tells him that he is ill and Marcel is sad, but accepted. When he brings Marcel to meet a few former gay friends, the tension between them and the stage rises for a gripping conclusion. <br /> <br /> Although I was uncomfortable seeing scenes in bed with physical contact between the brothers, I feel that the sincerity of Close to Leo and the brilliant performances of Lespert and Mignard have more than a positive impact on the scales , Seeing events from the boy's perspective gives the film an authenticity that reminds me of the Quebecois film Leolo and Truffaut's The 400 Blows. Unlike some American films that dance around the fear of AIDS, Close to Leo says a sharp truth, but in a way that is tender and wonderfully real.
