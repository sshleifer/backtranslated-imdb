Like the gentle giants that make up the second half of the film, Michael Oblowitz's latest production has grace, but is also slow and cumbersome. The producer's last problem, "Mosquitoman 3D", had the same problem. It's hard to imagine a boring shark movie, but they did it somehow. The only draw for Hammerhead: Shark Frenzy was the passable Animatronix who is always fun when dealing with wondrous worlds under the sea surface. But that was only passable. The low concentration in some scenes made the production amateurish. With dolphins and whales, the technology is almost wasted. Cloudy scenes and too many close-ups of the film's huge motifs can not take advantage of IMAX's impressive 3D capabilities. There are far too few scenes of depth and variety. Close-ups of these great creatures just look flat and there is often just one creature in the camera field, so no depth contrast arises. Michael Oblowitz is trying to follow in his father's footsteps, but if you get the Shark Week on cable, his introspective and boring treatment of his subjects is a constant disappointment.
