The best way to describe Europe, which is at the top of my list of favorite films, is the exclamation that a comrade received after the end of the film: "I did not know that films could be made that way". Fully original in visual style, this is one of the best examples of what cinema can be. It's as far from the "master and coverage" style as you can get; Many levels of image, sound, effects, props, dialogue, voice-over, performance, editing, lighting, etc. can be perfectly integrated. Despite Hollywood's "dialogue" - myopia, cinema is not about dialogue, not about lighting, action or music. It works best when all the elements are equal and ONLY convey the idea in the order or combination in which they are presented. Reduce or eliminate the contribution of an element, and the movie has no meaning. "Europe" should be the cinema.
