by Dane Youssef <br /> <br /> "Coonskin" is a film by the only Ralph Bakshi who allegedly made a satirical indictment of blaxploitation films and negative black stereotypes, as well as a look at black life in modern America (modern for the day, I mean - 1975). Paramount dropped it like a hot potato that was just going up in flames. <br /> <br /> But this is a Bakshi movie, controversial, exciting and almost a must-have by definition. Not just a random "shock jock" of a movie trying to create a shock for shock reasons. It's from Ralph Bakshi. Anyone who knows the name knows that if he made a movie, he has something big to say. <br /> <br /> Although the roots are in cheap blaxploitation, "Coonskin" is not just another knock on the cake. away from the mainstream white movie or any kind of disposable movie. "Coonskin" wants to be more. It aims to direct the view up and deep-fried a much larger fish. <br /> <br /> The movie is not just fun in the genre. It not only appeals to black people, but actually shows love, beauty and heart in the strangest places. <br /> <br /> "Coonskin" tells a story of some convicts waiting for a jailbreak. The fact that it is even possible to break out of a prison in the "Coonskin" world makes it old-fashioned. <br /> <br /> One of the inmates tells a story about a trio of Black Brothers in Harlem called Brother Bear, Brother Rabbit, Fox Preacher, who want respect and a piece of plot and are ready to do it by any means possible. The Itallian mob carries out all the action. <br /> <br /> The star of the great black musicians: Barry White and Scatman Crothers and Charles Gordone, the first black playwright to take the Pulitzer home. Something big is obviously happening here. <br /> <br /> The movie takes place like a descent into this world, this side of the race. From an angry, hip, deep, soulful black man with a hatred in his heart and a gun in his hand. Bakshi's films never know the meaning of the word "sublimity". This looks like it has not even heard the word. But maybe such a topic needs extremism. Real sledgehammer satire. Some topics can not be approached carefully. Bakshi is mercilessly merciless. No member or minority of the Harlem scene is intact here. <br /> <br /> The characters here are "animated" to "real" depending on mood and situation. The animated and human characters have the same reality and should be taken literally as well. Bakshi never shows ugly cartoons just to get shocked. He always has something to say. Blackface is not in vain. Unlike Spike Lee's "Bamboozled," he seems to be trying and really saying something. <br /> <br /> Like 99.9% of all films by Bakshi, this movie includes animation and live action. Usually at the same time. Bakshki is not just bauble here. The whole technique is intertwined and intertwined as she says something. <br /> <br /> Somehow, this feels inevitably old-fashioned. Many of these types of films (including bakshis) are very up to date and very spontaneous. They reflect the particular trend of the day, but looking back years later, there is only one unmistakable sense of nostalgia (and timeless truth). <br /> <br /> Although music, clothes, slang and the city clearly look like photos that belong in a time capsule, the attitude, the mind and the heart are the same, no matter what the ear it is. Everyone who has really seen the movies, the state of affairs and being in society, people know what I'm talking about. <br /> <br /> Even some of the black characters are a hare (Junglebunny). a big old bear and a fox. One of the sourest and most unappetizing racist characters is a filthy Harlem policeman tracking this "dirty N" after the death of a policeman. But for him, it's not just about business. Nor does it apply to the other brothers who wear the shield. It's just pure sadistic racist joy to hurt black people. <br /> <br /> The sequence in which the godfather and his wife are involved is one of the most moving pieces in the entire film, of which there are many. It's like an opera or a ballet. <br /> <br /> Promo line: WARNING: "This movie offends everyone!" This is not just a hype. Take extreme care. <br /> <br /> You have been warned ... <br /> <br /> by Dane Youssef
