I know, I know: it's childish. But I love this kind of movie. A bird that has suffered many "mishaps" and yet has not lost faith in humanity and its humor. The special feature of this film is the fact that the main character is Paulie - the parrot - and he does not serve as a boost to a human actor. Also, I like the plot: Paulie tells his cleaner at the point where he's bottomed out. (By the way: Jay Mohr's voice almost sounds like Joe Pescis!). And of course Cheech Marin is humor for me. Since I saw "Up in Smoke", I appreciate his naive way of playing and made a simple situation into a funny situation. I can not help myself.
