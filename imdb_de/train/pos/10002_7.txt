This is by far the most underrated movie of the Brooks Cannon. Sure, it's faulty. There is no realistic view of homelessness (in contrast, Citizen Kane, for example, gives a realistic view of lounge singers or the Titanic a realistic view of Italian YOU IDIOTS). Many of the jokes fall flat. But still, this movie is very adorable in a way that is not the case in many comedies, and it's really impressive to say so in a story about some of the most traditionally insulted members of society. It is not the fishing king, but no shit. My only complaint is that Brooks should have positioned another person at the top (I love Mel as a director and author, not so much as a lead).
