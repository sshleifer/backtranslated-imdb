Theodore Rex is possibly the greatest cinema experience of all time and certainly a milestone in human culture, civilization and artistic expression !! In this captivating intellectual masterpiece, Jonathan R. Betuel combines the great filmmakers of the twentieth century, such as Francis Ford Copola, Martin Scorcese, Orson Welles, and Roman Polanski. The special effects are no less than breathtaking and make all works of Spielberg seem banal and elementary. At the time of its release, Theodore Rex was such a revolutionary gem that he raised the bar to a level never anticipated by filmmakers. The concept of not just making a movie with a dinosaur, but adapting an action-packed, intoxicating detective novel staring at a "talking" dinosaur with a postmodern name like "Theodore" and an existential policewoman. Humanity as we know it. The world could never be the same after experiencing such great beauty. Watching Theodore Rex is very similar when you look into the face of God and hear him say, "You are my dearest creation." This is one of the few movies that are easy to die for !!!
