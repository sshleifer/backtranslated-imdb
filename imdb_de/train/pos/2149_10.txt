Everyone in the cast, from Sugiyama to Aoki and Toyoko, is someone we know everyday. They were so natural and Sugiyama's transformation is incredibly believable. The score is so moving that I'm moved to tears. The choreography was nice without being athletic. Mai's graceful dance and charm gave me goose bumps. Tamako is such a wonderfully adorable character. You can almost see the enchanted student in her face reminding her to have seen "The King and I". Aoki's character is both funny and pathetic. Masako is as overwhelmingly natural as the confused woman, you almost want to hug her, to reassure her that everything will be fine. This movie is really a keeper.
