This is a very unusual film in which the star with the highest billing literally appears only halfway. Nevertheless, I was busy with the hook of the Phantom Lady. Although Curtis, as Scott Henderson falsely accuses, is competent, he seems to be a bit harsh (maybe he should have shaved his mustache) and his behavior when he got home would have convinced the police at least to some extent of his innocence , While another commentator had a problem with Franchot Tone as Jack Marlowe, I found his depiction of the character impressively complex. He is not a rogue. The outstanding character actor Elisha Cook Jr. is back in top form as a "little man with big ambitions". His drumming in the musical numbers added a welcome touch of eroticism. However, this film is worn by the very capable and sympathetic Ella Raines, as would be the devoted lover of Henderson, Carol Richmond. She definitely has talent and her screen presence is in the tradition of Lauren Bacall. This is the first of her works that I have seen, and I am definitely inclined to see her other roles. The rest of the gypsum plaster is also more than competent. All in all, a very satisfying film noir puzzle that, when you look at it today, fully conveys the dark and complex city world it intends. Recommended, 8/10.
