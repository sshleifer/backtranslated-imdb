Panic is a sneaky little gem of a movie - you think you figured it out in the first half hour and then it was a great joy to discover that Henry Bromell is a much better writer / director. <br /> <br /> The film slowly builds up, scene after scene in a devastating destruction, by William H. Macy, Donald Sutherland, Neve Campbell, Tracey Ullman, John Ritter and the most notable children's actor I 'David Dorfman, seen for a long time, as Macy's son, who pretends his lines as if they were completely unwritten thoughts that arise in his head. This movie is rich and rewarding and will be available to you long after the credits.
