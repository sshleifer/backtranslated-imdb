That's My Bush is a live action project created by South Park makers Trey Parker and Matt Stone. The show was canceled after a season, not because of bad reviews (it actually received good reviews), but because it was very expensive. This is my bush is a pretty funny parody of an average TV sitcom. It is also a political satire. Well, this is not nearly as good as South Park, but it's a very funny parody of a sitcom and also a pretty good political satire. The guy who plays in my bush looks very much like him! If you can find the show, look at it. There is a lot to laugh about! <br /> <br /> 9/10
