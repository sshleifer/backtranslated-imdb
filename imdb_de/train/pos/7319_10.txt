Halloween is the story of a boy who was misunderstood as a child. He takes out his problems with his older sister, whom he kills at the beginning of the film. This is just the beginning of Michael Myers. Donald Pleasance plays the doctor who has been studying Myers for years. He knows something is different about him, something that is mysteriously evil. This evil is not contained and can not be stopped. After escaping from an asylum, Myers goes in search of his younger sister. If he kills her, the problems of this misunderstood boy can end. But he seems to have trouble handling his sister because other people get in the way. He manages to take her out while he is still looking for the girl he needs. <br /> <br /> There were many horror films in which teenagers were hacked to pieces by a masked or cruel murderer. But this one started it all, somehow. If you think about it, most of those horror movies we all remember are those where Freddy Kruger or Jason chase half-naked girls. Well, if Halloween had not been, these characters would not have pursued our dreams when we were kids. <br /> <br /> Halloway's director John Carpenter has taken a lot out of the horror movies of the 1950s and combined everything he knew into a movie that scared a lot of people in the late '70s. This film solidified him as a director to pursue the career of Jamie Lee Curtis, who plays the girl who is being persecuted by the masked killer. It was not so much out there. It has been copied and demolished, but Halloween will always remain the epitome of teen horror film. It still gives you a shiver when you hear Carpenter's exciting music as we watch another victim being persecuted by this shadowy Michael Myers.
