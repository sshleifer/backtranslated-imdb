I saw this movie with my mother many years ago in high school. I was definitely not interested in opera at the time, but he changed my mind. I really enjoyed this movie and have really enjoyed the opera ever since. I even bought several of his CDs. Who cares what his acting skills were, basically he played only by himself, which was adorable. He was so charming, so charismatic; I just wanted to hug him. I am very sad that so many criticize him so hard. It was so clear that people did not accept pushing him around or judging his actions. He deserves to be respected and admired for his talent. He will definitely be missed !!!
