This film has scenes that come back to me at the strangest times - this intense scene in which Mr. Muckerji tells Mrs. Melandez that someone he's talked to has seen the girl from a woman who fits into her description Rolling out of the window that rolls around - the way she always refers to him by name - with a Greek accent "Mr. Muckerji" - and then, when Boyer discovers that she has just taken poison and you still a final blow to the side of the head gives you dies - it's a pleasure! "Fools - fools - my whole life" ... etc etc - you get the point ... I have to buy this. I love Dan Seymour's acting - he usually plays a fat foreign sultan or police chief and appeared in Casablanca and many great pictures.
