This is an amazing movie, both because of the incredible energy created by the frenetic flamenco dance and because of the unique way in which the filmmakers interweave the story of stage production with the life of the characters prepared for it. Spellbound is the only word I can use to describe the experience. This is not 'Bizet's Carmen' as usual. This is not a normal movie. Every nuanced gaze, every pounding of the foot, every piece of music is so intertwining that you can not take your eyes off the screen. You do not have to love opera or flamenco (I can not) to be caught up in this movie, caught up and fascinated. Subtle and direct; loud and quiet; One of, if not the best, films of this kind, because there are so few of them.
