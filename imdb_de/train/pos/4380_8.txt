This is a very good, underrated action / drama and historical movie. <br /> <br /> The basic story refers to Rob Roy's loan of 1000 pounds, the theft and the problems that this causes for his family and indirectly his clansmen. <br /> <br /> Cunningham (Tim Roth) is an amazing villain and character in this story. Brutally cold and looking at his face, he seems to be able to avert his eyes and look totally evil. <br /> <br /> Rob Roy (Liam Neeson) is also excellent, but I think the authors used the word "honor" 1 too many times. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast is strong and the whole movie is very well played and filmed. <br /> <br /> The action is exciting and the sword is very realistic, but not too bloody. The story is good and you really want Rob to win. <br /> <br /> All in all, just shy of a classic.
