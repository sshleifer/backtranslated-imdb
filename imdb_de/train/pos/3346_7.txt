In the Old West, there are always men who breathe violence and women who hold their breath. A famous "city man" named Clit Tollinger (Robert Mitchum) is hired by the citizens to eliminate the gunslingers (including Leo Genn, Claude Atkins), Baronlands Hoodlums. There he meets the blacksmith (Emile Meyer), his daughter (Karen Sharpe), her boyfriend (John Lupton), the marshal (Henry Hull) and the saloon owner (Ted De Corsia). Clint, as a lawyer, is appointed deputy to bring peace, and sets out some cartels in the following terms: ¨ Warning, carrying weapons or other weapons in the city is prohibited. Check all the hardware in the Marshal's office ¨. Clint finds his ex-girlfriend, a local Madame (Jan Sterling), who is responsible for the saloon girls (including Angie Dickinson, Barbara Lawrence). But the city council was afraid of the raw methods used by Clint. In the end, the Kingpin landowner appears and tries to assassinate Tollinger with his own hands. <br /> <br /> This is a hugely exciting story of a sheriff who had just one more murder to kill. It starts out as a slow moving western, but it surprises us with dark characters and a solid plot. The story is almost gloomy, a pacifier arrives in a city just in time to convince the citizens, but later the events get worse and worse. The highlights are the burning in saloon and the climatic showdown at the end. A phenomenal and great role for Robert Mitchum as avenger angel and bitter gunfighter, he's the whole show. Lively and lively music by Alex North (Spartacus, Cleopatra), atmospheric black and white cinematography by Lee Garmes. The film was amazingly realized by Richard Wilson (Al Capone, Three in Attic), who made a good Western as an "invitation to a revolver hunter" and "Zane Gray" episodes.
