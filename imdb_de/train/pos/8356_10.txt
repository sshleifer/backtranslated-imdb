Not sure if this counts as a spoiler or not, so beware: <br /> <br /> Just one small but important thing to watch out for, a fascinating possibility: the guys will eventually steal a green Citroen to have fun, and bring it back to the owner after you have done purposefully and vindictively hidden damage to the car in the hope that the owner will crash. Is it the same car that they later steal from the picnic's family? We know that the original owner sold it. You end up on a dangerous road, which I believe has been closed to all but pedestrians for ten years. A completely new perspective on the end of the film. <br /> <br /> This film could also be called "Scent of a Woman". I can not remember another film, certainly not an American who treats the scent of a woman so open and open, much like the "nose" of a fine Bordeaux.
