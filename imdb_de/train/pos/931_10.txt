I like all versions of this story, but this is my everlasting favorite. George C. Scott gives the Scrooge character a depth that the others do not give. The film shows more about why he gets so bitter. The changes in Scrooge are beginning to appear as he encounters the various spirits and incidents that show him. <br /> <br /> This movie has by far the best Tiny Tim. He is the right age and is not played by someone who, like in the other movies, is almost a teenager. Anthony Walters still has all or most of his baby teeth. <br /> <br /> David Warner is wonderful as Bob Cratchit. He is such a versatile actor. He portrays a man who clearly loves his family. He plays the role with dignity, not as a shaky man huddling under Scrooge's thum but as a man who gets away with it cruelly because he has a family to look after. Susannah York and the other actors do a good job of bringing the characters to life. Edward Woodward is the best Christmas present I have ever seen. Mostly he is played as a funny Santa Claus. In this he shows anger over Scrooge's attitudes and makes Scrooge really rethink. <br /> <br /> The costumes and sets really bring the Londoners of Dickens to life. A wonderful movie.
