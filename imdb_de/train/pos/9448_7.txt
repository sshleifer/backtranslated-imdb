This was undoubtedly the most disturbing movie I have ever seen. The first part of the film is strange but light and amusing. The journey begins with such a peaceful touch that highlights the beauty of the Appalachian hills. But that is misleading. The obvious social problems (inbreeding) and the deformities of the rural inhabitants are only the first disturbing aspects of the film. I can still hear Bobby moaning in pain, and I shudder at the thought. Lewis's leg made me flinch. Although the film as a whole was very disturbing and stressful, he asked some interesting questions. When is it moral or right to take another person's life? What can morality do to us in some cases or not? And are dignity and moral integrity more important than life itself? Whatever conclusions one draws from the film, it is a feat in its own right (despite certain aspects that were freezing cold and really cruel).
