At first, I did not know what to expect when I started the video. <br /> <br /> Every time someone brings back a cult movie genre and puts it into the present, something inexplicably gets lost in the translation br /> <br /> That's not the case here. This film is just starting on the right track. It is familiar terrain in part, but it also manages to surpass it. Crockzilla scene someone? That must be seen, and try to keep a straight face. This film takes some of the old fun cult classic and manages to seamlessly integrate it into a modern production. It is good to see that someone meets the needs in this market. Very well done. <br /> <br />
