This movie is definitely on my top 10 favorites list. The voices for the animals are wonderful. Sally Field and Michael J. Fox are both brilliant as the naughty cat and the young inexperienced pooch, but the real standout is Don Ameche as the old, faithful Golden Retriever. This movie is a great family movie because it can be appreciated and loved by both children and adults. Humorous and exciting, and guaranteed that every pet lover cries! (Tears of joy!)
