I looked at it in July and even with the Christmas theme I found it touching and empathetic. It is not for someone with a spirit of reality because it is full of imagination and lovely moments that sometimes make no sense. William Russ did a great job as Hank. I just saw him in the remake of The Long, Hot Summer, where he played a weak character. But in this case, the expression in his eyes was consistently, while Hank looked at the things that happened to him, wonderful and tender. Valerie Bertinelli was, as always, excellent and gracious and believed in this role very much. And Peter Falk as Max was great and always smiled when performing in a number of important scenes. There were many special scenes, including the one in which Hank identifies who Max really was in his life. It's not for everyone ... especially those who are not interested in "feel good movies" and this is definitely one! If you want everything to be perfect and meaningful, avoid it. But I think it's worth to look at it again, that's why I recorded it. (Yes, some of us still have VCRs. :)
