The enchanted April is a tone poem, an impressionist painting, a masterpiece of the transmission of a message in a few words. It was one of my 10 favorite movies since it came out. I'll wait, though less patiently, until the movie is released in DVD format. Apparently I'm not alone. <br /> <br /> If the entries of the parent company Amazon are correct, there are many people who would like to have this title in DVD format. Many people want to go to Italy with this cast and this script. Many people want to keep a permanent copy of this movie in their libraries. The cast is spectacular, the cinematography and direction impeccable. The movie is definitely a keeper. Many have already asked. Please add our names to our list.
