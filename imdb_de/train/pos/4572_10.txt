As someone who has been living with Cerebral Palsey for over forty years, I find this film inspiring. If someone with so severe a case of CP like Christie Brown can do so much, then there is no reason why I could not achieve my own dreams. Daniel Day-Lewis and Brenda Fricker both give great performances. <br /> <br />
