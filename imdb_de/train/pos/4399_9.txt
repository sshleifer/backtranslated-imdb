Ride With The Devil is best described in one word: authenticity. I will not repeat what has already been said about this wonderful film, but I would like to say how much the historical research and meticulous attention to detail, which the crew undoubtedly went through, has been appreciated by this film visitor. <br /> <br /> As a student of history, familiar with the time and setting of this film, I have to say that this production is one of the most accurate fictional films about Bleeding Kansas. Yes, freedoms were taken in relation to actual events, as all fictions are appropriate. But the overall feel of the movie is real. Authentic costumes, authentic settings (no PC in hindsight), even the actors look authentic. Even Jewel Kilcher (who plays a minor role in the film) looked as though she had stepped out of a mid-19th century photograph. Few spectators with whom I spoke expressed her disbelief in stylized dialogue. You can not believe that 19th century farmers "talk like poets". <br /> <br /> What they do not realize is that the 19th century American public in this age of verbal sloppiness was an astonishingly educated person eloquent. These people grew up on Shakespeare and the King James Version of the Bible. The scriptwriters reconstructed the most likely verbal styles of these people based on the documentation of the time. The stylized dialogue adds only to the magical atmosphere of the film. <br /> <br /> In addition to a historical document, this film also works on a visceral level. Beautifully photographed and performed, it is reminiscent of the times of the great Western epics. The raid on Lawrence, Kansas, which has taken place so often in so many other smaller films, is portrayed with a sense of urgency that puts the viewer in the middle of the action. <br /> <br /> Romance, adventure, moral and ethical conflict. This movie has everything a sophisticated movie-goer could wish for. <br /> <br /> In a year dominated by over-high garbage like American Beauty, this great work of art was buried by an indifferent studio system. However, I am sure that Ride With The Devil will be due in the next few years. Please lend this movie. You will not be disappointed.
