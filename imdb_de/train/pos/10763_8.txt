I have to admit that I was very skeptical of this documentary. I expected it to be All American propaganda that we do not like here in Europe. I was wrong. This is NOT propaganda, in fact it is hardly political. <br /> <br /> It shows the events of 9/11 through the eyes of the firefighters who were called into the scene immediately after the aircraft crashed. It is an amazing coincidence that this documentary was filmed at all! This film was originally filmed as a documentary filmmaker about a rookie New York firefighter who became "a man". We can only thank the filmmakers for continuing their work during the terrible suffering before them. <br /> <br /> A great job. Absolutely stunning material. We recommend. <br /> <br /> Greetings,
