This film is about the unlikely friendship between a businessman and a man with Down syndrome. <br /> <br /> The character development in this film is excellent. We can believe that Harry is a businessman who neglects his family, and Georges is an innocent man who longs for love and care for the "normal" society. The acting is excellent and the price for the best actor of Cannes is well deserved. <br /> <br /> The fantasy scenes in the film underscore the fact that Georges misery is tormented by his abandonment of his family and his desire to be considered normal. The song, which is played repeatedly, amplifies this message. The film shows that people with intellectual disability are good-natured. We treated her with discrimination and neglect, as highlighted by the scene in which Georges presents the waitress in the kitchen. When we understand and share the world of these people, both we and the mentally disabled can become very happy. <br /> <br /> I was so fascinated by the movie and the emotional experiences of the characters. It's a touching movie for good-natured souls.
