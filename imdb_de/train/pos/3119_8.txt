"The Bourne Ultimatum" starts frivolously in the middle of the pursuit and explodes in a throbbing burst as Jason Bourne (behind the CIA black ops) finds the masterminds behind the CIA black ops, making him the perfect match in the last attempt Killers made to learn his true identity. A sickeningly icy David Strathairn as a "man behind the curtain" is added to the recurring cast of regulars like Joan Allen (excellent) and Julia Stiles (nonexistent). <br /> <br /> As the second entry in the I wish, Paul Greengrass's shaky handheld camera would be static at least for a few minutes of downtime. However, this is the perfect way to capture the tense, claustrophobic feeling of intimate melee scenes, and it works just as well in the chase scenes that usually run on foot or over rooftops with occasionally large wagon stacks. Part of the fun of the Bourne series is the constant globe hopping and the manipulation of technology and communication that seem to contradict the laws of physics and current abilities. The Bourne films seem to exist in a kind of pithy hyperreality that is full of technological magic. There's no point in everyone seeming to be in the right place at the right time, but I'd be damned if it's not a great time watching them get there. <br /> <br /> With the absence of The emotional and inclusive Franka Potente tries to create an emotional connection between Damon and Stiles, but she is as expressionless as an actress, that she never leads to anything. However, this can be forgiven because, unlike "identity" and "supremacy," this "ultimatum" reveals everything and we finally learn the truth about Bournes's past. It's a fun and satisfying end to the series, and if you have a good mind and Damon has his wish, this is the perfect ending.
