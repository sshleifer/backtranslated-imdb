I just can not believe some of the comments on this show! The show is awesome! Certainly it does not follow the tried and true, but as consumers we want to throw the same things over and over again. Should we not have the opportunity to treat ourselves to something new every now and then? The style is not as realistic as in previous "Scooby Doo" shows, but it should not be. The show, titled "Shaggy and Scooby Doo Get A Clue," states that in this title, the entire beloved cast of other depictions would constantly play. And nowhere does that mean they'll solve secrets, and they can not even stand monsters. So why? I'm really glad that they put some long-time plot points in a Scooby Doo show. They still have jokes, awkward hi-jinks, fast-changing outfits in chase scenes, the usual hallway gag and even Scooby snacks. In fact, I am glad that this show is out there because I just love it. I'm even glad that they got rid of the rest of the team for a while, focusing on only two main characters and a villain. <br /> <br /> Sure, it's ridiculous, it should be! Of course it is different, it should be. It's meant to make you laugh at the villain and encourage the idiot robot butler to triumph over all invading vermin, regardless of size. They should get the running joke "Roobi-Roo". The whole thing is just so well put together, there's not a single thing that I think is wrong. The writing, the acting, the animation, everything first class. The theme music is great (my computer plays "GET A CLUE!" At startup) and the background music is just gripping.
