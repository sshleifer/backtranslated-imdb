This is the first movie I've seen of John Singleton, and he's a pretty good director. The movie starts with a bunch of incoming newcomers and shows what happens to some of them. Omar Epps plays a track star with a partial scholarship and finds it hard to keep up with his work. He is friends with Ice Cube and creatures from Tyra Banks. Kristy Swanson is a rich girl who has raped a date and is friends with Jennifer Connelly, a lesbian, and is not sure which direction to go. Michael Rapaport is a kid from Idaho who falls into a group of neo-Nazis whose leader is Cole Hauser. These are the three main characters and Laurence Fishburne is a professor of political science and tries to help them. It's a great movie, and it's unfortunate that the studio had to make several cuts in the movie.
