Yeah, it's a chick movie and it moves a bit slow, but actually it's pretty good - and I consider myself a male man. You have to love Judy Davis no matter where she is, and the girl playing her daughter provides a natural, compelling performance of the movie's main theme. The unknown (at least unknown to me) actors and actresses give the film a realism that attracts you and attracts your attention. Overall, I give an 8/10. Look at it.
