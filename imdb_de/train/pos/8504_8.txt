You play as B.J. Blazkowicz, a tough guy from the US secret agents, wants to expose the Nazi mystery and make the turn of the Second World War. That means everything from the outbreak of a Nazi dungeon to Hitler's war machine to the leader himself. This is probably the most influential game of his time. That's because it literally inspired obsession. There were a lot of games at that time and even more today, but sometimes you get a real grabber. This is one of them. Just like Tetris before and recently GTA III in 2002. Yes, Doom is better in almost every way, but the shots that are heard all over the world and that led to one of the biggest tidal waves in the game have been described by B.J. The Space Marine, Duke Nukem, Max Payne, Serious Sam, John Mullins, JC Denton, Agent 47, Gordon Freeman and legions of others owe their existence to the guys from ID. Whether directly or in most cases indirectly, but they still do. <br /> <br /> Despite its old-style appearance, the very aged graphics, the super simple gameplay (this is really a game, the games now border on the "level experience") and high rectangular levels provide the scope of all six Episodes a lot of fun especially discovering these secrets with treasure and chaingun. <br /> <br /> Also: "Stop!" * Bang! Bang! Bang! * "AARRRGH !!!" never gets old --- 8 / 10 <br /> <br /> Voluntarily ranked PC-13 for "deep carnage", but it's exceptionally tame when compared to today's games.
