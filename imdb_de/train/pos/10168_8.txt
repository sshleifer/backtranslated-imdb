Look, it's Eva Longoria and Paul Rudd in a movie about a dead girlfriend who is chasing the new girlfriend. It's Gabrielle from Desperate Housewives and the guy wearing "Sex Panther Cologne" in Anchorman. If you're expecting a Golden Globe nominated movie, you'll need to rethink the way you watch movies. But if you're ready to face reality for 90 minutes and want to watch a funny movie, you've come to the right place. The characters are all funny. They work very well together. The real match is Paul Rudd and Lake Bell. He is just as funny as Friends and she looked both funny and good. I was with my wife, she enjoyed it and so did I.
