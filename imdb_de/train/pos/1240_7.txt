Eddie Murphy plays Chandler Jarrell, a man who focuses on finding lost children. When the beautiful Kee Nang {Charlotte Lewis} enters his life, she tells him that he is the chosen one and he must find the golden child. Jarrell is skeptical and driven by lust and intrigue. He is in the process of not realizing that he is embarking on a fantastic journey, a journey that brings with it the dangers and the worst of everything, the demon Sardo Numspa. <br /> <br /> Is the golden kid a product of his time? by that I mean, was the popularity of Eddie Murphy and The Golden Child exclusively for the late 1980s audience? I can vividly remember how much this film entertained folk in this decade. The box office was $ 79,817,937, making it the eighth largest earner of 1986, but since the 1980s have disappeared from memory, it has become the thing to deny Eddie Murphy's comedy awards that they actually once had. The Golden Kid is not pleased with Murphy's more-accepted 80s imagery, such as Trading Places and Beverly Hills Cop, but when I revisited the movie recently, I find him Murphy in his wisecracking, witty and charming best !, seriously! Contains. > <br /> With a fantasy action formula reinvigorated by Raiders Of The Lost Ark in 1981, The Golden Child hits all the required genre buttons. Pretty girl, daring reluctant with a joke in his armory, penetrating villain {Charles Dance so English, I could kiss him myself}, wonderful colors and a sweet kid with mystical powers, the movie just encourages you to join in the fun, not to analyze and divert its value as a cranial fantasy image. Yes, the CGI daemon looks very crisp now, and yes, the genre had far better pictures in the '80s,' 90s, and beyond, but really, if you agree with the shameful rating of 5 here on this site, then take this one Genre maybe a little serious, seriously 7/10
