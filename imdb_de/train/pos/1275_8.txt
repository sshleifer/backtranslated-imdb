I found this movie charming. I thought the characters had been developed because I took care of these people. This is a piece that I believe occurred during the Depression. A single mother known as the city's recluse (she has a reason to be) makes an ad in the newspaper for "a husband". Christopher Reeve plays an ex-con who comes to town looking for work. He sees the ad and walks out to see her. She hires him. I really had some giggles when their relationship progressed because I found it easy to put myself in their shoes. Everything went on so naturally. He needs the work so he does not want to upset her. And she needs his help, but does not want him to get the upper hand. They dance around the fact that they really need each other. Things are starting to warm up ...... the big explosion. I will not spoil it if I tell you what happens. But the point of view of the resolution is absolutely wonderful. I found the story very believable for the time it takes place. I think that's one of the better "relationship stories" out there. Maybe the younger generation will not "understand" it, but if you're over 40, you'll like it. And if you liked Christopher Reeve in "Somewhere in Time," you'll like him in this case as well.
