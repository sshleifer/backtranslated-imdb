There are far too many subjects that are avoided in the cinema, and eating disorders are part of it. This movie shows it as it is. It is not glamorous for the audience, it is shown with true truth, which makes it all the more powerful. I've only seen it once, and that was a few years ago, but I still remember everything and how I felt. It is a very powerful film and good support for anyone suffering from an eating disorder to give them the will to stop. That's what films should be about - they should be there to help people, not what's wrong.
