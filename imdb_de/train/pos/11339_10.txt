Anyone who has experienced the horrors of divorce will empathize with the protagonist of this indie film, a scared little boy who thinks a zombie is hiding in his closet. Does Jake (a fascinating Anthony DeMarco) simply translate the trauma of two contentious parents into an understandable picture? Or could the creature be real? Writer / director Shelli Ryan carefully balances both options and lets the audience guess. Their choice of using a setting - a suburban home - adds to the feeling of desperation and claustrophobia. <br /> <br /> Brooke Bloom and Peter Sean Bridgers convince as angry but loving parents. However, there are the creepy minor characters, Mrs. Bender (Barbara Gruen), an intrepid babysitter, and Sam Stone (Ben Bode), a grim real estate agent who lingers in the head. Jake's Closet is a darkly inspired portrait of childhood as a special kind of hell.
