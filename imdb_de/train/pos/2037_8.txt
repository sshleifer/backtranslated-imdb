Christopher Smith is an obvious horror fan and this is evident in his debut horror movie 'Creep'. Although "Creep" is somewhat relaxed with information, it turns out to be a true bloody classic. Slightly less brilliant than the recent horrors of the US (Amityville Horror Remake, House of Wax Remake) follows this dark and cruel story of Kate (Franka Potente) through the maze of underground tunnels and disused railroads while she and several others are traveling. try to escape a murderous attacker. Although some bad reviews have shown this film, I really believe that "Creep" on a tight budget and for a British production of the first-time director Smith really lives up to his name. It provides more or less frenzied action right from the beginning, sometimes too fast, as the story is patchy in some areas, but with a perfect location and the best character reaction I've seen in a long time, 'Creep' delivers some scenes definitely the nightmare.
