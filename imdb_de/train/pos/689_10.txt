Maybe I will identify with this movie because I live in NYC and suffer from bad insomnia. to do what she did without a budget ... wow, that's all I can say. really good as if no money had been spent on this movie and it still blew me away. I would definitely recommend trying it if you can. great direction, fantastic score and of course a script that beats your ass. see it
