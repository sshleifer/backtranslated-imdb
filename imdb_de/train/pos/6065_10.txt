This movie is awful - in a way how bad it is good. <br /> <br /> The plot has been reworked by so many other films of this kind that I do not even deal with the description. It's a sword / sorcery image, a kid hopes to see how important he is in this world, has a "nomadic" adventurer, a bad aide / sorcerer, a princess, a hairy creature ... you got the point , <The first time I caught this movie was during a harsh winter. I do not know why I decided to watch another five minutes before the channel was turned, but when I took the place of Gulfax, I decided to stay until the end and watch it. <br /> <br /> Gulfax is a white, furry creature that resembles Chewbacca but is not nearly as useful or entertaining to look at. He looks like someone has stuck a pile of white carpets together and forced the actor to wear it. There are scenes in which it looks like the actor can not move or he almost falls over. Although he is not that much in the movie, the few scenes are worth it! Watch as he tries to talk to Bo Svenson and bring the comparisons between solo and chewbacca to an even higher level! <br /> <br /> I just bought this movie because of this character and still have it somewhere! <br /> <br /> Gulfax may look like shit, but he made this movie !!! The only reason I never saw or even searched the sequel was because of his absence! Should there be a graduation film that concludes the trilogy, Gulfax will make a much anticipated return!
