Based on the preview I saw, I went to "Shower" and expected a sweet little comedy. What I found was a deeply moving drama of family life that was seen in some of the most lavish photographic shots I've ever seen. Later, I also appreciated the abrupt cuts from earlier scenes (in the arid landscape of northern China and the Tibet Plateau): does memory often work? In one moment I'm here, the next I'm in a landscape from the past, just like that .... <br /> <br /> I would not only highly recommend this film, I would also put it under the two or three of the best movies I've seen in my 60 years. <br /> <br /> By the way: Some years ago in the US another Asian "comedy" was called "Shall We Dance?" (Japanese). As with "Shower," the preview did not give the slightest indication of the depth of this film, which turned out to be a subtle psychological study (albeit full of fun moments). Are distributors scared that movies appear too "important" or "too deep" to appeal to viewers outside the US?
