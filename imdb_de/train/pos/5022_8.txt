Frailty - 8/10 - It's a non-sensitive title and the caption "Bill Paxton Directs" aside. This is a pretty good old fashioned rip that snorts the biblical horror thriller. In the end, it may just be the incarnated Southern Gothic cousin of Kubrick's "The Shining" - but hey, that's a damn entertaining idea. It also has a bit of a plot twist ... and a very ambiguous moral message. This is the kind of movie that people will capture in the late evening hours with a simple cable and scare the bee jesus watching the movie. Too bad that director Bill Paxton had to enroll himself as a star ... well ... still a hell of a good rent.
