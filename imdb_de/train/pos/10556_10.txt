I was not sure what to expect, but I'm glad I saw that. A clever, slightly twisted comedy that makes you think. I was not sure how a director could do "nothing", but leave it to Mr. Natali and the brilliant personalities of C.O.R.E. to create another low budget that looks real (as real as anything can be). Worth your time and money, if you have the opportunity to see this, please go. You will not regret it.
