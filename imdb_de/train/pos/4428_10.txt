I absolutely do not have to agree with the other comment on this movie. The visual effects complement the supernatural themes of the film and have no negative impact on the plot. Also, I loved how this move was unlike Crouching Tiger, because this time the sword action had no strings and most of the time you can see the action up close. <br /> <br /> I think the western audience will be very confused with two scenes. One of them involves a monk trying to burn himself and the other about the villagers who say this is the end of the world. These scenes are derived from certain interpretations of Mahayana Buddhism (Mahayana Buddhism can be found in China, Korea, and Japan) and the other scene deals with a peculiarity in the Japanese calendar ... People really thought then that the world Coming to an end ... Gojoe has the action, story and visuals to captivate every viewer. I am firmly convinced that he can be sold with some skill in the US. My only complaint is in the last fight scene (I can not reveal anything - sorry).
