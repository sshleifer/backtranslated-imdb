When I saw this for the first time, we borrowed it from our local library about a year ago and looked at it about 3 times. We just saw it again and I liked MORE than the last time I saw it !! :) :() <br /> <br /> The movie is mainly about two dogs called Charlie and Itchy (spoken by Dom DeLuise and I love Dom DeLuise!). Charlie is half a gangster and half a goodie, which I like. Itchy is his buddy. Charlie is (NOT) killed by his friend and sent to heaven. When Charlie is brought back to life, this is the beginning of an amazing adventure. <br /> <br /> The five main reasons why I am absolutely CRAZY about this movie: First: I love the characters (except Carface). My favorite three are Charlie, Itchy and a little girl named Anne-Marie, who comes a little later. Two: I love the time of the story in which this movie plays. It is set during the ban in the United States. Three: The Don Bluth animation is (as usual) excellent. The backgrounds are good too. Fourth, in this film, there is a strange excitement that keeps me on the edge of the seat. Fifth: The songs are lovely. My favorite song starts with "I need Brazil, the throbbing, the thrill" ... <br /> <br /> So watch this beautiful movie, if you can, you will not be disappointed! :);) :()
