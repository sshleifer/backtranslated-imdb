Why should you see that? There are certainly no reasons why you should not see it! Gray Gardens was a great and amusing director of Albert and David Maysles. Originally intended to be a film about East Hampton's gentrification, Gray Gardens found it would be more interesting to make a study of the eccentric life of the two, Edith Bouvier Beales, the aunt and cousin of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis , Her life was certainly an amusing one (Edith spent most of the day in bed and singing operas, Edie played pirouettes and majorette dances with her many cats, one was Ted Z. Kennedy) The movie is interesting because it's funny and sad - Edith died shortly after the film's release (in February 1977) at the age of 82, after experiencing some of the celebrities she and Edie received after the film (she danced and sang in a nightclub.) Edie Beale Jr was born in 1925 and Still living in Miami Beach, this movie is captivating and intriguing at the same time.
