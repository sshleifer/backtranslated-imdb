Ok, in the beginning it looked like "Shrek" - the loner who follows the comic relief persistently. Then it develops into something really compelling when the glove is set. And the result is an entertaining movie whose moments I agree with are a bit too dramatic for kids (like Manny's past, for example). Obviously, the premise has been worked on for a long time, so they will be able to create a movie with almost no other sets (just ice caps and stones) and three characters. It's a good thing to know that they manage to make something emotional out of it. As I said, sometimes it can tinkle into tears, so children, be warned. The real flop is the animation. This was not as mixed as the Toy Story movies or Shrek, and that shows it. People are unrealistic and we've seen better examples of CGI. But do not let the record spoil you: "Ice Age" is praiseworthy as a solo attempt. And it will gather a lot of fans, I have no doubt. Oh and yes, the moments with this little mouse are priceless and steal.
