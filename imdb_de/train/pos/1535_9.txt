Luckily for several years I have been able to see "Diagnosis Murder". Basically it is a doctor who solves murders with the help of his LAPD son, a young doctor and a pathologist. DM provided 8 seasons of exceptional entertainment. What distinguished it from the many other police performances and worth seeing several times was the cast and quality of the writing. The main cast did well, and Dick Van Dyke's entertainer roots shone with magic, dance and humor. The best thing about DM was the fast pace, the funny scripts and of course the score. Unfortunately it was unfairly compared to "Murder, She Wrote". DM is far superior and offers more difficult puzzles and more variety. Now it's gone TV is a worse place. Gone are the days of feel-good family shows. Now there is simply depressing "gloomy".
