The rich alcoholic Robert Stack falls in love with the secretary Lauren Bacall. He marries her and is so happy that he stops drinking. However, Bacall is secretly loved by Stacks best friend, Rock Hudson. And Stacks nymphomaniac sister Dorothy Malone wants to rock. Throw some complications, and the movie will get out of control (in a good way). Very shiny movie in beautiful technicolor with breathtaking fashion and decor (check out the hotel room of Bacall at the beginning). Everyone looks perfect and dresses in beautiful, figure-hugging clothing. Basically, this is a soap opera with production levels of level A. The story itself is great fun and some dialogues at the beginning are hilariously exaggerated. The acting of Hudson, Stack and Bacall is not so good, but seeing her so young and glamorous is great ... especially Stack ... when he smiled, my knees went weak. Dorothy Malone, on the other hand, is fantastic - she deservedly won the best supporting actress for her role. She is sexy, violent, vicious and sympathetic ... all convincing. <br /> <br /> Fun, shiny garbage. Do not miss it!
