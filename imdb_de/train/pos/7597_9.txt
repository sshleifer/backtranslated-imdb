Lost has something interesting for everyone. You can say a lot about this series, and a lot has been said, so I will not be the one to put it all back for you. Just read the people who loved it and you know why you want to see it. The beauty of this series is that it is completely new. There are not many films - and even fewer - series based on the theme of "excitement", but Lost lives the theme with pride. It's about the inexplicable, and if you combine that with an exotic location, beautiful twists, great cast, and good format (combining present and past in separate episodes), you'll have a series in which each episode has a story about it but part of a bigger story. You want to have all the insights of the characters, you want to see the big picture, and you want to know where the authors lead you. The result is that it's a series that will not let you go. More skeptical, the series went down a bit in season two, probably because of its own success. It is known that Lost was originally written for only one season, and when the overwhelming success followed, the authors were overwhelmed. In my opinion, they have made the mistake of adding more mysteries in the second season and releasing them at a higher tempo than solving (or at least partially) the ones of the first season. At the end of the second season, you ended up with a big blur of secrets, plot twists, and inexplicable phenomena, but there's only so much that a viewer can accept. The difference between Season 2 and 3, however, was enormous. In the third season, many findings were distributed, in part to replace them with new questions. And that's how they should write; They want to jump from one plot spin to the next, avoid a tsunami of secrets and then get some to explain to the audience. They have the third season and bring us a promising future series for the fourth season. It is good to see that such a format of a series can be so enormously popular.
