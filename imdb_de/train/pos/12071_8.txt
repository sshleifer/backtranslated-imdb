Nicolas Roeg's projects are variable to say the least, but interesting at the same time. Insignificance is obviously first and foremost an adapted stage set: it is verbose and quite "space bound". BUT, it pays to watch this movie more than once: the underlying themes are not presented openly, and it also takes a while to adapt to the juxtaposition and role reversal of the four protagonists: Einstein, McCarthy, Munroe and DiMaggio. <br /> <br /> Einstein is plagued by guilt over Hiroshima, but seems to be the simplicity of a sexual connection with Munro; Munro, tired of being seen as a Bimbo, yearns for intellectual credibility; Senator McCarthy is at the height of his witch-hunt forces, but he's an impotent sleazebag. DiMaggio is uncertain about his celebrity, selfish and vulnerable to violence. Each of them contains the seed of its own destruction. Every character has a restless, abused / abusive past and a questionable future. Gradually, we see that obsession itself is the central theme. America's obsession with the cultural icons and customs of the post-war era; The obsessions of the protagonists for something that no one can have: peace and / or happiness. <br /> <br /> Compared with the Theory of Relativity, a proposed unit field theory, and indeed the cosmos itself. All aspirations and interactions of the protagonists of Roeg seem insignificant. But these aspects of the physical universe (it's all quantum, trust me!) Influence us when applied to the development of the means of destruction. Monroe's mention of the principle of the neutron bomb (without naming it as such) is not an anachronism per se, but can only be understood by a contemporary public. ALL references within the script are only accessible to a knowledgeable observer: a 1950s author / personality cell and how they affect us in the 21st century. <br /> <br /> This film and its script are either very, very smart or extremely opaque and overbearing. Ultimately, however, probably insignificant. <br /> <br /> live long and prosperous :) <br /> <br />
