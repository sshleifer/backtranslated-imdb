Tenshu is detained and sentenced to death. If he survives the electrocution, the government officials give him the choice of either higher electric shock or some experimentation. He chooses the experiment and is taken to a large metal cell with a nasty criminal who survived the electric shock. They can have everything they want in the room, but they can not go. After a few days, meals are reduced to one per day and room temperature is set to 100. After a few more alarms, an alarm sounds at regular intervals so that they can not sleep. One day a "witch" enters her cell (albeit a glazed portion). What happens next, I'll let you find out. I may be in the minority, but I liked the structure, it fascinated me. If the payout was half as good as building, I would have rated it that much higher. <br /> <br /> My degree: C + <br /> <br /> Media Blaster 2 DVD Set Extras: Disc 1) Director's Cut; Trailer for "Versus", "Aragami", "Attack the Gas Station" and "Deadly Outlaw Rekka" Disc 2) Theatrical Version; Commentary with Hideo Sakaki, Ryuhei Kitamura, Sakaguchi Taku and Tsutomu Takahashi; Cast and crew interview; Making of; Original trailer; and promo teasers
