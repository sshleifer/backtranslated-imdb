I've always been a big fan of this movie. First, you saw the cast. The acting is great and contributes to the fact that this film is developing very well. Cybill Shepherd received great reviews for her role and they were well deserved. The beginning of this film begins in the past, when Corinne Jeffries (Cybill), whose perfect wedding comes when her husband Louie dies unexpectedly. Fortunately, Louse gets a second shot when he agrees to be "recycled" as a newborn, Alex Finch (Robert Downey, JR). Alex lives his new life and forgets his past life while Corinne tries to move on with her life. But fate crosses Alex's path 23 years later, when he meets Corinne's daughter Miranda (Mary Stuart Masterson) and is suddenly inundated with a plethora of unwanted memories (fun and embarrassing situations begin here.) The music is great and the scenes are Heart felt and very sweet. You will not be disappointed if you give him a chance. You will probably like it. Very funny and cute!
