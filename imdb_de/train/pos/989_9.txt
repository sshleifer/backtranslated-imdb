Both my friend and I found the movie well done. We expected a carefree comedy, but got an action movie with funny ideas. We both thought that this movie did not do so well at the box office because the previews make us believe that it's a comedy. I was impressed by the supporting actors and of course Dave Morse always brings a terrific acting job. Most of the cast are veterans, not beginners, and they were solid. We both agreed that the writing and direction were first-rate, and commented on each other that they were buying this movie. If you do not buy, rent it for a good time.
