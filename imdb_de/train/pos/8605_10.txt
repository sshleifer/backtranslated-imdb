Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy play a starring role in this "modern" musical that features MacDonald's comic skills. Surreal 1940's musical seems to mock the fashions of the 1940s, even if they're trendy. Sensational costumes and sets (yes B & W) contribute to the surreal, dreamlike quality of the entire film. Several good songs enliven the movie, with the "Twinkle in Your Eye" number being an absolute highlight, including a fun jitterbug number between MacDonald and Binnie Barnes. Also in the HUGE line-up are Edward Everett Horton, Reginal Owen, Mona Maris, Douglas Dumbrille and Anne Jeffreys. Also on display are pieces by Esther Dale, Almira Sessions, Grace Hayle, Gertrude Hoffman, Rafaela Ottiano, Odette Myrtle, Cecil Cunningham and many others in their Jitterbug / Vamp routines. She could do anything.
