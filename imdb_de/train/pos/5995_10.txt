I'm not sure if it was right or wrong, but I read the other comments before watching the short films. I have to say that I did not agree with most of the negative comments or problems that people had with them. <br /> <br /> Like "Lone Wolf" director / producer for the first time, I like to see things that I can strive for, not necessarily by the pros, but by people who like me get wet with my feet. <br /> <br /> If this is the case even by a first-timer, as I've read, I applaud the effort. Wonderful work then in this regard! There were a few comments about the music. I thought it was pretty nice for the piece. Somehow it is said that it threatened for a while, but I found that tension is produced without us being aware of it, and when he pulled out the music gun and the guitar started to chop chords. It was as if we knew there was a train on the tracks, but you could tell it was moving. Yes, there is a 180 degree slip / clip in there, but Shi * happens. Has anyone else seen Hugh's dirty shirt turn white in "Australia" (near the end, in the rain)? See how much money and people were behind this movie! Give the child a break for God's sake! All in all, I think it was done very well. Only two things that I have mentioned are hardly worth mentioning. Do not go with the camera to a shiny brass picture frame, and I would have shown the splatter just as a still image at the beginning of a still shot, so people would not necessarily do that. I know what it is. <br /> <br /> My previous experience has taught me that making a film is not difficult. It just takes time to learn how to do it and then the time to actually do it. and then you should take some time to think about all the details you need to have recorded before you use "Postproduction Time!" call. In my opinion, director / writer Ryan Jafri has done his homework and if this is really his first certificate card, I would give him an "A". The rest of you will contact the management for a while.
