When I heard that Patrick Swayze had finally returned to KING SOLOMON'S MINES for his acting career, I was very excited. I had expected a great action adventure of the type Indiana Jones. What I got was a 4-hour epic (with commercials) that was very slow. The second and third hour could have dropped completely and the story would not have suffered. The end was good (no spoilers here), but I still wanted more. All a guy can do is take the plunder that Swayze makes "RoadHouse 2" so he can go back to the action genre that made him famous. Until then, if you are a fan of King Solomon's Mines, then read the book or watch the 1985 version with Richard Chamberlain and Sharon Stone, which is also not very good, but only an hour and forty minutes of your life instead of 4 hours has passed.
