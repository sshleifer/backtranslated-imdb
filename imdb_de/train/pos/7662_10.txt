It was way above average for B movies (I warn the reader now that I could reveal certain key elements of the plot or other parts of the movie, though I try to minimize this tendency). The sequels are usually great (despite a cookie-cutter approach that tries to copy certain elements of the original movie verbiage), despite this sometimes boring tendency, it seemed that this particular movie would work as long as the viewer did could separate his attention from comparisons with the original "scanners." <br /> <br /> The film was similar to the "Superman" series in terms of the character's description of his early childhood and his relationship with his parents ( which was apparently modeled on the Kents in the "Superman" stories) and the theme of a morally pure hero with extraordinary powers from early childhood, etc. The depiction of deep feelings of alienation from wondrous or otherwise not fitting children, adolescents, and / or Adult was an issue that attracted me to movies like "Real Genius" and (to a more superficial degree) "Doctor Mordr id "and hit a particularly strong chord. <br /> <br /> The movie had a positive message, and it was fun to watch. I found some of the insights and accuracy (relating to the depiction of certain aspects of paranormal experiences) fascinating and sometimes deeply touching. These moments occasionally appeared among all the great formula-driven bats and unsatisfactory sex (in this case sexuality, since the sexual elements were tastefully done) and the violence that B-movies (or Shakespearian dramas for that matter! ) So much fun watching! <br /> <br /> This is a must for all comic, sci-fi, remote viewing and horror fans! With the right exposure in the right circles, the film could develop a cult with the original "scanners".
