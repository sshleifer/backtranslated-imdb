This is an excellent musical with a timeless score of one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice Parisian atmosphere that gives the movie a lot of charm, but in terms of a story. Or at least not worked out very well. The play is not so smooth by Caron. But I liked some dialogues, I liked the scene on the Seine, I liked the character Levant played, the colors; and dancing, of course, which is pretty great. <br /> <br /> A 7.5 - 8 appears to me in a nutshell.
