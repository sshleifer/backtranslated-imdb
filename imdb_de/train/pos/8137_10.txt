If you like CB4, you do not know what you will miss if you have not seen this movie yet. This movie is crazy funny and contains much more about the hip hop industry than any other spoof movie ... It is unfortunate that this movie was not released on DVD has a copy loved and wanted. If you really want a good laugh and like hip-hop and know a few old-school artists, you can definitely rent this movie. There are not so many video stores that have copies of it, but if you find one, you will not be disappointed.
