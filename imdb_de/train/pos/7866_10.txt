PAGE 3 **** of 4 stars <br /> <br /> Madhvi (Konkona Sen) enters her friend's house and is empty. She looks here and there and then goes to his bedroom and you get the picture - 'Ah! another girl ?? this two-timing villain and yes, he does have his two timings, but this time it's a guy. And I say 'Brilliant!' <br /> <br /> END OF THE SPOILER (The scene above is really not a spoiler ... but for me it was like that I did not want to take a chance). <br /> <br /> Asked what this movie should look like, my friend replied, "Oh, it's just an exposÃ© of the P3 people," which made me think I saw a stupid movie, if not more. When I went to the theater, I thought to myself, "I'd better get a pen and a paper to write down the bad things about this movie," but I proved to be completely wrong? and then some because I could only raise the goods. This movie was great. Great, not because it's an unconventional and non-commercial cinema like a storyline, but because of the script's cleverness and how this movie shows you how to brilliantly handle a movie that would be a stupid and pointless movie if given in the wrong hands /> <br /> Konkona Sen Sharma is grace. She is so damn beautiful that she nailed her role perfectly, as if she had been born to play that role. One of the most charming actresses I have ever seen. But that's not the only performance that's good in the movie. There are Sandhya Mridul, Boman Irani and Atul Kulkarni. Especially Sandhya Mridul, who is just starting up the screen. (And guess what even the uncommonly accented Tara Sharma usually speaks.) <br /> <br /> The films play with some stupid old parties of the hush-hush celebrities of the film industry, among others, and you get the idea what it is Movie will be about. And for about half an hour through the movie, you're almost the same. But then the movie sets the pace to record a good action and never lets it go. Even Boman Irani agrees with this statement? "It was a good story, Madhvi." (Many Thanks). The great thing is that it addresses the question of how stupid these people are in style and can not bring it to an end. In addition, the social problems are addressed and they do not get boring. In the end everything is a rollercoaster ride and Madhvi informs us by smiling at all these people. The reason why I like watching movies. Ecstatic film production. The script is beautiful, smart and funny.
