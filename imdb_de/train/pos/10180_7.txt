Indian directors have a hard time. They have to compete with films like Laggan, in which eleven mottled, neutered men defend their village, and half of them are certifiable idiots. "Devdas", an unfortunate, fed foreign return that has been forgotten and characters walk in endless corridors that do not take into account the feelings or feelings of a human being - unfortunately, they live in an artful misery of red tapestry and pageant. But to make a good movie, you'll have to take a walk through the rope to appease the frontbenchers, who are the quintessential rogues fascinated by split skirts and dishum dishum fights, preferably with a top-notch Bollywood. who is reasonably pretty. So you can get in touch with a director who wants to tell a story of Leonine's village head, who in his own words defended his village as a violent movie or too male for a male audience. There are very few actors who can convey anger and pathos, such as Nana Patekar (Narasimhan). Nana Patekar lets you go to his courtyard and watch him robbing and mocking the politician as his faithful admirers burst laughter at every satire word thrown at him while his daughter bathes his grandson. This is an authentic scene that you can experience in rural India. Nana Patekar is the essential actor belonging to the old drama school, which is a disappearing breed in Hindi Films. The depicted violence is a complicated part of storytelling, where Song & Dances are used for the gazers, without which the films are not sold, a sad but true state. This changes faster for "Bollywood" better. All said and done, that's a good movie.
