This show was fabulous. It was complicated and well written and all the characters were sympathetic, without being terribly sweet. Even Jonathan Cake, the nimble friend, was sympathetic. Since our airwaves are filled with crap like American Idol and Dancing with the Stars, it was nice to see a drama that did not look like a soap opera. It was always fascinating to see how each character was related to the next circumstance. It's really annoying that we finally get a show that makes you think a bit and throws you out of the game for a mysterious number that most of us ignore. Some of us are not sheep. This show may not be missed by many people, but by some quite loyal fans.
