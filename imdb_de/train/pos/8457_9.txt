Gundam Wing is a good anime for me. Slightly slow (especially in the middle of the series), but overall pleasing. Now before anyone jumps on my case and calls me a "winger", I have to admit that I've looked at all original Gundam, Gundam 0080 and 0083, the 08 MS Team and Gundam SEED. <br /> <br /> I admit that there were some story issues and some characters seem to be "rip off" (ie Zech's Marquise to the original Gundam's Char), but this is an alternate universe show hosted on the Original series based. as SEED. <br /> <br /> If you want to see this show, make sure you first see the Gundam original and then know that you are watching an AU series.
