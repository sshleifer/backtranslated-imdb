Wang Bianlian is an old street artist known as the "King of Masks" because he masters the art of Sichuan change. Liang is a famous opera artist of Sichuan art and respects Wang as an artist and as a person. Liang worries that a valuable art should not die with Wang, and he sows the seed of an heir in Wang's mind. The film is about prejudice, male dominance, state of the art, values ​​and above all heat. <br /> <br /> I can not recommend this movie enough. The whole movie is in loops. Everything has a meaning. It's a long story that has been edited so well that the length of the movie is just 91 minutes. A total satisfaction. It's an artistic film for five minutes, the next five minutes a sad movie, the next five minutes a thriller. It just always changes his mood, as if his protagonist is changing his face. Last scene on the rope is phenomenal. History and script are flawless. Actors are brilliant. Both protagonists are artists, where you can see how they occurred. Very impressive. It was not even nominated for an Oscar. This year the "English patient" received the best film Oscar and in the foreign film category "Kolya". "Kolya" was just fine and the less the better said "English patient". See it 9/10.
