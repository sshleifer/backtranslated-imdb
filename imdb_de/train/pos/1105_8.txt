The residents of Manhattan must accept all sorts of inconvenience. The worst thing is the lack of storage space! Some people who go out to eat constantly use their stovetops and dishwashers as storage because the cabinets are already full! Melvin Frank and Norman Panama, a great comedy writing team from that time, saw the potential in Eric Hodgins' novel, whose hero Jim Blandings can not stand the tight quarters in which he and his wife, Muriel, and two daughters have to share. Jim Blandings, a Madison Avenue. Executive, has had it! When he sees an ad for Connecticut Living, he decides to take a look. Obviously, Jim, who is the first owner, will be persuaded by the real estate man to buy the run-down house, which he is to have inspected by an unscrupulous agent. This is just the beginning of his problems. <br /> <br /> Whatever might be wrong goes awry. The architect is asked to submit a plan that does not work for the new house after the original house was destroyed. As one problem leads to another, more money is needed, and whatever the initial cost would be, ends up in an inflated price that Jim could not really afford. <br /> <br /> The movie is fun with three principals in it. Cary Grant was an actor who clearly understood the character he was playing and made the most of Jim Blanding's. Myrna Loy was a delightful actress who always played successfully against Mr. Grant. The third character, Bill Cole, an old friend of Myrna, a lawyer for the Blandings, is polite and polite as Melvin Douglas portrayed him. One of Blanding's girls, Joan, is played by Sharyn Moffett, who had an eerie resemblance to Eva Marie Saint. The great Louise Beavers plays Gussie, but does not have much to do. <br /> <br /> The film is lovingly photographed by James Wong Howe, who clearly knew what to do to make this movie look much better. The direction of H.C. Potter is light and has managed to inspire this movie, which will delight fans of classic comedy.
