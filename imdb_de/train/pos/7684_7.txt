Read all comments are very exciting. But can someone please tell me the name of the real artist, who painted the pictures for the good airtime? I realize that everyone refers to j.j. As an artist in the family, however, there was a real family that has the right artist, and he has not received any credit in this regard. So, if you do not mind if someone can say the name of the real artist, I would also like to say "well done" to him. I know this is true for the GOOD TIMES cast, but do not you agree that he touched our hearts as well? I would like to know if he is still painting or if he is still alive. I would like to have some of his work at my house.
