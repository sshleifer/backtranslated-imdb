Wrestlemania 14 is not often considered one of the great wrestlemanias, but I would personally put it in my top 5 if not in the top 3. It has so many great things and really meant the birth of The Attitude Era WWE's best time in my opinion. HBK has the heart of a lion, and as he set about Austin on his way to Austin, his class lesson was pure. It has one of the hottest crowds you'll ever see and it has J.R and The King at their best! <br /> <br /> matches. <br /> <br /> 15 ?? Team Battle Royal LOUD Pop for the return of L.O.D. I'm not a fan of Battle Royal, and this is still an average one. Very predictable, even if you see it first, it is obvious that L.O.D would win. A look at Sunny for about 8 minutes is definitely helpful. <br /> <br /> 2/5 <br /> <br /> WWF Light Heavyweight Championship <br /> <br /> Taka Michinoku | C | Vs Aguila. <br /> <br /> Taka gets a surprising pop with his performance. Fast, soaring and very exciting. If these two had more time, they would surely have torn down the roof with their belongings. Taka wins with the Michinoku driver. <br /> <br /> 3 1/2 / 5 <br /> <br /> WWF European Championship. <br /> <br /> Triple H | C | Against Owen Hart's claim here is, Chyna is tied up with the Slaughter. Nice pop for Owen, mixed reaction for trips. A truly underrated game that is actually one of my favorites for Wrestlemania. The two got mixed up very well and Owen can go with everyone. Trips wins with Chyna interference. <br /> <br /> 4/5 <br /> <br /> Mixed Tag Match. Marc Mero & Sable vs. Goldust & Luna. Defining pop for Sable has never been there for this woman. Sable actually looks hot and the crowd just eats them up! Constant sable songs that break out almost every time she enters the ring. Not bad for a mixed-day match, it had entertaining antics and passed the time well. Sable's team wins when Sable reaches the TKO. <br /> <br /> 2 1/2 / 5 <br /> <br /> WWF Intercontinental Championship. Ken Shamrock against the Rock | C |. Before discussing the match, I'd like to say that The Rock has shown its enormous potential with his interview with Jennifer Flowers before his match. Nice pop for shamrock, big heat for The Rock. Too disappointingly short, and I found the end somehow stupid, although Shamrock's crunchy antics were great and the crowd went crazy. Rock retains the title when The Ref reverses the decision. <br /> <br /> 2/5 <br /> <br /> Dumpster Match for The WWF Tag Team Championship <br /> <br /> Catcus Jack & Terry Funk vs. The New Age Outlaws. The outlaws are not as past as they were at that time. Crowd is actually a bit dead, but I thought it had some great hardcore tracks with some sick-looking bumps. Cactus and Terry win the title in the end. <br /> <br /> 3/5 <br /> <br /> The Undertaker vs. Kane. Great time ovations for The Undertaker. Much better than Wrestlemania 20, and for a match between big men and big men this was really good. It was a great brawl, and the Undertaker took a sick-looking thrust through the table. WWE was smart in making Kane strong, even through defeat. After two tombstone kick-outs, Taker finally puts him away with a third. <br /> <br /> 3 1/2 / 5 <br /> <br /> WWF Championship. <br /> <br /> Special Guest Enforcer "Mike Tyson" <br /> <br /> HBK | C | Against Steve Austin. Great heat for Tyson. Crowd goes to Austin, definitely one of the biggest pops I've ever heard. Mixed reaction for HBK. This is really a special match, one of the biggest wrestlemania main events in history. One can say when J.R is even out of breath. HBK is giving everything that was supposed to be his last game, and Austin was rarely better. The animosity and the flow of the crowd are incredible and it is as exciting as it gets. Austin wins with the Stunner, Tyson joins 3:16 by defeating Michaels. The solemn victory of Austin is a miracle, with one of the most curious onlookers you'll ever see, King has said it right, they were crazy. <br /> <br /> Final effect. Wrestlemania 14 is one of the best for reality. It has everything you want in a Wrestlemania, and the Attitude Era has really started. This is something special for me because it was the first Wrestlemania I saw in 98. "The Austin era has begun!" <br /> <br /> 9 1/2 / 10
