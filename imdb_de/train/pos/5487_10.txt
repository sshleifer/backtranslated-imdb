You have never seen anything like it. Once the coup starts, this is the most dazzling thriller you'll ever see - even though you know the outcome. And it's all real, because it's a documentary - amazing. <br /> <br /> When it was over, it was on my top 10 list of All Time Great Movies. <br /> <br /> Ignore the far-right fanatics. Everyone I know who saw this movie gets the 4 star rating. Even if you are not interested in politics or Venezuelan politics, you become nervous and - believe it - on the edge of your seat. It's a roller coaster ride.
