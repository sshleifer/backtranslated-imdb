Great movie - I loved it. Great editing and use of the soundtrack. Capture the true feeling of Indian life, yet we can all be connected. A well chosen cast with some great characters. The movie develops all the characters so that you really care about everyone and you feel they know them. The use of Indian music and drums in some of the football scenes is great and the direction really works as everyone appears as real and natural. You just can not help but root for Jess in this movie! The acting was really good, even the tomboyische course and the posture of the two main actresses are as someone who has played a lot of football, very convincing.
