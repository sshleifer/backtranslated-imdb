This is a film about deep and unspoken human relationships. <br /> <br /> Finally they are spoken, but there is a possibility to change something about the situation. <br /> <br /> Originally made in Shanghai in 1948 and without propaganda, the film introduces us to the Dai family. There is still some weight in the history that surrounds the family. The story usually has weight in Chinese literature and in serious films. A young couple - Liyan, an invalid, and his wife Yuwen live in a formerly large family complex, which is partially ruined. A bright contrast is Liyan's young sister, who does not really remember the family's past, but in a very natural way accepted. Her mind is as bright as the other two, who are reserved. <br /> <br /> In this seemingly stable world comes an unexpected visitor ... <br /> <br /> I ended up feeling pretty sad - but definitely a superior movie.
