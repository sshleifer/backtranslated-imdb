"Hot Millions" is a delightful comedy enhanced by the presence of the wonderful cast composed for them. The film is a tribute to the genius of Peter Ustinov, who wrote the screenplay and appears as a key figure of an enterprising embezzler. The film, directed by Eric Till, shows no sign of dating anyone else from that time so terribly. <br /> <br /> At the heart of the action is a friendly man, Marcus Pendleton, who, before being released from jail, sets the income tax forms for the director, who is surprised at the government's reimbursement. Marcus, who is a genius in numbers, sees opportunities where others would not. He's starting to work for a company that uses the latest computer for his accounting, but Pendleton is a resourceful man who finds a way to use the system and set up various false accounts in different parts of the continent. <br /> <br /> Marcus is assigned a secretary who also happens to have an apartment in his building. The incompetent Patty works as a bus driver, bringing everything in disorder. It's incomprehensible how she gets a job as a secretary, but in the office it's never the same when the creepy Willard Gnatpole decides to follow her, but not to be afraid, Patty's heart belongs to Marcus, who is a pianist is a flutist and they do together nice music. <br /> <br /> The best thing about the film is Peter Ustinov. He clearly understood how Marcus should be played and runs away with the movie. Mr. Ustinov gives a safe report about the embezzler. The excellent Maggie Smith is also in her best shape when it comes to Patty, the friendly woman whom Marcus loves and who proves herself to be a genius when it comes to investing the money she puts in Marcus pockets. <br /> <br /> Karl Malden is perfect as a responsible American. Bob Newhart also appears as Gnatpole, the man who desires Patty, but can not make her retaliate. The wonderful Robert Morley is seen as Caesar Smith, whose identity Marcus adopted. Cesar Romero also appears as a cameo role as airport inspector. <br /> <br /> "Hot Millions" will delight anyone looking for a fun time in the company of this unappetizing but charming character of Marcus Pendleton.
