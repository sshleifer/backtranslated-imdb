This film is all about subtlety and the difficulty of moving around the ever-changing boundaries of morals, race relations and desires. Granted, it's not a movie for everyone. There are no chases, no buildings that explode, no murders. The drama is in the tension, which is suggested by looks, minimal gestures, spatial boundaries, lighting and things that are sometimes very unnoticed unnoticed. It's about identity, memory, community, belonging. The different parts of the film work together to reinforce the leitmotifs of self and other, identity, desire, limitations and loss. It will reward the attentive and sensitive viewer. It will displease those whose palates require explosive, massive, spicy actions. It's a beautifully filmed human story. That's all.
