This series was exactly what you would expect from Mr. Spielberg. It's really one of those horrible, funny, childish shows that you will not forget. Just like Outer Limits (another great show) makes this little series, which does not do much. It was great and deserves to run longer. It was a great show even children could see, though some of the shows were a bit scary when they wanted it, but in the end everyone had a moral (like the Twilight Zone) that made them see the situation do not land there or those that you did. I remember looking at some of them in the sci-fi movie when I was 10, and even now I still enjoy seeing them when I can. Truly a funny, imaginative show. I loved it and still do it.
