While this movie will not go down in the records of a major movie theater, spending a year and a half with the family is a fun way to spend it. The film is finally released in a video in which he should have actually debuted. The film is about a diverse group of friends gathering for a dinner they called "The Hungry Bachelors Club". Jorja Fox plays a woman who serves as a substitute to receive a deposit for the restaurant she wants to open. Bill Nunn plays a Cadillac-loving mystery man who becomes her lover. Fox offers a subtle and touching performance and Nunn is as always a reliable talent. Micheal of the Barres is a hoot as an exaggerated lawyer. The ensemble of familiar faces works well together to bring this crazy group of characters to life. This is a good rental and one of the few that you can observe with the whole family.
