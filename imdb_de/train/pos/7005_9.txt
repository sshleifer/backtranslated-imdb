When the DVD came out, I went to the market and bought it. And I think my money was on track, as I expected it to be before buying. Great movie, what else can I say for Will Smith? He was as always a fantastic actor, whether in action movies or serious. He always gives a record braking performance. I think that's the movie after August Rush that makes a person cry. The way the director described the story was really great. His previous life and new life in the film was presented to the audience correctly. Even I could not find a mistake in the story or in the way it was shot. I think the DVD should be a household, because this is really going to be a nice thing for your collection. It's not the movie that needs popcorn to enjoy, this is the movie that lets the audience learn a lesson. So what is the lesson you can see while watching? And I advise those who are film critics, please look at that, if you could find criticism of this movie.
