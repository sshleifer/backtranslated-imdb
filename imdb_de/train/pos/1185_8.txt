Robert Taylor and Stewart Granger change the goodie baddie roles they had played in "All Brothers Have Been Brave". Taylor seems a bit uncomfortable in his role as a villain, but Granger plays his role perfectly. The true hero in the story, however, is the bison and the northwest. The movie is done perfectly, the atmosphere of the time is wonderful. The direction is taut and although the film is not light-hearted entertainment, it is, in my opinion, an important film that ignorance unfairly ignores.
