Only a few chess films have been made in recent years, but this is more than just a chess movie. It is a story about the need to be loved and the need to win it. John Toturro plays a mentally challenged man, it does not matter If he accepts 64 squares and 32 pieces, the game confirms him as a person. If he loses a game, he loses the one thing that makes sense to him, and John Torturro beautifully expresses this, even a woman's love was not the case enough to save him from his sad existence. One wonders if there are other Luzon who deal with the game. I am sure that they are. If you are a chess lover, it can not hurt to see it from work properly laid out and well executed, it achieves its goals, unfortunately I doubt if there will be a sequel.
