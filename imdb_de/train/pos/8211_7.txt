I've never seen the original Dirty Harry and judged this movie on a clean board. And I have to say, I liked it a lot. Sure, some of the acting of Sondre Locke made me a bit scratchy - but hey, it was the 80s. But even if you can not get past her (and I almost could not) or her revenge killings (which seemed a bit over the top), it's only worth it for Dirty Harry. Or at least the bulldog he affectionately calls "MeatHead": P <br /> <br /> 7/10.
