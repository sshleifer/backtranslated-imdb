This movie is incredible. The plot was just ... wow. <br /> <br /> I was very surprised by Gackt and Hyde after I grew up in the American world with the actors who can not sing and singers who can not act. <br /> <br /> In this movie, a young sho (Gackt) encounters a vampire, Kei (Hyde). Over time, they form an unlikely friendship. Kei suffers because he is forced to live off others, the half-life of a vampire. <br /> <br /> It's a sad movie, but not juicy. The plot was very unique and unlike your typical vampire strip. The plot was full of twists and turns and very tempting. <br /> <br /> The only mistake I would make is that despite the lack of a happy - albeit peaceful - ending, the film could have been multiple languages. I had the unwanted version (I'm lucky I understood everything, except a few Cantonese), so I would recommend getting something with subtitles. <br /> <br /> All in all, the movie was just fantastic.
