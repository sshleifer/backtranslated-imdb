Fascinatingly I approached I Am Curious (Yellow) and his companion with great doubt. I read a lot of stories about the much-discussed controversy and explicit sex. What I got was not this, but a thoroughly thought-out and stimulating cinematic experience that is second to none. I sincerely believe that the majority of the commentators who found the movie "lame" or "boring" have gone into the movie as if it were pornography. Maybe this is pornography, assuming that pornography is for the senses, but intentionally not erotic. Lena, the protagonist, throws everything into her performance and gives her a realistic and humanity that is simply convincing and lasting. Her breasts may be limp, her nipples are unusually large, her thighs fat and her face plump. But at the end of the film, the audience identifies with her and accepts her mistakes as human. This touch gives her even more credibility than necessary. If the director had thrown a bomb from Briget Bardot, the effect would have been lifted. I can not recommend this thoughtful piece. Be prepared to invest a lot of thought in this consciously running movie. The patient and modest viewer will be rewarded in the way most other films can dream.
