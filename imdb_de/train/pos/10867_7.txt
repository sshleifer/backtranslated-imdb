I saw in the movie guide list for the Santa Barbara Film Festival, where I was in Hollywood, that this movie was in the show. Basically, there is an election for the new chairman of the Hong Kong Triads Wo Sing Society, so you can imagine how much violence will occur during that time. The fight is between "candidates" Lam Lok (Simon Yam) and Big D (Tony Leung Ka Fai) for the control of the oldest and most powerful triad parts of society. With Louis Koo as Jimmy Lee, Nick Cheung as Jet, Cheung Siu Fai as Mr. So, Lam Suet as Big Head and Lam Ka Tung as Kun. There are some good realistic themes and moments of corruption, just enough action, except maybe when the cops get involved, but there's a sequel, so it's a pretty worthwhile thriller. Very well!
