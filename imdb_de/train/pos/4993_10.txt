Unfortunately, this movie was not available for a long time (as has been noted on other posters), but this is one of the most important dramas of the Great Depression, a lyrical and touching love drama in a poor city. Performances by Spencer Tracy and Loretta Young are almost the best of their careers, and it is an excellent example of how director Frank Borzage was able to create an almost fairytale aura around elements of poverty, crime and violence terrible social inequality, proving that his talents were really romantic and spiritual. This film shows how love survives in the midst of misery and desperate need, and it is absolutely life-affirming. This is a true masterpiece of the time and a movie that deserves to be known.
