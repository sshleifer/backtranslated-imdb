Of all the films I have seen, and most of them are, this is by far the best that is primarily about the WWII WWII US Navy airships (blimps). Yes, there are other good movies related to LTA, but most use special effects more than all real-time footage. The man's navy contains a lot more real-time shots of blimps, and so on. There are a lot of dialogues, but that's even more interesting Hollywood movies today. P.S. I spent 10 years (out of 20) and spent over 5,000 hours in naval airships of all types from 1949 to 1959.
