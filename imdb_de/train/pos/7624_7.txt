A pretty memorable film from the variety of animals that kill people, essentially similar to "Willard", in which an aging character actor (in this case, a step down to the level of Les Tremayne, who is the only outstanding artist) I've seen him see him in a role as a man who has an unbalanced life and who decides to use his animal friends to revenge himself on those who have wronged him. Yeah, this is one of those movies where pretty much everyone is despicable, so they'll cheer when they die, and the selection of actors, locations, etc. could not be better, lending the film an air of shabby decadence. <br /> <br /> Tremayne's character is "Snakey Bender", and he's certainly the most interesting thing about the movie: an old snake collector obsessed by John Philip Souza's music. When the local preacher fights his practice of collecting small animals from local schoolchildren as bait for his snakes and his friend marries a stripper (which disturbs his ritual Wednesday concert on Wednesday), he sets out on a rampage. He creates a memorable pile of clunkers under the cliff, where he dumps the wrecks after disposing of his unfortunate owners. An amusing game you can play while watching "Snakes" is placing bets where the cars land furthest below the cliff. All in all very cheap and exploitative, but will really be a lot of fun for fans of this type of movie.
