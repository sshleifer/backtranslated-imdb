Sweet movie about three lively sisters from Switzerland (who were often seen walking around in matching outfits) who want to bring their parents back together (the mother still seems to have the torch for dad with her) - so they sail to New York to to prevent the dad from marrying A blond gold digger he calls "Precious". Dad has not seen his daughters for ten years, they (strangely) do not seem to mind and think that he is wonderful. Meanwhile, Precious seems to lead a life led mainly by her overbearing mother (Alice Brady), a woman who is currently living wants to make sure that her daughter marries a rich man. The sisters come up with the idea to push Precious on the path of a drunken Hungarian count and to make the two gold diggers that he is one of the richest men in Europe. But a case of false identity makes the girls think the count is handsome Ray Milland, who joins the scheme because he has a crush on sister Kay. <br /> <br /> This movie is enjoyable and easy. Barbara Read, how Kay looks cute and pretty, Ray Milland looks so young and pretty (although, unfortunately, there is not much to do), Alice Brady is pretty good as a playful mother - but it's Deanna Durbin, a real charming and cute as a button plays the youngest sister Penny who pretty much steals the show. With beautiful vocals she sings several songs throughout the movie, although I would have liked to see her more. The plot in this movie is a bit stupid, but still I found the movie entertaining and funny.
