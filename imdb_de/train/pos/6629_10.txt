The best treasure island of all time. They just do not make movies like these anymore or never. Nobody makes such films. This movie is more than a novelty, it is funny, open and fascinating, but capricious, mysterious and grumpy. This is one of my favorite pictures. The director must have had an idea of ​​what it's all about, but he certainly leaves room for his own impressions and interpretations while leaving little to his imagination. Why he <br /> <br /> did not make such films anymore, I have no idea. It reminds me of some of the best noir, but it is unique. But that's not lazy or easy.
