If people did not know who Barbra Streisand was before ... (is that possible?) ... did they really know who they were looking for? <br /> <br /> This show won 5 Emmys, & is one of the best things Streisand has ever done. <br /> <br /> It consists of 3 acts .... <br /> <br /> ACT I ... Barbra sings standards from room to room space, filled with musicians, including a segment in which she Once again a little girl is ending with an outstanding version of her distinctive song (at the time) ... "People". <br /> <br /> ACT II .... A musical tour of Bergdoff-Goodman while Barbra sings songs. It's better than it sounds ... ACT III ..... The Best, Just Barbra, Musicians, & some great songs, like ..... "Happy Days Are Here Again", & a "Funny Girl" - Mixture .... <br /> <br /> All in all, a big part of TV history. made by one of the greatest artists in the world!
