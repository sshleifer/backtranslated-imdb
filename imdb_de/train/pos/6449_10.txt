I was taken by a friend to this film and was skeptical of a Swedish film with subtitles. However, I really enjoyed every minute of this beautiful movie. The unnecessary cruelty to which humans are capable has been confidently portrayed without overwhelming images - although animal lovers may need to shield their eyes for a few seconds during the first 10 minutes. A traditional story of humility against brutality and hope against tragedy was illustrated from a satisfyingly new angle with a spectrum of characters with very natural faults and features. I particularly liked how the film has managed to treat various aspects of hypocritical human behavior that involve bias, discrimination, and hypocritical claims. An absolute gem of a movie that I will introduce to all who will listen.
