In terms of visual beauty, this movie is outstanding! I had no idea that Technicolor came out so early. Although I did not like the end, the whole movie is awesome and I wish I was in North Africa. The cast is excellent and Marlene Dietrich is a big plus and of course she is so enticing and I loved her in this movie. Basil Rathbone is perfect in this movie as well. I could not overcome the landscape and the scenery ... The hotel, the palm trees, the desert, everything is there ... The legionaries also give the film a "Beau Gesture" feeling. You certainly do not make movies anymore. Do not miss this classic!
