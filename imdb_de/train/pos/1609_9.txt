"Moonstruck" is a movie that I liked the first time I watched. The second time I really liked it. I loved it for the third time. Now it's one of my favorites of all time. <br /> <br /> The humor is subtle but really good. The movie offers a lot of warmth humor. The story takes place in an old Italian school in NYC. Cher's search for love is fun. This movie is by far the best job that Nicholas Cage has done in the movie. The Old Man character is fantastic. He lights up the screen without saying a word. The scene with his dogs howling at the moon was fantastic. But maybe the best character is played by Olympia Dukakis. <br /> <br /> The highlight of the film is a scene in which the main characters romp at breakfast with oatmeal in the family kitchen. Exceptional direction and completion.
