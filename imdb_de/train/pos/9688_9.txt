I'm careful to talk about movies about animals. For every wonderful one like Babe, you get as poor as the awful remake of Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey. Or in the case of Cats & Dogs, you have a great idea for a movie that does not live up to its potential. When I heard about Paulie, the premise of a whispering parrot did not fill me with confidence. But I found the movie a pleasant surprise. And you manage to sneak into your heart without your noticing it. <br /> <br /> Misha Vilyenkov (Tony Shaloub), a Russian janitor, gets a job in a research lab. One day he hears singing from the cellar. And as he investigates, he finds a parrot in his cage, expelling his little heart. Misha is fascinated by the bird, especially when it turns out that the parrot can not only sing, but also speak. And not a few sentences. It's a parrot that you can actually talk to. <br /> <br /> The parrot's name is Paulie (voiced by Jay Mohr) and recognizes a comrade in Misha. Wondering how this world ended up for the wise bird in a dusty basement, Misha persuades Paulie to tell him his life story. It all started when he was a baby, and in the care of Marie, a five-year-old girl who stutters. The two became feathers (OK, bad pun!). When Marie's parents were worried about her close friendship with a bird, they considered sending him away. And after Marie almost hurt herself in a fall after teaching Paulie to fly. Desperate to be reunited with her, Paulie begins a long journey through America, including a host of new owners who travel long distances and even land behind bars. From a cage that is! <br /> <br /> Paulie was one of several animal talking movies that DreamWorks released in the late '90s. And although it did not offer the same recognition or box-office success of Babe, Paulie succeeds on several levels, and he is an occasional work of impressive intelligence. Jay Mohr's stand-up style by Jay Mohr is well suited for Paulie's role. He never plays the role too smug, even if he is a smart Aleck. Paulie is secular, but he's also na√Øve in his way. <br /> <br /> Because he has led a more sheltered life with Marie, he has to take care of himself for the first time. And when he falls into the hands of various owners, they promise Paulie to unite him with Marie, which he believes. Only for the promise to be broken again and again. <br /> <br /> Paulie is admittedly a bit episodic. It follows the many-sided people with whom Paulie ends up, and how he slowly approaches Marie. He first lands in a pawn shop where he is adopted by Ivy (Gena Rowlands), a friendly woman who teaches him the importance of manners. She sympathizes with Paulie's situation and drives her camper through America to find Marie. <br /> <br /> Paulie is a sometimes very moving movie. His scenes with Ivy are among the best. Wonderful moments when Paulie sat on her shoulder and sang Tom Jones numbers. The way she feeds the need for hope is great and some of the dialogues are pretty well written and even thought-provoking: <br /> <br /> "There are things in life that you postpone, because you think I'll do it later, but the thing Ivy taught me is that you have to live like there's not be any later. "<br /> <br /> The scene where Ivy died is and has left Paulie alone is a very heartbreaking moment. And the sequence in which he has the courage to fly over the Grand Canyon for the first time, rising majestically, is such a beautifully composed scene he still has for hours after the film. Despite the occasional sad moment, there is much to laugh about. Paulie meets a group of parrots in a Spanish outdoor restaurant. The animatronic effects are really outstanding as four birds have a perfectly choreographed dance number. And Paulie even gets a romance. Which is the case when he falls into a small thief (also played by Mohr). That may be the only complaint I have. Once you become familiar with a situation, the film then moves Paulie to another. <br /> <br /> The scene in which Paulie is taught to steal money from ATMs is fun, but also a bit disturbing. I am amazed that DreamWorks has given the opportunity to include such a scene in a children's film. And Paulie's diamond robbery is a mission impossible. He has been put into action and sent to the laboratory for animal experiments, where he has since remained. <br /> <br /> The story eventually closes in the lab where Misha vows to help Paulie. Of course they find Marie. But the last revelation is a scene of such shocking intensity that I was deaf for several minutes. Paulie may never get the longevity Babe has, but I think it's an equally brilliant movie. The same laugh. The same flawless effects. And the same surprising intelligence. <br /> <br /> A little gem.
