In the 1930s, studios used short films like this kind as a testing ground for new actors, as their production is relatively easy compared to full-length feature films. Therefore, it is interesting that this film plays Shirley Temple, which has long since established itself as the most famous child star of all time. On the other hand, she was probably not the one who was tested. I imagine that this would have been Frank Coghlan Jr., who played Shirley's brother Sonny in the film and provided a comparatively less impressive performance. On the other hand, a nine-year-old Shirley Temple was probably not an easy accompaniment. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a nondescript gag with a leaky ceiling that was probably designed by Shirley Temple Give a scornful look at the ceiling, show the status of the working class of the family in the movie, and get one clean transition to the next scene in which Shirley is happily in the rain. <br /> <br /> It's Sonny's birthday, and his father occasionally undertakes and horribly botched efforts to hide the fact that he wants to give Sonny a dog he really wants for himself, but Sonny has Scared of dogs because he's been bitten by one and ever been dragged since. It's strange that Sonny, if he insists on having a dog, decides to run away from home instead of having a dog in the house, and since he runs into sight without a target, it's also strange that the movie shows What seems like an indifference to the homeless, surpassing even the astonishing indifference that exists today. Sonny passes by a man who cooks bacon in an iron pan on the side of the train tracks (right after a train has flown by plane) Given how close he was to the tracks, one would think the guy had him blown away from the tracks, but no matter. After Sonny has given up the breakfast with the sour look his guy is smiling on, he goes on and the homeless disappears from the movie. It's interesting to consider what a longer movie would have done, because this poor guy has a casual ending. <br /> <br /> Not that that matters. Sonny soon hears a dog howling under a rack as he walks by and jumps down to find a dog covered with ridges. It may seem banal that he immediately picks up the dog and adopts him, having just left home for fear of dogs, but it seemed to me that he did not need to be reminded of his power over dogs but of their lack of power about him. As soon as he saw a needy dog, he overcame his fear. <br /> <br /> Hey, if that's all, I just need to find a helpless spider and I'm done! <br /> <br /> It's a very comfy movie, with everything going the way it should, but it's cute enough and pleasant enough (and short enough to be a fun movie anyway). We expect No epic plot in a 19-minute movie, but Pardon My Pups still has a lot of story and character development in his short run. And there is also a fight scene at the end of the film that must have made Charlie Chaplin proud. I'm hardly an expert on Shirley Temple's films, but it's not hard to see her becoming the most famous child star ever.
