Lizzie Borden's love crime is an important film that deals with the dark side of female sexuality (and including the woman's complete female nudity sure to beat the male). It flirts with sadomasochism and the prisoner, who falls in love with the Captor theory. <br /> <br /> This treatment of female libido is sometimes shallow and jerky, but Borden has outgrown the feminist dogma of females, which gains power through its insatiable lust. <br /> <br /> An impressive scene depicts the female fetish for horses when the antagonist, a fake fashion photographer, wears an elderly woman in trousers by asking her to show her riding a horse. He shoves a riding crop between her legs and pushes her against her crotch, which greatly increases her excitement. Then he suddenly leaves her home and she swears accusingly at the closed door. <br /> <Patrick Bergin plays the con artist, and although he falls far away from the handsome man, he reaches out to Janes and has enough screen presence to give the impression that women could swallow his line. By all accounts, Sean Young proves a strange person, and she is barely beautiful. But in this film, as District Attorney, her intense face and slender body with long limbs, accentuated hips, and periodically disconnected movement are set in erotic fascination. Your performance is powerful and complex. <br /> <br /> Borden has a fascinating world view and the fact that he is so contrary to the modern, relentless zeitgeist that I really appreciate.
