"Who Loves The Sun" works with enough wit and grace through some spiky themes to keep the story not only captivating, but also often hilarious. It's been a while since I found such a touching, thoroughly enjoyable movie. <br /> <br /> The film is beautiful and captivates with its beautiful scenery and tranquil scenery. The peaceful imagery contrasts beautifully with the tension between the very human, very flawed and yet very sympathetic characters. Due to the outstanding cast, all five major players are wonderfully interesting and dynamic. <br /> <br /> I recommend "Who Loves The Sun." It's a really funny movie that shows a painful look at the injuries we can inflict on each other and the amazingly difficult but equally rewarding process of forgiveness.
