Loopy, but clever and impressive mob boss Vic (an excellent performer of Richard Dreyfuss) is released from a mental hospital. Some of Vic's criminal cohorts, including the elusive stalwart Brass Balls Ben London (a marvelously manic and exaggerated hammy-like depiction of Gabriel Byrne), the smarmy Jake Parker (a perfectly complacent Kyle MacLachlan) and the vicious rival "Wacky" "Jacky Jackson (a neat twist on Burt Reynolds) is all trying to fend off Vic, and meanwhile, relaxed and confident hitman Mickey Holliday (played by Jeff Goldblum with unobtrusive confidence) has been in the midst of this deadly madness, author / director Larry Bishop gives this deliciously dark and pitch-black comedy of deceit, loyalty and ruthless ambition a very hip, quirky and original, headstrong sensibility.The bang-up cast has a field day with the colorful, grotesque Rogue Gallery featuring uncannily amoral and treacherous stick men: Ellen Barkin as hard, sultry Mollin Rita E Verly, Henry Silva as Vics reliable right-hander Sleepy Joe Carisle, Gregory Hines as philosophical smoothie Jules Flamingo, Diane Lane as Vic's sweet, naughty lover Grace, Billy Drago as the slimy Wells and Christopher Jones as the brutal rub-out artist Nicholas Falco. Bishop uses his juicy supporting role as a deadly and laconic ass-assassin Nick. In skillful pieces Billy Idol emerge as a stinking thug, Michael J. Pollard as the unfortunate red, Joey Bishop as corpse Gottlieb, Rob Reiner as a funny chauffeur and Richard Pryor as Jimmy the Gravedigger. Byrne's wonderfully crazy duet with singer Paul Anka on "My Way" is an absolute highlight. A tense and amusing climax Mexican Mexicans tickle the funny bone also a bit hysterical. The smooth cinematography of Frank Byers, the outrageously nutty dialogues, the jazzy cocktail lounge of Earl Rose and a select soundtrack of vintage swing golden oldies underline the stimulating, very special charm of this extremely entertaining, unique Curio.
