I have no idea how to describe this film, and I would also love to give others the same opportunity I had - with no prior knowledge of what to expect. I enjoyed it very much, but I can also say that I hardly understood what was going on, when in fact something was to be understood. Fans of David Lynch (tangential) or, above all, Guy Maddin films should really enjoy it, and all fans of the comic book EIGHTBALL will probably be thrilled and amazed (it came as close as any movie I've ever seen have mood that Dan Clowes creates so effectively). <br /> <br /> A little note to warn everyone slightly offended - this movie would certainly be NC-17 if rated. Fans of male frontal nudity, however ... hmmm, well ... yes. That's weird wild stuff.
