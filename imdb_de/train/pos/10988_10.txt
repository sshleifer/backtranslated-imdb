Do not read anything about this movie (especially nothing that might contain spoilers). Watch this great movie without knowing it - and you'll have a really great experience. If you want to see a smart, twisted story, go get the DVD and you will not be disappointed. "Cypher" is not really a science-fiction movie, more of a psycho-thriller that has settled in the environment of globalized companies. It's about corporate secrets, how big companies spy on the research departments of others, and what methods they use. The performers do a great job and the overall visual style of the film provides a perfect kind of cold. Cypher is much deeper, more complex, and - which is part of the story and the end - much, much more satisfying than Vincenzo Natali's other films "Cube" and "Nothing". In fact, it's one of the best movies I've ever seen (and that's something I do not really say for every fifth well-made movie). Unfortunately I can not talk about this movie anymore without hurting the experience. Just give him a chance. ;-)
