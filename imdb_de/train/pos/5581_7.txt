This image was banned in American movie houses in the 1930s because Hedy Lamarr (Eva Hermann) had nudity, which caused all sorts of problems for the ladies in the 1930s, but not so much for the male population. This story is about a young woman named Eva Hermann, who marries an elderly man and is carried over the threshold on the wedding night. The husband never marries and cares about all sorts of trivia such as shoes and the killing of beetles. Eva leaves her husband's house and lives with her father, trying to explain her situation. On a hot summer's day, Eva rides her horse and decides to swim naked in a lake in the woods. Her horse runs away, she runs after him and is watched by a young man who finds her clothes and gives her back to Eve. These two people get to know each other very well and a romance begins to blossom. There are many other interesting issues that arise when watching this movie to the end. Enjoy a great classic movie that was a shock movie in 1933.
