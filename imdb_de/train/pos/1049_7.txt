Sisters will be theatrically released on March 24 in Sweden. A good opportunity for our Nordic friends to discover this original and thoughtful documentary. It was shown in Gothenburg together with a retrospective dedicated to Kim Longinotto, the festival's "director in focus". She gave a highly regarded masterclass about her method as a documentary filmmaker and told the audience about the special circumstances under which she had shot two sisters the film turned out to be different in the end. In this case, a pretty dreadful problem has arisen to create the possibility of a very powerful movie.
