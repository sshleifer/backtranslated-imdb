Robert Duvall is, according to the IMDb.com movie database, a direct descendant of Confederate General Robert E. Lee. After watching this movie, you may think that Duval's performance is the finest of reincarnation. One of my favorite movies. I wish the composer, Peter Rodgers Melnick, had a CD or a soundtrack available. Wonderful landscapes and music and "all too realistic", especially for those of us who live or moved to the south. This is a "real moment in time". Life goes on slowly, but "we do not stay strangers".
