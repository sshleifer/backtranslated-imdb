Great script and some of the best actors the world has ever produced. Montand adds a whole new dimension of intensity and, above all, credibility to the policeman's concept of a lonely wolf. When a typical Hollywood cop loses his family, friends and pets, he is usually given his minute of grief. But when the sixty seconds are over, he pulls himself together, grabs his weapon, and shoots up his enemies one at a time. <br /> <br /> However, Montands Marc Ferrot is really devastated - by the murder of his girlfriend, of course, but also by finding out she had another lover. In his confusion and anger, he seeks no revenge, but must always find the real culprit of a crime in which his fingerprints are everywhere on the stage. So all his actions inevitably become logical. This is the main reason why this film sticks to our seats, but definitely not the only one.
