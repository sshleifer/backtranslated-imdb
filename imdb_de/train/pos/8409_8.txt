A good movie, and I'll see you several times. Rich (the previous comment) is right: There is much more going on here than can be seen from the title boards, and I have to wonder how much the translation has suffered. Was there more in the original? Or should a native speaking audience read more? Or was this - since the script was written by the author of the novel - a currently popular story with which the audience was already very familiar? In short, it's worth taking a look, but it probably requires more work from contemporary audiences than the original 1913 audience had to put into it. <br /> <br /> The Alpha Video release advertises the new organ score, but the music does not match it in any way with the progress of the story. Sure, it starts off promisingly, but it degenerates into a repetitive, Phillip-Glass-like monotony that does not reflect the action on screen. After listening for a while, I turned off the sound and just watched: much better!
