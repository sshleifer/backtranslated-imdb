Masayuki Suo, who was director of this movie, plays a role. After the decent "Fancy Dance" and the classic (in Japan anyway) college sumo comedy "Shiko Funjatta", Suo has followed his own big strides with overwhelming success. <br /> <br /> The story is captivating. We both often laugh (Naoto Takenaka is weird, as he's in Suo's two previous films) and really the roots for the characters. For me, the big bonus is the look this movie gives the viewer into Japanese society - the real life in Japan. Suo has a knack for showing real fun activities. The result is a movie that will tickle you, make you laugh, make you think and entertain you, and give you insight into today's Japan. <br /> <br /> Also pay attention to the most important 8 actors of Shiko Funjatta, as they all appear again in different roles, from minor characters (Takenaka) to short cameos (many).
