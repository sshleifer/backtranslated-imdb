That's a nice job. Very sexy and engaging enough action to get my interest consistently. Its main drawback is that it looks like it was done for TV: full screen, and although there were several sex scenes, there was absolutely no nudity. Strange too, since Netflix shows that it was rated R. <br /> <br /> Still very annoying and I wish Alicia Silverstone would make more films like this. It was part of a series, but I could not figure out which series that is. I would like to find out because this movie was so good. <br /> <br /> Walt D in LV. 08/23/2005
