The Internet database lists this as a television program. And yes, it was a series about MTV in the program "Oddities", after "The Head" and before "Aeon Flux", if I remember rightly. But the version I watched this time was a VHS tape where all the episodes were put together to make a movie, without the hassle of putting off any quandaries or having to wait a week for the next fifteen minutes. They have the story of Maxx, Julie Winters, Sarah and Mr. Gone. The Maxx is a superhero or a bum, Julie a social worker or a leopard queen, Sarah a girl who should hear less of The Smiths and Mr. Gone a guy who seems unable to hold on. And then there are the other strange creatures ... <br /> <br /> I use "or" with Maxx and Julie, because part of the fun is figuring out which parts of the story are real and what dreams are. Maybe they are all true or dreams. Maybe one of the characters does not exist. Maybe only one of the others exists and dreams. You have to wait and find out. <br /> <br /> I had the comic books before the show came out, and it was one of my favorites. The artwork was spectacular and the story was original - unlike anything found in Superman or Batman. It will bend your mind and have strong overtones for adults without being obscene or offensive. And the show basically used the same exact artwork (just now it moves) and the same story ... and guaranteed that the beauty in the comic is faithfully reproduced. This was the best show that appeared on "Oddities" without a doubt. <br /> <br /> If you like comics with sombre nature or need a good train of thought, this is a show you should try. It's "Donnie Darko" before ever. <br /> <br /> The most amazing thing is that this never became another movie or TV series, but I'm not saying that disappointed. To keep it simple, they sealed this film in gold and freed it from the mistakes caused by successive failures.
