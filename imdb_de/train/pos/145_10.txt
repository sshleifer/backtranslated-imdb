Continuation of "The Kingdom" is more bloody and even more twisted. I only saw half (I was exhausted and could not get through every 5 1/2 hours), but I loved what I saw. Ghosts, blood, murder, poisoning, mutated babies, voodoo ... that has it all! If you have a strong belly and like crazy movies, this is for you. <br /> <br /> Besides, you do not need to see part 1 to understand this ... you will find out! <Br /> <br /> Does anyone know if Kingdom 1 and 2 are available on DVD? Sitting in a theater through these marathon films is exhausting. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, there will probably be no "Kingdom 3" - Ernst-Hugo Jaregard (Sig) died a year after it was filmed. But you never know!
