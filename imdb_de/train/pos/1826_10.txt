I loved this movie when I was little. Today at 17, he is one of my favorite animated films. Nice animations and appealing characters are just two of the things that appeal to this movie. Although many people do not like some of the songs, most of them are well done and go along with the story. It focuses on Charlie, a mischievous, good-looking German Shepard who seems unlikely at first glance ... but ultimately he'll convince you. Often very dark and scary. A treat for Don Bluth fans and animation fans. But keep a handkerchief. ADGTH makes me cry again and again and will do the same for film-sensitive people. Probably one of the biggest animated films that is not Disney. Together with Watership Down and My Neighbor Totoro. <br /> <br /> BOTTOM LINE: A heavenly masterpiece.
