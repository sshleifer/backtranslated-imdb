This great movie features a host of talented actors and musicians - Levant, Crosby, Martin, Rathbone and Manone are at home in the story that seems to have been delivered by Billy Wilder. One would like to know more about how much he had to deal with, because it is an exceptionally clever variation on the history of the sterile master / fruitful servant - almost an allegory of the entertainment industry run by dried-up nutcrackers, but a vibrant world of entertainment Art and the Play of a Underclass of Nobodies and Non-WASPs. Looking at the last six decades of music, television and film in the US, it's hard not to see the underlying insights of this film as prophetic.
