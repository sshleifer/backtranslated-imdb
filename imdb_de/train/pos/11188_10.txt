I'm a big fan of Stephen King's work and this movie has made me an even bigger King fan. Pet Sematary is about the Creed family. They have just moved to a new house and seem to be happy. Behind her house there is an animal cemetery. The new neighbor Jud des Judas (played by Fred Gwyne) explains the burial ground behind the animal cemetery. This burial ground is the pure evil. Jud tells Louis Creed that if you buried a human (or any pet) on the burial grounds, they would come back to life. The only problem is that when they come back, they are NOT the same person, they are evil. Soon after Jud has explained everything about Pet Sematary, everything goes to hell. I will not explain it anymore because I do not want to reveal some of the main parts of the movie. The acting that Pet Sematary had was pretty good, but needed a bit of work. The story was one of the main ingredients of this movie, mainly because it was so original and engaging. This movie has many make-up effects that make the movie more sinister and scary. One of the most fundamental reasons why this movie cooled my back was the make-up effects. There is one character in this movie who is really freaked out. This character is "Zelda". This special character appears in the movie about three times, to be exact. Zelda is Rachel Creed's sister, who died years ago, but Rachel is still being persecuted by her. The first time Zelda appears in the movie is generally not scary, because she does not talk or anything else, but the second time is the worst, and to be honest, the second time, life scares me. There's absolutely nothing wrong with this movie, it's almost perfect. Pet Sematary delivers great fear, some good acting, first-rate action and mesmerizing make-up. This is truly one of the most popular horror movies of all time. 10 out of 10.
