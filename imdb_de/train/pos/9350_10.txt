Let me say that I love Adam Sandler and watch over me. I paid close attention to his acting. I snap back while Adam Sandler sucks me. <br /> <br /> Reign over Me is a great movie, a movie that at first runs slowly when you expect emotion in every scene. <br /> <br /> Don Cheadle always does a great job and is no exception with some really great lines and deserves an Oscar in every movie he does. <br /> <br /> Adam Sandler was amazing in many ways, not only that this was his most dramatic. best-played film of his career. But I can remember that I laughed a lot in many places in this movie. <br /> <br /> The side cast was great, also with Saffron Burroughs and Jada Pinkett Smith. I highly recommend this movie Huge drama Beautiful shots of NYC Big comedy Big drama And a new respect for Adam Sandler, if you've ever doubted him or a confirmation of how awesome Don Cheadle is
