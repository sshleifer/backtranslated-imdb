I just looked at this after my mom brought it back from America for me and I was scared to see this after all the negative comments here But remember, this was not 2005 but 1898 and for such a low budget I thought it was pretty good. I enjoyed this version much more than the Spielberg version that I saw last week. <br /> <br /> I read the book so many times and almost always found myself "ahh yes, that's in the book." The other version had little of the book. <br /> <br /> So well done that you at least try to create a real version.
