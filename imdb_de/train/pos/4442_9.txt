The Ogre is a movie shot in Italy for television rather than a sequel to Demons, as Lamberto Bava even mentioned it in the interview on the Sheirk Show DVD, but he was called Demons III to be part of the Demons To be series. The music in Demons and Demons 2 was 80's rock music, while this was the scary music and the first two horrible horrors were like this movie. <br /> <br /> The music is scary and that gives a sound to the castle where the movie is playing. The Ogre is another thing why I like the movie. There are two other films classified as Demons III. These are Black Demons (Demoni 3) and The Church (Demons 3). Demons III: The Ogre is a good movie unless you compare it to Demons and Demons 2.
