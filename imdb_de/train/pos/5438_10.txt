A rousing adventure by director George Stevens (before turning to more serious prizes like I REMEMBER MAMA in 1948 and GIANT in 1956), which sets the standard for all future action yarns. GUNGA DIN is based on the poem by Rudyard Kipling and traces the journey of three officers in the 19th century in India. The noble trio must face a series of battles and other dangers, including a thug cult and a temple of gold. Their screen adventures are still exciting after more than six decades and have inspired almost everything, from the Cliffhanger-inspired space star STAR WARS (1977) to the similarly drawn RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARC (1981). The main reason for the success of the picture, however, is the timely performances of the film trio of extremely charismatic actors. Victor McLaglen was seldom better than the tough, tough guy, Cary Grant is the ultimate comic book, and Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. is as polite as you can imagine - maybe even more than rival Errol Flynn. The chemistry between the three actors simply could not be improved, and so warm and believable is just what most modern action images lack - and they are enormously supported by the wonderful Sam Jaffe, who overcomes the obvious physical abuse character a beacon of humane sweetness and calm power. A big hit in its time (the movie was supposed to be the second largest money maker of 1939 behind the incredibly successful GONE WITH THE WIND) and remains arguably the best film of its kind.
