I would not go so far as not to recommend this film, as the only problems I have with it are due to an overexposure of the plotter used in the film - the kind of things that are common in every children's film, it seems. That does not make it bad, just not something I would go far. <br /> <br /> It's a little saccharine, so I could say that anyone looking for something has a little more joke. Be disappointed in a movie that's obviously for kids like this one. <br /> <br /> However, the whole thing comes out of the window when the squirrel (which is in all trailers) appears on the screen. His time is limited, but it seems obvious that the decision-makers had the wisdom to tell the boys, hey, could you have a few more squirrels with them? 'Every time it gets unbearably boring. That does not save the movie, but you can go and say, "At least I could not stop laughing." <br /> <br /> And of course it will not visually disappoint, but that's almost a given with Pixar flicks. Of all their things I would put that to the bottom ... but that's not bad in itself.
