DO NOT judge this production by the 2 hour version released on VHS in the US. This is a choppy and incomprehensible mess. I had the pleasure of seeing the 6-hour full version on DVD from the UK and was intrigued. The intentional pace and growing sense of threat are just as intriguing as the amazing visual and acoustic landscape. This is an ancient Rome that we have never seen before, and far more authentic than most others. <br /> <br /> Director Franco Rossi was rightly celebrated for The Odyssey's 1968 mini-series, and this miniseries is just as powerful. Just as Bekim Fehmiu became the best Ulysses on the screen, Klaus Maria Brandauer may be the best Nero on the screen. Now I hope one day to see Rossi's version of The Aeneid (Eneide), which aired on Italian TV in 1971. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure which version of QUO VADIS is stronger, this or the Polish Mini Series from 2001; Everyone has different virtues and in many ways they complement each other. Certainly one rises above the Hollywood uprising with Peter Ustinov.
