I had heard of TEARS OF KALI some time ago, and it sounded like I was something, but with all the movies I regularly come in, it somehow fell off my radar. While walking through the local WonderBook, I discovered the box for this one and took it with me. I have to say that I'm pretty happy. TEARS OF KALI is a strange, bloody, sometimes downright spooky movie that is somewhat limited by its obviously low budget - but still is a fun and rewarding watch. <br /> <br /> TEARS OF KALI focuses on the fictional India Taylor-Erikkson cult group that practices meditation and other rituals to fight and banish the "inner demons" of the individual - but these techniques apparently work either too good or not good enough (depending on your point of view) as dark forces are not only exorcised, but unleashed on unfortunate victims. <br /> <br /> The film is referred to as an "anthology style", with a short but memorable and "eye-opening" intro sequence. Three stories that make up the bulk of the movie. <br /> <br /> The first (SHAKTI) is about a journalist visiting one of the cult members who are being held in a mental hospital. The journalist expects to explore the Taylor-Erikkson cult, but we find that her true motives are a little closer to home. If the interview takes a violent turn, the journalist realizes that she may have gotten over her head ... <br /> <br /> The second part (Devi) concerns a violent young man who instead seeks psychological rehabilitation She is sentenced to prison because she has beaten a young man into a coma. We find that the attending physician is indeed an "alumni" of Taylor-Erikkson, and his rehabilitation methods are far from normal ... <br /> <br /> The Final Story (KALI) is about a quack " Believing "Healer" and his assistant performing "wonders" for a fee If the healer unknowingly helps one of his clients and actually proves a force that possessed them, the demon can now roam free and look for a new host. <br /> <br /> I have to say that I really enjoyed Kali's tears, there are some flaws in the movie that do not really make him great - but it's an original and ambitious movie for what he does My biggest criticism in the production is the poor and uninspired spanned dialogue, the dubbing is below average, and I would much rather have preferred a subtitle option for the track in the original language Some critics have said that acting is bad, which I do not necessarily agree with. I think that the synchronization is so poor that the appearances seem stunted, which is not really the case. In fact, some of the services are pretty damn chillig (the "doctor" in the second segment and the "customer" in the third part immediately come to my mind ...) and remarkable. The Gore FX are very good for a low budget movie, with some graphic scenes of eyelid removal-over-cuticle scissors, a pencil-necked suicide, and some decent (but irritatingly "wobbly") self-photographing flaying, and a few other goodies thrown in for good measure. Not as rude as some of the "more extreme" Gore movies out there, but definitely more than your average horror fare. I also found the story about the cult group fascinating and a welcome change from the typical horror story nonsense. There are many scenes of real atmosphere and excitement that I have not encountered for some time. Although somewhat flawed in some ways, I still think that TEARS OF KALI will appeal to most "underground" horror viewers - some scenes may be too much for the mainstream viewer. In any case recommended - 8.5 / 10
