Before Cujo, there was the devil dog Lucky. In 1978, on Halloween night, the movie "Devil Dog, The Hound of Hell" premiered. A story of a family that gets a new puppy (from a farmer who happens to be in the neighborhood selling fruit and vegetables) because their dog Skipper was killed. Everyone loves the new dog, but there is something weird about it. <br /> <br /> It's not long before father Mike Barry (Richard Crenna, First Blood) begins to notice. His wife Betty (Yvette Mimieux, where the boys are in Jackson County Prison, Snowbeast) is different and His children are Charlie and Bonnie (Ike Eisenman, Witch Mountain and Fantastic Vourage and Kim Richards, Witch Mountain, Nanny and the Professor, Hello Larry , Tuff-Turf) have also changed. Does the dog have anything to do with it? He is determined to find out and do whatever it takes to save his family. <br /> <br /> This movie is great because Ike and Kim play a dark side of themselves when we saw it in those witch-mountain movies. This is one of the many 70's TV horror movies that were scary for a TV horror movie. The music was scary and even the end that I will not tell made you think. <br /> <br /> Ken Kercheval (Cliff Barnes of Dallas) and R.G. Armstrong (who could not stay away from devil films, remembers "Race with the Devil"?). <br /> <br /> It is worth to look.
