Someone (or something ...) leaves bullet points on the neck and leaves blood sacrifices to death. Police detective Karl Brettschneider (Melvyn Douglas, before he slips out of the B-movie horror genre for higher altitudes) is stunned by who or what's behind those notorious crimes. The village is conquered by hysteria, and Karl is of his trusted medical genius, dr. Otto von Niemann (Lionel Atwill, in another successful role as a mad scientist) depended on giving feedback on what may possibly be causing the death of innocent people. He also fears for the safety of his beloved Ruth (the pretty Fay Wray, who plays with Atwill for the third time for "Doctor X" and "The Mystery of the Wax Museum") and Niemann's assistant. <br /> <br /> Dwight Frye steals the movie as a pretty crazy village idiot who collects bats and carries humble behavior wherever he goes. Maude Eburne presents the humor of the film as a very na√Øve patient of von Niemann's patient, who believes that she has complaints in books near the lab where he works. She is impressive and she often makes of Niemann only humor and constantly fictitious diseases with which she is plagued. Lionel Belmore returns as another frightened, superstitious mayor. Creaking, static, but entertaining thanks to the cast. The film is obviously as cheap as they come, but that does not hurt the movie too much, as it was put together pretty well by director Frank Strayer and his crew. I am sure that the pressure of the film has seen better days. This is the kind of B horror item you would find along with 50 other random cheesefests and Poverty Line programmers. The villain of the film ... and his motives for feeding a synthetically produced biological creature ... certainly offers a different view of the Frankenstein formula. Many may be disappointed with the end result, as the film deviated from a real supernatural story about a true vampire killer who caused the murders.
