Although some call it "Cuban Cinema Paradiso", the film is more like a How Green Was My Valley, a remembrance film that mourns a lost innocence. The film skilfully avoids falling into a political trap to take sides (Pro-Castro? Anti-Castro?) And instead focuses on the human fragility of the characters and the importance of the family. Filled with good acting, especially the Mexican actress Diana Bracho, who plays Keitel's wife. A masterpiece full of references to classic films, from CASABLANCA to Chaplin's CITY LIGHTS. Gael Garcia Bernal plays a small role, which is crucial for the dramatic reward of the story is acting (remember the rookies?), Plays a homeless man who acts as a Greek choir, and it is a pity that this film with the Title DREAMING OF JULIA in the US was released by THINKfilm with the awful title CUBAN BLOOD, which has nothing to do with the movie.
