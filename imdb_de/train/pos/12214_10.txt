This cheap digital video has strengths in the right places - writing and acting. In addition, digital photography has been the best on the market so far. In low light conditions, the characteristic video umber sound predominates, but surprisingly competes with film material for brightness, clarity, and saturation in brightly lit situations. This is a film that works best on the basis of base films, with a snappy dialogue that tells a sort of "Midnight Cowboy" in which gifters do everything they can to survive in San Francisco.
