This film is an exact copy of a television series by the Indian television station Doordarshan, which was broadcast at least 15 years ago. The series was called "Gubbarre" (balloons). Each episode was a new short story. The story is excellent and the original is much sweeter and "convincing". Abhay Doel does a good job, but he does not fit into the role of a "normal" and "third" guy (as he calls himself in the movie). In fact, Shayan Munshi with his short hair and without the designer clothes would have fit the Abhays role, but Shayan just does not have the talent to take it off is available. It's the same story, apart from running with the Friends' mother and the first introduction. The drama of TV actors was much better than these "stars". <br /> <br /> The only reason these movies are a flop is that the director has been trying to stretch half an hour (or 45 minutes) of story to 2+ hours. So it has to get slimy. Even the nasal singing sensational songs could not make out. <br /> <br /> These films work well for a lazy Sunday afternoon and are really refreshing if you have not seen the original series. The script and the end of the series were much better. <br /> <br /> ##### SPOILERS AHEAD ######### ##### SPOILERS AHEAD ######### ##### SPOILERS AHEAD ### ########## SPOILERS AHEAD ######## ##### SPOILERS AHEAD ######## THe The end of the original series was much stronger than the hero himself rejected the girl, who had even thought she was ready to marry him. He is aware and tells her that he does not want to be "repaid" and never helped with this intention. The director or script somehow does not record the original ending in this film. The original ending would have bought the girls tears and the boys would have had to nod in agreement. The delivery was just not right. <br /> <br /> But personally I think that this is a pathetic copy. The director / writer should not be recognized. The story is amazing and comes from one of the famous novelists of the class PRemchand Munshi. I am not sure if this is the story of Premun and Munshi, but many of the other short stories in the series contain some of the stories of Premchand Munshi and other great Hindi authors.
