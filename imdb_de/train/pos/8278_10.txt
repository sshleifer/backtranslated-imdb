If you want Scream or something like the big studio horror product that's being forced on us these days, that does not bother you. This well written movie made me think about everything he had to say. The meaning of the myth in our lives makes sense as children interpret the world (and the violence within it), plunder our environment and do not know their history and legends ... all here, but not on the surface. Technically, it could be described as a "monster movie," even if the Wendigo does not take on a physical form until the end, and then it is up to you and your beliefs about what happens to the legendary ghost / beast. Some standard thriller elements for those who are just looking for the basics and never bore the movie, though in fact the less you see of the creature the better. Fessenden successfully continues the tradition of George Romero to use the genre as a parable and as a discussion forum, while still sneaking us.
