So many times a band meets for a reunion concert just to find out they just can not make it. Not so here. This concert is brilliant from start to finish. These three musicians had evidently teamed up and planned and planned what was needed to make sure that this was not just a nostalgic bash to satisfy another's ego. This is obvious from the beginning, even before they enter the stage. Many faces in the crowd were not even born when these guys appeared for the first time. From the first song they catch the old magic that was Cream, 3 men, 3 instruments, no hassle. Clapton himself said that he had to stretch out for this concert because there were no keyboards, synthesizers etc, and that we could see him at his best. Ginger Baker shows why so many drummers today speak of him as a kind of drummer guru. Jack Bruce just great. They have really managed to put together a piece of magic that will prove itself for years to come. That's a 10 for me.
