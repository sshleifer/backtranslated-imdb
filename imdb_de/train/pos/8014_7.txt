But if you like the Muppets, I oppose you not to like them. Basically, the same storyline (this time New York, not LA) was a lot of fun, it features lots of fun cameos and Muppets Hi-Jinx. Many of the Muppets leave the film pretty early as they focus on Kermy and Miss Piggy. I really enjoyed it. To see fun with your kids.
