I did not read anything about the movie before I happened to see it last Saturday night. And as I watched it, I felt the misery of Lena and Boesman in my bones. I was so fascinated by the acting, the sound and the filming that I only partially listened to the dialogues. My husband slept shortly after we went to bed and I was sleepless under the influence of the movie. I wanted to wake him up, just to say, "If I ever voted for an Oscar nomination, it would be these two actors." I decided to wait until the next day. Then I read more about the movie on IMDb and was saddened to learn that Mr. Berry died before the release of the film and that he probably never saw the latest version of his brilliant masterpiece. I still want to tell him that for me, his film was a truly independent film, in its concept and spirit. The actors are to be appreciated not only for their brilliant performance, but also for accepting a part without glamor or showing off, on the contrary, showing the true picture of human depression. Sad but moving.
