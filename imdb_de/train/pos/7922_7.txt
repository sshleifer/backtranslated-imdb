In this broadcast of horror movies, the Cold War paranoia of the 1950s, the Reagan era America, and in high school movies, Adam Arkin plays Tony, the Full Moon High star quarterback of the 1950s. He and his father (Ed McMahon) travel to communist Romania, and while he gets lost one night on the road, he is bitten by a werewolf. When he returns to the States, he can no longer control his animal urge and makes a killer. Frustrated, he flees the city. Decades later, the immortal Tony returns to the city and enrolls in high school again. He still can not control his transformations, and the citizens and friends realize he is not quite human. It culminates during the school's big football game. <br /> <br /> I expected it to be one of those "so bad, good" movies from the early 80's. But I was surprised that the movie was really funny. The cast, including Kenneth Mars as a perverted coach, Roz Kelly as Tony's pleasurable former flame, Demond Wilson as a bus driver, and Alan Arkin as a weird doctor, all end in strange results. <br /> <br /> When I saw this movie, I was surprised at how similar writing and humor was to Family Guy. "Full Moon High" has the same attitude and never takes it seriously.
