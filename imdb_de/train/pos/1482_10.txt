The best movie about marriage and family. This is a very interesting reflection for the couples who will come into the dangerous and paradoxical fascinating world of marriage and family. This decision could be the better or the worst in our lives and in the lives of our children. The real intrusion or help of "friends" or hangman when we go. The true role of families: they can help or destroy us. The crazy priest who may not be crazy and says what might happen according to statistics and reality. A couple who think in a "special" marriage lives a painful story in their future own story. <br /> <br /> Who likes a contract marriage? Nobody, after the priest has told his own story? If they leave the future in others hands, if they do not know WHAT the marriage is. That the problems are true, that everyone's life demands a real commitment, guarantees. That the real victims of divorce are children with the right name? Andrea in the movie or name. That abortion is only an easy way out: sadness, regret and unhappiness will be there after abortion. That the state and social security is less and less thinking of a real family problem. The gossip of the "friends", the infidelity because of the weakness and despair of Steffania, because Tomasso lives his life as if he were alone. <br /> <br /> Maybe someone might think that this movie is a pessimistic movie, but not. Steffania and Tomasso, in their deepest hearts, like a beautiful marriage and family, if not. Why do you like marriage? A truly beautiful marriage depends only on the couple: on each of their decisions, on every single act in their lives. The family could be a place where everyone feels loved, because he or she is only through the presence of oneself. The script is wonderful. The performances are great: Steffania and Tomasso, the almost cynical priest! An excellent guide and a good script. The colors and management of the cameras are outstanding.
