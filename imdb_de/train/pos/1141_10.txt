Anyone who does not laugh at the whole movie has been embalmed. I have seen it at least twenty times and many scenes still give me tears in my eyes. Sally Field is absolutely perfect as Celest Talbert, a fading soap star whose supporting cast is trying to replace her in the hope that her own star will rise. Fields, aged 45, still has this wonderful and beautiful Pixie quality and a perfect figure that introduces her to three children. I'm biased, I'm in love with her. <br /> <br /> The cast of "Soapdish" is full of stars who perform their roles perfectly. Kevin Kline is immaculate, as are Robert Downey Jr., a former Elizabeth Shue, Whoopi Goldberg and Teri Hatcher in one of their early roles, Carrie Fisher as the over-the-top casting director accusing an actor as a waiter without a shirt. Kathy Najimy is wonderful as a hapless costume designer, and the best part is that Cathy Moriarty as Nurse Nan, who leads the plan to remove Fields character from the show, is hilarious best comedy, best actress in a comedy, best actor in a comedy and countless other bests, including writing, governing, and supporting actors and actresses. Get the DVD so you can keep seeing it for the next 25 years. You will still laugh about it when the disc is worn out.
