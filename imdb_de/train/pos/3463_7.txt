I'm a big Beatles fan. My favorite beatle is Paul and my least beloved is John. I already knew a lot about the Beatles music and the background to separation as well as John Lennon's family and Paul's band Wings. I wondered how this film would handle the relationship between John and Paul so many years after the breakup. <br /> <br /> I was not disappointed with this movie. Although the story itself is a fiction, many of the references used by the two musicians were very accurate. Among them was how Yoko Ono would always be with John, wherever he went, the Wings song "Silly Love Songs" was the number one hit this year and the concert on the roof of the Apple Studios, the music from the album "Let It Be." br /> <br /> The actors did John and Paul very well. The accents might have taken a bit more work, but they seemed to behave as if I'd read the two former Beatles that used to be. I also liked the dialogue between them, which was basically the whole movie. <br /> <br /> The end disappointed me at first, but the more you think about it, the more you will appreciate it, especially because this was the case as it really was. They also show the fantastic sketch of "Saturday Night Live" in which the Beatles are offered $ 3,000 for the show. (compared to the $ 220 million others offered) Overall, I was not disappointed with this movie. There's really a sense of why the Beatles split up and why they never came back together.
