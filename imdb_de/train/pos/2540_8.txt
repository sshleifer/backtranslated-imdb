Although this is not as famous as some of their other collaborations (like THE BLACK CAT and THE BODY SNATCHER), this is a little horror movie, even though the casting decisions were a bit strange. Boris Karloff plays dr. Janos Rukh, a strange scientist living in the Carpathians - near the hometown of the Dracula character. Bela Lugosi plays dr. Benet, whose nationality was never discussed, though the name certainly sounds French. I really believe that it would have made sense to change the two roles, as the role of the Carpathians seems to be specific to Lugosi - especially with his accent. Despite this unusual twist, the two have nevertheless done an excellent job. Karloff's role was definitely the main character, but Lugosi did well as a relatively normal person - something he did not play very often in movies !! It seems that Dr. Rukh is a bit of a pariah because other scientists (especially Benet) consider his theories bizarre and nonsensical. In the course of the film, however, Rukh has proven to be right, and Benet is particularly generous in his new praise for Rukh. But unfortunately, the wonderful new element that Rukh has discovered has the unpleasant side effect of turning him into a crazy killing machine (do not you hate it when that happens?). While this could just have been a nice nice scientist turning into a crazy story, the plot was well constructed, the characters well developed, and the crazy Rukh was NOT a one-dimensional killer, but complex and interesting. The movie is for everyone except for people who hate old horror films. One can really see that Universal Pictures pulled out all the stops and instead of the cheap quickies made a movie on a larger budget, which both Lugosi and Karloff made unhappy in later years. Good stuff.
