If you still remember the summer when you had your first kiss, the first boy or the first puppy lover ... this movie is for you! OK, so this movie would never win an Oscar, BUT as a Dominican. I loved it. There are some things in the movie that could easily go over your head if you are not part of the culture ... the children Educated by a grandmother who is a mother and father, the youngest son becomes a Cafe Bustelo can ( sooo Dominicans!) bathed and bathed. Judy is molested by the neighbors, goes to church and lights a prayer candle ... the brilliance of the film was in those little details. Granted, it was not a draw for all the cinematic extravagances of the works, but it should not be NOR, it should be an educational tool for those who want to learn about Latin culture (Hint: make new friends instead). The film was more of a bittersweet, faux-cumentery series that kept it real without taking itself too seriously. As in the tradition of "Y Tu Mama Tambien", this was simply the story of a boy. I recommend it (especialmente si eres Dominicano!) = O)
