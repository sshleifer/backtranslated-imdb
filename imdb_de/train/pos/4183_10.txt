I had seen this movie a long time ago, but found it amazing and until today it has always surprised me. <br /> <br /> A wonderful movie describing the report of a group of Australian commandos trying to sink some Japanese ships in the port of Singapore during World War II. <br /> <br /> These commands are captured in civilian clothes and regarded as spies by the Japanese prisoners. However, something happens that has not been much explored in any World War II Hollywood movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> There is a close and friendly relationship between the prisoners and the prisoners. They respect each other while the captain of the captured Australian soldiers becomes best friends with a senior Japanese prison guard. This is the most wonderful part of the entire movie and it really tugs your heart. <br /> Soon, one day, as the two friends are talking, the Australian captain learns that some other prisoners will be brought to justice. He was executed for the sinking of the Jap ships in the port of Singapore. He mentions that it was his team, and not some other one, that had lowered the ships to his Japanese friend, and when he heard this, the Japanese guard told him to stay calm as this would lead to it could be that his entire group is executed. However, the captain remains undeterred in confessing this to the Japanese authorities. <br /> <br /> Finally, they are sentenced to death by the Japanese authorities in the most respectful way that complies with their rules. This is the highest honor given to captive warriors in Japan. <br /> <br /> This is the most impressive part of the film, where the Aussie soldiers are waiting for their imminent death and the tense indecision of the friendly Japanese guard that exists. I'm still not ready to believe that his Australian friend confessed to being guilty. <br /> <br /> I will not reveal the end here. But it's worse than you can imagine and can easily make you cry. All in all, an excellent underrated film that may not have received the recognition it deserves internationally. Get a copy today and be fascinated.
