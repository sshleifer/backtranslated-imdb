A great, funny, sweet movie starring Morgan Freeman (who plays himself), who meets a Spanish girl named Scarlet (Paz Vega) in a small shop while exploring a possible independent film. I was a bit dubious about the movie for the first ten minutes, but once in the store, I really started to enjoy the movie. It shows how a positive attitude can change something. It does not contain any complex plots and it is easy to follow, but it will lift the saddest moods and make you smile without the need for a clich√© romance. It contains several scenes all the way that will make you laugh at your pages. A very rare masterpiece!
