I spent 5 hours in this movie. Nothing I've ever seen comes close to the delicious sparkle I've been working on in this movie. It does not matter if the women are advanced aging dementia, human fear will bulge off the screen. The film, which is personally engaged to the ninth degree, adds an undeniable shared feeling for our lives. I enjoyed this game with rough, wounded bile deep inside me. It enables a mutually shared disguise in the history of human encounters that reaches far deeper into the pain, isolation and distorted views of oneself and others. The result forgives us for forming a lukewarm bridge that stretches from the muddy mud of the dead we must meet. The birth in the search for real people is a happy pursuit. The quest for realism intersects with the dark soil of our bankrupt culture.
