I saw this movie for the first time as a little boy and recently bought it on DVD. James Stewart sums up the role of Chip Hardesty, a diligent and dedicated FBI agent. His life in the office is related to his family life, which is not all rosy. His wife (an excellent portrayal of Vera Miles) lives in fear of the dangerous nature of his job, and they even split up for a while; Sam Crandall's best friend and colleague Sam Crandall (Murray Hamilton) is killed in a shootout; Chip's son, Mike, joins the Marines during World War II. With all this, the family continues with courage and dignity. <br /> <br /> The action sequences are quite exciting and the semi-documentary style of the movie is effective. And the music of Max Steiner says it all; Loyalty, bravery and integrity. <br /> <br /> This country is greatly indebted to the men and women of the FBI and indeed to J. Edgar Hoover. If the nature of Mr Hoover's vigilance had been observed, we might have spared September 11, the increase in crimes against children and many of the honest politicians we had suffered since his death.
