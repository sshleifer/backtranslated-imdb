A beautiful new print from "Zabriskie Point" plays in Paris and seems to work well in the Latin Quarter. It's time for a full review of the movie. Let's hope that the new print means that in the near future a DVD with a few revealing "extras" will hit the market. <br /> <br /> I remember seeing ZP when it came out and thinking it was a downing hole. This time I was totally stunned and would call it an "almost missing" masterpiece. The first part of the film is a time capsule from Los Angeles in the late 60s. I lived there and Antonioni masterfully recorded the essence of the place. Kudos to production designer Dean Tavoularis, who has found some incredible locations and done a great job. <br /> <br /> The pressure I've seen runs for 1 hour and 50 minutes. People under the age of 16 (or 18, whom I can not remember) are prohibited. I suspect that there is a lot of restored material in this print. SPOILER - I wonder how much of the desert sex scene was originally cut. What looks like today seems rather tame by today's standards. <br /> <br /> There is no soundtrack music until almost 1 hour after the movie starts. Before we hear noise such as radio broadcasts, etc., Antonioni was very daring to do so. I remember how much was being done at the time of lack of acting skills of non-actors Mark Frechette and Daria Halprin. This time Frechette did not bother me. Halprin is weaker, but gradually improves as the movie continues. <br /> <br /> Much of the uprising of the student uprisings looks like stock footage to me. A setting has a different aspect ratio and is distorted by the widescreen. Of course there is staged material, but not too much. <br /> <br /> I'm still trying to figure out how Antonioni made some shots of Frechette flying the plane. It looks like he has really flown - in some shots there is no blue screen or double. <br /> <br /> I hope I can see the movie a second time. Highly recommended to all Antonioni fans.
