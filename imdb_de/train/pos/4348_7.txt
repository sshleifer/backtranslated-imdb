Paul Reiser steps back from the standup comedy spotlight to write a warm and gentle affectionate family story - what we see and what we do not see, what we expect and what surprises us. THE THING about MY FOLKS does not set any new standards for the movie, but it's a beautiful, well-narrated story that reminds us of the important bonds of the family. <br /> <br /> Sam Kleinman (Peter Falk) was a workaholic who at times took his wife Muriel (Olympia Dukakis), his daughters (Mackenzie Connolly and Lydia Jordan) and his son Ben (Paul Reiser) into the background , One day, Muriel leaves a message that she is going after years of marriage! Her daughters, along with Ben's wife Rachel (Elizabeth Perkins), immediately start searching for their whereabouts. The confused, hurt and angry Sam leaves Sam alone on a road trip with his son Ben. The road trip becomes a time for the two men to find out who each other is and what they each mean for their status as father and son and as family members. Sam relaxes for the first time in his life and introduces the now workaholic Ben with the joys and the fun of living. The journey ends with a phone call about the whereabouts of Muriel and why she left, and the regrouping of the smarter family marks the warm end of the story. It's not all as it seemed: it's better and different. <br /> <br /> Falk and Reiser play off each other like the pros, but in many ways, the movie is one of the short moments in which Olympia Dukakis plays is on screen, reminding us that she is one of the strongest Matriarch in the movie is. Worth seeing. Grady harp
