What can I say about this movie that has not been said yet? Well, to tell the truth, a lot of it looks very fake like the punches and kicks. Like Charlie Sheen, although this was real, I do not know. I'm sure they would beat her harder and kick her if that were the case. The scenes of pinching and hot oil, however, look very real. and the last pin in the eye scene is amazingly finished and is probably the only one on the movie that ever shocked me.
