Bell Book and Candle was released in December 1958 and includes James Stewart, Kim Novak and Jack Lemmon. and Ernie Kovaks. This film had James Stewart and Kim Novak in their second mating (after the Alfred Hitchcock classic Vertigo, which was released in the same year). This was Stewart's last film as a romantic lead role, as he was found to be too old at age 50 to play that role. The film is about a witch played by Kim Novak, who is attracted by James Stewart as a mortal. She enchants him and he falls head over heels in love with her. I enjoyed the movie and its cast. This film was a modest success at that time, which was nominated for a Golden Globe for the best film comedy. GimmeClassics
