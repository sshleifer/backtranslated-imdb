I have not laughed so much about a movie in a while. I was allowed to go for a preliminary examination and was thrilled because I had absolutely seen it. I had tears in my eyes throughout the movie. The audience shared my laughter and clapped and screamed most of the movie. <br /> <br /> Kudos to Steve Carrell (of whom I have already been a fan). He proves his enormous talent for the comedy in this film. He has a style I have not seen before. And Catherine Keener is as always excellent. Thankfully, there was no cameo by Will Ferrell (I love him, but I saw him too much this summer). <br /> <br /> In this movie, there were parts of the comic genius. Partly thanks to Carrell and partly thanks to the font (also Carrell). The growing scene and the speeddater with the "obvious problem" were absolutely hysterical. <br /> <br /> I'll definitely see '40 Year Old Virgin' when it's released. My tip: Watch the whole thing and watch a huge movie.
