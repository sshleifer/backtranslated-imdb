With lots of sunshine, gossamer light and shadows streaming through windows and into rooms, tracking moving shots with handheld cameras, making sharp cuts and extreme close ups here and there, photography is the thing in this interesting, artistically interesting area done film. <br /> <br /> The storyline of this film begins with a fluff over a beauty contest. The movie starts on a warm Sunday at the local swimming pool, where we meet pretty Lucienne aka Lulu (played by Louise Brooks) - a kind of show show in front of the gaping men around the pool. She soon decides to enter France herself in the Miss Europe beauty contest, much to the chagrin of her very jealous, in love lover (a rather annoying guy, really). The ten contestants jump over the runway and show off in bathing suits, while the winner is selected as the participant to receive the longest applause (I was surprised that the girls could not run slower to extend their time - and so did Applause -) the catwalk?!). Lulu is soon persecuted by a prince and a maharaja, but her ingenious Beau may not pay attention to the attention that other men or her worshiping audience bring to them (that's why I want him to just cook her in his house) , and out of sight, right?!). Louise Brooks is beautiful and charming, her presence helps to make this film better, but it is really the way he is photographed that caught my interest the most. A bit distracting is the funny sound, which deviates a bit. However, the print in this version looked very clear and full of contrast. When I was watching, I tried to overlook the sound problems and visually watch the movie, and I found the movie excellent and worth watching.
