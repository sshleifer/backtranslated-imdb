I will not repeat everything that has already been said by other viewers of this film. <br /> <br /> This is an excellent movie in my opinion, not just as a very human story about the evolving relationship between a father and his grown son, but also a small window into the world of Islam, for those like me, who are not very familiar with this religion. <br /> <br /> An important aspect of this story is that of the young man's relationship to his father's beliefs and practices, and how his attitude towards religion seems to subtly change as we travel with them progress well made film that I would recommend to anyone with brain and heart.
