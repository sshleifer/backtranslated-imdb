Zero Day is based on the Columbine High School massacre. and it's a video diary of two boys. At first you do not know what's going to happen, you think it's just a bad student movie. until they start talking about the horrible things they will do in this quiet school. until they start talking about pipe bombs and cannons and shooting into the forest. You can say a lot about this movie. Everyone knows that this movie is a movie you forget when you watch a movie and watch a real video made by two boys. <br /> <br /> The two boys behave as if they had a strange cult. They burn everything there stuff. like playstation games books dvd homework stuff school stuff. These two boys can all be your friends or brothers or the people you see on the street. It's about everyday activities (and that's a weapon). The videos mention how bullying happens to them and how people say things about their clothes and the things they like. I'm not saying it's right, but many people are doing that. <br /> <br /> and also the thing is that people suspect that they like it because of the sensitive topic that they chose in this movie. <br /> <br /> so my review on zero day. <br /> <br /> and let's say that the end of the shooting scene is messed up.
