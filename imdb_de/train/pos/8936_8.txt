After "Beau Travail" everyone was waiting for Claire Denis to do a sequel masterpiece that had never arrived. Now it is time. Denis makes a quantum leap in this film, an orgy of beautiful cinematography, elliptical cut and wantonly opaque narrative events that feel weird and alien. There is a nominal conspiracy (partially derived from the eponymous Jean Luc Nancy book) about a mature man in need of a heart transplant who seeks a Tahitian son whom he had left long ago; Mostly, however, it is about exploring the idea of ​​personal and cultural break-ins. To get a full understanding, some considerations are needed, and at the end there are speed issues, but it's still more advanced and gripping than anything else I've seen this year. Miss it at your risk.
