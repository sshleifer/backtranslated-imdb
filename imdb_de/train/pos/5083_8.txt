In the hands of a few actors like Claudette Colbert and Robert Ryan, this film could have become stupid and banal. But with these two experienced thespians I felt that "Silent Fury" was an exciting and pleasurable little puzzle. If her wedding is interrupted by a stranger who says Colbert is already married, and that he was the best man at this wedding, you can feel there is some sort of conspiracy against her at work. When Colbert, Ryan, and her lawyer attempted to refute the foreign allegation of a previous marriage, they are supported on every occasion by further evidence supporting the claim that she is indeed already married. While it's not very difficult to figure out who the biggest "villain" is, it's still fun as the intensity and pace of the story grows. All in all a good, solid mystery movie with outstanding performances by the two main actors and a good minor cast, which also includes the often underrated Paul Kelly.
