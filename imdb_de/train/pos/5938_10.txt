Another exquisite taste of a superhero movie after Batman: Dead End, which inspires our taste buds and wishes us more! That's what a real superhero film should look like and feel like! This is also a kind of fan movie. Attention to detail, character and action is undeniably real. Although this is a limited production of resources, it embarrasses the production of "other" superhero films that are budgeted, star-studded, and extrapolated. Here, the main and secondary characters look and look as if they were real people. Finally a superman who actually looks "great" and looks like the real one! Batman, as it should be, without the eye-catching, rubberized, tattered body armor to conceal arid bodies for overpaid actors who do not deliver. I just wish a sensible Warner Bros. manager gives the OK to produce an adaptation of this full-length piece of jewelry. I do not care if it's in the theater or directly on DVD, I would never tire of looking at it. But the plot itself is worth my hard-earned dough. Hope the "Bigwigs" in Marvel & DC productions take a look at what a really well-made superhero movie should look like. No more "Batman & Robin" fiasco or Hulk, Daredevil etc. Learn from these directors and learn that there should be no reason to "reinvent" the hero for the movie just to have "bomb" theater. Mr. Collora ... we need more directors like you !!
