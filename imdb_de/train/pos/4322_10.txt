You may not be interested in the filmmaker's social commentary or position (I myself am confused about the "insignificant" angle that Kasdan seemed to promote), as clearly the actions taken in the film promote CERTAIN significance End confuses me). However, it is absolutely undeniable how the story is presented; the great symbolism everywhere; the threaded signatures; visuals; Dialogue ?? is absolute masterpiece. I've seen the movie dozens of times and still admire its perfection. There is no moment, no action, no cut or no line that does not have anything to do with the subject. Realistic human performances by all actors. Scene by scene it is fantastically woven. <br /> <br /> I have a pretty good sapmeter. The buzzer never went out during this movie. If you are a thinker (and not a casual onlooker)? This movie delivers. Exponentially. Absolutely fascinating. (Do you need to agree with the message to appreciate the display, who cares if it makes you warm and fuzzy or not, was it interesting?) <br /> <br /> Did the movie touch me personally? significant. In my Top 5. <br /> <br /> Note: The reviewer of the front page speaks clearly of a faulty African American perception. What he may not have realized is a hand? Shake. No transfer. The "mentally dead white man" simply saw a man he should respect and admire. And he did something about it. The fact that he was black had little, if anything, to do anything (color is simply used to draw the parallel, and the abyss.) It is no coincidence that the opening sequence shifts from black to white to color.) , If you see the blacks in this movie as "tokens"? You may want to reevaluate your fear. Maybe you see only black and white. Just a thought.
