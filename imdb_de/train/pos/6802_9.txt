It's better to watch this episode from the beginning, because if you start looking at it later, you'll be confused about what's going on with Clark's life. <br /> <br /> But that's the twist; Clark is stuck in an alternate reality. Lana is devoted to him. Lex has lost most of his legs and is sitting in a wheelchair because he left Clark at the bridge accident when he misses the pilot of the series. Martha is married to Lionel. The only constant is his most faithful friend Chloe, who still believes in who he is. And, oh yes, he has no superpowers. He's in a psychiatric ward because he's in a fantasy world where he has powers, and he's being ridiculed for believing so. Apart from Chloe, there is a mysterious figure who believes in Clark: a black who, in alternative reality, is also a resident of the institution and believes he is from Mars. Clark must remain faithful to everything he believes is truly a reality and not be brainwashed by the institution's psychiatrist, who is indeed the fourth Phantom Zone refugee. This episode is absolutely stunning and shocking. It also offers a fresh twist from the usual "Smallville" episode.
