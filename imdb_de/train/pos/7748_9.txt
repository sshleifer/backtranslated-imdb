Tom had long wanted to make a movie, and so did he. it's like having imagined a dirty and worn notebook with great little ideas that he has been filling and carrying around for 10 years. No Grant character transformations, no Hollywood ingredients, just life and a bit of magic. The balance between speed, humor and drama is perfectly balanced. This movie takes you on a journey that's over before you realize how beautiful it was. The music is great and your eyes will be equally satisfied. The fact that this film is not about anything, just a series of sketches of people mainly connected by a group of characters makes it very pleasant and surprisingly entertaining. It happens between the lines. to see or not to see, is that?
