Again, it seems illogical to me that "Arthur" earns only 6.4 out of 10 possible points. Steve Gordon's one-shot masterpiece is the totally "unlikely", if not the "impossible," fusing of very different elements. That he has managed to make alcoholism laughable instead of acting tragically is wonderful in itself. The fact that he gave Dudley Moore his finest role and gave every other cinematic element here its optimal effect, including the score, seems to me to be patent and outrageous. I challenge everyone to sit through this movie and not laugh out loud. But apparently almost a third of the audience has made it. Well, I find and find Gordon's efforts both ridiculous and amiable, and the quirks of Geraldine Fitzgerald's great-aunt and Stephen Elliott's murderous, willing father-in-law gems of background character. Even the black chauffeur could escape tutelage, and the late Sir John Gielgud was right in taking his fee but wrong to take on his role. "Arthur" does not make any effort to "lower", rationalize much less, the scourge of "alcoholism" (hey, iFit is not alcohol, it's other drugs of choice, including meth, and addictions are just symptoms, not targets ) simply watches in his own questionable way.
