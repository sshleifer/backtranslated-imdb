I was one of about 200 people lucky enough to see an early glimpse of this movie. <br /> <br /> Stardust follows Tristan to a young man looking for a fallen star and brings him back to the woman to prove his love for her. The only catch is that the star fell on the other side of the wall, a gateway between England and a magical kingdom called Stormhold. <br /> <br /> This movie was just a pleasure to look at, it has something in it. For all, all the action scenes are beautifully played and the comedy is spread throughout the film, which makes them weird without being annoying. If I had to compare the preferences with another movie, it would probably be The Princess Bride, a classic. <br /> <br /> All performances are outstanding, the beautiful Claire Danes lets you love in her portrayal of Yvaine The trusting naive star and undervalued Michelle Pfeiffer delivers an outstanding performance as Larnia ... but the performance you speak about Robert de Niro is ... in every scene he's in, he steals the show ... <br /> <br /> If you fancy a funny fantasy love story, this is the movie. Guys are not rejected by the description, there's enough action comedy and not too much eye candy with Claire Danes and Michelle Pfeiffer to keep you entertained. The cinematography is dead and sticks to the feeling of the film ... nothing about the film seems to be forced.
