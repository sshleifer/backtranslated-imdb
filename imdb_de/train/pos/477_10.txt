Hello everybody, I've been a chess lover for about 6 years. I think I'm pretty obsessed with chess, but hopefully not as much as the central character in this movie. The figure reflects a real chess player named Curt von Bardeleben, who committed suicide in 1924. He is famous for a game he played against Steinitz, where Steinitz played a nice combination. Instead of stepping back, he just walked out of the tournament hall and never returned. The social inability of the central figure is unfortunately a treat of some serious grandmasters, sometimes in chess tournaments. I think chess is a huge sacrifice, and in other areas of life it can sometimes lead to imbalances. An important example is the chess legend Bobby Fischer. Although he is a genius, he was also very worried in many ways. In the film, a World Cup match between an Italian grandmaster and Luhin is presented. The format is a knockout competition that Fide's World Government sometimes used as a format itself - from 128 players to 2 in the final. However, this was a group knockout - which is also a realistic format in which the winners of each group play against each other. <br /> <br /> The postponement position is a fascinating chess puzzle. I even wrote a Youtube video about it so you can explore the winning combination in detail - have fun! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZPtdtPhwdM Best wishes Tryfon
