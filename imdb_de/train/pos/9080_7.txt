Maybe I have to have my head examined, but I thought that would be a pretty good movie. The CG is not that bad. I have seen worse. The look of the creatures (and by creatures I mean the good and the bad snake) was pretty cool. The action scenes with the snakes were really good, I thought. Sometimes there were some logical mistakes, and the story does not always make sense. But for a creature function, there is much worse. A lot The other creatures seemed to have been taken from other films, so it's not completely original. I think, however, that the gist of the story is original. I also like this movie, but I still say that it was pretty good. I also liked the music. All in all, I believe that Dragon Wars is a 7/10
