This short film is a mystery. I miss the words, because this is almost indescribable. Technically exceptional after more than 90 years (the look is remarkable and sometimes even amazing). This is not something you watch when you like things that are banal or "normal" because it is the most secure. This is a strange group, a gang. It's worth trying, but if things like Ren and Stimpy hurt your head, you should skip this. Recommended.
