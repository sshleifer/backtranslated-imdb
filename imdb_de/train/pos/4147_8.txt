I do not think this movie is for everyone. But I saw it this weekend in Seattle and thought it was so funny. I have not laughed so long in a movie. I found the entire cast well done. They will laugh from the first moment to the last scene. I suspect that some moviegoers (especially those who take WAY too seriously) are put off by this kind of humor. Not me. The movie was a real surprise. The entire theater was laughing with laughter throughout the show I attended. I think a lot of people were amused and happy to have a good time in the cinema for a change. I can not wait to see it again! If you fancy LOL, then this is the place for you. Funny funny funny funny!
