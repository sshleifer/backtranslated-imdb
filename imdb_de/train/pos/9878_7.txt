almost every review of this movie was pretty bad. It's not pretty bad, it's actually pretty good, if not great. The Judy Garland figure could have been annoying, but she did not allow it. At some point I'm a fan of brooding, overbearing and exaggerating Van Heflin, at least in the early 40s. Judy's singing is great, but the movie missed a big chance by not showing his relationship anymore. I gave it a 7.
