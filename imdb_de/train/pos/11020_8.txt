Walker has to outwit Quaien for survival. <br /> <br /> Directed by Renny Harlin (Driven, Mindhunters, A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dreammaster), an entertaining action shot was made without interruption. This movie is a spectacular, exciting, visually exciting action image with a lot of dark humor. This was one of the biggest hits of 1993. This is one of Harlin's best movie. Lithgow is a fantastic entertaining villain. Stallone has certainly made a brief comeback of this hot thriller. This is probably Harlin's best work as a filmmaker. <br /> <br /> DVD has a sharp anamorphic widescreen transmission (2.35: 1) and a terrific Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound.
