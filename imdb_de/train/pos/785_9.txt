I was of Irish descent and loved this movie. Not only was the guy hot and funny, he was also sincere and honest. I loved the girl he fell in love with, she was pretty. They were such a cute couple. The end was so sad. Love this movie! Although it's a bit dirty, it's reminiscent of a British or Irish version of Prime. If you liked this movie, you should watch Prime. The same action falls the young man for older women, older women for the young man. Many paths intersect, in the end the best decision is made or the task is done. I have nothing else to say without ruining the whole movie, though I thought the Frenchman was ugly, less appealing to me. Um ... if you like Irish movies, I would recommend "Circle of Friends", the movie is so good. Quick quote that you might not get if you do not see it "Well, my dinner is ruined." LOL
