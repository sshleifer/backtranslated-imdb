The first 50 minutes of this movie were pretty boring. The focus was on the personal issues Doyle had, including his sick wife, death threats from fans, a pushy publisher, and feelings of guilt about his mentally ill father. Although these topics had a significant impact on Doyle's life, I was more curious about the birth of Sherlock Holmes. The last 40 minutes were excellent. We finally got a look into Doyle's head, how he created Holmes and why he had to "kill" Holmes. The actors are excellent. Including the fascinating Selden, played by Tim McInnerny, Arthur Conan Doyle, a convincing role, the Douglas Henshall and Brian Cox as a role model for Sherlock Holmes and dr. Bell played. The locations are good, especially for a TV movie and the camera work is nice. If the first 50 minutes were as good as the last 40 minutes, this would have been a small masterpiece.
