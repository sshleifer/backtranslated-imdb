WHERE THE SIDEWALK ENDS deserves to be a well-known film by Otto Preminger, the man who gave LAURA to the world. And this time he has the same co-stars: DANA ANDREWS and GENE TIERNEY. It must be said that Tierney is under-utilized here, which is more of a supportive role, while the spotlight on Andrews goes too far, one night he kills a man who arrests him. When he suspects a taxi driver (TOM TULLY), he goes along with the investigation of the murder, but feels guilty because he falls in love with the daughter of the taxi driver (GENE TIERNEY). By the way, Tierney looks a bit too elegant for the girl she plays here and does not seem to fit into the dark background elements of the story. <br /> <br /> The story takes a dark turn in the investigation It goes deeper and it is discovered that the murdered from his military service had a silver plate in his head. In the end, it becomes a moral story in which Andrews develops a conscience about his crime. <br /> <br /> It's fascinating as a movie noir with capable performances of a strong minor cast. A good introduction to the Noir field, powerfully led by Preminger and well played by Andrews and Tierney despite the slight miscast of their character.
