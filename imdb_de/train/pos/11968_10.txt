Full House is a great show. I grew up with it today. I started seeing it when I was 8 years old, and now I'm 12 and I still see it. I fell in love with all the characters, especially Stephanie. she is my favorite. She had such a sense of humor. If there are people who barely watch the show, you should do so because you will love it. I was addicted to the first show I saw in 2002, which happened to be the first episode. It's really a good show. I really think that this show in families should go back to many generations. and it's also great because it's an appropriate show for all ages. and for all parents, children are taught how to continue their lives. nothing terrible happens, like violence or swearing. It's just a really great sit-com. I give 5 out of 5 stars. What do you think? Oh and the best time to see it is when you are sick at home from school or even from the old office. This will make you feel much better. Trust me, I'm hardly sick at home, but I still know you'll feel better about it. And for those of you who think the show is stupid, it's too bad for you because you do not get that far in life, even if you're happy with your life. You should really see it and you will be addicted to it. I'm just telling you what happened to me and everyone else who started watching this great show. Well, I have to have lunch. Remember, you must see full house soon!
