The Dana Andrews cycle Noirs by Otto Preminger belongs to the (largely) unsung jewels of the genre. Lacking in paranoia, misogyny, or hysteria, they may have been out of place at the time, but the clear imagery, the complex play on identity, masculinity and representation, the subversion of traditional psychological principles, the austere geometric style, are astounding today modern and similar to Melville. The lucid ironies of this film are so harsh, brutal and ironic that the "happy" ending is one of the cruelest in Hollywood history. Brilliant also on the level of the entertaining thriller, tense and full of double-edged dialogues.
