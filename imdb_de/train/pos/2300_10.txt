This movie has so many wonderful elements! Of course the debut of Reese Witherspoon is wonderful, but so is her chemistry with Jason London. The score is remarkable, airy and pure. James Newton Howard improves the quality of every film he composes tenfold. He also seems to be a knack for Youth Lost Days, be sure he gets his score for "Peter Pan" and the haunting gothic music of "The Village". I saw this movie for the first time at 13 or 14 and now I do not just cry at the end, I have one or two tears of nostalgia. Show this movie to your daughters. It becomes a lifelong comfort movie.
