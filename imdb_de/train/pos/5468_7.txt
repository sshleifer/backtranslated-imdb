I saw the restored or no other version of "Baby Face" with Barbara Stanwyck until I caught her on TCM. What a great movie! In a nutshell Lily lives in a Speakeasy, she was pimped by her own father since her 14th year! Then he is still in the air and he is dead when he left Lily (Stanwyck) alone for his black maid Chico, who was played very nicely by Theresa Harris. Lily goes to the big city (New York) and decides to take her sex to the top. She does it in a great style! <br /> <br /> She seduces a dumpy office worker, who is on the ground floor, and goes on to go through men like disposable candies! One drops his fiancee and kills his close father-in-law, also Lily's sugar-daddy, and then commits suicide! Lily hardly blinks! STanwyck is great as a girl who really does not know what love is. <br /> <br /> In Paris, she falls in love with Courtland, played by George Brent Bolzen. She is almost free with Chico and half a million. She realizes that she loved Court! Lily races to find him, but will she be late? <br /> <br /> This is Hollywood at its best. Stanwyck is huge and the look and music in the movie are perfect. This reminded me of "Original Sin" with Angelina Jolie, another unjustly ignored movie with an amoral woman. Those who do not like movies having ultra-romantic tastes will not like Baby FAce better, those who believe in sex, love and power love it. Highly recommended! See it!
