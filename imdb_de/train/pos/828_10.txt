I noticed that A NEW HOPE and THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK are in the TOP 10, but this is not even in the TOP 100. <br /> <br /> This film has a bad reputation for Ewok, but there are so many reasons to love this movie: <br /> <br /> - The rescue of Han Solo from Jabba: This official sums up the Han Solo in Debt Subplot, which was founded when we first met the character in A NEW HOPE. <br /> <br /> - The Emperor has finally been unmasked: Well, that may not work so well now that the prequels are out, but we first saw the Emperor as children. <br /> <br /> - The Speeder Bike Chase: Okay, so this was a moment for special effects. But it was definitely one of the most memorable and exciting moments in all the movies! <br /> <br /> - The 3-part climax: 1) The Battle of Endor (led by Han and Leia) 2) Luke confronts his father & The sinking of the Emperor 3) The destruction of the second Death Star (Lando's moment) <br /> <br /> - The Closing Ceremony with Our Heroes: As I said, this movie gets a lot of crap because of the Ewoks But I think it's kinda cool that while the entire galaxy is celebrating the FALL OF THE EMPIRE, our heroes are their own celebrate private party in the forest with each other. All in all, this was a great finale chapter for our heroes and a fitting end to the STAR WARS story.
