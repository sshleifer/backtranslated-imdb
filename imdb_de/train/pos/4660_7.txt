"Hot Millions" is a well-written, well-traded story about an embezzler who steals (whoops! - a too low word for an embezzler, according to Peter Ustinov's main character) a "hot million" from the London branch of a US company , which establishes shell companies on the continent and uses the company's supposedly secure computer to transfer funds to them. (Remember, spoiler police, this is a comedy, not a mystery.) Starting in 1968, the appearance of computers in this film may seem naive for the more computer-literate population today; But as one who worked with computers prior to the release of this movie, I would say that even then it sounds like it was written by and for computer illiterates, probably on purpose, for the droll comedies of that British band strengthen. <br /> <br /> If someone has little taste for this kind of entertainment, the movie seems to be sluggish. Fortunately, it has a nice ending. Unfortunately, the credits give no indication of the classical music used in it - the symphonic piece at the end and the piano flute duet in the middle - only the song of Lulu, which I do not even remember.
