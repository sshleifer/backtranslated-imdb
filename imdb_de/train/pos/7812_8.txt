A long film about a very important character from South Africa, Stephen Biko. He is one of those blacks who did not survive apartheid and actually died long before their normal time. However, the old film does not show how important Biko was, what he really represented. His life and teachings are reduced to a minimum, at best some funny remarks. The 1987 film was aimed at marginalizing South Africa, which would lead to liberation. The film is therefore intended to show how irrational South African supporters of apartheid 1987 are. To show this, the film has to look beyond Biko's death, so concentrate his discourse not on Biko, but on a white liberal journalist and his escape from the absurd system in which he lives. His escape becomes necessary because he and his family are victims he falls victim to, and because after his death he wants to publish the first book on Biko, which can only happen in England. The film shows a way to escape South Africa while apartheid is still standing and killing. So do not expect this path to be realistic and true. It could not be. But the film has aged enormously because it does not show South Africa with any historical distancing, the distance that has taken place under Nelson Mandela's presidency, which is referred to as forgiveness, provided those who want to forgive speak out. The film is strong and emotional, but this historical border makes it rather weak today, especially since the film does not mention the third race community, the Indians. Panegyric books or films all have this flaw: they only look at the person they are supposed to portray from a single point of view. That explains why the movie has aged so much, seems to come from so long ago as if nothing had changed. A remake is necessary. <br /> <br /> Dr. Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University of Versailles Saint Quentin and Yvelines, CEGID
