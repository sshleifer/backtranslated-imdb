At the beginning of its 100th anniversary, Saura brought together an unprecedented wealth of talent from the Spanish performing arts scene to bring this quintessential love song to their homeland. The twelve "impressions" of the suite are presented without narration in harsh environment, so that the power of each performance in front of Saura's camera can explode. The creative use of large, flat mirrors and mirrors moving throughout the set, combined with screens, shadows, fire, rain, and back projection, adds a dramatic effect to the diverse selection of vocals, dance, and instrumental music. Photos by Albeniz reappear throughout the program, combining the passion of music with its great creator. Saura includes all Spaniards on stage, from the beautiful elegance of older flamenco dancers in costume to happy dancing children with their teachers.
