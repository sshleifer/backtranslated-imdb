I'm glad that users (as of this date) who enjoyed this movie are now coming forward. I do not understand the people who did not like this movie - it seems they expected a serious (?!?!?) Treatment! Come on, how the hell can you take the premise of a killer snowman seriously? The filmmakers knew this was a stupid premise, and they did not try to deny it. The straightforward delivery of scenes actually makes it fun! Yes, there are times when the low budget is shown (like this explosion scene), but I think a costly look would have taken away the fun of the movie! So if you like B-movies and the silly premise appeals to you, then you will certainly like "Jack Frost".
