I happened to come across "My Tutor Friend" surfing on TV a year or two ago. Previously, I had never seen Korean movies in my life. So MTF was really the first Korean movie I've ever seen. And what a nice surprise! I was totally amused from beginning to end and had a lot of fun laughing. His comic style is very different from the Hong Kong comic movies (which I've been used to all my life and therefore tired of), bringing fresh air into my modest movie viewing experience. I thought there are some scenes and tricks in MTF that are pretty funny, funny and original. <br /> <br /> I saw MTF for the second time a few days ago and have seen it before, the surprising / weird effect on me was somehow mitigated. However, that did not affect my opinion on the film in any way. Instead, something else came through this time - it moved me - the story of how two young, seemingly "incompatible" enemies, who are totally incompatible, are thrown together and how they gradually dissolve their differences and start caring for each other, without the feelings even reminding me reminds me of the long-gone high school days. For me, Su Wan and Ji Hoon are actually compatible, as they both have something pure and genuine in them, a trait that separates them from people like Ji Hoons naughty girlfriend. <br /> <br /> The film is The first part deals with the "fight" between Su Wan and Ji Hoon and is more violent and faster. After Ji Hoon has graduated and Su Wan dances the provocative dance (after Ji Hoon), things change. The pace slows down and ... Ji Hoon suddenly realizes that he cares more about Su Wan than he could ever imagine. The second part is about developing their mutual feelings, which of course leads to a happy ending with a final showdown with the gang boss. <br /> <br /> Just one last comment. I find that a bit unbelievable - the fact that a 21-year-old, self-styled "bad boy" would feel embarrassed to be almost naked in front of the girl he harasses and loses his cool is just a little bit .. odd I think that shows that Ji Hoon is just a pure boy and not really what he looks like. By the way, Kwong San Woo (Ji Hoon) has a sexy body and a perfect figure! ;-) <br /> <br /> MTF is definitely on my list of the top 10 most popular movies of all time.
