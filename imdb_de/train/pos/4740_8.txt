OK, it's by no means a perfect movie, but I do not agree with the general IMDb opinion that it's really very bad. I saw a lot of Hong Kong Flix in the 1990s and loved the era very much. Back then, I never saw "Black Mask" and only saw it for the first time last week. Aside from the embarrassingly bad synchronization that my DVD copy did not allow me to turn off, the film contains the raw energy and courage that Hong Kong films permeated at that time. I still think that these guys, no matter what budget they have, put a magical element on the screen when it comes to action. Movies - I'm just guessing that they're missing the spontaneity of this movie and I like it feel very regulated, they will ever reach. What is it? It's the feeling that the filmmakers experimented while shooting and editing, without fear of leaving some blemishes for learning lessons for the next time. This makes watching movies even funnier and more dangerous for me.
