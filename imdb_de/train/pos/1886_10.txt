I have loved this movie since its 1981 debut! I've lost track of how many times I've seen it! It always makes me laugh or cheer when I feel bad. The three leads are awesome and the script is priceless, and how do you not get nostalgic when listening to the theme song? I think I quote this movie without realizing it. I basically know the entire script. When someone looks at it for the first time, I have to hold back and say something about how funny the next line is. I can not even restrict it, though Sir John's character is probably the most memorable. The famous "I'll alert the media" when Arthur announces his intention to take a bath is still invaluable, but the list is truly endless. The scene with Arthur, who will soon be the house of the fianc√©e, is a hoot, especially his interactions with the moose. Do yourself a favor and watch this movie!
