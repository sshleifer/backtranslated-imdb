I was in the movie, too, but I do not know if they are actually staging this scene. On the way back from a school trip (2005) we stopped at a gas station at the same time as they were making the film. and we were asked (all of us) to run in and call Go! Free bird! We were all around 10 years old. Could anyone who saw the movie say if this part is actually in the movie? It would be great to know! I remember thinking that the movie never came out because it took two and a half years before it was released. All your comments seem to be good, so I think it was a pretty successful movie, I could buy it, but first I'd like to know if I'm there! : D Thanks
