I can not believe they took that from the air. Especially if they had only a few episodes left. My daughter, my sister and some of my friends have enjoyed this show. We were so upset when they stopped because of so-called ratings. It is not fair to the people who saw this show from the beginning. We had the right to see the end. I wish they would cast a total vote of anyone with a thrice-yearly electoral system. You could send papers by mail and we as viewers could give a total vote on all the programs we see or heard of. This could also help to promote a new show. People would see it and ask themselves what it is. Not only can you see what viewers are seeing, you can also use it as a tool for free promotion of TV and cable channels. We want to see the other episodes. Bring it back !!
