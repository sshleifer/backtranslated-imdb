I thought Mukhsin was wonderfully written. It's not just about entertainment. There are tons of subtle messages that I think Yasmin has tried to convey. And yes, it might be confusing for some of you (especially if you did not watch Sepet and / or Gubra 76 times) right? It's really ironic how the characters behave. Like the bossy neighbor, this prostitute is from Gubra. And the chick at the snooker pad proves to be religious and wife of the pious man in the future. <br /> <br /> And I absolutely love the voice-overs. It is rude and yet fresh. When they made a shot of Rumah Tumpangan Gamin's sign, Mukhsin's voice suddenly came out, "Bismillah Hiramannirrahim .." (the scene as he climbed the tree) in a bland manner reminding how wretched it is shown in the figure. For example, even the kids can be really sharp-tongued (complete with the shrill annoying voice) and just bad mouth, all the way through the movie. And how can you be such a busy person and talk about people when your own life is not clear. <br /> <br /> All I can say is that this film has met my expectations if it is not exceeded. <br /> <br /> It held me to the screen, I could not even avert my eyes. Not even make out in the cinema. Haha.
