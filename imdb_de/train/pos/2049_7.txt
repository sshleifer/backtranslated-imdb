This movie is rather cheesy, but I acknowledge that he at least tried to characterize his principles. There are some great moments in the movie and the dialogue also has some great moments. <br /> <br /> The Air Raid sequence may be the best part of the movie. <br /> <br /> I think I really like the idea of ​​how long a veteran will be for another veteran. Of course it is not so well done, but the premise is not bad at all. <br /> <br /> Tom
