This is a top Finnish film this year, even though Tango is close to Kabaree. A few years ago, director Lampela made another cute little movie called Rakastin ep√§toivoista naista (I fell in love with a desperate woman) on a beautiful Saturday afternoon movie in a small village / town. The actors may not be as pretty or beautiful as they are look beautiful. I sincerely hope many of you will receive a JUSSI statue (Finnish OSCAR) next spring. I think this movie could do it abroad, too.
