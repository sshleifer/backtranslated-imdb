Although I wanted to watch this movie since the first time I watched the trailer, I was deeply surprised by this movie. While some of the characters' characters and actions seemed a bit too cartoonish, the dark nature of the movie makes it a very different experience. Instead of the feel-good-cheerfulness, this film leads in a different direction, which turns out to be uplifting, but also disturbing. Most children will not understand some of the movie's darker moments, which makes it more suitable for adults. I was also impressed with the cinematography, which through animations and digital animations formed a seamless network of pans and inclinations. The score was solid again, proving Hans Zimmer to be an inspiration for animated scores, and I never thought I would really like Brian Adams' music.
