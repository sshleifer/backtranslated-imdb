That's why I love this website! I saw this movie on British television in the 1980s. Over the years, I've wished I knew more about it because it has remained as one of the most extraordinary things I've ever seen in my life. With barely a few key words to remember, I've tracked the movie here, and much of the information, including the fact that it's an off-Broadway musical, is interesting. I can not remember finding this movie sad or exploitative. On the contrary, the extraordinary relationship between mother and daughter has been remembered as a testimony of great strength, honor and dignity. Ironically, you may be thinking of the misery of her life. Maybe it's because I live in the UK, where blossoming glory in the old money's life is an established language, often endorsing misery as proof of good breeding. I saw it as a rare and unique representation of tremendous spirit, deep and profound humor, whose extremely fragile and finely balanced material gave it attitude and respect. In a way, I was sorry that it was being discussed as a "cult". Over the years, as it faded in my head, it shone above all as the brightest and most outstanding experience on television. It was such a deep private performance that it seems strange that it gets as public as if it were a New York musical. But maybe the daughter will be amused by such a result somewhere. She may have the last laugh .. (They made Jackie O 'a musical out of it)
