Middle-aged frustrated Assistant District Attorney George Maxwell (a good performer of George E. Carey, who also produced this picture) can no longer stand his naggy, frigid wife Edith (a perfectly bitchy Anne Bellamy). Worse still, poor George is being saddled up with a newborn baby sun and a lascivious lesbian teenage daughter (dishonest brunette Sheri Jackson). George has an adulterous drive with the lovely, alluring and free-spirited swinging hippie babysitter Candy Wilson (sexily played with sexy aplomb from the delicious, blonde knockout Patricia Wymer). Complications arise when George is blackmailed by the bitter Julia Freeman (a cute venomous phrase from Kathy Williams) who wants George to spring into her psychotic biker friend Laurence Mackey (a fearsome Robert Tessier wearing a head full of hair here) jail. Director Tom Laughlin (yep, the same guy who portrayed Billy Jack!) And scriptwriter James McLarty epitomize the gloriously hazy story with a winning and extremely entertaining surplus of delicious female nudity, sizzling softcore sex and raw violence. In addition, they capture the entire wild and unobstructed sensibility of the youth culture of the 60s and relate the plot in a short 75-minute runtime, ensuring that this film does not exceed his greeting. A special highlight is when Candy invites her groovy friends over the Maxwells-Haus to an impromptu basement bash, complete with pot tuxedos, music for the attack and, of course, hot, naked dance chicks. Robert O. Ragland's funky score hits the gnarly point. Stanton Fox's strong black-and-white cinematography gives the insane, vile impulses a particularly gloomy setting. Best of all, this movie is a wonderful showcase for the extremely charming and fresh-faced Elf Patricia Wymer, who positively lights the screen with her sweet, bubbly personality and enchanting beauty. A totally bad taste.
