My preference for Chris Rock varies with his films. I hated him after Lethal Weapon 4, but then I hated everyone in this movie. I like him when he is himself and does not hold back, as in Dogma. Well, that's his best yet, I did not expect it to be that good. I've been rejecting my ass the whole time. Chris Rock delivers a sweet, wonderful story, accompanied by one of the funniest comedies I've seen in a while. I loved it.
