In 1955, with Peter Finch and brilliant Kay Kendall, the British made a comedy called Simon and Laura. To this day, it is considered one of the finest examples of British comedy and, above all, how popular television sitcoms are becoming. It was and is an excellent example of self-referential cinema. <br /> <br /> Like Soapdish, a movie I'd never heard of until a few nights ago when I saw him on late television. I was a bit dubious at first, just because comedy is as hard as you know. <br /> <br /> However, I was pleasantly surprised and was pleased to see a very smart satire on American television during the day. It's been a while since I laughed so heartily. So, if you like satire, I would recommend you to see them. <br /> <br /> The main actors ?? Sally Field, Kevin Kline, Robert Downey and Cathy Moriarty? Just do a great job and show how sloppy and shallow the action is. As I watched it, I kept thinking, how much of this bum affects real life? That is, if actors ever have a real life? For example, as you probably know, Peter Sellers was known for hiding his true personality behind a variety of characters so nobody knew the real person. When I saw Sally Field starring Maggie with Celeste Talbot, I reconsidered the earlier British film in which Kay Kendall starred alongside Peter Finch in a TV sitcom ... <br /> <br /> Is it an I wonder that some actors have nervous breakdowns? And that feeling crystallized when Celeste finally confronted her daughter (Lori, played by Elizabeth Shue) and in an emotional moment repeated the fictitious lines she had used in an earlier episode of her daytime soap when she saw her fictitious daughter in front of her that's how it goes! Are you confused? Well, it's not all that, but the dialogue is amazing for originality, comedy, bitchiness, anger, corruption, duplicity and even ... love. <br /> <br /> The story? Well, there are many stories in this film that are all intertwined and that all end up matching (of course, but not like a Robert Altman movie, okay!), And not all are finally resolved. Life is not like that anyway, right? The pace is almost hectic, and you really have to look and listen carefully to catch all the gags and subtle jokes. Spend the 97 minutes of your life watching it. You will not regret the time required. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast performs well, although I have never done much at Whoopi Goldberg. The funniest exchange may take place between Robert Downey and Cathy Moriarty and for my money the latter steals so many scenes from others that she gets my vote as an outstanding player. I do not fool you, she gives the term bitch a completely new face ...
