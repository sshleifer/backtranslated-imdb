Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau started and ended their career together. Remember the grumpiest old man and the strangest couple that ever made us laugh. Lemmon and Matthau were one of Hollywood's most popular comedy teams of the last 100 years. Not as "slippery" as Pryor and Wilder, but the classic comedy team that reflected a more modern Marx Brothers routine. For example, the physical comedy as well as the mix of chaos for which Marx, Chaplin and Keaton were so famous. In the odd couple, Lemmon and Matthau play complete opposites that create chaos. The physical comedy is as unique as chaplins. The joke is usually self-centered, as opposed to transferring the joke to another. Not a typical movie, it is, in a sense, a comedy comedy with two old men defying two young teenagers in their prime. The chemistry between Lemmon and Matthau is enough entertainment. Although this movie is not for everyone, this is a great comedy.
