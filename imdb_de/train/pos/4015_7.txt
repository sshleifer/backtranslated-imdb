Johnny Yuma is one of the most satisfying western all'italiana that offers the freshness of many WAI's during the heyday of the genre, and is highly recommended for fans of the genre or fancy, intelligent cinema. Johnny Yuma. Johnny Yuma is not terribly original in many ways, but that does not really matter. The success of a genre movie depends on how well it meets the expectations of the audience and offers surprising variations of these expected elements. In the past, pleasurable experiences are restored, but with a subtle (or large) twist that creates lasting interest. Of course, the quality of the execution is important. A tired retread is less successful than a sincere attempt to entertain or move the audience. <br /> <br /> Considering these criteria, Johnny Yuma is successful. There are many repetitions of elements from previous films. The scene is the brutal, twisted, semi-feudal twilight world that shares many of the best "Gothic Family" westerns from 1964 to 1968, such as Tempo di Massacre (1966). The plot is a combination of the basic storyline of Fistful of Dollars (1964) and the Ringo films, which was not surprising since screenwriter Fendiando di Leo was involved in both. Di Leo was one of the best screenwriters of Cinecitta's popular cinema in the '60s and' 70s, and his work has been instrumental in ensuring the thematic continuity and coherence of the genre (along with several other personalities in some different circles of actors, Directors and screenwriters). In the FOD plot, the protagonist arrives in the city, throws up a tense situation and experiences a near-death, followed by a resurrection (in some films, such as Quella sporas storia nel west (1968), this is literally a crucifixion) , The Catholic undertone of narration and symbolism is intriguing, especially given the implicit populist / explicit socialist leanings of filmmakers and their films. The Ringo plot, starred by scriptwriter Ernesto Gastaldi in a series of films starring Guliano Gemma, a selfish protagonist chooses a community's interest over his own through a relationship with a member of that community (with a healthy irony of the Branch) uncertainty). <br /> <br /> The relationship between Carradine and Johnny is clearly based on that of Manco / Mortimer from a handful of dollars (1965). The scene of the exchange of pistol straps ensures a skilful dialogue and understanding between the two. Numerous films, including Da uomo a uomo (1968) or even El Chuncho, qui√©n sabe? (1967), use this relationship between an older and a younger man (father / son, older / younger brother, Anglo-adviser / opponent and peasant revolutionary) as the central dynamics of the plot. <br /> <br /> In addition, the focus is on deception and deception, mazes and mirrors that recur during the best early WAI. The canons and pueblos of Almeria become true labyrinths, through which protagonist and antagonist Katz and Mouse move. <br /> <br /> What distinguishes Johnny Yuma from other WAI is the quality of the visual / psychological space of director Romolo Guerriri, along with the intelligent mechanisms of the script to convey the story. The dialogue was never very important to the WAI and often absurdly incomprehensible (just think of exceptions, such as the cynical commentaries in Django (1966) or Faccia a faccia (1967)). Psychological depth of character is created almost exclusively through iconic images, juxtapositions, and descriptions of the entire narrative situation: See how the presence of the deadly Samantha is felt during the beating scene - from the roof or background of the action, or how Johnny strips himself Samantha and Pedro of their safety and their confidence in their power through his treacherous invasions of their ranch, their hotel or even their bedroom (this is again an issue of FOD). Finally, it should be noted that the search for information takes center stage Many elements come from FOD, which was ultimately based on the hardened mystery novel Red Harvest: by random contacts, wanted posters, eavesdropped conversations, glances from windows, clocks in the Dus or erroneous identities and movements through the waves created by the actions of Pedro and Samantha in this surreal and absurd reality that brings the narrative to a close. <br /> <br /> The film was notable in its time for what was perceived as excesses in violence. Of course, these films were hardly more violent than in many American Westerns. The psychological intensity of the violence and the causes to which it was assigned were different. That is, it was not the violence, but the meaning that had changed. Johnny Yuma is unmistakable and interesting in his use and portrayal of violence, and this is another interesting aspect of the film. <br /> <br /> What interests me most about this genre is the connection it associates with the anonymous, an unnamed public in Italy and Spain, for whom these recurring stories were of importance and interest. The artifact can not have intrinsic value in and of itself? a refractory pit from a prehistoric site, a shard cruse pottery or a rotting piece of leather and rusted metal? But it's an indication of a nameless presence, a life that was significant just because it existed. Although Johnny Yuma has an intrinsic value, much of his interest for me is due to this context and this mystery. <br /> <br /> Top Spaghetti Western List http://imdb.com/mymovies/list?l=21849907 <br /> <br /> Average SWs http://imdb.com/mymovies/ list? l = 21849889 <br /> <br /> Only for fanatics (barrel bottom) http://imdb.com/mymovies/list l = 21849890
