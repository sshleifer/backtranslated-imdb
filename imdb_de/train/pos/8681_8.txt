This cartoon is short in action, but a visually impressive piece of work. There will be very, very small spoilers: <br /> <br /> This short has a "story" that is incredibly light. Dwarves under the earth are responsible for the return of spring every year, but have to deal with an unfinished winter. Both the gnomes and the storm have their own songs. That's pretty much the act as it is. But in this cartoon, it's not about the plot, it's about color and animation. The visuals are extraordinary. In 1936, this bright color was still a novelty, and there are some incredibly inspired works here. <br /> <br /> My favorite moments of the short time surround the movement of liquefied colors by whistling. At more than one point, there are a series of pipes arranged in a row, from the shortest to the highest, and the colors move through the pipes, and the musical track gives the impression of being a pipe organ. <br /> <br /> The visuals of the struggle between the emerging green and the winter storm, which refuses to calm down, are extremely well executed. These types of short films were things that Hugh Harman and Rudolf Ising are known for, but they probably contributed to their definitive withdrawal from MGM, as this cartoon was likely to go beyond the budget and MGM decided they could better control costs, if the animation department did that, somebody became a bit more aware than Harman and Ising. <br /> <br /> This is really a beautiful cartoon and is well worth seeing. It is available on the DVD Attack of the 30s Characters. Recommended, especially if you like good animations.
