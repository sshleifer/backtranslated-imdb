When I saw this movie, my expectations were very low, but I was pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br /> I thought I would see a boring teen movie BUT the plot is interesting and well done, the acting is a bit convincing - especially by Melville, who really shows his talent in this movie. and the fight scenes were very well done for a low budget movie. <br /> <br /> I think this movie deserves a wider audience than it received. It's a movie that can be seen by the whole family - maybe not the smallest kid, as it contains some pretty rough scenes. A film about love and the problems that can arise if you break your family traditions. <br /> <br /> Yes, the movie is very similar to "Bend it like Beckham", but I actually think this movie performs better.
