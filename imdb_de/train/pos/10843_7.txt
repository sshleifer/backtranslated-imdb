What happens to rock n roll stars in the late 1990s? They start a comeback / reunion tour. At least that's what the members of Strange Fruit, a (fictional) stadium rock band of the 70s, do. Tony (Stephen Rea) has the condom vendor concession when he encounters the promoter's son of a famous music festival. At this festival in the 70s, Strange Fruit broke up. The 70s are "retro" and the time is right to spread that wave. He goes in search of the other members of the band. <br /> <br /> Part of the band's breakup was the death and replacement of Keith, the singer and brilliant songwriter. The band was known for their excessive lifestyle and now they are all back to the working class from which they came. Beano, the drummer, played by Timothy Spall (who was brilliant in Secrets and Lies), is a lay player, the bass player is a roofer, and her vocalist is still a rocker. Although he owns a huge villa, he has to sell it because his fortune is not permanent. Brian, the lead guitarist, is dead, so a young guitarist is hired to replace him. <br /> <br /> The band agrees a bit reluctantly to try the reunion. After giving up their day jobs, they start rehearsing and their manager turns to their label to republish their albums. But he wants them to go on tour first. And so they opened the club circle all over Europe. The club scene is not friendly to those overweight, outdated, old rockers. <br /> <br /> It's on tour that the movie really starts to develop. All the old conflicts are getting ready, and the characters of Keith and Brian are floating everywhere. They all hang together because they are all looking for a second chance for the size they have missed before. And they rediscover something of the interpersonal chemistry that made playing together so enjoyable. <br /> <br /> Still Crazy begins as Spinal Tap II, but gradually becomes a dramatically focused film that follows the relationships of the band members. Although it's still a very funny movie, it's the evolving characters who struggle with the deaths of Brian and Keith and their own personal demons that make the movie work.
