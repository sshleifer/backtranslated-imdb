Cunningly interesting Western by a director who had few colleagues in the genre. Similar to other images of Anthony Mann, The Far Country combines a potent pot-cooking story with a skillful landscapeist. Both play under some of Mann's Peccadillos such as honor, integrity, betrayal and, of course, death! In the story, lucky-hunters Jeff Webster (James Stewart) and Ben Tatum (Walter Brennan) are traveling with a herd of cattle to Oregon territory. They are aware of the booming gold boom and plan to make a decent profit by selling the cattle in a Klondike town. Once in Skagway, they find the self-styled judge Mr. Gannon {John McIntire} ready to do justice to Webster because Webster broke the law, all for honest reasons. As punishment, Gannon withdraws the partner herd, but they steal them back and cross the Canadian border to Dawson - with Gannon and his men on the hunt. Here beautiful women and a gentle and lawless city will fill the fate of all concerned. <br /> <br /> Interesting from start to finish. The Far Country benefits from James Stewart's bubbly {anti} hero in the Waitview and Mann's smooth sense of the tight Borden Chase script. The cinematography of William H. Daniels is a superlative that was not favored by current DVD prints, and the movie has some surprises and a "Will not he?" The core splinters the audience. With re-clocks for die-hard genre fans, it's still a must-have item for first time visitors embarking on the wonderful, but dark western world of Anthony Mann and James Stewart. 8.10
