"California" is a great movie that makes us look at ourselves. The film has a great cast, Brad Pitt (Johnny Suede, A River Runs Through It and the Legends of the Fall) as Early Grayce, David Duchovny (The X Files) as Brian Kessler, Michelle Forbes (Star Trek: The Next Generation, Homicide : Life on the Street and Escape from LA) as Carrie Loughlin, Brian's girlfriend and Juliette Lewis (Natural Born Killers, Cape Fear and Gilbert Grape) as Adele Corners, Earl's girlfriend. <br /> <br /> Brian Kessler is a writer who is a liberal. He prepares to write a book about serial killers. Brian and his girlfriend, Carrie, decide that they want to move to California, so Brian sets up a college ad for some who want to go to California to share the cost of the trip. Early Grayce is a former lawyer and probate sociopath who has recently lost his job The mirror factory in the city is in debt, owing money to his landlord. Ely's probation officer stops to visit him and tells him about a job. He used to go to Col Lege and see the ad, he later told Adele, his girlfriend, that he had gone to California. Early and Adele meet Brian and Carrie at the bus stop and leave the city. Brian and Carrie do not know that he is a murderer who has just killed his killer landlord. For a short while, Brian and Carrie thought of Early and Adele differently, but got to know each other and became friends, Carrie and Adele became really good friends. <br /> <br /> Your journey is very learning. Although Brain and Carrie do not know early, this is a killer later in the movie. The question Brian asks in this film about the difference between killers and us is a very good question. Formerly Grayce is a sociopath who does not see the fault of His ways, later goes downhill and pays the price. <br /> <br /> This movie is a great movie, I give it 10/10 stars and 2 thumbs up. I love the songs in the movie, especially at the end of the movie is the song "Look Up To The Sky" by The Indian.
