I'm sitting here in November 2006 and I can still rave about this movie. Arnold's best films were produced in about 4-5 years. Running Man, Predator and Total Recall (1990). All 3 are incredible. Arnold's cheesy singles in this movie will make you laugh more than once. I find the acting in this film surprisingly good as in Predator and Totall Recall. They did a great job of making the scenes futuristic as they're set to take place in 2017, but you really have to sneak past the haircuts of the 80s on the men and women in the crowd and the normal television screens in the US The Running Man Studio, that we all know in 2006, is on the way with the advent of flat screens and HDTVs. Even the computer graphics of the intro "The Running Man" 2017 will not look like this. Nevertheless, the plot is absolutely fantastic. I did not want to get up even once during this movie and not worry about the end, which I often do with today's movie. I really think that Arnold's acting is much better than he deserves. Now I would not have elected him governor, but that's California for you. Buzzsaw, Dynamo, Fireball and SubZero are also fantastic "stalkers" and I think the producers are not trying to exaggerate the fight scenes. If the stalker is dead ... he is dead. It does not last 20 minutes. The Stalker scenes are fast and entertaining, but they do not try to overdo it. I give this movie 10/10 and that comes from someone who does not like many movies these days. If you get the right actors and the right story, the futuristic graphical representations that you would see in 2006 are not important or necessary.
