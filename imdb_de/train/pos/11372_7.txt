"Citizen X" tells the story of "The Butcher of Rostov", the nickname for a vile and perverted Russian serial killer who claimed 52 deaths from 1978 to 1992. The film focuses on the novice detective (Rea), who pursues the murderer despite adversity despite the uncooperative bureaucracy in self-interest and comfortable denial. The film is an HBO product for TV. He provides a solid cast, good performances, spares the audience a lot of the gruesome details, but plays like a docudrama without the stylistics of similar Hollywood fare. A straightforward and straightforward dramatization of a serious and comparatively little-known story, more interesting than "Jack the Ripper". (B)
