I would recommend this movie to anyone. Not only to the fans of rocker Luciano Ligabue, but to all movie lovers. Because it is sincere, moving, funny and true. For Ligabue is a born storyteller and film lover, and every frame of his film is created with love and care. Because his characters are loved and ask to be loved. Because most of the Italian debut films are lousy and this outsider film is a real pleasure to watch and listen to. Because Stefano Accorsi is great and reminds me of Andrea Pazienza, who like Freccia was beautiful and talented and good and lost his life because of the heroin, Ligabue shows how it is, unbelievable and ugly, without going into loose morality. Because it is a movie that speaks to our heart, to our ears, to our souls. And because I experienced the experience of VHF radios and that's exactly how it was. Thanks, Luciano!
