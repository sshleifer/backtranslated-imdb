This film is a journey through the mind of a scriptwriter immersed in his own paradoxical philosophy. He examines the always illusory question of "Who am I" and "What am I?" It is a courageous and thought-provoking company. There is a boatload of beautiful pictures, dream-inspired, Escher-like paradoxes reminiscent of the hand-drawing or deleting itself. More and more we follow the writer in his agony about what he should say and what he should film. We see him phoning and caring for his baby with his wife who went to Peru. He is so lost in his dilemma that he hardly looks at the child anymore. His wife comes back and makes a scene, destroys his notes and helps him cross the last threshold until he extinguishes himself. The story is above all philosophical, as it is interspersed with appealing and destructive images. It's about the veils of Maya, the world of illusions. The film's paradox, however, is that it takes a lot of talking and thinking to prove that thinking should stop. In the more than two hours of provocative beauty and quick philosophizing, the movie demanded silence or a shorter movie. If this was the purpose of the manufacturer, he succeeded quite well.
