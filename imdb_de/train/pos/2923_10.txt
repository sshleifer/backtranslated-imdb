Eddie Murphy really made me laugh in this HBO stand-up comedy show. I love his impressions of Mr. T, Ed Norton and Ralph Cramden of "The Honeymooners", Elvis Presley and Michael Jackson. The Ice Cream Man, Goony Goo Goo, is also funny. I saw this for the first time when it came out in 1984. I laughed so hard that I almost fell off my chair. I still think it's very funny. <br /> <br /> Eddie Murphy, when he was on "Saturday Night Live," made me laugh so much that he's one of the best on Saturday Night Live. "Eddie Murphy Delirious" is his best standup performance besides "". Eddie Murphy Raw ". <br /> <br /> I give" Eddie Murphy Delirious "2 thumbs up and 10/10 stars.
