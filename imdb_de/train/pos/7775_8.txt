Another one they do not make like this category. This story of a family with some real skeletons in the closet is still considered good, clean, sometimes exaggerated fun. Robert Stack and Dorothy Malone are at the height of the troubled Hadley siblings, and they really took on the roles and ran with them. Malone won an Oscar and Stack was nominated in the minor categories, both honors were well deserved. They compensate for the somewhat threadbare leads. Neither Bacall nor Hudson could be described as bad actors, but both had better games and played them much more convincingly than here. It's hard for me to accept that Rock Hudson plays a reddish heterosexual like this, but that's more of a personal affinity than anything else. However, this does not take the overall entertainment value of the movie with it, which is considerable and this movie is extremely good to see. If you are awake in the evening and this movie comes, I would say look at it. It is worth it ..
