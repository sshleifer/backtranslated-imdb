Before the devil knows you have died, he starts off promisingly by setting up a simple robbery told from various perspectives (in RASHOMON style). At about the full hour, Sidney Lumet transforms this film into something that is so much more than the sum of its parts; It eventually morphs into a multi-facetted family drama exploring the entire realm of human emotions / relationships as story comes to its shattering climax Performances from its star-studded cast, with no sense of exaggeration or exaggeration. Philip Seymour Hoffman, in one of his best roles, is a complex, mysterious and interesting character and often dwarves Ethan Hawke, who plays his brother Hank. That does not mean that Hawke is not bad; In fact, he is above average, in a troubled role that fits his style. Marisa Tomei is excellent for her relatively short appearance (the fact that she bares her flesh contributes to that). Albert Finney's character (Andy and Hank's dad) is the most intriguing, and I think he deserves a little more time on screen. Amy Ryan also does her job appropriately. <br /> <br /> Before the devil knows you're dead, this is not an extraordinary movie, but it proves that Lumet is in the (apparent) twilight of an illustrious career. Many of its features and trademarks can be found here, not least the use of its characters. With a killer script (no pun intended), smart dialogue and pace, and a decent score, it's a must before the devil knows you're dead. A truly underrated gem. 8.10. 3 stars (out of 4). Should only enter my top 250 at 248. We recommend.
