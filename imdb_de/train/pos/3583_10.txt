This was a great movie, but it had the worst ending I have ever seen !!! The actors were great and showed wonderful talent. The whole story was twisted and unexpected, which made her entertaining. As good as the film was, the whole movie is judged in the end, which was terrible! Maybe a sequel could eliminate this bad ending.
