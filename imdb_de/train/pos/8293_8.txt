As a 90-minute experience, it does not conform to the standard of "Drive" as the actors do their craft on "Who Am I?" Academy, while the action sequences are generally no better than those in the excellent Mark Dacascos beat 'em-up. Those who enjoyed 'Drive' (and I thought it was wonderful!) Will undoubtedly enjoy it too. You certainly will not go back to the beginning and watch it all again, but you will definitely be back for a long time to some action scenes. <br /> <br /> It is refreshing to see that the art of the quality fight of choreography is still practiced, though not in Hong Kong, and I would like to see what these guys are doing with the budget, the time and the Respect for Yuen Woo-ping and Corey Yuen Kuei. If you sit for the first half hour and are not driven crazy by the cruel dialogue, you will be looking forward to something. Bosch is great and can really take a step forward with some great acrobatics, kicks and simple bravery. <br /> <br /> If you are lucky enough to be within 500 kilometers of a copy, look for it. It is not Shakespeare. In fact, it's less articulate than Coolio's in "China Strike Force," but you'll be impressed with the movements shown as well as the pain of the stunt team. (I'm pretty sure there is no sure way to head straight to your landing or be forced to push a wooden roof off a raging car!?). <br /> <br />
