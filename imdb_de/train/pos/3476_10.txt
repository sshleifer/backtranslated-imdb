To put it in a nutshell: If you're a baby boomer, you've inevitably dealt with the question that in 1976 McCartney felt like visiting John's recluse life and spending the day with him. Surely you also wondered how it went. I have heard exactly the same reports that the author of this film heard from the perspective of John and Paul, and I agree that I reconstructed the meeting in the same way as this film. But none of my ideas could have brought tears to my eyes, as does this incredible work and acting. I found it amazingly lifelike, perfectly plausible, and 100% saccharin-free. Can anyone explain why I did not hear of this masterpiece before it was shown by the CBC last night? I mean, it's already three years old, for God's sake! And yes, if you are a Beatles fan, then this is an absolute must! Even the subtle transcription of the Beatles melodies in the background is inspired.
