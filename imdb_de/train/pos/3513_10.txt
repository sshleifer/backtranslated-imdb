Actor Herman Jos√© plays the role of a football entrepreneur who buys the passport of two African players and tries to sell it for very little money to the rival of Benfica (FC of his heart), FC Porto, did not play well and it wanted that FC Port was wrong. But what happens is that these two players are still good and FC Porto sells them to a foreign club for a lot of money and makes a good deal. The film, for a small country like Portugal, without much love in great movies, is a very good and funny comedy showing all the rivalries between Northern and Southern Portugal (FC Porto / Benfica). Highly recommended
