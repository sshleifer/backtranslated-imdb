This movie is great. The plot is very consistent with the book, which is a classic by Mark Twain. The film begins with a scene in which Hank sings a song with a group of children singing as "When They Poke Their Toes on the Moon." It reminds me of Sinatra's song High Hopes, it's fun and inspiring. The music is consistently great and my favorite song is sung by King, Hank (bing Crosby) and Sir "Saggy" Sagamore. Everywhere a great family movie or even a great date movie. This is a movie that you can watch over and over again. The princess of Rhonda Fleming is beautiful. I love this movie!! If you liked Danny Kaye at Court Jester, you'll love this movie.
