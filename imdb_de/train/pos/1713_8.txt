This is a kind of movie that will stay with you for a long time. Soha Ali and Abhay Deol both look very nice. Soha reminds you so much of her mother Sharmila Tagore. Abhay is a born actor and will rise a lot in the future. <br /> <br /> The end of the film is very different from most movies. In a way, you are not satisfied, but if you really think about it, you realize that the only meaningful end was the end of the movie. Otherwise it would have been grossly wrong for everyone. <br /> <br /> The film is about a professional witness who meets a girl who is waiting to marry in court. Her boyfriend does not show up and in the end she is supported by the witness. Slowly he falls in love with her over time. It is not clear if she has similar feelings for him or not. Watch the movie for full details. <br /> <br /> The film really belongs to Abhay. I look forward to seeing more of his films. Soha is pretty, but did not talk much in the movie. Her eyes, her innocence, talked the most.
