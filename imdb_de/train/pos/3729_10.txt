I think this film could get the rap as anti-Vietnam while I saw it, I did not feel that this was the case as the movie was just a candid look at the young men's perspective for one War was trained that the public did not support ... it showed their fear, their desperation, their drive ... all outdoors, naked. As a soldier, I've seen many of my issues in my military experience - especially in the Bootcamp. All in all, the film, although shot on a very small budget, looks great, is well composed, and excels in great acting and directing. I highly recommend this movie to anyone looking for another excellent Colin Farrell movie. 10/10
