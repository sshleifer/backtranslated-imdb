This is your standard music comedy from the '30s, with the great advantage that it contains some well-known actor from the' 30s with little funny cameo motifs about the fun and the atmosphere without worries, with a typical Hal Roach comedy touch , It's obviously a "Cinderella story," but I certainly did not think about it when watching the movie. The story is very closely involved in the storytelling, which includes many different characters and also many small cameo appearances when the main characters meet the Hollywood studios. <br /> <br /> Hardy make her appearance and show some of her routines. It's like watching a movie and getting a Laurel & Hardy short for free. Even Walter Long, a regular Laurel & Hardy, performs in routine, and James Finlayson (this time without a mustache) as the director of the short films the main line and the character, but in that case, that's no problem as it's definitely more fun makes and is more interesting than the main plot line and the flat main characteristic. <br /> <br /> The film is most likely no worse than any other genre films of the same period, though the rating here would suggest otherwise. <br /> <br /> 7/10
