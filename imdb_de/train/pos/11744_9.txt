"Mr. Harvey Lights a Candle" is anchored by a brilliant performance by Timothy Spall. <br /> <br /> While we can predict his suspicious morality, the close teacher will have some kind of breakdown or catharsis based on some deep in the mystery of his past, it's surprising how his feelings are revealed. Spall's emotional transmission is very moving and more than he normally portrays as part of Mike Leigh's repertoire. <br /> <br /> While an anticipated boring school bus trip was only used for comical purposes, such as "The Simpsons," this central situation of a visit to the Salisbury Cathedral in Rhidian Brooks script is self-contained and structured for dramatic purposes and is almost formally divided into acts. <br /> <br /> We are getting into the urban British range racially and religiously different children (with their uniforms I could not say if it is a "private" or "public" school) how they gather? the rapping black children, the serious South Asians and Muslims, the white thugs and mean girls? but naturally and individually mediated. The young actors, some of whom I knew on British television, such as "Shameless," were thrilled to represent the usual area of ​​junior high social sophomore. Celia Imrie gives the superior's role more warmth than the Martinets she normally plays. <br/> <br /> A break in the journey causes some to have a transformative crisis, while others remain amusing. We think the teacher Ben Miles of Coupling has portrayed teaches us a lesson on religious tolerance, but it's more about faith in people and God, which is why the BBC showed it in England At Easter and BBC America she showed it in the US for Christmas. <br /> <br /> Nathalie Press, who was also so good at "Summer of Love," plays a key role in Mr. Harvey's redemption, which could have been played for Film-of-the-Week sermons, But touching, when they reach in unexpected ways (unfortunately I saw their intense scene interrupted by commercials). <br /> <br /> While it's been a bit more rampant in this roadtrip called "pilgrimage," this quiet movie was the best indication of "goodwill towards men," which I've seen in most TV movies on vacation have.
