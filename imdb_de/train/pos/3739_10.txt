I really like this movie. Bozz is an ultra-cool, non-intimidating soldier who does not want to go to war. His person is somewhat similar to Yossarian in Catch-22, Joseph Heller's classic novel about men and war. However, this film does not play in a war zone but in pre-war preparatory training. This wonderful movie is all about the disgusting realization that the Vietnam War was a mistake, and the men being sacrificed for a lost cause. Colin Farrell is brilliant as Bozz, a soldier who acted as an actor, much sincere love and compassion for his comrade, as he rejected the establishment that tried to kill him, and disrespected irreverently. Bozz is totally cool and not excited. He tests and optimizes his military superiors and gets the goat at every opportunity. He is a Jesus Christ figure with a degree in psychology who "saves" his fellow soldiers and shows those in serious need the way out of this man's army. <br /> <br /> Action and action is crisp and believable As "Sleeper", Tigerland with Apocalypse Now and Full Metal Jacket is one of the three best Vietnam movies in my opinion. <br /> <br /> FIVE STARS, a top choice.
