I stumbled across this series by accident. After half an episode I was addicted. American Gothic was a dark, curious series starring Gary Cole as the mysterious, probably evil, sheriff Buck trying to gain control of his illegitimate son Caleb, played by Lucas Black. I was impressed with Gary Cole's scary sheriff and I was even more impressed with Lucas Black. Lucas Blacks Caleb was able to defend himself against Sheriff Buck, one of the most frightening characters ever created for a television series. I have rarely seen a child actor with as much presence or talent as Lucas Black. If you were not lucky enough to see Lucas in American Gothic, you should see him in Slingblade. <br /> <br /> It was a remarkable show with many ambiguities and secrets that were never explained during the short run.
