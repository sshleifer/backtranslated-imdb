Seriously, I loved this movie ... I started reading the book and I loved it ... The way everything was set up and everything had a purpose ... I think this movie has so good works because Louis Sachar wrote the script. And of course, Andrew Davis directed ... Shia Lebouf does a great job for his first movie ... The plot is very cool and interesting ... there's humor, heart and intensity ... it's very similar to the book I do not find this movie boring ... I absolutely loved it ... and I encourage everyone to read the book. All in all, this film is very well put together and carefully crafted ... two thumbs up for me in every way
