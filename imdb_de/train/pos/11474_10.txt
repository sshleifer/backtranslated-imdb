This movie is for eternity. First, I have to say that once I saw this, it became one of my favorite movies of all time. Why? Easy; Ben Coccio (writer, director) has put together a true work of art. While 99.9% of films are just entertainment these days, director Ben Coccio gives us the truth, the reality, and the learning tool to know why. The mainstream media are spinning and turning, but Ben Coccio faces school shooting straight in the face and, where there has been no other form of media, can plunge into the heads and hearts of two young men who want to kill their classmates. While it's certainly graphic and terrible, how could it not be? The gloves will peel off, the lies and sugar beat of our media masters will be pushed aside and we will be taken to a place where we can find the truth about what happened. Sometimes it is not just a gap, as everyone likes to think, no, sometimes hate and isolation are deeper, more human, we are shown that these guys are us and we are. The society has left them behind and the consequences are terrible and real. Respect and love your fellow man. A lesson we should all learn. Thank you for making this film, Mr Coccio. I sincerely hope that you will continue your film career.
