Most Stoogephiles consider this the best Stooges bar, and they're right. Curly is a drag-dressed scream as "Senorita Cucaracha", and Moe and Larry are in top form as "Senor Mucho" and "Senor Gusto, respectively." Christine McIntyre's beautiful opera voice has a full rein - she was actually a trained opera singer - and that's wonderful. The great Gino Corrado is hilarious as a pompous Italian singer who is terrorized by the Stooges at a party party. Some really funny jokes, a good direction and a very close working make this climb to the absolute top of the productive power of the Stooges. Even more amazing is that Curly had serious health problems at the time, and in some of the shorts he's done during that time, you can see he's obviously sick. His timing is too late, he speaks very slowly and hesitantly and has difficulty moving. Luckily, his health was in an upswing as he filmed this movie, and that shows. Classic stooge comedy that was also enjoyed by non-Stooge fans (I had a girlfriend who did not like the Stooges, but even she laughed about it). Something you must have seen.
