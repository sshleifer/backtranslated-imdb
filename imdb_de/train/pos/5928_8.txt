This is not a good movie, but I like it anyway. The cat Clovis is gold in the glass and the premise of the cats themselves - in contrast to the evil sleepwalking. I think this movie has more to offer than people realize, basically it's very tough, but this freakiness can sometimes be good. It has the crazy lines, the abrupt end, and a comedic element conveyed by the limping policemen. <br /> <br /> Has anyone found the incestuous element a bit disconcerting? After all, this film is random and randomly picky, which is pretty effective, I compare it to psycho - the relationship between mother and son, the change of protagonists. I think the abruptness works too, this is not a movie you want to extend, it only works when it is short. <br /> <br /> I'm still not sure if the director lacks depth or if he did. We know that Stephen King has these skills, but I have not even read his books, just a few of his Seen movies. <br /> <br /> I liked it anyway. If you like tough, crazy movies with 80s overtones, just look at them. but do not expect too much. It's really that bad, it's good.
