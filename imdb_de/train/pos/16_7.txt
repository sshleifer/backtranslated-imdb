I found this a so-so-romantic drama with a nice ending and a generally nice feeling. It's not a Hallmark Hall Of Fame family movie, where sleeping before marriage is considered "normal" behavior. However, considering the stars Jane Fonda and Robert De Niro, I would have expected a much rougher film, at least in terms of language. <br /> <br /> The most memorable part of the film is how difficult it is to learn to read and write when you're already grown up. That's the big theme of the movie and it has some touching scenes, but honestly the movie is not so memorable. <br /> <br /> It's still a pretty mild, nice story that I'd like to recommend.
