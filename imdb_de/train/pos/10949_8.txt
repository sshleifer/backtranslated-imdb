First and foremost, I want to say that I'm a big fan of Sarah Silverman, and if other people say that and then run away the pilot, I do not care. Everything in the pilot project was in the typical Sarah Silverman form, maybe not exactly funny, but the situation and the delivery are what counts. I do not like it. It has the same flow and the same rhythm. It's true only for the true fans, but if you are, you'll be satisfied. <br /> <br /> Again there is no way for the true fans. If you are not used to their style, you will not understand why it is funny. It is, however, and I hope you think so too.
