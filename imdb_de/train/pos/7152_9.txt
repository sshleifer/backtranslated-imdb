"Holes" was a great movie. Disney made the right choice. Every person I spoke to said that she loved it. Each actor was fit for the part he had, and Shia Labeouf really has a future with actors. Sigourney Weaver was perfect for The Warden, it was exactly as I had imagined. Anyone who has not seen it, recommend it and I guarantee you that it's 'Dig It'.
