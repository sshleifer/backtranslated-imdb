When I read the various external reviews by Roger Ebert and other well-known film critics, I have to be reluctant to admit how much I love this film, even though I only have a Japanese-Japanese video version of it. Obviously, many critics seem to consider it a minus that the premise of the story has been used before, most prominently in the very big "It's a wonderful life". For me, a great premise is a great premise, no matter how many times it is used, and I would be happy if I could see more films with that particular premise - the dissatisfied man who gets the chance, a new perspective on his own life to get through a bit of "divine magic". <br /> <br /> I suppose people and intellectual critics are not so involved in the story, but I do not go to movies to criticize them with a notebook in hand - I go to the movies, to throw myself into them and they let me get where they want to go. <br /> <br /> If you are sentimental like me, you will be well rewarded by looking at this picture. The performances are consistently excellent and the movie was very well staffed. Wonderful music selection too. Michael Caine is excellent as a sympathetic bartender. Jim Belushi does a great job as an "average Joe," wondering if his life is not going the way it should. Linda Hamilton, always excellent, is just right here as a loving wife. Jon Lovitz entertains as usual and even has some surprisingly moving moments in "Mr. Destiny". No, "Mr. Destiny" is not "It's a wonderful life," but who says it has to be? "Mr. Destiny" is an entertaining, well-made, funny and moving movie. I've seen my Japanese-synced video several times, and I'm sure I'll see it several times. If that somehow makes me a "lowbrow", then so be it! I'm just glad I did not read reviews of "Mr. Destiny" before I saw them. <br /> <br /> I think I should have the courage of my beliefs and give the film nine or ten stars. but I could not help but doubt myself after reading all the critical reviews!
