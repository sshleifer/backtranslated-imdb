There is nothing to like about Moonstruck. I come from an Italian New York family and feel a little homesick when I see it. The actors and actresses, the plot, the subplots, the humor ... they were all fantastic. It starts a bit slow, but a lot happens in these two days! I fell in love with LaBoheme because of this movie. Moonstruck is number 3 on my list of favorite movies. It's a "feel-good movie" in which you repeat the drone-drama "that's amore" or some of your favorite series: "Old man, if you give these dogs another piece of me food 'I will kick you until you are dead'; "Chrissy, bring me the big knife", "who is dead", "do you love him, Loretta ..., well, because if you do, they drive you crazy because they know they can do it". I always put on Moonstruck when there is no good thing to do, because it makes me happy.
