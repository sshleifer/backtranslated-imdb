This film evokes many memories of the classic cinema of yore, in which actors did not have to undress to let viewers watch their movie. <br /> <br /> At first I think the main advantage of this movie is in it The amazing chemistry between Shahid and Amrita is definitely the genesis of the movie. <br /> <br /> I've seen a lot of comments about the film being pathologically sweet and overly mushy. I think that to a certain extent this is a correct analysis, considering that this is a Barjatya movie, I think it has been significantly attenuated compared to MPK, HAHK, HSSH and MPKDH. HSSH was almost unbearable in some places. <br /> <br /> In this film, however, when the sentimental moments come along, you smile and wish the aspiring couple well and hope that nothing bad happens to them. <br /> <br /> Another big plus is the performances of Shahid and Amrita. Both have done very well, especially Shahid, who looks great in the movie. Amrita just looks stunning and should be taken seriously as a future Major Star. <br /> <br /> Although I really enjoyed the movie as a whole, I feel it was too long. A part of the middle could have been cut off and perhaps even more effective. I also think the music fits into the movie, seeing that the situation is a bit old-fashioned and the film could have benefited if a more up-to-date soundtrack were available. Although the pictures of the songs Mujhe Haq Hain and Hamari Shaadi Mein are wonderful. <br /> <br /> All in all, I can definitely recommend this movie. The romantic movie looks stunning and has a dramatic climax (I will not go into details just in case you have not seen it.) PS: If you tend to cry, take it A handkerchief! (I needed several)
