OK. As you can see, this is one of my favorite movies. This is a character drama that is absolutely funny. The main character is a business man who puts in a mentality "Same, other days". He sees a woman who looks melancholy from the everyday life of a coach from a window of a dance studio, wonders about her and decides to find out more about her. He decides to take part in the dance class just to find out she is not the instructor. From then on, he connects with four other dancers and learns to have fun dancing and to learn about the mysterious woman How to build and develop friendships. <br /> <br /> This movie was redesigned with Richard Gere and Jennifer Lopez, and the new movie is appealing, but nowhere as enjoyable as the original. In America, the film was never great because it was out of the question for the Oscars since it was televised in Japan (films can not be released on television or they are disqualified for Oscar nominations). In Japan, numerous awards for the best film, the best cast, the best director, etc. were awarded for their Oscar award.
