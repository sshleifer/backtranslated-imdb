I think this movie is the best movie about Mike Hammer, with Biff Elliott's performance as final Mike Hammer. The script by Harry Essex is excellent and contains many improvements to Mickey Spillane's novel. His direction is strong and imaginative, and he uses light and shadow well. The camera work of John Alton is first class, as is the score of Franz Waxman. The cast includes many seasoned players as well as Peggie Castle in her memorable performance as Charlotte Manning. All in all, this is one of the most beautiful private eye films ever made. Biff Elliott and Haary Essex should have been given more options. I always appreciated this movie very much.
