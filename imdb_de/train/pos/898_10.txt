In fact, one would have to be very jaded to avoid being drawn into this gem of a movie (and I've seen hundreds of Hindi and Bollywood films as well). The actors, the beautiful scenery, the locales and the surroundings, the deep emotions, the sweet songs (especially the singing voice of Udit Narayan, my favorite) - everything was just beautiful. The human (imperfect) element was also woven in to create some drama and advance the plot, as well as to allow a cordial dissolution. Alok Nath is such a terrific actor, so open with the emotions of the characters he portrays, he almost steals the show from the young stars. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who loves true romance - those who go beyond the superficial beauty - as one of the best movies ever, Hindi or otherwise!
