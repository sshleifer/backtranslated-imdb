Excellent plot within a plot. Too bad that two of my movie heroes have a good snog. Must be my education :) <br /> <br /> Very well acted by all. You never know exactly who will outdo who. The last little twist at the end allows everyone to get their fair desserts. <br /> <br /> Recommend all. A harmless thriller about mistakes, and if he has any faults, Michael Caine will probably use the word "bloody," but that's his signature, is not it? <br /> <br /> 9/10
