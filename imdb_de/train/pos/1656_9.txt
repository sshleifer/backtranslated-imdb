"Thieves and liars" presents us with a very naturalistic portrayal of the corruption levels that affect many Puerto Ricans, forcing them to make difficult, if not impossible, decisions about the lives of their loved ones and their loved ones. The cast is excellent, considering that some are not professional actors; an excellent choice that raises the level of reality in the movie. Photography drives history without interference, as it should be in this kind of movie. The script captures the idiosyncrasies and attitudes of the "Boricuas" in a very profound way. Sometimes it feels like you're watching a documentary! When you watch this movie, you feel as if you have secretly invaded the real Puerto Rican society and watched it invisibly as it imploded. I loved it!
