"Margaritas and Cock ..." <br /> <br /> This extremely entertaining film keeps you away from the opening scene and always brings laughs, surprises and unexpectedly touching moments. I had more fun watching "The Matador" than almost any other movie from 2005. It's a crazy movie with an unforgettable character perfectly played by Pierce Brosnan. Julian Noble (Brosnan) is a moderator (hit-man), who specializes in high-profile corporate concerts (assassination of rich types). He also experiences something that resembles a midlife crisis. After realizing that he has no real friends, no permanent home and no planned future, he stumbles into a Mexican hotel bar one night and meets Danny Wright (Kinnear). <br /> <br /> Danny is a Down- Fortunately, he's a family man who's about to lose the big deal that could possibly bring him a turn. He loves his wife very much, especially because they lost their baby son a few years earlier. The two men are chalk and cheese, hardly in common, except that they are in the same desolate bar night. And somehow it comes to a conversation that sets in motion a chain of events that will change their lives forever. <br /> <br /> The friendship that they make reminds me a lot of Laurel and Hardy. One is the hetero and the other is the stubborn fool who gets her into trouble. The interaction is perfectly timed and finely tuned, not least due to the wonderful performances of Brosnan and Kinnear. <br /> <br /> But do not make a mistake ... This is the movie by Brosnan. It shapes one of the decade's most memorable and disgusting characters. He could shoot your mother and apologize immediately, and you would probably forgive him. Brosnan may be the ultimate charmer of cinema, but this is still his loveliest and most complete performance to date. I would not be averse to seeing an Oscar nod for this role. <br /> <br /> Look at a scene in which he involuntarily touches a high school girl with the impure thoughts and utters the line: "All blushy blushy, no, damn, damned". He does it with the well-known Bond grin and manages to get away with it. He manages to tell a little boy, "Tell your mother to lose 30 pounds and 20 years, then contact me" without appearing unlikely. In fact, it makes us more like him. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, the film surprises with some really touching scenes, most of which are near the end when the movie makes unpredictable turns. But as Julian leafs through his little black book to find somebody for his birthday, or when Danny and his wife (Davis) console themselves one night in their bedroom, the film gets into an unexpected depth of emotion. <br /> <br /> "The Matador" is stylish and full of energy. It is always entertaining. And it has a career-defining role for Brosnan as the lone killer looking for normalcy, friendship, and a means to do at least one good thing in his life. This is an overlooked gem in 2005, and you should strive to see this movie as soon as possible. <br /> <br /> TC Candler of IndependentCritics.com
