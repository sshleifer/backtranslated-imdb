I agree with what veinbreaker wrote about the "Ahhhh" feeling you get at the end of this movie. I absolutely loved the places they wanted to film, the songs were well written and interesting, especially the psychedelic-sounding track that Hans Matheson sings on. It is trippy. Nighy was fabulous in his role, Nail "nailed" it, Beano was the typical drummer, and Rea kept it together. Bruce Robinson was great. Helena was a lovely girlfriend. But I felt that Juliet Aubrey's performance was great. The scenes between Aubrey and Robinson killed me! Perfectly played and the music behind the scene was perfect! Too bad that not many musicians have checked out this movie! I have to tell all my musician friends. Great quote from Jimmy Nail's figure: "It should be rock & roll, not the phantom of the f ***** g-opera!"
