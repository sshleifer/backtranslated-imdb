My mother took me to this film as a kid, and every year I yearn to see him, like all my other Christmas favorites. Most of all, I remember the stupid devil and Santa Claus looking through his telescope. I waited and watched the TV Guide every year to see when it would be shown. I would normally find it playing on a Saturday afternoon. I found the movie in English only, which demands a lot from the film, and I longed to find a copy in Spanish. I think this movie is for my heart and have never suffered from nightmares as others might think. Yes, it's another movie about Santa Claus and that makes him special and unique. I can not wait to get a copy of this movie and watch it with my kids as I tell them my favorite pieces and memories !!
