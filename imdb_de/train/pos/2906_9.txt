A funny action comedy, in which Damian Szifron cheated on the life of Díaz, a policewoman whose wife cheated on him. He lives in a hotel that feels guilty about his wife's unfaithfulness. He falls into depression and stops worrying about red lights, just for fun, and feels sorry for himself. And Silberman, a probable Jewish swindler, a leftist liberal who does not trust the cops at all. He is to accompany Díaz in his daily tasks, because he can not refuse because of his probationary period. The situation soon resurfaces when Silberman himself learns that his wife is cheating on him, and in the end is consoled by the person he should help, a person he did not trust in the first place. A nuclear conspiracy, car thieves, international spies, a hysterical woman. Comic characters in a delightful comedy about friendship and heroism.
