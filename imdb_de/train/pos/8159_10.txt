OK. This movie is pure pleasure. It mixed the ever-so-violent horror with a little tension and a lot of black comedy. The dentist really starts to lose his mind, and it's nice to watch him do it. This movie is intended for specific people. Either you will totally love it or you will totally hate it. A good movie to borrow and watch if you have nothing else to do. Also recommended: Psycho III
