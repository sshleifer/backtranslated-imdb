I saw the last night with low expectations. The reasons are that I do not usually like Made for TV movies and rarely Cast Reunion movies. But the critic in the Los Angeles Times seemed to like that, so I gave him a chance. I am glad that I did it. It was pretty good. Adam West and Burt Ward unite as themselves. But in some ways they acted as their "Batman and Robin" self. They were campy and did not take themselves or this movie too seriously. The film begins with a search for the George Barris designed Batmobile that someone stole before it was auctioned off to an orphanage. While looking for the car, they also remember the series they made together. This is told in Flashback. It was well done. The actors they gave to younger Burt Ward and Adam West were dead. And for a TV movie, it was down to the basics of their real behavior on and off the screen. I give this a 9/10, I liked it so much.
