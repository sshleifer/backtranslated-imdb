"Yes, Georgio" is a fun and entertaining movie / comedy that contains beautiful settings and beautiful music. It's not my favorite movie, but it's a movie I've seen more than once. Some critics said that if you want to enjoy Pavarotti, it would probably be better to buy an opera DVD. Although a complete opera represents a better portrayal of Pavarotti's opera talents, an opera often requires costumes and henchmen who completely obscure the person's appearance and nature. "Yes, Georgio" allows Pavarotti to use his speaking voice and portray personality and character as an opera would not. Many reviewers seemed to think the story unbelievable; I disagree Enormously talented people can be both selfish and charming - charming enough to captivate intelligent and beautiful people. In addition, people who are very different from one another often gain insights about themselves and develop positively when they interact with people who stretch them or take them in directions they may not have chosen themselves. Both Georgio and Pamela become more open to unexplored parts of themselves. <br /> <br /> Relax and immerse yourself in a visually and acoustically rewarding film with Pavarotti at the height of his vocal abilities. But the final scenes of Puccini's Turandot are worth the time to get there.
