I saw this movie for the first time in a theater in France about a year ago. It came and went with little fanfare, but I enjoyed it because of the beauty of landscape photography and captivating wildlife photography. (The story is nice, but it's really random.) If you really think about it, it's impossible for what happens to happen in real life.) I saw it on DVD right here in the US tonight. I find again that there is only a very limited distribution. Blockbusters had only a copy of it, and I do not remember ever being played in Cleveland art houses. <br /> <br /> On my TV, the photography is not so breathtaking, though it is still very beautiful. The animal pictures are still fascinating. The story of the relationship between the 10-year-old child and the fox is less convincing the second time you know where it's going. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, the story is, as I said, coincidental. It's a beautiful movie you can watch, and if you like animal films, you should find this fascinating.
