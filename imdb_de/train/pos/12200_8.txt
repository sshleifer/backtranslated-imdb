At the time of the founding of The Lady from Shanghai, the marriage of Orson Welles and Rita Hayworth dissolved. The film was also an attempt by Welles to rekindle the old flames as a classic Noir. Not well received at the time, The Lady from Shanghai has gained more and more recognition over the years. With age, so to speak, got better. <br /> <br /> Welles is the Irish sailor Michael O'Hara, who saves beautiful Rita Hayworth from three muggers in Central Park on a fateful night. Sparks fly, but then comes the friction, it turns out that the lady is married to the crippled, but brilliant defense lawyer Everett Sloane. Nevertheless, Sloane apparently has a preference for Welles and instructs him to skipper his yacht. <br /> <br /> So far this movie sounds a lot like Gilda. If Orson had seen Gilda and was not thinking about his male member at the time, he would have gone back to the Manhattan staffing hall in Lower Manhattan. Instead, he engages in a charming web or intrigue and finds himself for two murders and Sloane as his brilliant adviser. Welles, for whatever reason, decided his wife would be blond in this movie. Allegedly, Harry hit Cohn on the roof when Rita was known internationally for her coppery red hair. This may have upset him in the picture as he joined the legion of studio bosses who saw Welle's vision that independent film threaten their power. Stage actor Glenn Anders plays Sloane's partner Grisby, who is a slimy-aged, he wraps up a corpse. The other corpse to be here is Ted DeCorsia, a detective who feeds from the ground up and tries to do business himself. <br /> <br /> It's a good noir thriller that shows Rita of her glamorous best, even if she was blond here. The last shoot in the Hall of Mirrors is beautifully staged, but I would not recommend seeing it when on a controlled substance.
