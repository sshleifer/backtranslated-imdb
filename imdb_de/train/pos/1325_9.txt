I saw this movie at the Adelaide Film Festival '07 and was intrigued every 106 minutes. I like documentaries, but often find them in about 25 minutes. Forbidden Lie $ is on, but never loses my interest. <br /> <br /> The theme of the film is Norma Khoury, a Jordanian who, in 2001, with the publication of her book Forbidden Love, a biographical story of, fame and fortune found in relation to a Muslim girlfriend, because of her family a relationship with a Christian was murdered. Several years later, some journalists began making holes in history, and the public thought it was fraud. The film deals with this quickly but thoroughly, and from there we spend most of our time in the company of Norma, trying to convince us that her novel is more than just a fiction. <br /> <br /> Director Anna Broinowski has found a truly fascinating woman who is studying and she conducts endless interviews with Khoury while she seeks the truth. As always in life, the truth is not so easy to find. Norma fears for her life and worries about a violent setback over the unappetizing portrait of her novel colors of Jordanian Muslims. She refuses to return to Jordan and show us the facts. However, Broinowski is not deterred and slowly puts the pieces together in front of us. <br /> <br /> The result is an incredible look in the head of a competitor. Of course, what we find there makes little sense and is extremely hard to track, and we do not know whether or not to believe Norma. She's either a pretty unjustified woman trying to survive or a fantastic spinner. The web of lies, truths and half-truths that she makes through the film is brilliant. <br /> <br /> The film uses a lot of interview material and dramatization to tell its story, and Broinowski uses these dramatizations to show us why people like Norma can exist: we want to be cheated. We go to the movies every day and let us believe that what is happening on screen is real. Maybe I'm reading a bit too much into things, I did not comment on it after the film in an interview with Brionowski, but that's what I took from it. <br /> <br /> This is a great Aussie movie and needs to get an international release, and a premium of prizes, if you ask me. Certainly the best movie I have seen on the AFF07. <br /> <br /> Look at it, if you get the chance.
