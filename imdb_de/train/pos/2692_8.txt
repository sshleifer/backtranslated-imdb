I really enjoyed watching this movie. It has a good direction, from the already known Bigas Luna, who were born in Spain. And exactly in Spain, the film takes place in Catalonia, to be more specific. <br /> <br /> Luna revisits the topic of obsession, in this case the obsession of a little boy with women's milk. There are some psychological concepts in this story, such as the denial complex that the older son experiences when his brother is born. In the film, this leads to the obsession of the boy, who suddenly sees that all mother's milk goes to the newly born son. So he looks for a breast that can feed him. He finds it in a recently arrived woman and from here the movie is all around here. <br /> <br /> This film lives a lot of pictures, more than the story itself, the viewer captures certain moments (unforgettable moments). and certain symbols (the film deserves a thorough analysis of almost everything that happens because it usually means something ...). The environment, the landscapes typical of the country, as well as the surreal behaviors of the characters, which are also symbolic, and the excellent, ambiguous soundtrack by Nicola Piovani put us in another dimension that is not parallel to the real world, but that cuts them with the times Times ... It's worth living in this world, worth the movie, even though we may eventually get tired and get a bit sick from the excessive obsession that may go beyond the borders ... <br /> <br /> I also enjoyed the performance of the protagonist ... 8/10
