It is a shame that Deliverance is mainly known as the Redneck rape film and Dueling Banjos. Even people who have seen the movie can not forget this rape scene. It's not as bad as the rape scene in Pulp Fiction. It's certainly not as bad as any female rape scene in pretty much any movie. People often miss the power of the movie that contains the infamous buggery scene. <br /> <br /> The acting, the action, the cinematography and the soundtrack of Deliverance add to its brooding charisma. The hinterland, where it was shot, is beautiful and stands in contrast to the dark motifs. The actors, both big and small, make you feel like they're rafting along the river with them. <br /> <br /> What distinguishes this film from others is the tangible sense of fear it inspires. There are not many films that make you feel like they are lost. Conclusion: This film is a classic. I can not say much more.
