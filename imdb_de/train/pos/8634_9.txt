LOVE AT THE TOP - the totally wrong American title for the great French movie "Le Mouton Enrage" (which, I think, The Rabid Sheep) - is such an original movie that the fact that it dates back to 1974 is even more amazing. This film was far ahead of its time; Even by today's standards, it reaches things that seem rich and new. Filmed by the extremely undervalued director Michel Deville, he rather defies the description in the way he combines social criticism, comedy, mystery, love, sex and satire into a completely original mix, before suddenly gone sad and understandable. The cast is great, as well as the script and theme. But it is the delicious tone of Deville that constantly upsets you, but it does inspire you to bring this "lost" movie to a very high level. (The written interview with the director on the DVD "Special Features" is definitely worth reading if you have time.)
