If you're adapting a 1950s book in the '90s, put that damned thing in the' 50s, not the '90s. You see, 40-year-old manners and values ​​tend not to play or ring as well as far down the street. It's a simple rule that keeps Hollywood hurt. And that's the problem with this movie. It should have been in the time it was written. You'd think that would be a breeze, but no. I would like to elaborate on it, but the comment from bmacv shows it very well. I will limit myself to Rachel Ward. She looks like she has completely taken her ass out of this world for this role. As a result, she looks like a blast on chemo and is as sexy as a gay leather couch on the train. I found her "I could die at any moment" looked quite disconcerting, and it affected her alleged "sharpness" and the "sexual tension" that the film was supposed to create. Besides, the movie was pretty good; a 7+ out of 10.
