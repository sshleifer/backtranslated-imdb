HG Wells Story The shape of the things to come was filmed in 1935. Very well made science fiction story about a war that lasts for decades) Ralph Richardson (Time Bandits) and Margaretta Scott. Earlier view of helicopters, holograms, a rocket ship and futuristic cities. This film was ahead of its time the former film metropolis (1927), but avoid the so-called continuation of the form of things that was made in 1979. This film has nothing to do with the original.hg Wells like Jules Verne had a vision of the future with his stories. A classic sci-fi movie. 10 out of 10
