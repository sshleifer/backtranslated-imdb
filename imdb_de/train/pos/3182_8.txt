The handsome British flight pilot George Taylor (a solid portrayal of Guiseppe Pambieri) is beaten up by thugs after a wild night in Hong Kong. George meets and falls in love with the sweet and virginal Dr. Emy Wong (a fine and charming performance by the enchanting Chai Lee). George recovers and goes back to work. When Emy does not hear from George for a long time, she succumbs to despair and becomes a prostitute. While director / co-author Bitto Albertini actually delivers a satisfying amount of the expected delicious nudity and steamy softcore sex, this movie is anything but your routine that devours out of sheer mess. Instead, it is a surprisingly thoughtful, touching and tragic love story between two well-drawn and very responsive characters (Chai as Emy Wong is particularly radiant and lovable). The image starts bubbly and happy, but the sound changes radically into a grimmer and tougher mood about two-thirds of the passage. Emy's descent into vice, after falsely assuming that George left her, is grim and disturbing; Likewise, the remarkably sad and heartbreaking end of surprise. Granted, the narrative is certainly melodramatic, but never too stupid or trashy. In addition, the sex scenes are very tasteful and even genuinely erotic. Ilona Staller, the notorious Italian porn star, has a pretty considerable supporting role as Georges jealous and uninhibited secretary Helen Miller. Guido Mancori's sophisticated cinematography offers many exciting shots of exotic locations. Nico Fidenco's funky, pulsating score hits the groovy spot. Worth a look for those who are looking for something different.
