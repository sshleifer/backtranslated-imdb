This was a very daring movie for his day. It could even be described as softcore porn for the silent time. It was a talkie, but the dialogue was extremely limited and in German. You did not need it anyway. <br /> <br /> The young (19) Hedy Lamarr is caught in a loveless marriage with an obsessive (stereotypical?) German and after a short time in an apparently never consummated marriage, returns home to her father. <br /> <br /> In a famous and funny scene she decides to go gloomy one morning when her horse is distracted by another. She then has to hit a field and chase after him while leaving her clothes on the horse. An engineer brings his horse back and returns his clothes - after he has kept an eye on himself. <br/> <br/> You sit for a while, and in a Zen moment, he gives her a flower with a bee sitting on it. Here she thinks back to her honeymoon and the actions of her husband and an insect. She knows that this man is different. <br /> <br /> She returns home and finally looks for our young man and finds the ecstasy that was denied her. You can use your imagination here, but his head disappears from view and we see her squirming with joy. Since he has never undressed, you can imagine ... Certainly a tribute to the director Gustav Machat√Ω to the wife and a shock to the public of 1933. The only thing that influences this beautifully filmed film is the excessive guilt and a strange ending.
