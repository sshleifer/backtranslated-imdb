This cinematic presentation of "The Rime of the Ancient Mariner" is a very beautiful and interesting rendering of Coleridge's haunting poem. The impressive film art, combined with a collection of two centuries of effort to illustrate the epic poem of 1798 by world-famous artists, and the outstanding narrative of Michael Redgrave are worth the time to see this outstanding visual work. <br /> <br In the age of television, such work is an invaluable tool for getting young students and adults to explore and learn the value of great poetry. To the best of my knowledge, this kind of work is indeed rare; that is unfortunate. As a student of world literature and a former university teacher and academic advisor, I think that larger epic poems such as Coleridge's "Rime of the Ancient Mariner" should be "translated" in this way. Although I am not a film critic, but as an avid reader of classical literature, I recommend this fine production unrestricted.
