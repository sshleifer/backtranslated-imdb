I saw this movie on TV many years ago and watched this movie when I got it on tape. I thought that was reasonably well done. It was not the best of all movies, but it was good enough. The film has enough talent to inspire many people, especially younger children. The acting was good, with Danny Glover leading the cast. The plot was not very credible, but the script was well written. This film may also be the interest of avid baseball fans. It does not apply directly to an action-packed sports movie. It is right for a beautiful movie that you can see with your family and learn some news hidden in this movie. Overall, the movie was good, but not great. I give this movie a 7/10.
