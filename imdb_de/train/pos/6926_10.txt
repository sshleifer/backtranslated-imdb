The narrative confirms the classic image of good versus evil in the form of a brother's fight against his brother. The main character Lin Macadam, played by James Stewart, stands for justice and righteousness. His brother, who plays under the personality of the Dutch Henry Brown, played by Stephen McNally, stands for the classic stage bus robbing the Western Outlaw, who was chased by his brother for killing their father. The world in which the story takes place is the classic dystopian West, where the only way to prevent the residents from killing each other is to take away the side weapons as they enter the city. Lawyer Wyat Earp. <br /> <br /> Even those flat characters that are typical of the West, like the murderous Indian warrior, the beleaguered cavalryman and the hooded girl. <br /> <br /> Another important archetype in this movie that gives the film its name is a custom built Winchester rifle. The weapon can be seen as an allegory for the reward of those who honorably do things. Once stolen from its rightful owner, it brings a tragedy to all who come in contact with it. In this sense, it resembles other icons such as the Holy Grail in Raiders of the Lost Ark and the blood-stained letter in Saving Private Ryan. This gives the film an element of surrealism that is usually lacking in the Western, a genre unknown to esoteric themes and symbols. <br /> <br /> As this is essentially a revenge movie, it shares this element with many other examples of the genre, such as Jack Arnold's No Name on the Bullet and Clint Eastwood's Unforgiven. <br /> <br /> There is also a tacit rape topic in Winchester '73. Waco Johnny Dean, one of the villains of the film, who played Dan Duryea very effectively, kidnaps a woman after she killed her husband. The elusive cowboy plays with the affectionate footman and sends him like a cartoon of a cat playing with an insect before biting his head off. Waco Johnny Dean finally gets what comes to him after coming in contact with the ominous Winchester rifle. <br /> <br /> The main story of Winchester '73 recalls the mythological story of Jason and his search for the golden fleece, as told in Apollonius' Argonautica. Both stories are about acquiring a sacral object that has immaterial properties. Like Jason, Stewart's character hops from adventure to adventure in search of a unique prize. Another theme in Winchester '73 that resembles a mythical story is the struggle between brothers. Several ancient stories deal with this theme, such as the history of the Hebrew Bible of Cain and Abel and the story of Romulus and Remus. <br /> <br /> As for the theme of kidnapping and rape in Anthony Mann's film, it is present in many mythological works, such as the rape of Europe, as told by Ovid in his Metamorphoses. <br /> <br /> Winchester '73 is a good example of the Western genre and serves as an objective correlate to many of the classic American Western and ancient mythological themes.
