This is a haunting, powerful Italian adaptation of James M. Cain's novel The Postman always rings twice, under the direction of the great Luchino Visconti. The interesting thing about the film is that it transcends in any way its source material to become bolder and more original (interestingly, Camus also writes Cain's novel as the inspiration for his trailblazing novel The Stranger). The film has more power and intensity than the novel because Visconti is able to create the cinematic equivalent of Cain's narrative structure, but offers a more complex sex exploration. Cain's very American novel is also uncritically fascinated by the construction of whiteness (the main character Cora fears she might be identified as a Mexican, and embarrassed that she married a Greek immigrant), which is the Italian rural context, the Visconti is not relevant is working in. This allows the class opponents to focus on and dance between the embers of the passionate, damned love affair of the two main characters. This film is a complex, exciting and rewarding experience.
