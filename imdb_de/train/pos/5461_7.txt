Lily Powers (Barbara Stanwyck, who just loves it) disappears from the life in which her father (and the entertaining waitress) and her food died from an explosion. When a possessive lover is murdered who should be his next father-in-law (and Lily's new lover), heaven is the limit for Lily, as she has written down her various relationships in a diary and subtlety, which will preserve the newspapers if certain pay does not come into their hands. Courtland Trenholm (George Brent), the newly appointed president of the bank, sends Lily to Paris, instead of worrying about dough, but quickly falls in love with her after meeting her in the city of love. This makes Lily's mouth water as she reaches the pedestal of success and seduces a man of wealth and prestige. However, there are circumstances that lead them to make a decision that threatens their successful path to achieving this wealth. Trenholm, now her husband, is indicted with certainty and has lost the bank. He needs money that Lily now owns, or he will have absolutely nothing. Stanwyck is the full movie despite the usual Warner Brothers polish. Settled in the pre-code era, filmmakers have the opportunity to explain in greater detail taboo topics such as a woman using sex to achieve success and how it can lead to a tragedy. The good direction of Alfred E Green shows through subtle clues in different behaviors and through good action from the seductive performance of Stanwyck, how to stage something without actually showing the explicit action. Obviously, the film shows that money is not everything and all the jazz as love comes in Lily's dead heart. This end, after Lily had achieved the miraculous transformation into a man in love, did not seem to me to be true. She has spent all this time getting to this platform to interest a man who was essentially no different from the others she had used before him.
