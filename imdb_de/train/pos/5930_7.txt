The monstrous mother-son duo (Alice Krige and Brian Krause) soak up the virginity's vitality, and their newest destination is the pretty, but lonely Tanya (Madchen Amick). These monsters, however, are allergic to scratching cats ... I've never been a fan of sloppy, overrated bestsellers like King, Koontz or Barker, but this B-movie written by Mr. Dung himself is not as bad as he could be His. Yes, it can be terribly cruel sometimes, but there are some surprisingly impressive accents: good old-fashioned graveyard, sinister soundtrack and candlelit Gothic House scene, mirrors that show the monstrous form of the bad guys, etc. Of course the movie is soiled by Mr Dung's gloomy dialogue and obsession of toilet seat toilet seat to denigrate fat people, leading to the pointless rape of a rapist, but there are roses under crap.
