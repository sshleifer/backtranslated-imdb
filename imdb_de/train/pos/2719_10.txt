I saw this movie after seeing Capote and Infamous. It is simply unbelievable how the homosexual relationships between author and protagonist are sublimated in the film. The reporter is clear, the protagonists are beatniks rather than gay. <br /> <br /> The movie starts slowly, but on second reading we get all sorts of interesting information from similes created by writer / director Brooks. <br /> <br /> Note the unbelievable beginning cuts that involve killers and killers. Cutter on the phone is matched to Perry on the phone. Cutter, who washes his face, is attuned to Perry, who washes his face. Only Perry's look in the mirror and his eroticized male body looks like he's playing guitar in Las Vegas to empty the chairs. This failure / fantasy fits the failure fantasy that Perry tells us about his father, who built a beautiful motel in Alaska just to find it constantly empty. Dick talks about shooting pheasants and the fact that pheasants get dressed I do not know they're going to die. we cut to the clutters. <br /> <br /> Perry tells of his dream of a yellow bird, "Greater than Jesus," who attacks the nuns who persecuted her. "The nuns begged for mercy," he tells us, "but the bird slaughtered them anyway." The bird brought Perry to paradise. Oddly, Perry says he has a dislike for nuns, God, and religion. This is reflected later in his last words when he wants to apologize, but does not know whom. <br /> <br /> The director gives all sorts of what if ifs and ifs cases. <br /> <br /> Nancy Cutter gets an offer to sleep with a friend. She is holding a horse. Perry will later comment on a photo of her and the house. Nancy can not sleep with her friends because her boyfriend is coming to dinner. The decision seals their fate. <br /> <br /> Perry talks about Bogart in "Treasure of Sierra Madre". But it's another Bogart image, "Beat the Devil," written by Truman Capote, where McGuffin's fictional treasure hunt is. But Dick knows that the protagonists of this film have lost nothing. Dick wants the $ 10,000 money that he thinks they are in the vault of the Clutter (which, ironically, is a fantasy like Perry's Mexican Treasure). Cut to Herb Clutter signs a $ 40,000 life insurance policy. He is currently thinking about mortality. Ironically, his mortality ends in a few hours. The insurance agent on behalf of the company wishes him a long life, ironically again, if we know what will happen in a matter of hours. <Dick said they did not want witnesses, so no one would remember them. Later, indeed, because they eliminated all the witnesses they remembered. <br /> <br /> "There was a witness," says Detective Dick later. But was that the witness of the friend in prison, Dick, Perry, Truman Capote, or God? The viewer becomes a witness after seeing the movie. <br /> <br /> Fascinating movie.
