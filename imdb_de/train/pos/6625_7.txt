If you have ever seen the trailer for the movie "The Recruit" starring Colin Farrell and Al Pacino, you will never have to watch this movie. Unfortunately, Renaissance has similarly revealing trailer manufacturers. <br /> <br /> The story of the Renaissance is about a detective investigating the kidnapping of a young woman and a medical researcher. The scenery is a futuristic Paris and science fiction elements are consistent. What is special about the Renaissance, however, is the visual style and not the story. Renaissance is a 3D computer animation, like Final Fantasy, but with extremely sharp contrasts in black and white. The result looks stunning (although people's 3D animation problems are still noticeable from time to time: slight robot movements, light facial features, etc.) visually. However, the story and the writing do not quite match the quality of the visuals. It's not a bad story (and if you've probably never seen the trailer before, this is more exciting than for me). But it's a story that's not very original and borders on nonsense. A few lines of dialogue were painfully cheesy, making the writing sound like a beginner's first effort. I will definitely recommend Renaissance to my friends. It's different from anything I've seen before, visually, and I think its originality alone makes it a rewarding experience. It is also an observable story, even if it is not perfect.
