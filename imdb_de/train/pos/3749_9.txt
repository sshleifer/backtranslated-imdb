I laughed a lot when I saw that. It's an amusing short with a funny musical act and a lot of craziness. The characters are simple, but their simplicity adds to humor styling. The dialogue is funny and often unexpected, and everything seems to flow wonderfully from the first to the last line. There's Max, who seems to have lived a terrible life. And there is Edward, who is not sure what life he wants to lead. My favorite character was Tom, Edward's insane boss. Tom has a short role, but a memorable one. Highly recommended for those who like silly humor. And you can find it online now, which is a bonus! I'm a fan of Jason's cartoons and can not wait to see what he'll bring out next.
