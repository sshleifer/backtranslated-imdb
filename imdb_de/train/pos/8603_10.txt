The movie is a fantasy. The plot is thin, but serves as a structure on which some wonderful songs are beautifully sung and sung. (I still can not believe that beautiful and attractive people could sing that well.) Some of the dialogues are wonderfully wise. The costumes made me feel like I was watching a 1942 Haute Couture fashion show. <br /> <br /> Films are used for a variety of purposes. This is intended for entertaining and certainly does. If I have a negative comment, Nelson Eddy would be a bit too old to be the handsome count. Some close-ups made me uncomfortable. But he still could sing and sing great. Jeanette MacDonald, however, was as dazzling as ever. She makes a spectacular angel. <br /> <br /> This genre is long before my time, and I'm a new movie by Jeanette MacDonald / Nelson Eddy and related conversations. The music in this movie is beautiful. As much as I love the classic rock music that fills most of the modern films, there is no question to me that this music is simply and distinctly more memorable, appealing and better constructed. The stars in this movie are more talented than the stars that I see in theaters today. And Jeanette MacDonald was prettier than the stars I see today without the benefits of plastic surgeons in Beverly Hills. I do not know why so many other posters apologize that they like this film and more generally this group of films. They say it is outdated and try to explain why it is. And those who do not like it say it's not very good, but compared to what? I think this movie will undoubtedly still be entertaining when so many other films have long been forgotten. There's just too much quality in this movie to not be remembered and enjoyed. I can fully recommend this movie to anyone who appreciates talent, beauty and music.
