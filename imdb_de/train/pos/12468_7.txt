OK, this movie starts like a cheesy Lifetime movie and gets better with the movie. The script is full of "cheese" and "fluff," and the cast is largely unaddressed. In the first half of the movie, the little girl got on my nerves. I do not think that this is one of her best job. The only reason I bought the movie is that it was sold and had Ellen Burstyn with it. She is great, but this is not one of her best performances. The story is based on true events and that helps the movie. Actually, I did not like the movie at all, and I got disgusted when I saw stills of the balloon. But everything is forgiven when it reaches its goal and the story comes to an end. If this does not bring a tear in your eyes, nothing will! It's cheesy and predictable, but you'll feel good in the world as well.
