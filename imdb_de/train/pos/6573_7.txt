The film feels very much like a piece from the beginning - I think it would do a better job than a movie, because the scenery and the dramatization make a movie version look a bit too artificial. But it's still pretty good, and the story and above all the dialogue are interesting. They have taken the dialogue as accurately as it is from the actual game. Maybe it's a good introduction to Shaw's pieces. <br /> <br /> The main character Raina has her head in the clouds and a sense for the dramatic, and the acting of Helena Bonham Carter does a good job here. Her fianc√©, Serges, is a bit too caricature if he really wants to be a very pretty brisk figure. Your parents are entertaining enough.
