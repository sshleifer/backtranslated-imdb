"The Kennel Murder Case" starts with a run and does not stop until the end. Everyone had reason to kill the victim, and several people tried. William Powell is great as Philo Vance, Gentleman Detective. Mary Astor is a refreshing niece who only wants to marry her Scottish master and enjoy her heritage. This movie comes along with "Nancy Drew, Reporter" on DVD, which is also fun. If you need to borrow the disc (or check out from your local library), do it. It is pure entertainment!
