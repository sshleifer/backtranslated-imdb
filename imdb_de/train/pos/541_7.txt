as a result, this is not a bad movie. I actually liked it better than the first. I found it more entertaining. it seemed like the documentary was shot But it affected me and it made the movie more authentic. This film has drier deposits than the original, which in my opinion is a good thing. With some scenes and characters, it almost becomes a parody of itself, which is perhaps the point. This movie has at least some tension that the first one does not have, in my opinion music from the original, which is great. Acting was pretty decent for the most part, even though, as I said, some of them are exaggerated for a few minutes that seem very slow and just do not seem to flow like the rest of the movie. Overall, however, I thought that this is a very nice sequel. The y rating for "Return to Cabin by the Lake" is 7/10 *
