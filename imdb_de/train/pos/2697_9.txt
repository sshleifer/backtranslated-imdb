Nothing revolutionary here; simply impeccably elegant, low-key cinema. <br /> <br /> GARDE A VUE is almost entirely confined to a drab police station and mostly to an interrogation room, but director Claude Miller (who filmed the wonderful THIS SWEET SICKNESS movie) intercalates free views of outdoor billboards as a minimalist local scenography , Miller's restraint, especially at the beginning, is breathtaking, and his exquisite handling of consistent interior staging provides captivating viewing. <br /> <br /> Lino Ventura is as usual excellent and can legitimize a figure on paper is a clich√©: the laconic, hard-boiled, world-weary murder detective. Ventura lives the role and makes it absolutely believable, even though the script gives us little access to its inner functions. The film ends at the very moment when he is forced to confront his failure for the first time. Michel Serrault is the task as well as the alleged child murderer, with the single imaginary Flick. The exchange between the two is more often not affected by tension and the aura of a constantly changing playing field for a fight of jokes. Serrault's character is alternately haughty and crafty and pathetic; then later .... <br /> <br /> The "Embassy" of GARDE A VUE, if you look for it, is a condemnation of the police methodology and the kind of pressure that makes a police overzealous, possibly cases at a cost close the judiciary. For the greater part of its length, however, the film seems nothing more than an example of how to turn a potentially sleepless scenario into an exciting drama of the extreme film economy. <br /> <br />
