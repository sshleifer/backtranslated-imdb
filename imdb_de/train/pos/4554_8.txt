There are not many stories of overcoming that are very similar to those of Christy Brown. He was born in Dublin in the 1930s with cerebral palsy. His parents believed that his handicap was both mental and physical. Although he was finally diagnosed correctly, Brown had to push himself into a lower-working-class family of nearly 20 children just to be valued by his family. Using his only fully functional limb, his left leg, he taught himself to write and paint, both skills he expertly developed. <br /> <br /> What makes the movie version of Brown's autobiography "My Left Foot" so great is humility. Both director / writer Jim Sheridan and star Daniel Day-Lewis have managed to tell this story in a way that does not call for attention and uses melodrama. Cheesy fights and frustration scenes, as well as glorious moments of victory, are the simple pitfalls of such a wonderful story, but "My Left Foot" remains real and inspired in itself. <br /> <br /> Day-Lewis is the easiest marker. Playing with such severe physical impairments must be a demanding task. Not only does Day-Lewis give us a very comprehensive picture of Christy, but he also manages to record the growth, improvement, and inner transformation of the character at various stages of his life. He plays Christy at the age of 17, when he had limited language skills and was emotionally as volatile as the intellectually learned Christy, who struggles with the question of why he can not find non-Platonic love. The latter theme is the strongest in the film and it would have been nice if Sheridan and co-adapt Shane Connaughton had really worked that out. Anyway, Day-Lewis makes us understand and sympathize with all these elements. A performance that is so credible that you often do not have time to think, "wow, he's such a great actor". These are the laudable performances. <br /> <br /> Equally important, but more subtly, is Sheridan's work on the film. This story is about everyday life and fighting. Although Christy has such unique circumstances that hinder his life, his struggles are no different from our own, and Sheridan fully understands this concept. Christy struggles with love, parental attention, questions about self-worth and ability. His struggles are manifested only physically (literally and figuratively) as ours. <br /> <br /> Sheridan gives us moments that capture the spirit of the great Brown family and Christy's unique place in it. The drama develops naturally when tensions are highest and humor comes in the same way. The dinner scene, in which Christy learns that his doctor / teacher - the woman he loves - will marry his brother Peter, is the best example of Day Lewis and Sheridan's efforts. It's so well constructed by Sheridan that it comes out when we're ready and Day-Lewis brings us from there with his stunning work. <br /> <br /> The other strong component of the film is Brenda Fricker as Ms. Brown. I did not know she had won the Oscar, but there was something about her performances as Christy's loving and smart mother, who screamed only Oscar-worthy. Her love for Christy and her constant struggle for him just seems to be convincing and heartfelt and she deserves a lot of sympathy in the face of her situation. <br /> <br /> The film's emotional impact in the face of history is surprisingly low. Maybe the part of the victim was to make a movie that feels organically human. The two should be compatible, but I think it's a challenge to tell a story that feels lifelike and has enough dramatic moments to take our emotions on a roller coaster ride. The decision to downplay the latter was definitely the wise decision for "My Left Foot". Brown's circumstances speak for themselves - they do not have to be squeezed together for major dramatic effects. <br /> <br /> ~ Steven C <br /> <br /> Visit my website moviemusereviews.com to find out more
