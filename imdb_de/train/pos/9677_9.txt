This film seems to be a run of mill children on the surface that parents can regret with their mostly entertained young children. The film seems and is mostly children oriented, but does not stop at this level. I first saw this movie as a kid and found it funny, entertaining and heartwarming and did not see it for several years. I looked at it again recently at the age of 18 and found it almost as funny, but equally heartwarming and entertaining. This film is heavily undervalued and contains many messages of real life. This is an inspiring quest story made for children yet a epic of its own. I can recommend this movie to anyone, no matter how old he is.
