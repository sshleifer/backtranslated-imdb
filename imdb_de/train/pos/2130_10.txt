A wonderful movie filled with great, unobtrusive performance and sharp, intelligent dialogue. What really distinguishes the film, however, is the enduring sadness. The story is underscored by affairs, loneliness, suicide, disappointment, and the fear of losing the job in a world where it had catastrophic consequences. Most of all, it was located in a world that no longer existed because it was torn apart at the beginning of World War II. In fact, the movie is hardly a comedy if you compare the percentage of serious scenes with the comic scenes. But it's funny - listen to Margaret Sullivan's dismissal of Jimmy Stewart and watch his painful expression as he answers that her comments were a remarkable mix of "poetry and vulgarity". It is funny, sharp and sad at the same time. A remarkable achievement and one of the ten biggest movie comedies ever made.
