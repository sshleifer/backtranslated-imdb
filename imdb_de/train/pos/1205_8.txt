This movie is exactly what the title describes - an attempt to convince you what the authors have to offer. <br /> <br /> First, it's fun to see the 1996-style Toronto that I remember stupid haircuts, sunglasses, clothes and attitude. It really has not changed; Just a nice, safe, cheap and provincial little urban backwater that makes an excellent venue for international movie types! It's also amusing to see Kenny and Spenny go to LA and find out that it's always in Toronto, with a strange selection of beach lovers, musicians, fortune tellers, and even more high-class movie types. <br /> <br /> I do not think Pitch is a movie that you can enjoy. It is not a conversation unless the viewer enjoys seeing another's trample. I think Pitch is a warning that power and money are really held by studio managers and production houses. Would-be (and "successful") writers, musicians and actors are still transients even when they reach the big time. <br /> <br /> Kenny and Spenny are trying to sell you a warning. Buy it or not, but the message is still there.
