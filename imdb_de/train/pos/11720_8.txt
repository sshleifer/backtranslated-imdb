I did not expect much and to be honest, I did not like this movie the first time, but when I saw it again, I realized it was sort of cool. Sure, it's a joke movie, but a weird gag. <br /> <br /> Somebody wrote, it could be better written and it could be. I think this movie had the potential to be an exaggerated cousin of Vinny. But with a horror host instead of a lawyer. Unfortunately, it is a wasted opportunity. With a little more writing it could be a classic. The children are not used, there is no reason why they should cling to Elvira. Apart from the obvious reasons. It would have been nice if their relationship flourished. I know it's a comedy, but it's small differences that distinguish the good movies from the brilliant ones. <br /> <br /> Elvira is always fun and fascinating. Not to mention Flirty. Every time she smiles, you will too. It's hard to hit a movie when the main character is so charming. And it's really her charm. Do not be fooled by her gaze, because you think she's sort of a cupcake. Now it is. But she is nice. The kind of person you would care about your kids. I would not let her cook for you ... <br /> <br /> I would recommend trying it out. <br /> <br /> Do not expect too much. <br /> <br /> She is more than just a great set of breasts. She is also an incredible pair of legs.
