**** Excellent <br /> <br /> *** Good <br /> <br /> ** Fair <br /> <br /> * Bad <br /> <br /> `Go Ahead, make my day! '<br /> <br /> The fourth image in the series is directed by Eastwood himself (rumored to be the largest part of Magnum Force directing). However, the film still lacks influence and credibility. This film was released in the early 80s, at the time of Regan and the young Republicans. The premise of a raped woman who takes revenge on her rapist does not like this timeframe. This plot would have been better for the Enforcer, which would have made him a good movie. What Sudden Impact needed was a conspiracy like Wall Street, but with Dirty Harry in the middle. <br /> <br /> RATING: 3 STARS
