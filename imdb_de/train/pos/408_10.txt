I can not tell everyone how much I love this movie. I've read reviews that say this step is "too confusing" or "like floating in concrete." I say that these appraisers have no imagination! For anyone who loves fantasy fiction, this movie is for you. If you've ever loved Dungeons & Dragons ... this movie is for you (especially if you've come to the Oriental Adventures). (Just more incentive to get my own big screen :-)
