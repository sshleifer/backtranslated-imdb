My dad grew up with Supersterman with George Reeves, and when I was a little kid he had VHS episodes and let me watch them including this movie (if you pass them on to the family) and I loved them. <Br /> <br /> Clark Kent and Lois Lane are being sent to a small town with an oil mine and moles emerge from the mine that are radioactive and considered deadly by the city, and Superman must stop this mess. <br /> <br /> It's just beautiful and fun to look at. The old special effects and the sound - the crew has created such beauty with so little technology. George Reeves was my hero when I was a little kid and I'm now 16 years old, it just shows how timeless and classic these adventures are.
