The Footlight Parade is one of the best musical comedies of the 1930s. A snappy screenplay and an all-star cast, including Jimmy Cagney, the lovable Joan Blondell, Dick Powell and Ruby Keeler, make this film something very special. Under the direction and choreography of the creative genius Busby Berkeley, you will be grinning from ear to ear in this film from start to finish. <br /> <br/> Busby is the undisputed master of the Hollywood musical with "Gold Diggers of 1933" and "42nd Street" in his honor (as Dance Director). The Footlight parade is admired by hundreds of slightly dressed girls in chorus, a trademark of Berkeley. The elaborate dance numbers were recorded with just one camera, and Busby was the first director to shoot close-ups of the dancers. His obsession with shapely legs and "rear view" is demonstrated here in detail. The overall effect is extremely erotic and mesmerizing. <br /> <br /> Our boy Jimmy Cagney plays Chester Kent, a producer of "Prologues" or short musical stage productions that have been shown in cinemas to entertain the audience in front of the talkies. He is surrounded by crooked partners, a corporate spy and a gold digger friend. Although Cagney had a good background in the variety show, this was the first film in which he showed his talent for dance. Joan Blondell is memorable as Cagney's clever, in love secretariat. And Ruby Keeler is as always gorgeous. <br /> <br /> The film reaches its climax with three outstanding production numbers: "Honeymoon Hotel", "The Waterfall" and "Shanghai Lil", all of which are a masterpiece and not likely In today's Hollywood, where the so-called "special effects "have replaced the creative film art, they are duplicated. <br /> <br /> Claudia's Bottom Line: Clever and erotic, with some of the best musical production figures ever put on celluloid. A thoroughly enjoyable period of depression.
