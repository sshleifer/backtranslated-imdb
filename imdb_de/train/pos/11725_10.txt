I shit on free boob references, so I just write a simple flat (no pun intended). I love Elvira, not an "I-shoot-the-presidential-just-to-impress-jodi-foster-fanatical" method, but suffice to say, I think she rocks. The movie is played like a horror movie of the 50s, but it's much more fun. Look for the reference "Leasurely stroking the ankle" to know what I mean. What Relais shines through in the film is Elvira's absolute charm (or should that be Cassandras). I saw this movie for the first time at the tender age of 8 and have seen it continuously since then. I should really buy a copy of it, the videostore version looks a little worse. If other fans of the film want to tell me about it by email, you'll feel free. <br /> <br /> p.s another great performance from Edie McClurg (chubby Paria), an actress who never gets the attention she deserves.
