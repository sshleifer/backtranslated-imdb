We're talking about a low budget movie, and it's understandable that there are some weaknesses (no spoilers: a sudden explosives expert and a meaningless alcoholic). In general, however, the story remains interesting, most of the characters are personable and there are some original situations. <br /> <br /> I like movies that surprise you with some people who are not who you believe you believe and then turn the plot around. <br /> <br /> If you know what I mean, try to see "Nueve Reinas" (Nine Queens) from Argentina.
