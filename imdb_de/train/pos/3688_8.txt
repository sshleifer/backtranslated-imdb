A wonderful movie directed by some of the best directors in the industry. The film also works with some of the great actors of our time, not just from France, but from everywhere. <br /> <br /> My favorite segments: <br /> <br /> 14th arrondissement: Carol (Margo Martindale), from Denver, is coming to Paris to learn French and to get a feel for her life. Montmartre: There probably was not a better start to this film than this segment in romantic Paris. <br /> <br /> Loin du 16ème: a picture of Paris, which we know better since the riots in the Cités. Ana (Catalina Sandino Moreno) spends more time looking after someone else's child (she's a nanny) than her own. Latin Quarter: It's great fun to see Gérard Depardieu as "Tenancier de Bar". with Gena Rowlands and Ben Gazzara about their divorce. <br /> <br /> Tour Eiffel: Do not tell me you do not like these pantomimes! <br /> <br /> Tuileries: Such a pleasure to see Steve Buscemi as a tourist who makes contact with a girl in the metro (a no). <br /> <br /> Parc Monceau: Nick Nolte is great. Ludivine Sagnier too. <br /> <br /> I spent three days in Paris in 2004 and this movie makes me come back! <br /> <br /> In Barcelona (another great city) seen the Verdi on March 18, 2007. <br /> <br /> 84/100 (***)
