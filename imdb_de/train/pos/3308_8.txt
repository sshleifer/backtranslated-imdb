The Power of Kangwon Province is the second feature film by director Hong Sang-Soo. It's clearly a lot of what he started in his previous film, including the numerous interrelated narratives (two in this case) and stories of problems or worry relationships, and a dose of irony. <br /> <br /> One thing that has diminished significantly from his previous work is the fantasies that contain elements of surrealism. However, this film also contains a single moment of the surreal, which defies the otherwise realistic portrayal. The two stories follow a young woman who travels with her friends to Kangwon province to be attracted to a stranger, the second to a man who also goes to Kangwon province with his girlfriend and fights with his relationship sore. <br /> <br /> Once again, Hong has a strong sense of irony and the flaws in human nature, and yet I do not think he is totally disagreeable with his characters and has just enough sympathy for that He draws criticism with his irony. I think I believe in Hong's films that they just feel so real, especially the complex and conflicting characters. Not to say that every person is a hypocrite or suffering from confused feelings, but rather that these characters that he and the actors present are fully developed and believable. <br /> <br /> This is not a fast moving movie. There is a lot of lingering and like in the previous film, things do not always connect immediately, so patience and in a surprising way is worthwhile. It does not seem to be an element of the movie that was not intentionally included in the movie, and I'm a little bit overconfident about different, seemingly extra characters as they get drawn into the mix as the movie progresses. <Br /> <br /> Power is a great movie that manages to create personal emotions, remorse, and a longing for a story that underscores irony and the fallibility of human choices. It's a pretty difficult balance, and it's surprising how Hong manages to do it twice in a row. The technical production values ​​have become much better since the first film and the direction have become stable and clear. This movie is not as emotional as the first movie, but it does gain much in its safe exploration, and the refinement really helps streamline the overall vision. Great view for art cinema lovers. 8.10.
