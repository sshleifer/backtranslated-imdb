When it comes to Paul Verhoeven and erotic thrillers, most people think of "Basic Instinct" and some maybe "showgirls". But Verhoeven has made his best erotic thriller before these two films: "De Vierde Man". This movie is mesmerizing and mind-boggling - and most of all, the story is absolutely plausible, which makes it even more intense. The appearances of Jeroen Krabbe, Renee Soutendijk and Thom Hoffman are extraordinary, and Verhoeven's directing takes care of the rest. "De Vierde Man" makes even "Basic Instinct" look pretty tame ... It could not be better, a true classic of the erotic nightmare cinema. 10 out of 10, at least ...
