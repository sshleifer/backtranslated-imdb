That's more like that now! The first movie had some dizzying dialogue and a little bit of acting, but it seems that the team behind it collected their stuff for the sequel and released a solid, thoroughly funny, witty and creative comedy, all on the fringes of their own Seats will be brought all the way through. <br /> <br /> Seriously, that's just full of great material, full of creativity, and it's less a spoof on 80's movies at the same time. The scenes in hell are great and those in heaven too. There really is no shortage of the adventurous game that promises this game, and you'll never see another movie like this one. Even the hammering final act of the film is not as bad as the first one, as it is fundamentally heartwarming and enjoyable in its extremely clich√©d repertoire of family fun-movie happiness. And even Keanu Reeves is not so bad despite his appearance of 30 years. <br /> <br /> Sounds like a good deal to me.
