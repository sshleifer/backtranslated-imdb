I really enjoyed this documentary about Kenny and Spencer's attempt to play The Dawn. It was a great look at how outsiders try to get inside to grow up. <br /> <br /> The story was well arranged and organized in an interesting way that made the movie flow well. Definitely worth a watch. My only complaint is that apparently there was no closure. Maybe that's part of the point. But we really expect that to be not what happened (or usually happens). <br /> <br /> The film is also a great way to see the personality of Kenny and Spencer outside their Canadian television program. You can see a little bit what's to come. <br /> <br /> I'm looking forward to a chance to see The Papal Chase.
