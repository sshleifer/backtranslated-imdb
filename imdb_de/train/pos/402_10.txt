To: I've seen Warriors of the Magic Mountain before. In this movie, the backdrop plays in China's mountains, the legend of Zu looks like another dimension !! Thanks for Tsui Hark's extensive use of CGI effects. He is able to portray his vision of mountains hovering above the clouds, a land where beings fly freely, and powers that range from razor-sharp wing blades, split swords and the extremely cool moon ball. Many characters in this field the focus is mainly on King Sky and Enigma. The romantic aspect is there, though the film seems much darker than its predecessor. Cecilia Cheung is beautiful and her presence on the screen makes this movie worth seeing. In the beginning, I like the way she resembles the Countess (by To Warriors), and she plays Enigma well when dealing with her past life. By the way, did I mention that Cecilia is very appealing to the eye? <br /> <br /> In truth, Warriors had more comedy elements and their special effects were limited because of his time in 1983. Tsui Hark takes it to a whole new level and sets a new standard in the cinema.
