I saw this movie in the worst circumstances. I had already missed 15 minutes when I became aware of it on an international flight between Sydney and Seoul. I did not know what I was looking at, I thought it might have been a movie of the week, but I was quickly struck by the lead actress's performance by a young woman whose child had been abducted. The premise began to spin and turns that I did not see coming, and in the end I crawled through the on-board guide to find out what I had just seen. It turned out that I discovered late Do-yeon Jeon, who had won the best actress for the role in Cannes. I do not know if Secret Sunshine is typical of Korean cinema, but I go to the DVD store to find out more.
