Arthur Bach has to grow up, but unfortunately that's not the only thing he has to do. According to his extremely wealthy father, Arthur must marry a certain wealthy Susan Johnson, or he is cut off from family money ($ 750 million). The problem is, Arthur does not love Susan (though I hear she makes a good chicken) and just fell for the waitress and part-time lover Linda Marolla. Arthur is an interesting guy. He's really just a big kid, born in wealth, with at least one person looking after him every day. The work rubs Arthur only the wrong way - he's having fun at the woman and can of course drink. Drinking gives Arthur a kind of Jekyll-and-Hyde complex; and while that puts him in all sorts of trouble, it's absolutely weird to see on the screen. <br /> <br /> Dudley Moore as Arthur is great in this film, which received an Oscar nomination and a Golden Globe win for his performance. Moore is fantastic with the comedic aspects of the film that make the already comic lines a memorable comedic gold, but it is also great in bringing Arthur on a relative level, and to make the character sympathetic. Moore has some help in the co-star department - Liza Minnelli is great as Lina, the spirited person who can not get enough of the Arthur and John Gielgud's great when Arthur Butler Hobson. Gielgud won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, and there's no doubt why. Hobson has a stiff, dry wit and a rigid attitude, but he is always looking for Arthur - and Gielgud is perfect in the role. Steve Gordon's 1981 movie Arthur is short and simple, but brings a lot of laughter.
