THE SOPRANOS (1999-2007) <br /> <br /> Number 1 - TV series of all time <br /> <br /> Everyone thought that would be a stupid thing that would not pass a pilot episode. The sopranos have become a cultural phenomenon and widely recognized as one of the greatest television shows of all time. <br /> <br /> James Gandolfini plays the enigmatic New Jersey criminal director Tony Soprano, who is accompanied by a stellar cast. Edie Falco is outstanding as a worrisome, affectionate mother of the upper class. Tony Sirico is enormous as a superstitious, gray Consiglieri who is often very funny. <br /> <br /> While the show has often been criticized as a mafiosi for the negative stereotype of Italian-American Americans, and to some extent that is undeniable, I can see so many positive things from the show. The presentation of strong family values, friendships, love and compassion; Could this be present in a gross TV show about gangsters? Yes. In addition, other burning issues such as terrorism, social inequality and injustice, homosexuality, drugs etc. are discussed. This is not a superficial, boring show about tough guys and violence. It has so much more. Many of the problems we see on the show are very real. <br /> <br /> The writing, which was pretty awesome, has so successfully penetrated current themes and managed to embed them in the lives of the characters, which makes it all the more interesting. <br /> <br /> Credit I have to go to David Chase, who has created a superb television treasure, and to James Gandolfini to see the most complex and enigmatic character of television. <br /> <br /> Simply extraordinary. <br /> <br /> 10/10
