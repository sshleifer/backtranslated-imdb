I do not doubt that the critics have turned this film upside down, especially the artistic follies who need a laxative. This is a great vehicle movie in the tradition of Abbot & Costello or more recently Don Knotts. It will not shake or change the world forever. What it will do is entertain. When everything is said and done, that's the most important thing anyway. Watch this movie and forget about your problems. There is even a simple and friendly moral message at no extra charge. I've always loved Elvira's TV show when I lived in LA. She did not steal her fate from Vampira any more than Vampira from the original, Theda Bara. This kind of mythical character belongs to the one who does it best. & Cassandra Peterson does it best. Long live Elvira; We need more of these films. There is never enough. The villain, William Morgan Sheppard, was also excellent. He exudes a wonderfully refined malice. I could not find any technical defects. The execution is as flawless as the art form. My deep compliment to the director James Signorelli and his entire crew.
