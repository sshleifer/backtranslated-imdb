L'les Acteurs_ is the absurd story of Jean-Pierre Marielle desperately waiting for a cup of hot water, the story of a plot against actors, the story of aging actors whose careers are slowly becoming less active than before, but an overwhelming tribute to French actors and her cinema. <br /> <br /> Supported by a solid reflection on cinema and drama (the fourth wall, the hidden cameras to play or not to play), the story of this movie where most of them are. Famous actors play her own role (not to mix with life in front of the camera - the movie is not a voyeur) is quite vague and follows the actors as a result of episodes that make the movie very amusing. When Andr√© Dussolier leaves the film and leaves Josiane Balasko to play his role (great actress, she is weirdly serious, especially when she complains about herself in Dussolier's role), while actors collide in the street and sign autographs fight and gossip happen, we recognize pastiche from other scenes in which everyone (or others) have played. <br /> <br /> Actually, for anyone who does not know the actors (most of them are at least in their 50s) or does I do not know French cinema, this movie has less interest, as most of the references are missing, but there will still be a good reflection of aging, acting, public life ...
