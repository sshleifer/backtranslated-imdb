Soylent Green is a classic. I was waiting for someone to do it again. You seem to be re-creating Sci-Fi classics (ie, War of the Worlds) these days, and I hope a director / producer reissues Soylent Green. With today's computer animation and technology, this could make a great picture. Anti-Utopian films may not be that far-fetched. The human race breeds like cockroaches without restricting them from the outside. We as humans have the opportunity to put the Kibosh on the reproduction of smaller species if they get out of control, but there is nothing that can control human breeding except ourselves. Despite all diseases, wars, abortions, birth control, etc., the human race multiplies like bacteria in a petri dish. Classical Malthusian economics states that every species, including humans, will multiply beyond their livelihood. 6 billion and grow ... that's obscene.
