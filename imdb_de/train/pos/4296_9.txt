This would have been my # 1 movie of the year for 1991, unless beaten by the brilliant JFK. This is such a wonderful movie! I loved it. I love stories in which the lives of different characters overlap and how they deal with their lives. Kevin Kline is good here, but is outshone by Danny Glover and especially Steve Martin. I have never liked Martin or his style very much, but here he is great. I was thrilled with the entire speech he delivered about the Grand Canyon just before the end of Kline. The writing was excellent. Larry Kasdan is, IMO, a great dialogue writer, on the ways of Kevin Smith and Quentin Tarantino. Here he has formed several three-dimensional characters and elaborate storylines and messages that positively affect our lives. A really excellent movie. 4 out of 4 stars
