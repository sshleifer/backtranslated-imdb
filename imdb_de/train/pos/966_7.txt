Report of the Toronto Film Festival 2005 It is official; "Takashi Miike" is beaten. <br /> <br /> The annual midnight screening of the new movie "Takashi Miike", "The Big Spook War" or "The Great Yokai War" or "Yôkai daisensô". Call it what you want. This is a fanatical ride. Colin Geddes, the fearless programmer, said that this film was originally aimed at children in Japan. Think of Lord of the Rings or Neverending Story for Japan. After the screening I can understand where they went with it, but damn it, that's "Takashi Miike". He directed the movie "Ichi the Killer" when he presented Barf Bags at the festival. And no, that was not just a marketing ploy. <br /> <br /> Plot Abstract: A boy with a restless home is "chosen" and stumbles in the middle of a Great Spirit war in which he finds himself meeting a group of friendly spirits who, through his journey to his own Become companions. <br /> <br /> This is not really for kids, not too young. Surely they are terrified with some of these ghosts (even the friendly ones) who are being exhibited, shit. This is unlike anything I have ever seen in the cinema. A fantasy of course, something very funny (but dark) material. You will not be bored that guarantee. Will this ever hit North America? Doubtful. <br /> <br /> My rating = B
