Movie star Jay Leno as Detroit cop, Tony Costas, and Pat Morita as a Tokyo policeman sent to Detroit to retrieve a stolen car engine prototype. A Japanese man traveled to Detroit and hoped to sell it to an aspiring car company run by a man named Derrick Jarryd. Unfortunately, the men who were to negotiate the deal killed him and took the prototype. An angry Derek Jarryd tries to distance himself from Phillip Madras, who led the men. But Madras (played by Chris Sarandon) has none of this and threatens that Jarryd forces him to continue their partnership. In the same junkyard where the Japanese had been killed, a friend of Tony Costas was also killed by the same men. Tony's friend had been watching the junkyard. <br /> <br /> Tony goes in search of the murderer against his superior's orders. Tony is on robbery, while obviously murder should investigate the case. As Tony investigates the crime, he encounters the Japanese policeman and arrests him by mistake. In the end, they work together on the case. They make up a weird couple and there are some really amusing parts as well as some ridiculous scenes like Pat Morita who jumps right through the windshield of a moving car and kicks Madras in the head. But in the end, it's a gratifying buddy cop movie, at least in my opinion. Jay Leno is not an actor, but he is sympathetic in the role and Pat Morita is good as well. Still, they are one of the unlikely buddy-cop duos in an action movie. If you enjoyed Buddy Cop movies, cheesy 80s movies, or you want to see Jay Leno as an actor, then I recommend this movie.
