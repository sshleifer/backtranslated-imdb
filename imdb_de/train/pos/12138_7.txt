Some features of this movie date it immediately. The sound is rather shrill and you notice the big progress in sound reproduction in the following years. The language of dialogue is rather curious and unnatural, and acting is still reminiscent of the transition from stage techniques. <br /> <br /> Bette Davis always shows a strong performance in all her films, as in this early period of her very successful career. However, I have the feeling that the cockney accent somehow does not match the facial expression. I think it's the supposed cockney accent that does not sound right to me. Somerset Maughan loves to immerse himself in human relationships of great dramatic intensity that will delight all moviegoers. As in so many of her character roles, Bette Davis can switch from a beautiful, seductive woman to a viper of fiery hatred. Leslie Howard is well staffed as the retired English artist with a clubfoot desperately looking for a partner and meeting a bad waitress. <br /> <br /> Towards the end of the film, the young doctor meets his true love on a busy street. They cross the traffic completely unimpressed by a multitude of horns and whistles that yell at them. This scene may be funny, but I find it rather ridiculous in this otherwise very serious movie. It's probably meant to be sent home with a smile on your face. And as far as we can see (and hope), it's a happy ending.
