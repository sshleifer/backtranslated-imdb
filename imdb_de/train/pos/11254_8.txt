It has been a long time since I saw this mini-series, and I am pleased to say that their merits have withstood the test of time. <br /> <br /> Most components of 'A Perfect Spy', the adaptation of LeCarré's best novel, are, in my opinion, the top drawer. Noteworthy is the music and the masterly script written by Arthur Hopcraft, who I believe was also a screenwriter for "Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy" with Alec Guinness a few years ago. <br /> <br /> The actors are usually very good, some excellent, like Alan Howard's Jack Brotherhood and Ray McAnally's Ricky Pym. Peter Egan is fascinating to watch as his face changes with every camera angle. The timing and effects on the physical appearances of the characters are made very believable. So much so that I wondered exactly how old Peter Egan was at the time of the shoot. The only jolt comes when the character of Magnus Pym has been transferred from the very capable hands of a young actor named Benedict Taylor to that of a too old Peter Egan, who is just from Oxford. However, this is an insignificant and unimportant seam as a whole. <br /> <br /> Egan has difficulty convincing only when the text becomes melodramatic and he has to be emotionally "excited", ie crying. None of the actors have a very easy time with these moments, except for the wonderful Frances Tomelty, who plays Peggy Wentworth for everything she's worth, and steals the episode with ease. <br /> <br /> Jane Booker is annoying like Mary Pym. She has some of the character under her skin, but often shows a moody whim that she reduces as a tough cookie-diplomatic housewife who is Mary Pym. Rüdiger Weigang is great as Axel, amusing, ironic and brilliant. I also enjoyed Sarah Badel's camp-turn as a baroness. <br /> <br /> The British view of the Americans is rendered alive in some dry-witty scenes. When the Yanks have come overseas to concoct with Bo Brammell (head of MI6), the American contingent is portrayed as empty antics that seem to have memorized many long words from the dictionary, and they use American jargon and psycho-babbling generous season very much to the amused disdain of the English. <br /> <br /> Humor and sadness mingle subtly. LeCarré has a knack for mixing different elements in his stories, and Hopcraft has brilliantly captured the melancholic but wistful atmosphere of the original. <br /> <br /> No perfect production (what is it?) And yet the best of the best LeCarré adaptations to achieve film or television today. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended for lovers of spy thrillers and especially for LeCarré fans. DVD available at Acorn.
