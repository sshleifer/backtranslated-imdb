I'm really outraged by the comment I've read, stating that this film is "boring" and the beautiful scenery was affected by the black-and-white shots. It was made in 1925 !!!! I think it's absolutely incredible for his time! <br /> <br /> The journey these people had to go through is absolutely remarkable. It took them a week to cross a river. The women carried their children in heavy wooden cradles on their backs and climbed on a solid rock face, sometimes barefoot in the snow. I would like to see someone do it now! <br /> <br /> I thought it would be a wonderful movie with really amazing pictures and an incredible story.
