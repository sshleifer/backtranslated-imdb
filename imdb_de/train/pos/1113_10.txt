Sandra Bernhard is quite a figure and certainly one of the funniest women in the world. She started out as a stand-up comedienne in the 1970s, but in 1983 she joined forces with Jerry Lewis and Robert De Niro in Scorsese's undervalued masterpiece The King of Comedy. However, her film career has never really started. She did some weird but entertaining pictures like "Dallas Doll" (1994) or "Dinner Rush" (2000), but the most amazing parts were the ones she made for herself. <br /> <br /> "Without you I am nothing" is undoubtedly her best effort. It's an adaptation of her Smash Hit Off Broadway show, which made her a superstar. and Madonna's best friend for about four years. In ten perfectly choreographed and staged scenes, Sandra turns from Nina Simone to Diana Ross, talks about her childhood, Andy Warhol and San Francisco and plays songs that were made famous by Burt Bacharach, Prince or Sylvester. Director John Boskovich got Sandra to do a 90-minute tour-de-force performance that's both sexy and uniquely funny. If you're a Bernhard fan, you can not miss this movie. It pays homage to her (weird) beauty as well as her extremely unconventional talent as a comedienne. And it has influenced the filmmakers in their work? For example, "Hedwig and the Angry Inch" would look very different if "Without you I am nothing" does not exist.
