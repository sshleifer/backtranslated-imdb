This, in my opinion, is the best Emma there is. Having seen the other version (1996), which is good and reading the book, I can say with certainty that this is the true interpretation and Jane Austen's masterpiece is the most faithful. The 1996 film with G. Paltrow is good too, it's just that it looks almost like a whole different story. It's very light and fluffy, you do not see the darker edges of the characters, and if you just want a nice movie, you'd do well, but the subtleties of some of the plot points, like the Churchill / Fairfax entanglement, are as glossy as practically not available. If you want to make the characters a bit more realistic and multi-dimensional, the 1996 TV version is the supervisor. Emma is a remarkable person, but she is flawed. Kate Beckinsale shows the little quirks of the figure masterfully. You see, her look at some of Harriet Smith's simpler conversations is casually disgusted, but she shows no remorse for having ruined Harriet's proposal until this action ruins her own marital bliss in the end. They see their narcissism and it reflects Frank Churchill in saying that they would do harm to others to achieve their own goals. For Emma, ​​it was Matchmaker and a new friend with whom she could pass the time after she lost her governess through marriage. For Frank Churchill, it is the promise of the woman he loves as he treats her and others in a hideous way to keep the secret. In the book, she recognizes all this in a stifling awakening of all the mistakes she has made. Both Kate Beckinsale and Gyneth Paltrow convince by their pangs of conscience, but Paltrow's more childlike and stagnant, while Beckinsale's awakening is more real and serious, and you see the transition from a childish, selfish behavior to a friendly and thoughtful adult. Both versions are very good, but I prefer these.
