The second part (actually Episode 4-8) of the successful Danish TV series is somewhat inferior to the first, but also has a lot of laughter and fear. This time, Udo Kier plays two parts, like the monster baby and his demonic father. Other outstanding parts this time are the doctor Krogshoj of Søren Pilmark, who took up the terrible revenge of Dr. Krogshoj. Helmer must face. Once again, the patient Frau Drusse tries to solve the secrets in the Miss Marple style. It ends at a cliffhanger and after the death of the main actors Ernst Hugo Järegård (Dr. Helmer) and Kirsten Rolffes (Mrs. Drusse) you ask yourself how they will do the third part, but I hope Trier will be there Unfortunately, Morten Rotne Leffers, the dishwasher of Down syndrome no. 2, died shortly after. Look for Stellan Skarsgård in a cameo. ***
