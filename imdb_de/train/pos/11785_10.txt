I do not know exactly how to explain "Darkend Room" because in summary it would not really do it justice. It's a typical Lynchian short film with two beautiful girls in a strange, mysterious situation. I'd say this shorts is definitely more on the "Mulholland Drive" end of the Lynchian spectrum than "The Elephant Man" or "The Straight Story." It's hidden on the Lynch website and worth the search.
