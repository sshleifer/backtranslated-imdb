The film takes you from the fifties to the near present by focusing on three main architects who contribute to the development and development of the sport. Honest "home videos" like videos of themselves and their contemporaries take you further into their world. The music layers, the culture, the technical information, a glimpse of the participant's athleticism and the great big wave images give you a comprehensive insight into this aspect of surfing. <br /> <br /> Worth seeing.
