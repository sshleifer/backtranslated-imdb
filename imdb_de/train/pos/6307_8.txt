I had never heard of this movie, even though George Clooney (whose company has produced and he is seen in a very funny supporting role) and Steven Soderbergh, his 11-year-old Ocean director, were there. Worse, we picked it up in a $ 4.99 (Canadian Dollars!) Discount box. What a great and pleasant surprise. But then I think if William H. Macy is there, you can not be disappointed. This was very reminiscent of these England comedies in the fifties. OK, with more profanity. This is a strange and sometimes obtrusively funny movie. The actual robbery made me laugh so much that I cried. Perhaps the funniest use of underpants in film history. Maybe it was the low expectations that I had, but I saw with a group of people and we had a great time. Best $ 5 I've spent in ages.
