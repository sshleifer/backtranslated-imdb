The Theory Of Flight is an engaging study of an artist (Branagh) who wants to free himself from boredom and mediocrity, and a terminally ill patient (Bonham-Carter) in the final stages of ASL who is in a wheelchair and wants to make love to a man before he dies. <br /> <br /> Helena Bonham-Carter exudes wit, defiance and independence as an ASL patient who is virtually dependent on the people around her to look after her. <br /> <br Kenneth Branagh, convicted by community service, completes Helena's charm with sad melancholy and creates a sentimental, captivating love story in which two people try to help each other before time runs out.
