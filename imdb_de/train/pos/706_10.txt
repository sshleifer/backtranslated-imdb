I have to say that I wanted to see this movie for a long time and I was not disappointed. The drama of Dominic Monaghan is just fantastic. As a part that does not understand myself, I can tell how the story unfolds. I have never experienced anything like it, but some awake moments are superimposed on sleeping and it can be weird. It was a great movie, worth every penny. I hope one day I can work with Tess myself, it would be an honor and beyond. I recommend it to anyone. Maybe not small children because they get scared. But if you're an insomniac like me, you understand the world, the secrets and the fear. You will love it. <br /> <br /> F.
