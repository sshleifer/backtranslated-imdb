I have to say, I was impressed that the cinematography was amazing, the frames close to perfection and the way he built the suspense around a theme that sounds more like a terrible boredom than unbelievably two narrators, one , one unseen. Both try to explain the meaning of a series of pictures that caused a scandal a long time ago. The film is all about theories and explanations of views, but the conclusion is pretty shocking, I must say. Definitely a movie that earns more than 171 votes. <br /> <br /> With only 66 minutes playing time, the movie still felt like a complete job. Fantastic direction! I have to say, much better than Blood of the Poet, which reminds me of a strange reason. <br /> <br /> I assume you can call it slangwort artsy. It's actually just a lot of professional talk about different theories and impressive visual effects, but the crew and Ruiz have made it. At least for me. An amazing movie.
