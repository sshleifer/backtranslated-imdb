Two great comedians in a great movie by Neil Simon based on his hit. <br /> <br /> A great combination, especially when the comedians are Matthau and Burns. No wonder Burns won an Oscar for it. He is as sharp and funny as ever. And Matthau is just right for him, albeit a bit more scared. <br /> <br /> This is a familiar area of ​​Simon: two veteran vaudeville partners meet for a TV special, but after many years they can not stand each other anymore. <br /> <br /> It is a pleasure to see how these two choose each other, their scenes together make this movie an absolute pleasure. I especially like the "Knock, Knock, Knock / Enter!" Scene. And if you're a fan of Burns or Matthau, you'll enjoy it too. <br /> <br /> Actually you enjoy the whole movie. <br /> <br /> Ten stars. Put a little "sunshine" in your life.
