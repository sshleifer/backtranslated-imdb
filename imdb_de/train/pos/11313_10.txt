Gino Costa (Massimo Girotti) is a young and handsome drifter arriving in a street bar. He meets the young, beautiful and dissatisfied Mrs. Giovanna Bragana (Clara Calamai) and her old and fat husband Giuseppe Bragana (Juan de Landa), the owners of the bar. He exchanges his mechanical skills through food and lodging and has a relationship with Giovanna. Both decide to kill Giuseppe and fake a car accident. Their relationship is influenced by guilt and police investigation. This masterpiece ends in a tragic way. The noir and neo-realistic film by Luchino Visconti is outstanding. This is the first time I have seen this version of "The Postman Ring Twice". I loved the 1946 version with Lana Turner and the 1981 version, in which Jack Nicholson and Jessica Lange have one of the hottest sex scenes in the history of cinema, but this one is certainly the best. My voice is ten.
