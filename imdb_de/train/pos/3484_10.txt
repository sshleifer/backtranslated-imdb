This is simply the best movie ever! Sorry, Hollywood! I saw it in the early 70s as soon as it appeared on Bulgarian TV, and I immediately loved it (at that time I was 14). 25 years later, I bought it on videotape and appeared here a few months ago on a DVD here in Bulgaria. I live with this movie already 35 years and my friends and my family too. My son was a teenager when he saw it for the first time, and he loved it immediately (and this is the generation that grew up and practically saw only Hollywood movies and does not speak or understand Russian at all!). What makes this masterpiece of Danelia so special? It's hard to say because it's difficult to describe the beauty ... But the fact is that you can watch this movie dozens of times with the same pleasure as the first time. I can not remember any such movie, no matter how many millions it cost or how great the cast was ... Chapeau, Maestro Danelia! Bulgaria loves you!
