Impressive. A really awesome "Trip" movie that has a lot of super-surreal imagery, dark intentions and a black, rather strange feeling of how comic animals need to see the world. It's populated with a very cute bunch of characters bending and flowing with distorted backgrounds. As with all cool fancy, the wandering plot is secondary to the stunning pictures and we follow a little cat and his zombie sister as they encounter death, deluge, water elephants, samurai swordsmen and pigs who are fishing. I had never heard of it, but now I love it - probably because it reminded me of the surreal pencil work of an American cartoonist; Bill Plympton. It's a denial for fans of strange, pretty things, and I was glued to the screen because I was afraid I would miss something great. Simply put, it's 'Hello Kitty' without 'o'.
