I have always enjoyed movies that portray life as it is. Life sometimes has boring spots, no real action and not necessarily a happy ending. "A river flows through" is the perfect name for this film (and Norman Maclean's novel). Life ebbs and flows like a river, and it has rough spots, but it is a wonderful journey. <br /> <br /> Robert Redford brings a lot to the movie. His narrative has a friendly feeling that fits perfectly with the picture. As a director, he is reserved and quiet and captures some incredibly beautiful scenes. As far as acting is concerned, Craig Sheffer and Brad Pitt work surprisingly well as brothers. I'm not sure how to describe Tom Skerritt and Brenda Blethyn's performances, only that they really feel real. "A river runs through" is a wonderful movie. <br /> <br /> 8.6 out of 10
