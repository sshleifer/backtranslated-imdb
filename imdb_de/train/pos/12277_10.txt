Perhaps the best book by Isabel Allende, House of the Spirits, describes an alternative Chilean story, full of magic, a mystical veil and a kind of ubiquitous sadness. This movie contains a great cast as well as a great artistic direction with a script that can not contain the quality of this book. It is unusual for an almost unknown country like Chile to be depicted as well as it is in this film, whose only sin is to aim too high, and therefore the illiterates are a little annoyed, mostly because they have little understood.
