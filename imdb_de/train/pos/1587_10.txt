Does anyone know where I can watch or download Season 4 episodes "What I like about you" on the Internet? Because I would die to see them, and here in Germany they will not be shown on TV. Please help me. I do not want to see the episodes of the fourth season bad. I've already seen Episode 4 and Episode 18 on YouTube. However, I could not find any episodes of the fourth season. Is there perhaps a website where I can see the consequences? I read some comments on German forums and there were people who had already seen episodes of the fourth season, even though they were not shown on TV in Germany. I appreciate any information that I can get. Thanks, Kate
