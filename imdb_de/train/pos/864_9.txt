Certainly one of the French movies of the decade, a tight, atmospheric thriller that takes full advantage of the main characters that hinder the listening in order to use the sound in a way that is rarely explored in the cinema. Emannuelle Devos offers a truly impressive, multi-faceted performance, sometimes unobtrusive and manipulative, sometimes open and vulnerable. Another reason why those who appreciate good cinema should keep their eyes open to offers from France.
