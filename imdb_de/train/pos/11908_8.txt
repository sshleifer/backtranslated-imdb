This movie plays very well with an audience. Especially when the hunt begins. Also, Trevor Howard with his sensitive, intelligent charms and Jean Simmons with their innocent demeanor and piercing eyes are great. <br /> <br /> The movie begins as a psychological drama, but after the murder he becomes a chase the two lead towards the border. Some may think that the persecution is superfluous, but in fact the persecution is indispensable as it helps to defuse the character of Jean Simmons by bringing them out of the oppressive household. Besides, it helps to bring out the real killer who suddenly gets into such a position position that they have to finish the job. The killer rightly believed that the Simmons character would be locked away after his arrest. And it's true that her lack of control in the household - as well as evidence pointing in the direction - did not get her out of the murder charge. The chase helps to expose the truth. <br /> <br /> This is a fun movie. Choose it if you can find it.
