I'm just sorry for this movie: there are far, too many wide-angle close-ups, and if they irritate you beyond the stamina, it's fair enough. They drove me barmy for the first ten minutes. But after that I made a kind of truce with the awful camera; and long before the end of the movie, I stopped taking care of it. This comedy is too rich to destroy so easily. It's funny, it's funny, ALL the performer's whimsical release is flawless, and as much as Usher gazes at his characters through a cold fisheye lens-he may not particularly care about them-he manages to present them with warmth. In fact, "Mystery Men" is not only funnier, not only smarter, but also deeper than anyone seems to have expected. The jokes in the Austin Powers movies, for example, are less funny than the jokes here and are also much toothless. The satire of "Mystery Men" bites when it's worth biting and gnaws gently when it's not. It does not scoff at any old thing. Contrary to what some have said (I have to consider them unobserved) critics, ideas are never involved. <br /> <br /> The superheroes are an attractive bunch. Sure, they are secondary, but they are not secondary. The Blue Rajah, for example, just throws people cutlery, and he's not so good at it. On the other hand, he is not weird bad. He is better in his limited area than most people and he practices diligently. He is not a buffoon, which makes him much funnier than if he were. If Superman is Christ in a Cape, the Mystery Men are all little demigods from the foothills of Mount Olympus, in Cape. Much more funny; also much more adorable.
