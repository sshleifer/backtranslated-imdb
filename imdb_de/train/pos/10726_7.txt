To my surprise, I enjoyed 'Spacecamp' a lot, I remember seeing it about 13 years ago, and recently I've put it back. I was pretty impressed. Obviously, the special effects in today's space films like Armageddon and Deep Impact are far superior to those of SpaceCamp. However, this film had a story - a very stereotyped story from the 1980s, in which one could almost recite the next line of dialogue before hearing it. But I liked that - they do not make movies anymore, so it was a refreshing change. It was interesting to see Kelly Preston, Leaf Phoenix and Lea Thomson in early roles, along with Tom Skerrit and Kate Capshaw, to give substance to the light and fluffy plot. Absolutely excited about the robot named Jinx, he was very cute, but unfortunately had more emotions than some of the main characters. The film was almost inspiring in its own right, and it was interesting to know that it was shot at the NASA Space Camp in Alabama (I think).
