I'm not an expert in acting or other movie details, but this movie really hit me hard. I do not think I'll ever forget it. A scene specifically (I think anyone who has seen the movie knows which ones I speak) is imprinted in my brain by an earlier commentator). It was also very moving, but not quite so direct and brutal. If you are sensitive at all, tears will come into your eyes, but Anjos Do Sol (Angel of the Sun) can stay with you forever. <br /> <br /> This is a very depressing topic, but I think no, I hope the film manages to pay more attention to it. <br /> <br /> More people have to watch this movie !!!!!!
