One of the most provocative films ever backed by McLaren's Lisp with outstanding cinematography, and a stunning quote "Do you believe in love first?" <br /> <br /> A trace of Expressionism was evident in this picture catapulting the films flawlessly. Gabby (Alias ​​Joey), played by Eva Longoria, was so enthusiastic about the film and the role she played that she did not even bother to be mentioned in her filmography. Lol. <br /> <br /> The best part of the film would no doubt have to be the heroic rescue by MC Clure, saving the young 'handicapped' child with the language weakness. What I can add was perfectly implemented! James Cahil's use of sound effects is unsurpassed to this day. The drug explosion he performs at the beginning of the film is painfully realistic. When I saw this movie for the first time, I was so excited that I did not respect the South Angles Gang Inthused brothers and the CTM (Cut Throat Mafia). This was by far one of the most enclosing gaps Cahill has set for filming. <br /> <br /> This film has a sentimental value for me personally and I will download it in the near future. That's if I can find it anywhere, LOL!
