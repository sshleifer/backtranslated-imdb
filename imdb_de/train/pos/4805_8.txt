When I heard about this movie for the first time, I thought it was like The Duchess (2008), but when I saw The Young Victoria for the first 30 minutes, I knew it would not be just a solid movie. Almost everything in this movie is great, the costumes are really fantastic and the settings are also beautifully shot. <br /> <br /> The only thing that really failed me is the performances. Emily Blunt (The Devil Wears Prada) is the star of the film that brings Victoria to life, and with this movie she shows she is a great actress and possibly chooses a first Oscar nomination for her performance. Rupert Friend is almost bland as Prince Albert, but he has a great chemistry with Emily Blunt. Paul Bettany is also stuck as Lord Melbourne, though I had expected more from him. Jim Broadbent and Miranda Richardson both have supporting roles, but are forgotten. <br /> <br /> For me, the film feels unfinished. Maybe the screenwriters have changed too many things in the script, I do not know, but that's how I feel about the movie. <br /> <br /> But overall it's a great movie about the early years of Victoria with a great performance by Emily Blunt.
