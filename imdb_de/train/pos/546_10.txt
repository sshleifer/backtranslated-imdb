I thought it was one of the best sequels I've seen in a long time. Sometimes I felt like I just wanted someone to die. Stanley's death of the annoying characters was brilliant. It was such a successful movie that you were happy when he died and died. My only problem in some scenes was that it looked like someone was filming it with a home camera, and it was weird. Judd Nelson is cute, at least in my opinion, and he was excellent in the role of Stanley Caldwell. Brilliant movie.
