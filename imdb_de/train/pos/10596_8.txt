Every time this movie is on the BBC, someone in the Radio Times says he's a satire against the post-war world of rationing and the welfare state. I do not think that's the point of the movie. The film parodies the Spivs (small time criminals who run the black market) and the Housewives League, which opposed state restrictions but was actually a Tory front organization. Yes, of course, the film sends the political / social retinue In the situation, however, the people end up recognizing that they need all the controls to ensure a fair society. They want to be more British and more confused than by foreign countries. <br /> <br /> But I do not think they will resort to it exactly as they were before.
