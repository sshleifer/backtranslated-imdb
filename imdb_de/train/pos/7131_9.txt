This TV movie is brilliant. This is probably the best and most popular role of BAFTA winner John Thaw (Kavanagh Q.C. and Inspector Morse). Tom Oakley (Thaw), the widowed man, has been living alone in a village since the death of his wife and son. Now he has landed in an evacuee called Willaim Beech (Nick Robinson). As he meets this child, a friendship develops. Willaim's mother (Annabelle Apsion) wants him back. After Tom worries that William has not contacted him, he goes to London to find him. In the end, Willaim comes home with a loving family (or dad). During the Second World War, this is an excellent movie. It was nominated for the BAFTA Lew Grade Award and won the National Television Award for Most Popular Drama. John Thaw was number 3 of the 50 Greatest Stars of Television. Very well!
