I do not know what the previous reviewer has seen, but I think that's what ratings are, personal tastes. In this film lacked the depth, a very deep movie, many layers of emotions that influence. Subjugations of restrained love by submission to social beliefs, taboos of times and classes, racial relationships are not in a very good state of equality, guilt, longing, hate, confusion, very dark, I thought, under the skin To join the film, a flowing film that is not slow, as already said, you release yourself to the flow of the film, the emotions show up, the characters reveal their shortcomings, their bad inside, excellent and really very cruel!
