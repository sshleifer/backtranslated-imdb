The Lady and Shanghai, made in 1946 and published in 1948, were one of the great films Welles had made on his return from relative exile to produce Citizen Kane. This film is dark, brooding and expresses earlier paranoia of the Cold War. He is a movie noir thriller. The film's cinematography is filled with Welle's characteristic quirks of odd angles, fast cuts, long pans, and eerie light. The use of ambient street music is a precursor to the incredibly long opening in Touch of Evil, and the mysterious Chinese characters and sequences in Chinatown can only be considered as inspiration for Roman Polanski's Chinatown. Unfortunately, it is Welles's obsession with technical filmmaking that this film is hurt in its entirety. The plot of this story is often lost behind a sometimes incomprehensible jumble of film techniques. <br /> <br /> Despite this criticism, however, the wonderful performances by Welles, Hayworth and especially Glenn Anders (laughter) film are a pleasure to see. Orson Welles not only pulls out the Irish Brog, but the tattered identities as a honest but dangerous sailor. Rita Hayworth, who was married to Welles at the time, breaks with her usual role as a sexual goddess and assumes a real depth and inconsistency. After all, the strange and bizarre portrayal of Glenn Anders or the partner of Elsa's husbands is a classic!
