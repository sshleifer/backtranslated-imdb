I started to expect this movie and was expecting nothing, just another movie to watch, but for the first twenty minutes, the artwork and the main character, which is puzzling, have not talked much and really convinced me in this movie br /> I really liked this movie, it was dark, beautiful and really touching. It's a bit slow, but the dive was complete. The direction was fantastic, telling us piece by piece the story that led to the conviction of Joey and his life behind bars. The music was really great and well integrated into the scenes. The end was unexpected with a twist that I did not see coming. It's not the kind of movie we often see.
