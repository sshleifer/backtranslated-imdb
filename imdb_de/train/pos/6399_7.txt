Although it was certainly not the best movie I've ever seen, it was certainly worth the $ 8 (which is not to say for many movies these days.) This was a pleasant report from a true one History, though many details of the real story were twisted for the film (ie Billy Whay's character consisted of three or four people in real history combined together.) Robert DeNiro was naturally good and Cuba Gooding, Jr. was also impressive.
