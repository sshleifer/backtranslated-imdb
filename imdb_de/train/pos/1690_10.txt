I found the memorable quotes in search of video clips; You forgot one of my favorites ... Old Person 1: You know, I remember the first time they played the thing. <br /> <br /> Old person 2: you remember pterodactyls. <br /> <br /> Old Person 1: And I remember you fell for it, Hookline and Sinker. <br /> <br /> Old person 2: Oh, I did not. <br /> <br /> Old lady: That's what you did. You put a big bucket on your head and use them to take off army bats to fight Martians. <br /> <br /> Old person 2: Are not you dead yet?
