Yes, it's a bit of a stupid movie. So if you're looking for an Oscar performance, forget it ...... but if you love John Candy's humor, this is a must. We've lost John Candy before he's had enough of his great comedy brand, and he's only better in one movie: planes, trains, and automobiles (with Steve Martin). Outstanding fringe benefit from Eugene Levy, perhaps his best work as the cynical Sal DiPasquale. Also good acting by Richard Libertini, Alley Mills & Pat Hingle. If you're a John Candy or Eugene Levy fan, you need to see this dark and out-of-print movie.
