This movie is good for what it is and unpretentious; However, I would not mind twice: I am a Peter Cushing Completeist and that's why I looked at it. The best thing about this movie is: BREVITY and EFFECTIVENESS. Compared to other similar films, it does NOT drag its feet forever, because each of the four segments (plus one segment) lasts less than 30 minutes, the last one under ten. Good scary vibes. In the first section, the horror writer suffering from "writer's block" moves to a secluded old house looking for inspiration. He even finds too much of it when he introduces one of his fictional madmen. Plot setup similar to PREMATURE BURIAL. Good use of perspective: If the writer becomes mentally ill ... or (as the end shows), his trophy wife wants her lover to play with the man's phobias to drive him mad and secure his goods. Survive the surviving Bimbo to enjoy the fruits of their ingenious plan? In the second section, two longtime lost friends meet in the same secluded old house, but can not help but visit a bizarre horror museum with the wax figure of the long-lost love of their youth that had once separated them. From the Gothic museum guard, they learn that the depicted woman is a dead ax with a murderer ... or was she? <br /> <br /> The third section was less interesting for me. <br /> <br /> The fourth movie features a horror movie actor who thinks he's the best of all, lost in the depths of low-budget C movies. In search of a costume that gives his fictitious vampire more credibility, he gets the right deal. This segment also lacks the solidity of the first two. <br /> <br /> Acting is fair, with the first two segments making up the bulk of the contribution. Good movie, taken with a grain of salt. Not the best Cushing or Lee ... but worth it to see it.
