With all that's ending with MJ at the moment, I've started listening to his music, seeing the weird documentary here and there, seeing The Wiz and Moonwalker again. Maybe I just want to get some insight into this guy that I thought was really cool in the '80s, just to decide if he was guilty or innocent. Moonwalker is part of the biography, a part of the feature film that I remember when I saw him in the cinema when he was originally published. Some of them have subtle messages about MJ's feelings towards the press, and even the obvious message of drugs is bad m'kay. <br /> <br /> Visually stunning, but of course it's all about Michael Jackson, unless you like MJ from afar anyway you'll hate it and find it boring. Some may refer to MJ as egoists for agreeing to the movie BUT MJ, and most of his fans would say he did it for the fans, which is true if he's really nice of him. <br /> <br /> The real feature When the movie starts, it's only about 20 minutes on, excluding Smooth Criminal and convincing Joe Pesci as a psychopathic, all-powerful drug ruler. Why he wants MJ so dead is not mine. Because MJ overheard his plans? Joe Pesci's character was thrilled, he wanted people to know he was giving drugs, and so, I do not know, maybe he just hates MJ's music. <br /> <br /> Lots of cool things like MJ, becoming a car and a robot and the whole Speed ​​Demon sequence. In addition, the director must have had the patience of a saint to film the kiddy-bath sequence, as directors usually hate working with a child, not to mention a whole bunch of them that are complex Play dance scene. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is this movie for people who like MJ on one level or another (which in my opinion is most people). If not, stay away. It's trying to spread a healthy message, and ironically, MJ's best buddy in this movie is a girl! Michael Jackson is truly one of the most talented people ever to be on this planet, but is he to blame? Well, with all the attention I've given to this topic ... hmmm, I do not know, because people behind closed doors can be different, I know that from a fact. He is either a very nice but stupid guy or one of the sickliest liars. I hope he is not last.
