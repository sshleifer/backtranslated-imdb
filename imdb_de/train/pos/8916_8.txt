Absolutely the very first movie that scared me to death. I happened to catch it when my older brother (r.i.p.) watched it. It was on a black and white TV and not really a good picture, but I was interested. Shortly thereafter, my people bought a color set and the million dollar movie showed it, as luck would have it, on a Sunday. <br /> <br /> I had forgotten most of the plot, but it was not long before catching up ... and I was so scared that I could hardly sleep this night! I mean, it was just a movie, but it was a creature that not only came from outer space, but you could not hear or see it ... and once it got to you, it was too late. Even now, after all this time, it still shakes my back. A true classic and even better a classic, I have seen him put off the pants of a new generation! <br /> <br /> Long live The Blob!
