I can not accept the negative comments of other reviewers. They are too critical, maybe because they are stuck in the past. I'd like a comment from someone who has never seen Basic Instinct 1, maybe someone who was very young? I left the cinema and was glad that I had not been influenced by the IMDb reviewers. 14 hours later, I still try to find mistakes in the plot, but I can not think of anything serious. My advice to all is that you see it for yourself and decide for yourself. <br /> <br /> A similar pattern to Basic Instinct 1 follows, but the plot is less confused. In the end, I still wondered, but in a more satisfying way. Sharon Stone is as sexy and evil as before, wearing her 48 years extremely well; This remains their determining role. David Morrisey was satisfactory, although he is not a Michael Douglas. From the side cast I particularly liked David Thewlis as a police officer.
