A very strong movie. Bruce is good and Brad too. <br /> <br /> When I think there are two cities missing from the list of receptionists Bruce remembered. <br /> <br /> That means the woman was a real insurance she did her job. <br /> <br /> Well, the property of Novikov seems to work in this movie. However, I believe in back to the future theory of the multiplicity of worlds. So Bruce could save the world, but not his world. In the theory of parallel worlds The man can meet himself. <br /> <br /> And I think that's no problem. I do not agree with Dr. Brown from behind ... <br /> <br /> But the story of 12 Monkeys has its own beauty. Despite all these theories of one world or many or many continents, one can believe that he is really insane and the doctor - his girlfriend was just lost. <br /> <br /> A sequence of events that may cause him to believe is from the future. The bullet - well, it could be a mistake, a fake. <br /> <br /> Well, I like this movie - I have to buy a DVD. <br /> <br /> Best.
