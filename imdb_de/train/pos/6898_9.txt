This is a tongue-in-cheek film right from the beginning, with a voice that makes fun of everything French and then produces a rather na√Øve but very courageous hero in Fanfan La Tulipe. The straightforward young man portrayed by the magnificent Gerard Philippe absolutely believes in the short-lived Lollobrigida predictions of fate - in particular, that he will marry the daughter of King Louis XV! The problem is that La Lollo soon finds out that she also loves Fanfan ... <br /> <br /> Driven by good swordfights, cavalcades and other spirited action sequences, the movie moves at a brisk pace and with many comics moments The Direction is perhaps the weakest aspect, but the movie is so light and takes itself so little seriously that I could not second thoughts about these shortcomings. Look out for Noel Roquevert, a traditional heavy film in French films, who tries to steal La Lollo, making himself a nuisance, and presents the script to the fortune-teller who reads the hand of La Lollo! And what a gem is Marcel Herrand as the gracious King Louis XV! That's not all: so many beautiful women in a movie wish me, I would be back in France in 1952 and on set! The film may have come out that year, but his enthusiasm, cheek, great narrative, impeccable photography, and the memorable Gerard Philippe keep him modern and enjoyable. I would not hesitate to recommend it to my grandchildren, not to mention those who love movies in general and Swashbucklers in particular! See it!
