When I saw "Gray Gardens" for the first time a few years ago, I remember laughing and finding it weird. Years later, I still laugh loudly when I see it, but after many visits, I have seen the beauty in the strange, twisted relationship between the inseparable "big" Edith Bouvier Beale and her daughter "Little" Edith Bouvier Beale <br /> Mother and daughter live together in their decaying 28-room estate in East Hampton, giving the term "shabby chic" a whole new meaning. With countless cats, raccoons and possums as roommates, Aunt and Niece of Jackie O. let the filmmakers Albert and David Maysles into their mansion to film them in their daily lives. The result is a funny, beautiful, sad and moving account of true love and anarchy. <br /> <br /> The relationship between Big and Little Edie is a testament to the unbreakable bonds of love. And her life is an example of drive, determination and will. This movie has more to recommend than I can put into words. It is a rare experience that you have to see for yourself. <br /> <br />
