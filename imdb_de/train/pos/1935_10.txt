Writing something honest and true is a challenge. It is even better to know how to shoot it and how to put it together without making it trivial. Ishai Setton's film is one of those where you can see life in its simplicity and beauty. I was touched by "The Big Bad Swim" and will promote it as much as possible from now on. It's just a shame that I can not show my friends anything (for example, do you know a DVD?), Because talking is good ... but seeing something is better. Everyone can not go to festivals to discover such gems, and this movie is really worth being out there! A big THANK YOU to the staff of this masterpiece, and I'm waiting for it to be distributed.
