From today's perspective it is sometimes difficult to watch older films. It's annoying to see that the stereotypical Wallflower librarian needs to take off her glasses and become pretty and stupid enough to win a man. Especially a shallow and unstable man. He's obviously a player (I would not trust him to remain true to her) who does not want to settle down, who only looks at stupid attractive women and always calls her "baby" (ick!). Even after she has completely changed her appearance and life for him, he only goes to her after being (allegedly) rejected by another woman and finds out that Connie has spent all her money renovating a boat for him. I wanted her to resist him and not chase after him! His sudden change within minutes was totally unrealistic and did not work for me. <br /> <br /> Apart from this subplot, I liked the movie. How can you not dance sailors dancing together ?! (You can say that they were from San Francisco ...; D) The rehearsal dance was great. Watching Ginger Rogers as he deliberately fell into the "right steps" was great. The last dance scene "Face the Music" with beautiful costumes and Art Deco set was beautiful. And I really enjoyed "We Saw the Sea" (though they used it a few times too often, as if they realized it was their best song). <br /> <br /> As with most musicals (IMO), the plot was a bit weak - and the songs were fine, but the dance is worth the movie. I wish they had been able to show a few shots of San Francisco since the movie was supposed to be filmed. <br /> <br /> It's also strange to see such a carefree marine movie, knowing what Hitler was doing at the time. I must try to expose all knowledge to immerse myself in a fictitious fantasy land.
