"The Plainsman" represents the directing power of Cecil B. DeMille in his most inexact and untrue situation. It created parallel acts for a no less outstanding entourage than Wild Bill Hickok (Gary Cooper), Buffalo Bill Cody (James Ellison), Calamity Jane (Jean Arthur), George Armstrong Custer and Abraham Lincoln to interact even though Lincoln was actually in The situation was already dead by the time the story took place. Every now and then, DeMille hovered dangerously close to the truth, but just as easily deviated from her into an unabashed spectacle. The film is an attempt to backstage Custer's past with a pile of fiction loosely based on the lives of people who were already the product of manufactured things and legends. According to DeMille, this is really the world - a zeitgeist in the annals of entertainment, but by today's standards a pretty camping relic. <br /> <br /> TRANSFER: Considering the vintage of the film, this is a moderately pleasing transmission with often pure white and extremely strong black. In some scenes there is a considerable amount of film grain and at other moments it lacks. All in all, the picture quality is therefore somewhat inconsistent, but it's never all bad or all right. just a bit better than in the middle of the street. Age-related artifacts are kept to a minimum and digital anomalies do not distract. The audio is mono, but nicely balanced. EXTRAS: Forget it. It is universal! Bottom Line: Painted as a pseudo-story on celluloid, this western is captivating and fun. Just take the characters and the story with a grain of salt? in some cases ?? a whole box seems more appropriate!
