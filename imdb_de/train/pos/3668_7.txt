I saw this movie recently and I really liked it. It gives insight into creating indie films and how much work is really needed if you have a low budget and need an actor-actress name to get people and others to see it and the movie demonstrate. Bobby Myeres, played by Modine and his partner Saul - Paul Linder, is an excellent combination of eccentric Miachel Bates. A "NAME" actor by Alan Bates was a perfect casting decision in the movie and for the movie. My favorite actor was Sandy Ryan, who was played by the great and underrated Debra Kara Unger with her own special performance in the movie's film. If you enjoy thinking while watching a comedy, this one is for you. Low budget meets lower budget with high salmon content.
