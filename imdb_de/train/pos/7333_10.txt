This is a great movie. probably the best movie I have ever seen. I watch it over and over again. I have to give him 10/10 stars, because as I said, this is probably the best movie I have ever seen. This movie + popcorn + coke = best mix you can imagine. If you want to watch a movie, I recommend it clearly. At first I sawn it, I liked it, so I bought it and now I own it and probably see it every day. My sons like it and think that this is the best movie I have ever seen. This movie is about Guy In Fantasy World. I do not want to ruin the whole movie so you can enjoy it after reading my text. Lovely Movie Nice characters, nice story and just great stuff. a must watch movie. I hope you liked my comment Cya <br /> <br /> Jim Make
