Alright, I have to admit that I've never seen "Rhoda" and only one or two episodes of the "Mary Tyler Moore Show". Although I know nothing about this duo of comedic talent, I still enjoyed this movie very much. Mary goes back to work. Rose tries her luck as a comedian. Rhoda is struggling with a photography career. And Meredith ... what exactly is she doing again? These three stories we follow for over two hours are amusing and entertaining in their own way. When the two longtime friends reunite, the movie just gets better. <br /> <br /> I was surprised how good the writing was. The little jokes of Mary and Rhoda were funny. The script itself was very well put together. <br /> <br /> I had seen Moore and Harper in other films in recent years and thought that they were very good. But I had no idea that they worked so well as a team. While both actresses are doing their part to fulfill the title of this movie, they never seem to let me down. (During the movie.) Joie Lenz and Marisa Ryan play their roles okay, but nothing great. The rest of the cast like Jonah, Cecile and .... everyone else works well together. <br /> <br /> As this is a reunion, you would expect a fan of the two shows to enjoy it. From a non-fan, I still enjoyed this little get-together. Good storylines for every character and the two main characters make this movie very good. (The newer version of the MTM theme song does not hurt either.)
