I thought this movie would be much better than most movie critics would appreciate. Although it has confusing parts of the plot, it does not significantly affect your understanding of the movie. That being said, unless you are open-minded about more open political ideas, this is probably not the movie for you. I found all the actors in the movie outstanding. Every character has its funny moments and the audience at the Tribeca Film Festival laughed the whole thing. I thought satire would be a little over the top in a certain area, but that's intentionally done. John Cusack is right, although he is settled in the future, one really sees the present.
