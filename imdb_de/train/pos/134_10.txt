Someone is releasing this film on DVD so that he can take his sacred place as one of the greatest movies of all time in ten to twenty years, when critics and film historians look back on the so-called 90s films and see how sad they were and how Lars von Trier wanted to revolutionize and revitalize the international film world with this masterpiece. As it stands, "Zentropa" (or "Europe," as it is called outside the US) is one of the most intriguing and artistic views of the bleak and almost psychotic uncertainty that has emerged from post-war Europe, the decimated German landscape whose physical horrors were only achieved by damaging the psyche of humans. Von Trier paints brilliantly his vision on the screen. You'll feel like you're seeing a lost late 1940s spy-noir classic with perfectly lit black-and-white scenes, while at the same time feeling like you're off the cutting edge, especially in scenes like that Assassination aboard the train. When you watch this movie, you literally experience the development of an art form. <br /> <br /> For some reason Von Trier soon found himself in his own dogma movement. And while "Breaking the Waves" and "Dancer in the Dark" are classics, with "Zentropa" he has really elevated the art of filmmaking to new and exciting heights. 10/10, ages like a good wine and asks for a DVD release.
