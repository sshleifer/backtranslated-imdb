"Johnny Dangerously" is a kind of hit-and-miss comedy that laughs and "huh?". But I suggest giving it a chance. I think it is very overlooked. Not too many people give this movie a chance. It works. Just think of a little parody of "Goodfellas". Michael Keaton is very funny in his role. And he does it well. Johnny Dangerously is a gangster who wants to go higher in life. He just works his way up from the big bosses to a beautiful woman. And of course, as with many mob films, someone wants to see him dead. 90% of the jokes laugh. I said, give a chance. Just take your favorite gangster movies and mix in a comedy. They have "Johnny Dangerously". <br /> <br /> 7/10
