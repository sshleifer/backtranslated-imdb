Farewell friend aka Adieu L'Ami / Honor among the thieves is not perfect, but it's a decent and entertaining thriller that sees the French Algerian war veterans Alain Delon and Charles Bronson trapped in the same basement vault, one that stole bonds returns others to clean up the two million wages that sit there on Christmas weekend. Of course, things are not so easy even after opening the vault, which leads to neat twists and turns. On the debit side there is a very bizarre striptease scene in a parking garage. Bronson has a very irritating Fonzie-like catchphrase, which he uses in the worst moments, Brigitte Fossey, who may have the terribly misunderstood hairstyle of the 60s (she does) looks like a bald woman with her wig off her head in strong wind is blown back. "I'll cook spaghetti! I'll learn to love well! I read Shakespeare!" Language is hysterical in all wrong ways? and it's a shame about the awful final line / attitude, but otherwise this is a surprisingly entertaining and unpretentious number that is worth checking to see if you find a decent print. <br /> <br /> The British Cinema Club DVD features only English movies soundtrack, but since Delon's voices and the rest of the cast are pretty well dubbed, that's not a big deal, especially since the widescreen transfer is pretty good quality is.
