Okay - I admit. I think Kenny Doughty looks great in this movie - but apart from his good looks, the film is carried by a sometimes predictable but sensible plot. <br /> <br /> First we will be with the three main girls from the movie. A headmistress - very worried about her image and never married. A policeman - with a child and a bad ex to go on. The third - a power and status hungry doctor with the desire for recognition and three exs. They are almost the "First Wives Club", and indeed there are many verbal attacks by exs as well as some "He left the credit card". The characters are set - the movie continues. McDowell's character, the headmistress, arrives late for a funeral - where a young organist who works for the regular player (Doughty) attracts their attention. What will her two friends say about the next disaster? Will they be happy afterwards? <br /> <br /> One or two handkerchiefs are recommended if you are tearful - the end uplifting, but maybe not what you would expect. All in all a great movie that stands out among the current action options, special effects and Schlock horror.
