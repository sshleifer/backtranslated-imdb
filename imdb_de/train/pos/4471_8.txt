Gene Kelly, Frank Sinatra, Kathryn Grayson and Jose Iturbi play the main role in "Anchors Aweigh" directed by George Sidney. Kelly and Sinatra are Joe and Clarence, two navy guys on holiday in Hollywood. They meet a little boy (Dean Stockwell) and when he brings him home, they meet his aunt (Grayson). Clarence falls in love with her. She wants a casting for Jose Iturbi. They try to help, but there is a mixture. <br /> <br /> This is a very energetic musical with great dancing and singing by Kelly and Sinatra. Kelly can dance with Jerry the mouse in a sexy sequence. Grayson sings blinds and my heart sings. None of my favorite voices, but she is doing well. Iturbi's piano work is beautiful. <br /> <br /> Sinatra shows his versatility and why the girls with these big blue eyes and boyish face walked over him. For Kelly this was a big break for him at MGM. Wonderful movie, very lively.
