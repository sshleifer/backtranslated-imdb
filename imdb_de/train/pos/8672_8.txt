WWE's last PPV in 2006 turned out to be a hit with the fans, but for one reason, the ladder match, planned only as Paul London and Brian Kendrick against William Regal and Dave Taylor. When the last crap PPV took place from December to Dismember, WWE knew he needed to do something to get the fans talking again. This proved useful when he introduced MNM and The Hardy Boyz to the mix and announced that the match would become a Ladder Match. <br /> <br /> The match was brutal and one of the best ladder matches I've ever seen, but Joey Mercury's face was a total mess. Johnny Nitro did not even check his partner, they just kept going as if nothing had happened, and Taylor and Regal did nothing during the game except hit people with some ladder shots. In the end, London and Kendrick retained the title. <br /> <br /> Elsewhere on the show, Kane defeated MVP in a decent inferno match as he set fire to MVP's stupid costume. Chris Benoit defeated Chavo Guerrero in a decent match, Gregory Helms defeated Jimmy Wang Yang to keep the WWE cruiserweight title in solid stride. <br /> <br /> But the main event was a total mess, to which King Booker collaborated with Finlay. Take on John Cena and Batista. The action was bad and no one cared whom Batista chose for his partner. <br /> <br /> Overall Results: Kane Defeated MVP in an Inferno Match. Paul London and Brian Kendrick retained the WWE Tag Team titles against The Hardy Boyz, MNM, David Taylor and William Regal in a ladder match. Chris Benoit defeated Chavo Guerrero to retain the US title in a decent match. <br /> <br / Gregory Helms def. Jimmy Wang Yang to retain the Cruiserweight Championship. The Boogeyman struck the Miz in a terrible game. The Undertaker defeated Mr. Kennedy in a recent Ride match. <br /> <br /> John Cena and Batista defeated King Booker and Finlay in a miserable fight. <br /> <br /> Overall rating - B
