The movie has caught my interest, mainly because Dianne Keaton is my favorite actress. I disagree with some other posts because the conspiracy was not devoured. I had no problems following (maybe some people had too much eggnog the night before). The movie was very sad and touching. What more do you want? Alexa Davalos is a wonderful new talent (also pretty) and Tom Everett Scott does a great job with his role as well. Although the relationship between mother and daughter was somewhat unrealistic, the behavior of the young people in the film was not. It was tragically sad, but instructive. It certainly beat the other shows that took place on the evening of TV New Years Day
