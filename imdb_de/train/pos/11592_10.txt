My son was 7 years old when he saw this movie. He is now on a Russian fishing vessel and said that the movie he was most impressed with and remembered in all those 39 years, the movie The Legend of the Boy and the Eagle He asked if it was me it would be possible to get this for him. I am sure that many things go through his mind as he only has 3 hours of daylight and he has been on this ship for 3 months and will have three months left before his contract expires. Since we have Indian blood, he connects to this movie. On January 27, he turns 47 and I want to get this movie for him. He lives in Thailand and has been a commercial fisherman for 17 years. As we all know, this is one of the most dangerous jobs. Can you help me to get this movie? Thanks in advance, Dolly Crout-Soto, Deerfield Beach, FL
