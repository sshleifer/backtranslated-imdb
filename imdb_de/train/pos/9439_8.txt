Before I saw this movie, I had heard a lot about it and certain scenes in the movie, but I did not do the listening for myself, so I planned to watch it and wow! Ned Beatty, Ronny Cox, Jon Voight and Burt Reynolds are creating an interesting group of people who want to go canoeing the Cahulawassee River and the unfortunate series of events transmitted to them all. Character development takes some time to surround the viewer with a better understanding of each person, but eventually you know these guys are as if they were your friends. The theatrical dialogue is very real, as close to reality as you can get it for Hollywood acting. Reynold's character "Lewis" was interesting as a guy who comes out very hard, but under the male veneer lies a very soft and broken man (I was impressed with his performance!) Jon Voight seems to be the character most in the limelight stands. the unfortunate circumstances that seem to find him on every corner mark him in the end in another man (his character transition was excellent). Ned Beatty and Ronny Cox really look like stupid boobies who are just kidding and do not seem to get too serious unless they did, and they did. very impressive. You can not go all your life without this movie. I give eight out of ten stars, very impressed.
