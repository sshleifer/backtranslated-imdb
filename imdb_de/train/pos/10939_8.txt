The Five Deadly Venoms is a great kung fu action movie packed into a puzzle at any cost. There are all the usual signs of a kung fu movie: great choreography, horrible dubbing, various "fighting styles" and a wide range of over-the-top, often cheesy human emotions. The plot is definitely better than the average. It's interesting and keeps your attention during the non-fight scenes. Occasionally, it can even cheer on the audience, for example, when the X character receives terrible injustice. <br /> <br /> Another thing I like about the Five Deadly Venoms is the beautiful simplicity of the movie's morals and motives. Almost everyone gets what comes to them. The cowardly, greedy and corrupt lose. The evil ones consumed by selfish greed are ultimately destroyed by their own betrayal and setback. The good guys use teamwork, planning and integrity to overcome opportunities and be at the top. <br /> <br /> Gift Clan rocks!
