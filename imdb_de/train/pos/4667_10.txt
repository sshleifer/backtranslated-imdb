I recently found this movie on VHS after searching for it for several years. I was not disappointed. It gets better every time I see it. Peter Ustinov plays the original script (nominated for an Oscar) and plays along. Other stars you have heard of are Karl Malden, Bob Newhart and Cesar Romero. Ustinov is playing an accountant / embezzler who has just been released from the infamous Wormwood Scrubs jail (he had embezzled the Conservative Party Headquarters because he is a Liberal). He immediately starts looking for a new employer from whom he can hide, and discovers that computers are the wave of the future. He's a social engineer in a London men's club and gets to know the identity of the city's best computer experts. He steals the identity of a Caesar Smith, who has just left the city for South America to pursue his hobby of gathering moths in the wild. He speaks in Ta-Can-Co, an American conglomerate headed by Carlton Klemper (Karl Malden) before. Klemper hires Smith and leads him through the data center, especially his security feature consists of a flashing blue light. Ustinov asks the computer how he can defeat his safety, and the computer tells him firmly: "Blue light disconnect". Using hacking techniques from 30 years in the future, Ustinov breaks into the system and programs the computer to generate checks for various counterfeit companies. The system begins to clear up when Klemper's assistant, Willard G. Gnatpole (Bob Newhart), finds out that Ta-Can-Co is doing business with Ustinov's scams. With the help of his secretary Patty Terwilliger (Maggie Smith), Ustinov succeeds in avoiding prosecution and has been living happily ever after. To tell you how this very funny, romantic, intelligent and contemporary image would spoil.
