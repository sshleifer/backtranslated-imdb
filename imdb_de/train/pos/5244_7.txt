"The Ladies Man" has a common problem with movies based on "Saturday Night Live" kits. That is, a sketch that normally succeeds in five minutes will not work so well in ninety minutes. Although this movie has its laughs, like Tim Meadows as Leon Phelps, a 1970's sex maniac, and Will Ferrell as a wrestling-obsessed husband traded by Leon Hahnrei. So this movie is funny enough, but it's not a "world of Wayne"!
