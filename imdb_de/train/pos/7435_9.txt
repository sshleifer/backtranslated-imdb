I saw this video for the first time 15 years ago. I thought it was great then and still do it. I am a former English teacher (high school and college) and a lover of English romantic poetry. Coleridge appreciates me very much. Anything that could distract from the beauty of the poem or the power of history would not make me decide for excellence. In this case, everything works well to engage the viewer, especially students. The story is well illustrated for a generation that grew up on television. In addition, the voice of Michael Redgrave adds authenticity and authority. Okay, so there was not a big budget for the project. So it was not Star Wars and there is no CGI in it. But who can dismiss the illustrations by Gustave Dor√© as part of the presentation? The above comment, which presents the video as waste in just four lines, is grossly unfair and unobtrusive. I'm a friend of the producer, but that's not my reason for commenting. Rather, I defend an artistic work that, in my opinion, is of value at all levels. It is well suited to bring Coleridge's poem to the students in a way that awakens their appreciation and awakens their sympathy for the lesson taught by the old navigator.
