I was very impressed by this small, independently made picture. The story of a pair of social outsiders who meet, become friends and provide each other with a support system that seemed to be missing as children is sometimes funny, sometimes sad, but always provocative. Music, mostly from underground bands, has been used with great success, as well as experimenting with camera angles, filters and slow-motion techniques. The performances (the leads are played by the writers and directors of the film) are some of the best I have seen in recent years. If you have ever felt like a square pen being forced into a round slot, I truly believe that you appreciate "By Hook or By Crook".
