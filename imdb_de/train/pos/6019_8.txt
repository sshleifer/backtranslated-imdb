ZP is closely linked to this youth dream represented by the hippie movement. In the debate of the universities at the beginning of the film, the cultural situation is out of which this movement emerges. The explosion presented by Daria represents the fall of all social structures, and thus the development of all that tremendous transformation that society undergoes, and finally Mark's death marks the end that A sees for the movement itself. The movie will be easier to understand as we return to this time of life. In the 60s and 70s, young people were the driving force behind the profound exploration of change. One of the most important changes was getting the sexuality out of the closet, and I think the scenes in the desert are not an orgy, but the sexual relationship that men and women would have in complete freedom in the hipotetic situation in which they live would be hiding from anyone. I watched the scene where the couples threw sand at each other, and appreciated the great way in which A represented the impossibility of further concealing this basic human instinct. The oppression was then the way to "control" social outbreaks, and that's the method used by the police to stop the students. This society suffers from hipocresia, and this becomes clear when students are given access to weapons that skip all false controls. The dialogue between the police officer and the undocumented college professor shows that part of society is interested in this youth and some are completely uninterested. Representing flying as the more precise symbol of freedom, stealing the aircraft represents Mark's inner desire, but his (going back or returning or returning (Segun)) shows the difficulty of getting rid of these ties, and as I said I did A shows the death of the dream through these difficulties that win the game. In my view a movie to remember.
