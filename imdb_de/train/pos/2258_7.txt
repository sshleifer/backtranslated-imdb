I think Sarafina is an enormous effort by Whoopi Goldberg. Besides her, there are no other stars in the film and her role is smaller than the title character Sarafina. Working at a high school with city kids, I think this is an important movie to show South African apartheid history. Sarafina is a film about education and the relationship of a teacher to her student Sarafina. I bought the video practically nothing in a video store. I took a look at it and quickly went through the musical numbers. But I strongly recommend this movie to understand educators and their students. Although I do not know the other actors and actresses in the film, I assume that they are very popular in South Africa, and I'm glad they shot in a small role with a South African cast and crew with the exception of Goldberg People see this movie, Whoopi reaches worldwide attraction.
