I saw this movie while traveling in Brazil. It was hard for me to really understand Brazilian culture and society because there are so many regional and class differences. Seeing this film in Sao Paulo itself was a revelation. It shows something of the everyday life of many Brazilians. On the other hand, it is sometimes overdramatized. And that's the only negative comment I have about this movie. Sometimes it's too much, too much sex, too many murders and too much cynicism for a movie. The director could film some things a bit more subtle, this would make the movie more effective. <br /> <br /> I liked the movie and the way the story developed. The characters are complex and very similar to the people of real life. Not pretty American actors and actresses with a lot of cosmetics, but people who could be both ugly and beautiful at the same time. That makes the movie realistic, even if the story is not so convincing.
