This is a reunion, a team and a great episode of Justice. From hesitation to disintegration, Clark has made an important leap from a troubled teenager who was afraid of a controlled fate to a Superman who, like Green Arrow, gives up his few relatives and is ready to save the entire planet. This is not just an exciting story about teamwork, loyalty and friendship. It's also about deciding what's more important in life, a lesson for Clark. I do not want the show to end, but I hope the following episodes will strictly adhere to what Justice does without "rewinding" and put a good end to Smallville - and a wonderful start to Superman. <br /> <br /> In this episode, however, we would have needed to see more contrast between Lex and the team. Nine stars should earn enough.
