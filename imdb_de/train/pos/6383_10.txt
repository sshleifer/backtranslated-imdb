I found this movie very enjoyable. I saw this movie with my wife BEFORE having my first child. That's why I did not just look at it as a family entertainment and I liked it very much anyway. It seems many of the reviews point out that this movie was not rocked on earth, there were no unexpected changes in the plot, and that the movie was predictable and boring. If these people saw this movie and expected it to be religious, they would obviously be disappointed. This is just an animated movie; nothing more. If you just want to watch this movie to sit back and be entertained, you will not be disappointed. In the end, this is definitely not the best movie Disney has done, but it's entertaining and I do not understand the bad reputation it has received.
