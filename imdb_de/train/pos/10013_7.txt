As one of the previous commentators said, this was the basis for a great movie, but on the way to extradition something happened. Such a waste, because Collette's performance was scary and Williams was believable. I was just waiting for it to get better. I do not think it was cut bad or needed another director, it could just have been the movie. It seemed like a Canadian movie, something like the first seasons of X-Files. Not cheap, just hokey. It also needed a bit more tension. Something that makes you jump off the seat. The movie reached that moment and faded; somehow like a false climax. I can see how exciting it would be to take away the "reality" of the story, but I thought that part was reached when Gabriel was in the hospital looking for the boy. This movie must have a Director's Cut that tries to fix these issues.
