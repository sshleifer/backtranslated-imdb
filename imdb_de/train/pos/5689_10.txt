This is initially an overview of the two sets of discs that came with the rental of the DVD "Wonderland". <br /> <br /> The two included films, "Wonderland" and the Johnny Wadd documentary, make the film completely myth created by "Boogie Nights". This myth states that the characters involved in the adult film trade were much more than slimy lowlifes who would do anything for money and basically deny that they were anything but disgusting, self-centered whores. This is amazingly similar to what the book "Wiseguy" and the movie "Goodfellas" did with the fable "The Godfather" and the rest of the gangster romance story. Well, what bothered me the most When you look at these films and probably annoy someone who has seen and liked "Boogie Nights", that's how stupid and gullible supposedly educated and sophisticated people can be. "Dirk Diggler" in "Boogie Nights" is undoubtedly John Holmes, who unlike "Dirk Diggler" did not have any redeeming quality. Holmes was a criminal sociopath who abused all who were near him, was completely consumed by his quest for self-gratification and undoubtedly a key participant in the brutal murders on Wonderland Avenue in Los Angeles in 1981 was lies that "boogie Nights "was and reinforces the Linda Lovelace description of the cruel and pathetic business known as the adult entertainment industry. This should be displayed to anyone who has a positive opinion of the story in the movie "Boogie Nights" for both of them on the DVD "Wonderland".
