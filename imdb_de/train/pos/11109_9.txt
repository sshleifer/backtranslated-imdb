The Sopranos is characterized by an airtight, dynamic exploration of American life and how the American experience is shaped and defined by money. David Chase places the story in the environment of the underworld and removes all obstacles to a grunt, deep in the ground, and is almost a deconstruction of the postmodern era. <br /> <br /> Each character represents one facet of American industry. Tony Soprano is an example of the besieged working group, torn between family duty and the need to keep its "business" on a straight line. The convergence of these two things is the imperative that drives history. The characters of Christopher, Paulie and Bobby reflect loyalty - but in every company that serves itself, trusting more out of necessity than merit. With the character of Ralph, Joe Pantoliano Essays a brilliant interpretation of the charismatic psychopath, a twisted businessman marked by violence, is tragically outweighed by his overwhelming earning power. And Dominic Chianese is the ultimate symbol of the outmoded Oldgarde, which has earned its place as the ultimate television drama through established relationships and the need for junior staff to deflect the blame to power. <br /> <br /> PS A good counterpart to Chase's series would be The Shield, another violent drama that makes the ugliest characters interesting.
