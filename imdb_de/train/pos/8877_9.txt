This story was probably one of the most powerful I've ever recorded. John Singleton has put together this educational masterpiece. Brilliant appearances throughout the cast, but Epps and Rapaport achieved the best and most compelling career of any of the two young stars. <br /> <br /> As a college student, however, many of the issues Singleton addressed were taken up to the extreme. In a sense, while they are at many campuses campus, but they are not as big or outdoors, as this movie would make believe. In some cases, it seemed almost ridiculous to think that something of that nature might actually happen. Apart from the fact that the film was a bit too dramatic, the film was brilliant and baffled me, could not talk, just think. One of the things in this picture that I will remember forever was a quote from Lawrence Fishburn's figure: "Knowledge is power, without knowledge you can not see your power." Brilliant, just awesome.
