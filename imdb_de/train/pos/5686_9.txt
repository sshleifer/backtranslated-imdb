* Wonderland SPOILERS * <br /> July 1, 1981: five people: Ron Launius, Susan Launius, Billy Deverell, Barbara Richardson and Natasha Gregson Wagner Joy Miller (Janeane Garofalo) is assaulted in her sleep and brutally beaten with steel pipes in her apartment at 8763 Wonderland Avenue, Laurel Canyon, LA. Only Susan survives. <br /> <br /> Prime suspect: John Holmes (Val Kilmer), former porn king, owner of a 30 cm long tail and now a hopeless addict. Two Investigators Luis (Frankie G.) and Sam Nico (Ted Levine) investigate the case and try to break it with the help of a witness who claims to know that John has at least participated in the killings, David Lind (Dylan McDermott ), Barbara's friend, and trying to get a testimony from Dawn Schiller, Holmes '19-year-old girlfriend, and from Susan reminding herself of nothing more than a shadow over her night. The man's head was hammered, and their fate almost met the same fate, and the name of Eddie Nash (Eric Bogosian), a major drug king (who is always with women like Barbie (Paris Hilton)), comes as a suspicious planner to the appearance of the wonderland massacre. <br /> <br /> But what happened that night? Could Sharon (Lisa Kudrow), John's wife, know about it? 'Wonderland' is a taught, intense thriller, a desperate love story and the story of a sad decay of a man in one. There is a clever use of the 'Rashomon' technique (we are watching the events of that fateful day and night from the eyes of David, John, Dawn, Susan (albeit very briefly) and Sharon), a beautiful direction and a great script , But most of all, Kilmer's starring in his desperate, tortured, sometimes childish Holmes 'Lucas', whose Launius is strangely enticing, Kudrov's strong Sharon and Boswell's innocent Dawn Wunderland: 9/10.
