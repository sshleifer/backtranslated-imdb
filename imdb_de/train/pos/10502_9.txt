One of the funniest Mario I've ever played. The levels are creative, there are fluent controls and good graphics for his time. There are also a variety of crazy bosses and enemies to fight. Sometimes the levels are frustrating and if you miss out on some of the hard levels and still have to do more to fight a boss, it can be annoying. Another criticism is the camera angle; although it usually works pretty well, it can be painful in certain situations. If you are a big fan of Mario; this is for you. Even if you are not a big fan of him, I would recommend this anyway. It's a big game and getting what you need may take a while, but it's very satisfying. good for playing at short intervals. it will almost certainly hold your interest; it keeps mine safe!
