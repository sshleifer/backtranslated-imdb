For such films as "Anchors Aweigh", few have been awarded as many Academy Awards for warm up for Happy Hour. Either 1945 was a besieged year for good film or they still had a shock from Billy Wilder's "The Lost Weekend" that everything was written that stood on the ballot with A in order to create the best image, to the still musical fidelity to please. Since Gene Kelly was nominated for his performance and not his role in "Singin 'in the Rain", something had to go wrong with the behind-the-scenes rigging systems at MGM. Of course, the studio is at its best on this much-praised tour of the big studios and Hollywood itself, which is convenient for those stuck on the other side of the world. <br /> <br /> Another Sailor Suit with Genius and Frank Sinatra's ingenious talents are certainly a fun farce, though more people have to yell the previews for the musical, so today's audiences would not be beaten with unnecessary time. Before and since, there have been many longer songs, but in this case, all the lovely scenes of Kathryn Grayson could have been eliminated. Until viewing Kiss Me Kate, it might have been necessary for non-opera enthusiasts to watch one of their films with the remote control in their hands. <br /> <br /> If it was necessary to pick up women for "On the Town" from 1949, the lucky sailors of the shore holidays might not have to promise a casting with Jose Iturbi and strike the piano for a grand piano "Susie "Transfer. Few are lucky enough to get a screen test in MGM's golden studios. Then there are only a few who are even happier. There is no regret over the successful screening tests of Susan Abbot or Kathryn Grayson, but the unrestrained non-opera enthusiast hopes that the pink panties will be shared with both. <br /> <br /> But for all, the Star talents are in good shape and above-average score with a light but entertaining, great naval history, interwoven with young, ambitious navy boys good for later outbreaks of war morality 'makes' Anchors' question does not question the choice of the wrong MGM movie at least. The direction holds as the cast carries the story in a beautiful color cinematic. Whenever someone invades music or singing, the movie is a joyous event. <br /> <br /> The film's natural highlight is Gene Kelly's comic adventures in Fantasyland, culminating in a brilliant dance with Jerry the Mouse. This is a well-deserved masterpiece of Kelly's career, and it's nice to know that he thought about it before Fred Astaire started dancing on walls and ceilings. <br /> <br /> It's not exactly a triple flavor, rainbow sprinkled, chocolate waffle, cream, cherry and banana chips, but it's a square, solid sugar lump that will eventually melt in your mouth and still blame despite the guilt pleasant feeling is. <br /> <br /> Rating: 7/10
