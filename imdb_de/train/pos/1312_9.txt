Chalk this in the winning column, that was a great movie. The acting performances were great and the script was great as well. Helen Hunt was great as the Riverside policewoman Gina Pulasky. Gina was a complex character. She was a rookie police officer with the Riverside Police Dept. She ended up having an affair with a colleague she knew had wives and children. All this time, she took on the dangerous task of arresting a serial killer. <br /> <br /> Jeff Fahey (the Ray Liotta look is similar) did a damned good job as the confused, often-stammering policeman who had an affair with Gina. He was stoic as an officer, but it was the opposite when it came to dealing with his feelings and his extramarital affair. Steven Weber, especially from the sitcom "Wings", did a nice job as the calm, gentle, below-average sociopath. On the surface, he was an innocent loser, but beneath the surface was a cold-hearted killer. Weber has really taken on the personality of a childish young adult who has an insatiable thirst for killing young boys. <br /> <br /> The whole movie was spectacular. Every scene, every verbal exchange lets us know more and more about the characters. The production team has done phenomenal work by combining days, if not weeks, into events into a 90-minute film. This movie was a good example of having little to do with a little.
