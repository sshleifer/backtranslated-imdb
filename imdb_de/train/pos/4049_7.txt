Erich Rohmer's "L'Anglaise et le duc" is a perfect companion to Peter Watkins "La Commune (Paris 1871)". Both films, shown at this year's Toronto International Film Festival, ironically illustrate storytellers narrating history. Given the tragic events that took place during the festival in the US. In Paris, during the French Revolution, the film, based on Grace Elliott's ("Lucy Russell's) Memoirs", is a first-hand film that survived these intoxicating but dangerous days. She also describes her relationship with The Duke of Orleans (played by Jean-Claude Dreyfus) who, unlike herself, stands up for the revolution. <br /> <br /> Definitely, you do not know whose side of the story Rohmer is coming to. As one of the first French New Wave filmmakers, Rohmer was often criticized for being too conservative. After all, he filmed in the midst of the rebel youth Viet Nam days of the late 60s and 70s romantic little confections such as "Claire's knee". But do not sell the old boy, people, he has always been a disciple of human nature, not an ideologue, and L'Anglaise et le duc confirms this. Rohmer's characters are never the "bad guys" or "good guys", they are first and foremost people who are able to show a wide range of human possibilities and limitations. That's why his films are always provocative, and this film is no exception. <br /> <br /> Now to the technological innovations. <br /> <br/> Although Rohmer came to his eighties, he is still up to date on film innovation. The look of "L'Anglaise" is something you have never seen before. You guessed it. The old man - like several other festival directors this year - has become digital. <br /> <br /> All the outer scenes of the film look as if they were taking place in their original Paris setting from the 1780s - in fact, you might be so distracted by how much you must wonder about the authenticity of the film look to return for a second performance to capture the intricacies of the psychological - and yes, I say - political insights of the film. Toronto is home to some of the world's most exciting young filmmakers. as well as some of the oldest in the world. And the old masters are standing next to the boys on the cinema pages. <br /> <br /> Long live the youth. Long live the age. And live Erich Rohmer. <br /> <br />
