And a pretty unexpected conspiracy too - for the era: There is plague in the city of New Orleans - and only Richard Widmark can stop it! Elia Kazan's trademark: Waterfronts, workers, crowds, refugees, workers, violence in a side street - everyone is shown here. <br /> <br /> Jack Palance is very effective as the ice cold gangster is a real eye-catcher Big Score, Zero Mostel as Dom Delouise to see something wrong, but certainly as his pursuer. I enjoyed Barbara Bel Geddes as the brave, cool woman. I thought she and Widmark were a credible couple. <br/> <br/> He himself always reminds me of Sinatra - in the face and in the intense, quiet way - and that's meant as a compliment. I had never heard of this movie, and yes, you have to admire the performance of Widmark. I also enjoyed Paul Douglas - he seemed to play that role many times, forming an unlikely but effective team. <br /> <br /> The plague itself is a McGuffin - and you have to know it's not exactly like this I was in Real Life - rather small-scale, at least not? - but I found the plot nice. <br /> <br /> Take a look. It's good. *** outta ****
