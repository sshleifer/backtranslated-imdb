The Thief of Baghdad is one of my ten favorite films of all time. It is exciting without Gore, it is beautifully filmed and the art direction is impeccable. The casting could not have been better. Rex Ingram made me believe in geniuses. The epitome of evil is certainly captured by Conrad Veight as Jafar. He set the bar very high. <br /> <br /> ..I watch this movie at least twice a year ... and never get tired. This movie is an adventure for all ages ... no one is too old to enjoy it. The thief of Bahgdad brings my memories to an innocent time ... I was ten years old when I saw it for the first time, and the US was close to World War II. Conrad Vieght was such a great actor that he was able to continue this underlying "evil" a few years later in "Casablanca". And I think Korda has teamed up with Justin and Dupree in "The Four Feathers" ... great movie production!
