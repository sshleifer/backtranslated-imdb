One of my favorite shows in the 70s. As far as I remember, on Friday (or possibly Saturday) it went on the Nine Network overnight (?) Here in Australia. Darren McGavin and Simon Oakland were great. <br /> <br /> Each episode usually reached a climax. Kolchack had to go hand in hand to fight a supernatural opponent. The authors worked together to get as far away from the usual vampire and ghost nations as possible. I recall an episode in which the adversary was the ghost of an ancient Indian chief who "came back" as a massive electric current that started killing people in an urban hospital. At the last showdown, Kolchack tried to short the "power beast" in the midst of an explosion of sparks and streaming flames. Well ... they had to be there at the time, but it was an interesting idea. McGavin has always put a lot of energy and enthusiasm into his roles, and this has been one of his best achievements. Definitely worth a place in the "Hall of Fame" earned by TV. To quote Tony Vincenzo ... "Kolchack, you're up," or in the case of the Hall of Fame "IN!"
