I first watched the Walking Tall movies when I was about eight years old, and I thought Joe Don Baker and Bo Svenson did a great job, they still have to, because I've watched the movies I've tried to learn as much about the real sheriff as Buford Pusser can. All three parts of the movie gave me shivers and Buford Pusser was a true hero. I only wish he was alive today and that more people would be like him. I would like to thank him for getting rid of all the crime and being so brave. I am very sorry that his family had to go through such horror and pain. My heart goes out. So, from a 30-year-old sheriff Pusser fan and from the 3-part Walking Tall movies and the actors who portrayed him, please do not be negative about these movies and actors, they just wanted to let us know what a wonderful man that was a true Buford Pusser and what a great family he had. And to all the young people who may not have heard much about Buford, I suggest you watch the Walking Tall movies and learn more about him.
