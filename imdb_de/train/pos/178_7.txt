"Protocol" is a hit-and-miss picture starring Goldie Hawn as a bubbly cocktail waitress who saves one night the life of an Arab visit from an assassination attempt. The woman immediately becomes a celebrity and receives a new job for the US government. Will the power corridors in the capital of our nation ever be the same? Hawn is excellent as always, although "Protocol" is not as funny as her best movie "Private Benjamin". But it's still a good movie and I laughed a lot. <br /> <br /> *** (out of four)
