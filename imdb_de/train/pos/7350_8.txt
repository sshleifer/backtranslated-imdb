Well, I was a teenager when I saw the movie. The songs were a big hit, but the elite class dropped the Govinda movies as Govinda and Karishma (aka Karizma) movies were seen. Many people liked it when the series of these films rocked the '90s and most of them they were successful. Today I looked at them again after a long time and I remembered that there was a long line of people and the uproar they had created as the aa u uo oo song appeared on the screen ... the govinda dresses and karishma were complementary (the worst dressing duo of that time) and karisma in the late 90s turned, but govinda was still very faithful For his designer, his dress sense remains the same ... but then everything mingled, everything was fine. Everything worked and slowly the elite class realized what fun they had, and then ... there was no looking back. For this Jodi it continued as he had these Indians mass-produced ..hated by some, but by loved the masses. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a good time without renting or watching TV, I do not think you'll regret it ... but remember it's the worst at its best , <br /> <br /> I still watch these movies when I have time, and I can not stop laughing ... so I say, go ahead and have a good time, as there are times which we all love stupidity and especially if it is done by the kings of their time, it is certainly to see ... I recommend it to all movie lovers ...
