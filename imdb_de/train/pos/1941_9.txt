I actually thought this was a comedy, and watched and expected to laugh my ass. It soon became clear that this was not a comedy, or at least not a guy from Jim Carrey. What we've always been watching is the characters - the movie starts with rather gloomy, unruly people gathered to try to fight one of their basic fears - fear of water, fear of swimming. We begin to dive into her life, piece by piece, watching her problems, guessing her thoughts. <br /> <br /> I actually made it seem darker than it actually is, and next to the chain of events, it will soon bring some light and hope for its life. <br /> <br /> I probably would not have seen the movie if I had known it was not a comedy but a drama, but I had a good time, the story was fun and I do not mind about 90 Minutes spent with it. <br /> <br /> Many films deal with the alienation between people in the Western world. This film shows how people can come together and help each other. <br /> <br /> "And when you face the dying day you meet her, do not let her pass by and go, do not lose her, she is your gift from the sun ..." <br /> <br /> 9 / 10 <br /> Peace and love
