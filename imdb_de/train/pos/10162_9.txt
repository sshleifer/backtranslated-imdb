Ah, I loved this movie. I think it had everything. I had to laugh out loud over a dozen times. Yes, I am a girl, so I write this from the perspective of a girl. I think it's a shame that it only scored 5.2 points in the rating. Too many people choose? It was far beyond other romantic comedies. Just because I'm a woman, I do not like any chic, on the contrary, I prefer other genres. Romantic comedies are rather flat and not as funny as they should be. But as I said, this movie had almost everything in my opinion. Great script, good one-liners, good acting. Although Eva Longoria Parker's character was very reminiscent of Gabrielle von Desperate Housewives, but so what? It was fantastic. I will keep this movie for rainy days, days when I feel weak and need a few laughs.
