It's not brilliant, groundbreaking or innovative, but for some reason "Dog Days" is an extremely intriguing character study. It's as if CRASH is stumbling with a bad dose of heroin, but not really. It is an Austrian film that traces the lives of several depressed, disturbed and annoying people and their abusive relationships. It's disturbing but very well played and it's interesting to watch the crazy little things these characters do. Certainly not for the faint of heart, this highly pessimistic film offers in the end no conclusion or revelation. We only see the lives of these dirty individuals over two days. Note B
