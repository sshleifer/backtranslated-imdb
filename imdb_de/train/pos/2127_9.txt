To call this a romantic comedy is correct, but misleading nowadays. Unfortunately, the genre has worsened into stereotypes, too focused on bringing the main couple together, and there is little room for ambience and other stories that makes it formulaic and all too predictable. <br /> <br /> The Shop Around the Corner does not suffer from these diseases: it creates a recognizable Central / Eastern European atmosphere and has a strong cast in addition to the (even strong) nominal tracks; I avoid using the words "supporting occupation" because, for example, Mr. Matuschek (Frank Morgan) plays a central role in the film, and his story is equally if not more important than the romance. The movie from 1998 You've Got Mail borrowed the idea of ​​an anonymous pen pal from this movie and was therefore billed as a remake. This is not right and in fact unfair to the new movie - he shares the genre and borrows a plot element, but that's all.
