Full House is a wonderful sitcom about a dad, Danny Tanner, whose wife has just died in a car crash. So Danny asks his brother-in-law Jesse Katsopolis and his best friend Joey Gladstone to raise his three girls Donna Jo 'DJ' Tanner, Stephanie Tanner and Michelle Tanner. This is my favorite show that I can see all day. And something on Full House always makes me laugh and there are also sad parts. There is never a boring moment in Full House. The main characters play Bob Saget, John Stamos, Dave Coulier, Candace Cameron, Jodie Sweetin and Mary-Kate & Ashley Olsen.
