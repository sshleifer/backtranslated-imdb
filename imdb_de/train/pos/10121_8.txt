Although not so wild and far from Takashi Miike's later films, this is a very good crime drama. <br /> <br /> The basic story is the story of a policeman from a Japanese police officer attempting to break down an aspiring Chinese gangster. More complicated is that his younger brother acts as a lawyer for the villain and his gang. The film is actually much more complicated than the one with several complications that keep things interesting and distract things from the central narrative impulse. It is this complication and the disappearance of the path after about an hour that makes the movie less than a great movie. (It's a very good movie) This is definitely worth a visit, especially if you do not mind /> <br /> A word of warning, the violence, when it happens, is explosive and unpleasant. There are also semi-graphic depictions of gay sex. If this is not your cup of tea, continue with caution. <br /> <br /> 7 or 8 out of 10 points.
