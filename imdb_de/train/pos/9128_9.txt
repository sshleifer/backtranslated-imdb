I have to admit that Purple Rain is one of my deepest feelings of guilt. Purple Rain not only broke boundaries, it set a decade, the costumes, the music, the behavior and the dancing! To this day, my friends and I are still jamming with the Purple Rain soundtrack, pretending to be Prince and the Revolution. The movie itself is largely made up of music. The acting? Please do not let me judge that, because this is one of my favorite guilt-loving pleasures, because I know it was by no means Oscar-worthy. But I think the duo that recorded this movie were Morris and Jarome. Her speech about passwords was just incredibly funny. I just want to rate this movie on the concert sequences because I felt like he made the movie. Prince is a musical genius and has created beautiful music. While the movie and acting are pretty bad, this movie is still a fun movie and even dance at night. This movie has defined the 80s, so have fun with it. Prince would want it, just to party! Oh, boy, that sounded lame. <br /> <br /> 9/10
