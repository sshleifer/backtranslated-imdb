Genre: Dinosaurs, Animation, New York, Time Travel, Circus. Main characters: Rex the Tyrannosaurus rex, Elsa the pterodactyly, Dweeb the Parasarolophus, Ooo the Triceratops, a boy named Louis, a girl called Cecilia and Captain New-Eyes. ? Actors: John Goodman (Rex), Yeardley Smith (Cecilia), Martin Short (Stubbs the Clown), Felicity Kendal (Elsa), etc.? What happens: Four dinosaurs (see above) are fed "cereal grains" and are now cuddly, friendly dinosaurs who will be nice to children. They go to New York, with big plans. <br /> <br /> My thoughts: This is a cute animated movie. The animation of the dinosaurs, if they are cuddly and friendly, is a bit slack and not so good, but they look pleasant in the same way. I like the dinosaurs when they are cuddly and friendly, they are nice, friendly and good. I like (almost) all the characters, especially Elsa and Cecilia, but of course I also like the others. Overall, I like this movie very much! :-) <br /> <br /> Recommended for: People who like good children animation films, people who like dinosaurs, John Goodman and people who think circuses are not always what they seem? Enjoy! :-)
