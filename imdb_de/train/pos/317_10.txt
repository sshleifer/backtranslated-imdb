Telemundo should definitely create a DVD collection of the novela Xica! I know a lot of people, including me, who want to buy the novela Xica! It's a very entertaining novela playing in Brazil. The costumes worn by the actors are beautiful and the city where the Novela takes place is beautiful. Xica contains a lot of history of this period. I wish Telemundo would retransmit it, even if it was 2 o'clock in the morning. I would highly recommend Xica if ever shown again at Telemundo. I've emailed Telemundo a million times to show the novela again, but my requests have fallen on deaf ears. The only cautious statement about Xica is that it occasionally contains harsh scenes. Therefore, I would recommend children under 14 not to see Xica. Overall, Xica earns 10 out of 10 points!
