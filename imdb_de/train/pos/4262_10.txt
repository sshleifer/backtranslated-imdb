I saw it as many times as I could before it left the scene. An adorable and entertaining movie with some of my favorite stars. I just wish I could find it again! I would certainly buy / watch it if I could. Please, someone, bring it back. Fred MacMurray was perfect in his role as Patriot during the Second World War, and his chief wives Joan Leslie and especially June Haver were beautiful and charming. It was musical, but also romantic, funny and smart. This was my favorite movie with June Haver, although I always liked her. Her dazzling smile lit up the screen, and her beauty and talent enriched every movie. The supporting members gave credit to their individual roles. A balanced and carefree film; just wish we had more!
