This movie did not really surprise me, so it got better and better. I thought, "Paul Rieser wrote that, right? Well ... we'll see how he does it ..." Then I saw that Peter Falk was there. I appreciate Colombo. Although I was never a big fan of the show, I always liked Peter Falk. <br /> <br /> The performances of Peter and Paul were so natural that I felt like a fly on the wall. They were so good that I was almost dizzy with joy! ... and I had not even drunk! <br /> <br /> This movie was so well done that I wanted to get in touch with Paul directly and tell him how much I liked it! but I could not find his number. Does not have to be listed or something. <br /> <br /> This was one of the movies that I had no idea what it was about or who was in it or something. It just came and I thought, "Why not? Let it see, if I do not like it - I do not have to see it ..." ... and I ended up loving it!
