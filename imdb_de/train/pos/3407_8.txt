Marlene Dietrich and Charles Boyer give solid performances in this beautiful, but empty movie. The irony is that Dietrich plays a woman with a beautiful but empty life. Really great cinematography and sets, and yes, Dietrich's bottomless suitcase is also fabulous. She looks great; Boyer looks young and neat. <br /> <br /> The story of a woman looking for meaning and an ex-priest looking for life seems rather stale, but in the face of such unreal scenery and sky, it somehow seems, given the two stars, the Terrible score by Max Steiner and a good minor cast. The movie runs 76 minutes and seems to be badly edited, and certain characters appear or disappear. Joseph Schildkraut is funny as an Arab leader, C. Aubrey Smith is the old priest, Lucile Watson the mother superior, Tilly Losch, the dancer, John Carradine, the fortune-teller, and Basil Rathbone plays ... well, I'm not sure. He just rides in from the desert and spoils everything! As already mentioned, John Gilbert should play with Dietrich. I can not help but believe that he was wonderful. The role of world-weary Boris would have pleased the great Gilbert quite well. And after the success of Queen Christina (with Garbo), his career may have come back on track. <br /> <br /> I can not imagine another 30s movie that Dietrich did in color. She looks great and wears great clothes. My favorite is Valentino as The Shiek-style outfit she wears around the pool. <br /> <br /> Definitely worth a look at the lush sets and colors and the two big stars.
