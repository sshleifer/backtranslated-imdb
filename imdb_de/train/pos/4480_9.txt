In the Citadel movie The Films of Gene Kelly, Anchor's Aweigh is described as the kingpin of a musical. I really can not do it better. It's such an important movie in the careers of Gene Kelly and Frank Sinatra. Kathryn Grayson was not bad at it either. <br /> <br /> Louis B. Mayer had loaned Gene Kelly to Columbia, where Harry Cohn had the inspiration to let Kelly choreograph his own numbers, and that's why Cover Girl became a classic. So if Mayer did not learn a lesson, producer Joe Pasternak made Kelly's artistic control. When Anchors Aweigh was done, Fred Astaire finally had a dancing rival for the monarch of the Kinotanzes. <br /> <br /> The most important number that everyone here talks to Gene Kelly is the dance with Jerry Mouse. Originally, Kelly wanted to make the number with Walt Disney's Mickey Mouse, but Disney did not offer Mickey a rental. Mickey had to wait until Roger Rabbit did an outdoor movie. Do not worry, because MGM had its own animated rodents, half of the Tom and Jerry teams. Kelly as a dancer was always anxious to do something new and different on the screen, like Fred Astaire. For the next twelve years, these two artists were allowed all kinds of artistic control and were praised for their work, even though the films themselves did not make snuff. It was as if everyone inspired the other to greater and better creativity, Kelly for MGM, Astaire for MGM and a number of other studios. In Anchor's Aweigh, Kelly brought Sinatra to dance. In fact, Frank Sinatra has always given Gene Kelly credit for showing him how to make musicals, thanks to both Burt Lancaster and Montgomery Clift for helping him to give him an Oscar for From Earn Here to Eternity. <br /> <br /> When Frank Sinatra bought half of his RKO contract from MGM, he insisted on some artistic creativity. He had become friends with the songwriting team of Jule Styne and Sammy Cahn. In his autobiography, Sammy Cahn tells how Sinatra insisted that they write his songs for this film. Louis B. Mayer relented and the team wrote some really nice ballads for him to sing. One of my favorite Sinatra numbers comes from Anchors Aweigh, I'm falling in love too easily. Frank sings it in an empty Hollywood Bowl on the piano. It is Sinatra at its best. <br /> <br /> With Jule Styne and later with Jimmy Van Heusen, Sammy Cahn earned the title of having more lyrics in Frank Sinatra's mouth than any other person. They were lifelong friends and Cahn always credited Sinatra with this milestone in his career. <br /> <br /> In a bet, Styne and Cahn said they could only write a song with a chromatic scale. They proved it in Anchor's Aweigh when Kathryn Grayson used her soprano on All of a Sudden My Heart Sings. She also did some classic numbers. <br /> <br /> Here singing is actually the basis of the plot. Two lay off sailors meet under different circumstances with Kathryn Grayson and her orphaned nephew Dean Stockwell. Kelly tries to fix her with Sinatra and says he could have her audition with Jose Iturbi. They spend the movie doing just that. <br /> <br /> My only disappointment with Anchors Aweigh was that Pamela Britton, who plays waitress Brooklyn, never got a number herself. She had received rave reviews from her performance as Meg Brockie in Brigadoon on Broadway, and that brought her to Hollywood. I suspect she had a number that was cut, and it could still be somewhere in MGM's vaults. Anchor's Aweigh is a great example of why musicals are simply no longer made. All creative talent was under contract at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. If you had to pay the market value, the costs could pull back the debt of a third world country. <br /> <br /> But the movie results would be extraordinary.
