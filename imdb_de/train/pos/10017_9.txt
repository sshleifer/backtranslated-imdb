I absolutely loved this movie! I'm not referring to any other comments I've read about it. I was FULLY fascinated by every second! <br /> <br /> I found the story exciting, the acting intense and the direction accurate. I would literally jump every time the phone rang just before the end of the movie. Even though the story itself was not "scary," I was completely nervous throughout the movie - and for the rest of my evening. <br /> <br /> I found out that so many perfect decisions were made ... the casting, the script, the little jokes that were sprayed in it. There were so many points the movie could have gone for the cheap thrill, but he never did, and that's what set the movie to me about so many mediocre thrillers that have appeared lately.
