In the context of the time it was made, I found this movie worthwhile. While the details can be "dramatized", the overall story was a nice introduction. I also found that I tracked down actors I knew. Who would think of Ben Cartwright as an insidious kad? I'll leave the rest of the star to you. As far as secondary casting is concerned, this movie (as one would expect from a movie from the late 1930s) has many character actors, but they focus on Andrew Jackson's right-hand Peavey. The perfect comedy. Well shot, with beautiful ships and consistently competent action, I recommend this to anyone who likes the light camp, or an eye for a double piece that was set up at dawn in the Americas and originated in a time when it was great name and first-class character actors were a real pleasure to enjoy.
