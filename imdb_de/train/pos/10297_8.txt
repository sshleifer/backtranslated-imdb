Well, not really. This movie is very entertaining. Went and saw it yesterday evening with the girlfriend and had to use the routine "I think there is something in my eye". The movie is a great combination of comedy and typical romance. Jim Carey is an excellent will for his lucky reporter, who has the power to change himself and the city in which he lives. In fact, all the characters are great. The movie is not overly funny or sappy, good movie to go with the woman. <br /> <br /> All in All 8/10 .... note * I'm not a simple student. That's all from BigV through and through!
