This is a great story of family loyalty, which fortunately does not draw on the usual tricks (or at least the ones I'm used to in American and European films) of supersentimentality or high dramatic tension. It's very good to see and very adorable. It has some nice cinematography, but does not rely on it alone to entertain.
