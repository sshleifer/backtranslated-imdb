This movie came and went to the theater. Because of nature, you can see why it was not well received. It was wrongly postponed because of its theme more than the actual movie itself. Higher Learning is not spectacular, but it was a good movie that tried to talk about a topic dreaded in America: racism. Plot / Story: Higher Learning focuses mainly on Malik (played by Omar Epps), a naive track star who has to deal with not being fast enough, and a rigorous professor (played by Laurence Fishburne). He befriends Fudge (Ice Cube) and a beautiful lady named Deja (Tyra Banks). Later, they have to deal with some skinheads on campus. Remy (play by Michael Rapaport) is a confused boy who befriends a few local skinheads on campus. As soon as they impose their views on him, he becomes as racist as they are. Opinion: Higher learning is not without flaws: The character development is rare, good performances of Omar Epps, Tyra Banks and the leader Of the skinheads (whose name I forgot) fits Busta Rhymes not at all in this film. Women who became gay after being abused by men were a clich√© to this film. Besides, this movie was not half bad. Laurence Fishburne was good at being Professor Phipps (though I could do without an accent), Fudge was Ice Cube's best performance and Michael Rapaport was the confused Remy. All in all, it was one of John Singleton's best films. This is one of the reasons why I frown at the garbage he is now exposing. Cinema needs more movies like Higher Learning, Mississippi Burning and American History X and less movies like Baby Boy, 2 Fast 2 Furious and a very meaningless remake of Shaft.
