I only give it 9 out of 10 because I have to look at it again in a more recent mind-frame to have a new perspective. What I remember is an amazing psychological thriller that blinded my brain and eyes when I saw it. I would watch it every time it came on HBO (probably 1990 or so). I may even have recorded it, but this recording is long over, I'm sure. I hope I can find it in a local video store. <br /> <br /> I would highly recommend trying it if you find it somewhere. At least it's interesting. If you enjoyed movies like Edward Scissorhands, Beetlejuice, Gummo or anything weird, give it a try.
