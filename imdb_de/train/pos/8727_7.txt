Bugs life is a good movie. But for me it's not really comparable to movies like Toy Story and such. Do not get me wrong, I liked this movie, but it was not as good as Toy Story. The movie has the visuals, the laughs and others that Toy Story had. But the movie did not feel quite that way ... I do not know, but I thought it was still a pretty good movie. <br /> <br /> A bugs life ... I do not want to say that, is a movie I do not remember. I saw it years ago. Of course I have not seen Toy Story in years, but I still remember it. I should not have repeated this movie, but it's me. I give a thumbs up, though it's not the best work Pixar has done. <br /> <br /> The life of a mistake: *** / ****
