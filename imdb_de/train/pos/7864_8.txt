This is another crazy movie by Madhur Bhandarkar. I'm not sure why he has this obsession to show kids collages and horny concepts to Indian cinematic audiences, but I find some of those scenes really disgusting! What's new? It is a beautiful piece by Bhandarkar, in which he depicts the story of an entertainer reporter played by the lead actress of the famous movie Mr & Mrs Iyer. What distinguishes this film is the fact that it also covers the stories of people with whom this reporter interacts or is friends, such as their roommates, their colleagues, movie stars, models, rich and others who are on the Entertainment Page # 3 in your newspaper. <br /> <br /> Remarkable: It's another good performance from Ms. Iyer. She is probably perceived for this role. She plays selective roles, but shines in them. She is clearly delustered in this film and less beautiful. But entertainment reporters should not overshadow the people who treat them, right? Conclusion: Madhur has come up with another good film that sets social themes very well. However, this film loses focus and one is not sure what the director is trying to convey. <br /> <br /> Is he trying to show us the splendor and glamor of the rich people? or is he trying to show us the life of an entertainment reporter and compare it to the life of the REAL Crime reporter? Is he trying to tell us how the government and the rich rule the press? or he tries to illustrate the issues with child abuse and people. Other concepts include the unwritten rule that young women must sleep with directors or co-stars when they want to go to Bollywood. He also talks about how flight assistants get sick and tired from their jobs after a while, and resort to extreme standards by marrying a lot of older people, etc. He also talks about unfortunate women and spoiled them Children in rich families. <br /> <br /> That was all fine with me .. but could be too complex for an average moviegoer who just wants to relieve some stress from their daily work
