I grew up as a kid with full house. I have not looked at it for years, but I started it again about two weeks ago. Now my kids see the show and they love it too. My kids can not believe the DJ is on the show and I'm the same age. <br /> <br /> I really love the show because it's a show that you can see with your family. It has good lessons that your children can learn from. There are no drugs and violence. Even though the children have a problem on the show, they can always open up for their family for help. This is the message that children should now receive from television for a few days. Turn to your family and ask for help, not drugs. Kids should watch more shows like Full House instead of half the mess on TV. <br /> <br /> I also love the show because it makes you laugh and down to earth. It talks about real problems and family matters. There is always a lesson that you can learn from the show. <br /> <br /> I vote for the show at 10.
