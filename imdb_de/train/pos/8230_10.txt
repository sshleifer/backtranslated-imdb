Eglimata (= crime) is a story about small crimes committed by people in everyday life that could lead to an absolute disaster in a crazy scenario. One of the smartest Greek series ever! Actors like Ketty Konstadinou and Maria Kavogianni showed a whole new dimension of themselves and their talents and gave us moments of incredible "guilty" laughter. Every viewer seemed to recognize the bad side of his self in one of the characters, or at least a side of himself that he wished he would like. Actors of all ages, playing ever larger and smaller roles, gained just as much space in the heart of the Greek public. My personal favorites (apart from the first two I mentioned) are Vassilis Haralambopoulos, Athinodoros Prousalis and Stavros Nikolaidis, but there were so many amazing actors from time to time. Anyone who understands Greek all over the world should find a way to see it, even though it has been on TV for more than five years. In Greece, the series (ANT1) is repeated on every occasion where there are summer or early afternoon zones. We will never forget Eglimata or the cast teams!
