The icy and deadly Ace hit man Tony Arzenta (a divine gentle and commanding feat by Alain Delon) wants to end the assassination business, but the dangerous gangsters he works for will not let him. After his wife and child are killed, Arzenta announces the season to anyone responsible for her death. Director Duccio Tessari tells the gripping story at a constant, snappy pace, maintaining a consistently serious and straightforward tone, staging the rousing shootings and thrilling chases with a sizeable raging coryza and emphasizing the narrative with jolting explosions of bloody violence. Delon's sympathetic and charismatic presence adds to that already enthralling procedures add an extra class. The film also benefits from the first-rate acting of a buff-up cast, with praising contributions from Richard Conte as a wise mafia kingpin Nick Caro Gravini as supportive friend of Sandra Sandra, Marc Porel as Arzenta's more faithful friend Domenico Maggio, and Anton Diffring as relentless. Capo Grunwald and Lino Troisi as poison gangster Rocco Cutitta. The brilliant cinematography of Silvano Ippoliti offers several graceful pans. Gianni Ferrio's funky score hits the groovy spot. Erika Blanc and Rosalba Neri appear briefly and snappily. Better still, there is no filler to talk about, and we even get a decent drop of delicious female nudity. The amazing conclusion puts a medium-long and long-lasting wallop right in the stomach. A solid and satisfactory winner.
