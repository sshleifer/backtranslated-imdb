A young woman comes to her husband's hometown after he died in an accident. She hardly settles down in this small town, but shortly thereafter loses her little son through a kidnapping and all her hopes ... This could lead to all sorts of actions following in a normal movie: finding a new partner and finally being happy; or depressed enough to fight and eventually kill ... She tries to kill herself, but not after a series of tough battles with God. She trusts in God only to find that God seems to forgive everyone, even the murderer. Well, I should take care of God here, the movie does not mean anything against God. The way the film treats the subject is quite interesting: not from the woman's point of view or from the perspective of God (that way, a lot of grass would grow, clouds will seem like the view). It is more from the perspective of a third party, the film lets us perceive and explains nothing. <br /> <br /> The movie would not be so interesting if only the woman were there. There is this man who is everywhere near the woman and obviously in love with her, but in his own way. He's a funny guy, like a clown, I should say, shamelessly hanging around our heroine. The combination of these two, the woman who is always full of tension and always cries and pukes, and the man who smiles and talks stupidly, ends up in a good balance of emotions: nothing absurdly wrong or too boring. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
