This interesting documentary tells a remarkable story about an expedition to do blind Tibetan children's trekking in the Himalayas. but also from a personality conflict between two remarkable people. On the one hand, there is Erik Weihenmeyer, the first blind man to climb Everest, and the team of (sighted) mountaineers who lead the children. On the other hand, there is Sabriye Tenberken, a blind woman who runs the first blind Tibetan school. She agrees with the expedition, but has doubts about her progress. At a certain level, Sabine simply does not understand the philosophy of the mountaineer (with an emphasis on yielding). She may be right in recognizing the disagreement between the goals of the mountaineers and the desires of the children, but her certainty as to her own correctness makes her a difficult person to express herself with, especially as she has an effective veto , In the background of this (reasonably well-done) fight, we get an insight into the lives of the children themselves. I enjoyed the movie, though it delivers a message that is clearly meant to be uplifting - although it describes the quarrel in detail, the film claims a little relentlessly How amazing are all those who play in it. However, it is difficult to argue with this assessment, even if it is presented somewhat uncertainly to the viewer.
