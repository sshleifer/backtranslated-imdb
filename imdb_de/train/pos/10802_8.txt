I'm at the other end of the previous comment. <br /> <br /> First of all, I do not think that this should be a direct continuation of "The Jerk". I mean, it's not "The Jerk 2" ... it's "The Jerk, Too", which leads me to believe that, although many character names are the same, it's actually a completely different person /> < br /> Think about it: Virtually no connection to the previous movie, except the names of the characters. a very different story; different cast; and the fact that it is a partial musical. <br /> <br /> I say, give this movie some credit. It has a lot to laugh about. Mark Blankfield at his best.
