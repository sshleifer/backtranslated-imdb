This is a funny movie. It has all of the usual Disney components (music, great variety of characters, story, appeal) associated with great animation and the outstanding vocal talent of lesser known actors like "Antz" and "Price of Egypt" /> <br / > The characters work really well and have a strong appeal, and the humor is focused on a broad level that overcomes generational barriers. The film is also presented in an excellent Cinemascope format, which contributes to the cinema experience. <br /> <br /> Call me crazy, but I've seen the movie three times, and I'd like to bring more friends to see it this weekend. Many skeptics have seen this movie on my recommendation and were not disappointed. I work in a multiplex, and I can honestly say that nobody has left this film without a sense of satisfaction. <br /> <br /> See it and do not be dissuaded because it is animated. You will surely enjoy this movie and be sure that you stay for the credits! The bloopers and out-takes at the end are the funniest part of the movie, which is laughed through and through.
