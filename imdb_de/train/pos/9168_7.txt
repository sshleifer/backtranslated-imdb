This was a fantastic adaptation of Jane Eyre. The only problem I had with that was that I did not like Zelah Clarke. I thought she was too old and made Jane too shy. In the book, Jane seemed to be a much stronger character. I was really upset about this depiction of her. the part in which it is the morning after Rochester has asked her to marry him, and she runs to him and always hugs him to laugh. I think they made a bad choice when she got them. But Dalton was absolutely wonderful as Rochester. he makes this version of Jane Eyre worth seeing. Another thing that did not make this version 100% was the quality of the movie. I know it was made for television in the 1980s. If it had been a movie and had better quality, it would have been perfect. My main complaint, however, is that Zelah Clarke was definitely too old.
