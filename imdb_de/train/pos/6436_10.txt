Ingrid Bergman is a temporarily impoverished Polish countess in Paris in 1900, who is persecuted by France's most beloved general and a glamorous countess - in addition to being betrothed to a shoe tycoon. This is the fail-safe premise that takes one of the most delirious acts in film history. There are political machinations in the back room by the general's henchmen, a run-down balloonist and ecstatic Bastille Day fans, but at the heart of this magnificently photographed film are the wild intrigues of top / bottom involving horny servants and more subtle aristocrats. Yes, these are rules of the game. Before it's over, even Gaston Modot, the jealous ranger of Rules, appears as a gypsy capo! Things are going to be a bit too thick and fast towards the end, which causes confusion for this non-French-speaking speaker, but what the hell - Elena and Her Men is another extremely humane Renoir masterpiece.
