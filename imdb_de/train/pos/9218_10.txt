Let me first say that I wanted to see this movie for about a year, because I knew Angelina Jolie was there and I love her. But my love for her has nothing to do with my opinion of the movie. Anyway, no video store had anything like the local library. I saw it and was totally excited. Yes, there were Italian stereotypes, but it was good and funny. It was not demeaning in any way. <br /> <br /> Every actor and actress did an excellent job. I laughed a lot about the sexual humor. Overall, I think this movie is worth seeing if you can find it. It's adorable and fun. I rarely slot movies as 10, but I give this a 10! <br /> <br /> Go, find it and look at it!
