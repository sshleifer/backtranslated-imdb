Man, I loved this movie! That really brings me back when I was a kid. These were the days when the teachers were still teaching movies on reel-to-real, and if they were good, they would slowly rewind the movie so you could watch it play backwards. I remember one of the first lines ... "Tutazema was his name, and he was an orphan, living in the village with his sister like that." This is a great movie for kids and as enduring as the red balloon. In the end, the other Indians in the village attach the feathers to Tutazema and he himself becomes an eagle. He lives as he always wanted. He can fly up the skies.
