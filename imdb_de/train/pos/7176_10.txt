OK - you want to test someone how comfortable they are with their puberty and the embarrassing and crazy changes - and you'll immediately get the reaction when you see this startling doc of children watching the horror movies that were socially relevant in the '80s do. More than any movie I have ever seen, this film is about putting sexuality and ego in a totally human, burdening and distressing way, in the kind of inherent goodness of youth that is being used by the Disquieted by the fear-obsessed world of adults, Quirkel in Youth is recognized for everything from madness to perversion. Mini-mogul Darren Stien seems to be seeking a deeper understanding of his achievements and concerns as the patriarch of the world of a stern child. What he finds in himself and others is not always pretty - but it shows how to improve and reconcile with age. What does change mean without thinking. I love this movie.
