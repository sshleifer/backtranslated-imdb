I enjoyed the movie and would recommend to anyone who is having a good time. Do not take the movie too seriously, remember that it's Disney and G rated it. It is a good cleaning fun, although some parts are recognized by adults, but children would never notice, especially the "triangle" between Cruella, Le Pelt and Cruella's faithful valet Alonso. Glenn Close is fantastic and has made Cruella truly her own and is terribly frightening even if she is "healed" by her furry-loving nature. It can scare the audience when it literally shakes the theater with its shrill heads. (I even sat in my seat when she surprised you with her "bipolarity" as a dog who loves Ella). All in all, I'll see it in the cinemas again, I liked it so much.
