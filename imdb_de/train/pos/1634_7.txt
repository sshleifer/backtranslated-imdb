I first (probably) caught the movie on HBO in 1981, and when I was 15, I found the movie hilarious. I remember that I have NOT seen the Alfred E. Neuman portrayals shown in the movie trainers. As the MAD Magazine satirized the film and abruptly stopped halfway with apologies from the "usual gang" to hide into such a bitch, I simply assumed they made fun of me as I did them (and Ron Liebman) like that embarrassed that they had removed their names from the credits, I was quite surprised. Certainly there are many worse movies that can be contacted. I'm watching the movie on video (at the age of 32) and have restored the MAD references. I still get a kick. And as a fan of Ron Liebman (Hot Rock, Where's Poppa?) I think it's his crowning glory (SAY IT AGAAAAIN)
