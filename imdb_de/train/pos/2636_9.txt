The Lion King series is easily the culmination of the Disney animation. The original Lion King is the greatest masterpiece of cel animation. Lion King II: Simba's Pride is by far the best direct-to-video sequel that Disney or any other studio has developed for an animated feature. It deserves a theatrical release. The same goes for this movie. It has the original cast, songs by Elton John, a funny story, exciting action and touching character moments. Everything you can expect from this series. Not so much a new story, but filler and extended backgrounds to Timon and Pumbaa and their place in this story. What impressed me most was the care taken in the animation. Too often, Disney is concerned with the animation quality of their video and television efforts. But here they seamlessly mix new animations with footage from the original movie. The scenes never look out of place. Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella are in full swing as Timon and Pumbaa. Matthew Broderick, Robert Guillame and Moira Kelly repeat their roles as Simba, Rafiki and Nala. We even receive a return visit from Whoopi Goldberg and Cheech Marin as hyenas. There are many big laughs in this movie. If you love Lion King, you need this movie. The story is simply not complete without it.
