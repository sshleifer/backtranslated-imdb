This unbelievably formulaic film from the "Walker, Texas Ranger" crew contains some of the most incredible scenes ever seen in a television movie. In addition, the result can be fairly predicted right from the start. But it is a funny little movie that does the work: he entertains. That's all it should and it does. The stunts and explosions are fun and exciting and the plot is not half bad. The drama is also decent, which is not a big surprise, because everyone knows that Chuck Norris is not a Steven Seagal. If you're a fan of the genre (and "Walker, Texas Ranger"), you'll definitely love it. If not, do not waste time. 8.10
