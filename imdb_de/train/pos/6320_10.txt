The main reason why I wanted to see this movie was because of the wonderful cast. A ton of my favorite actors in a movie is amazing without actually seeing them. But this movie surprised me. It was not what I expected. It's been a while since I saw it, but I remember I could not stop laughing !!! And not only the cast has done it for me. The script was written amazingly. Every time you expected something, it did not happen. There were so many twists and turns, but it suited the overall tone of the movie rather than being presumptuous. The camera was absolutely beautiful together with the set. I really can not say anything bad about this movie! Suppose I have more time for Andrew Davoli!
