This film is unusual and bizarre and in a very good way almost uncommon and bizarre. I give this shorts a 7 just because it's so unique and off the wall, but mostly it seems like it's bizarre just to be bizarre. If the film had managed to integrate its bizarre moments into a seeming plot, it would have been really fantastic. <br /> <br /> The main problem here is that the creators seem to have just mixed a bunch of crap over spatulas, then threw a whole lot more crap that sounded like it was funny from the mouth come from a spatula. <br /> <br /> This is definitely worth a look, but it's not top notch through every stretch of creator's wild imaginations.
