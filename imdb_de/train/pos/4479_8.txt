Since watching Anchors Aweigh in 1945 for the first time, watching on videotape has a lot of nostalgia for me. At 15, it was easy for me to get involved in the first of the big MGM Technicolor musicals. Now maybe I'm most interested in thinking about the future careers of the leading players. Although Sinatra had made a few negligible films shortly after his appearance after Dorsey's days, this was his first major movie appearance as a solo singer. As another observer noted, this seems to be almost a warm-up for On the Town. Sinatra might have had to work hard, but his dance with Kelly is believable and he would do better in the next pairings. When observing his body, however, it is easy to see why he was caricatured as a rodent bean. Who would have thought that within a decade he would win an Academy Award for acting and would play many roles as a tough detective or leader in combat. Although Gene Kelly's personality and dance dominated in this film, his lucrative performance did not indicate that he would become an important creative force, almost an iconic figure, for MGM Musicals, developing a dance style similar to that of Fred Astaire added. After all, it was strange to see the fresh-faced Dean Stockwell and remember that he would later play a "thrill" killer in Compulsion, based on the 1920s murder of Leopold-Loeb. An additional note: A reviewer praised Betty Garrett's performance as Sinatras love interest. Later she played in On the Town next to him, but Pamela Britton was seen in this movie.
