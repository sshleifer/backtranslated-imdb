The combination of the superb black and white photography and the plot "Eugene Onegin with a twist" made this a real knock for me. The atmosphere created by the mostly very dark shots, which were contrasted with occasionally very bright overexposed white, was gripping. There was a great moment in which transparencies - seemingly conventional holiday photos, but subtle but instantaneous - showed the faces of the actors, accompanied by Lensky's heartbreaking aria from the Tchaikovsky opera Eugene Onegin. <Br /> For me, the hallmark of a good movie is that it should use the possibilities of this medium, which means that the story is often less important than imagery and atmosphere. The last year in Mariánské Lázně is a good example of such a film. Krisana is in the same form.
