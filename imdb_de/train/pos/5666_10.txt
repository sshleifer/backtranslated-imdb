I loved this show when it was aired on television and was smashed when I found out that someone somewhere decided it was not worth the sequel! For years I hung my copies of this show, of which I had band or someone band for me. That's up to now. The forces that finally decided to release this beautiful series on DVD, and I finally got my complete set in my hands. Which brings me to this part; The part of this show is about everything. <br /> <br /> American Gothic is about good verses of evil, essentially a fight between Lucas Buck (meaning Buck, with a B). He's a nasty sheriff of a South Carolina town where things go the way he wants, and nothing stops to pave the way. There's still a lot of life left to live. I really hated it when it was canceled, but it seems to me to go when I finally find something worth seeing on TV. Gary Cole has done a great job as sheriff Lucas Buck, he has just the right amount of charm against evil to make it. The other actors did a great job too, so you could say even the casting was a hit for me.
