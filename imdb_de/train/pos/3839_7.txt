Most people know Paul Verhoeven as the director of many good (and bad) science fiction movies in Hollywood. But long before he produced generic thrillers in his homeland. History is a basic premise for women, nothing new or intoxicating. Verhoeven believes he can improve it by adding a series of dream sequences that, instead of defining our main character and situation, are only used as a way to advance the predictable storyline. The script was solid, the dialogue helped to catch the effects of the threadbare story. What made the movie at least good, was a terrific spectacle. Jereone Crab was fantastic as a "tortured artist" and the followers were also very good. The cinematography of Jan De Bont gives the film a little life and helps Verhoeven, as a director at least capable of acting. <br /> <br /> 6,5 / 10 <br /> <br /> * * 1/2 / * * * *
