Castle of Blood (also known as Castle of Terror) is a well-made, surprisingly eerie contribution by Italian director Anthony Dawson. Exquisite black-and-white cinematography, flawless dubbing, superb casting, quite logical scripting, intentional tempo, and a surprising (albeit fully fitting) ending set this picture apart. Only the movies that sometimes deal with music and the rather abrupt "love at first sight" between Elizabeth (Barbara Steele) and Alan (Georges Rivi√®re) are a surprisingly entertaining movie sitting in a pub and telling Count Blackwood one of his spooky stories. Alan, a young news reporter, recognizes the great writer and asks for an interview with Poe. During the conversation, Poe reveals that all his stories are true. Incredibly, Alan expresses his skepticism about life after death. Count Blackwood offers Alan 100 pounds that he can not survive this night in Blackwood's Castle, a night after Halloween when the dead go for a walk. Alan can not afford the bet, so he bet his life for a 10-pound bet. <br /> <br /> In contrast to Mario Bava's overrated "Black Sunday" (also known as "The Mask of Satan"), "Castle of Blood" is quite restrained, making the few moments of violence even more terrifying, especially surprising by a director normally associated with these terrible 1960s Italian space movies The pan and scan version found was severely degraded (and recorded). Still, it's worth seeing and crying for a modern remake, maybe with Christina Ricci or Jennifer Love Hewitt in the role of Elizabeth. Watch it and enjoy a movie that compares well with Robert Wise's "The Haunting".
