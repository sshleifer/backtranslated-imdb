This is in my opinion one of the five best animated features of Disney. Cinderella was a perfect return to the feature-length movie (as opposed to the compilation films of the 1940s), and the costly depth of the multilayer camera does not return to film in any other way. Although Disney adapts the story a bit liberally, one collects the idea of ​​the era over the dress and sets stylizations - a clear period in which the story takes place. <br /> <br /> Cinderella is more mature than Snow White and a multi-dimensional character. In fact, all the characters are a bit more developed, except the prince - the shallowest - we know that he has a sense of humor and a great smile, but that's all. Like Snow White, Disney has a strong influence on popular culture history - in most versions of Cinderella, the stepsisters are attractive, but not as pretty as Cinderella, and her character takes off from her otherwise beautiful appearance. <Br /> <br /> Favorite Disney Supplements: The Mice! Continuity is also valued - Cinderella always loses her shoe throughout the movie. The addition of the home-made gown and the following step-sister's attack was always terrifying as a kid - I remember that View Master showed this with a black background and a big red light on it! The broken slipper shows the unwillingness of the evil Lady Tremaine to give up her influence on Cinderella and to be beaten - Audley would characterize the worst Disney villains, the satanic witch Maleficent, in Sleeping Beauty.
