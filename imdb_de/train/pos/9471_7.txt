Steve Carell plays Dan Burns, a newspaper uncle and a single father for three girls. When returning home in a large family, Dan meets his perfect wife, only to find that she has a relationship with his brother. <br /> <br /> What does a man have to do? <br /> <br /> I quite liked "Dan In Real Life", but I would imagine that the success or success of this band depends on whether you want to accept Steve Carell as being relatively straightforward and reserved, instead going through the broad comedy trains made him so successful. If you can not accept it, you're not afraid "Get Smart" will be there later in the year, but for the record I thought it was very good. <br /> <br /> "Dan In Real Life" starts off as typical, incidentally, amusing, family drama, but it gets funnier and funnier as it continues and Carell's frustration with his situation grows. It's not very original (but if you would only watch original-idea movies, film throws would be very close, right?), But "Dan In Real Life" is entertaining and a good cast (who would not fall) in love at first glance into the luminous Juliette Binoche?) make the most of an insightful script that contains many thoughts about the meaning and passion of love. <br /> <br /> I hope Steve Carell is pushing and doing something so interesting again.
