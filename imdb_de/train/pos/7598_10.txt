"Lost", "24", "Carnivale", "Desperate Housewifes" ... the list goes on and on. These and a number of other high-quality shows prove that we are in the midst of a golden age of television history. "Lost" is pure genius. Incredible layers of personal and psychologically workable stories, underlined by sublime cinematography (unbelievable to use that word when describing a TV show), a killer score, great performances and cut. Anyone who is not enthusiastic about this is missing one of the most important creative expressions on television. There may be issues with watching just one episode per week, but the DVD format is actually an incredible way to look at it. I hope you keep doing that (as I'm sure).
