I'm usually skeptical when I watch movies or mini-series of novels because the script is always different from the novel. Luckily I was wrong! The script was very close to the novel (I think it helps that the author was an executive producer and author, huh?). <br /> <br /> The cast is outstanding. I can not describe how much I liked seeing such a large selection of actors (from Ossie Davis and Ruby Dee to Robert Ri'chard and Bianca Lawson) to see the houses and cottages that I imagined: what I saw on the screen was something different. However, it was not enough to dislike the mini-series. <br /> <br /> I recommend this to anyone who has read the novel: you will not be disappointed if you have done it. 8 out of 10 stars! <br /> <br />
