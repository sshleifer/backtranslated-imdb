"The man in a white suit" is another feather in the cap of Scottish director Alexander Mackendrick (Whiskey Galore !, Sweet Smell of Success). The star of the film is Alec Guinness (whose comedies include child Hearts and Coronets and The Lavender Hill Mob). Guiness brings his usual class into the movie and makes her much more than a typical comedy. <br /> <br /> In fact, the comedy is not completely open. At the end of the picture it has almost become a complete drama. It's the kind of Ealing studio comedy that is not meant to make laughter, but a general pleasure, like the best British comedy of the time. <br /> <br /> The whole idea of ​​the suit is not very original, but the way it is done is. The film is very original and is recommended to any fan of Guiness or Britsh Comedy. <br /> <br /> 7.6 out of 10
