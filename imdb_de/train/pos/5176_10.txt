A must for anyone who has ever or wanted to go to camp. This film shows the absolute essence of the summer camp. It's funny, it's compassionate, it makes you see more about the characters once the credits start. If you have not seen this movie yet ... what are you doing? Get off your butt and start the video store. Have a great summer :)
