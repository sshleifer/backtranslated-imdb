Although I was born in the year this movie came out, I'd never heard of it when I saw it when I saw it when I saw it. I totally fell in love and laughed and cried and felt together with the characters because me and my friends were her. <br /> <br /> Her hair, clothes and language were outdated, but the emotions and despair of each situation were so familiar! I remember thinking how real it was and how I wished that they would still make such films. <br /> <br /> In fact, I saw this movie the night after sitting in a crazy party (not unlike the one in Jay's house) that had fallen from what we considered losers who were at the edge of our crowd. A top notch BS'er and "responsible" mother figure I immediately identified with Jeanie (I was also the one with a car), though I also hovered a bit off Madge's insecurities. My best friend was a Deidre and her best friend from childhood was our Annie. <br /> <br /> She watched the scene when Jeanie is at school or where she and her boyfriend separate and then she tells Madge how much she loved him, felt like conversations and situations that I personally had. Now, at the age of 27, I recently saw the film again and felt a sense of emotion, because it was like looking back on a piece of myself youth (although none of my friends died). I think this is a must for all girls from the age of 13.
