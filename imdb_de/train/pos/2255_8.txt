Not a bad martial arts movie. Battle scenes were good. Michel Qissi did a good job shooting his first movie without Van Damme. The story worked without bad language and too much blood. Scriptwriter Jeanette Francessca has a good line to working history. It would be great to see something different from her in the same genre. She likes art and has strong women's promenades. It was definitely worth a look. I recommend the movie to all drama and martial arts lovers.
