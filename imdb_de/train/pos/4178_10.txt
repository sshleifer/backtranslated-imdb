This film reflects the Australian ingenuity needed to make this country what it has been for the last 200 years. Not as pompous as the British, not Gung-Ho like the Americans. If one of these countries tried to do what this crew would have done, that would have been terribly failed. Either out of ignorance of the British side or too much belief in superior firepower on the American side. "Real" Australians (ie non-imports) are the only ones who can excel in modern military conflicts because they had to improvise most of their adult lives. Take a look at examples like Gallipoli. Paschendale; Tobruk; New Guinea and Vietnam.
