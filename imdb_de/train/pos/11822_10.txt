Dick Tracy is one of my favorite movies of all time. I have to admit to those who have not seen it. You will either really love it or really hate it. It came out a year after the success of Batman. The expectations of all were so high that many were simply disappointed because the plot is so easy. But it's based on a comic ... what did you expect? Creatively, this movie is incredible! The sets, the make-up, the music, the costumes and the impressive spectacle make this movie fantastic. The film has bloodless violence and no bad language - that's something rare these days. Director, producer and stars Warren Beatty as the crime fighter of the Ace against Al Pacino's evil Big Boy Caprice and his mob of thugs. Madonna steals the show as a seductive Breathless Mahoney. This is one of the best characters Madonna has ever played. She has the best deposits I have ever heard! Madonna fans would love it! The coolest thing about the movie is that it uses only seven colors to make it look like a comic strip. This film is really a work of art that is unfortunately overlooked by the public. In summary, this film brings out the child in all of us. It's a movie that makes you smile in the end.
