I was thirteen when I saw this series for the first time, and I watch it again on DVD over 30 years later. The pictures about the opening credits have never left me. It has influenced my view of the world and the people in it. My parents had been with me long enough to have seen the show with me, and we always discussed the program thereafter. It made me a love of studying history and the best grades I got in the public exams of our school! I feel that the people who have experienced it feel that this is their version of the story of World War II. I can not imagine ever getting bored. Perhaps a similar series from the Cold War could now be considered, though it is difficult to imagine who could replace Sir Laurence.
