Although not the best anime I've ever seen, I really enjoyed Lady Death. <br /> <br /> I've never read the comic book and just seen it in the video library and decided to give it a try. <br /> <br /> The animation was OK, I got the sense for the 80s anime, which was the trigger for me. Why all others hate that is beyond me. <br /> <br /> Character development was ok. I like the way they transitioned from Hope to Lady Death. for you, who do not like it, obviously did not pay attention. Lucifer tells you how it happens, and she uses his words. <br /> <br /> Creamtor was a nice mentor / soldier for her. His dark bruise style was perfect for this type of movie. <br /> <br /> I think that everyone here who has beaten this one has to take a new look and think it over. Because all that people have beaten up can be said about any popular anime vampire Hunter D.
