I doubt that much of this film is based on a true story. In the beginning it says, based on a true story. I'll bet the only truth was that there was a former bounty hunter named Domino. Anyway, Domino starts talking to Lucy Liu, who works for the FBI. Domino is asked what she knows about a theft of $ 10 million. Through flashbacks, we see Domino as a child, then as a model, and how she was interested in being a bounty hunter. She basically tells two other bounty hunters, Ed and Choco. They let her join the group. It is tough, can use any type of weapon, and will use its good looks if necessary. <br /> <br /> You are involved in a fraud Chancellor Clarmont has. Along the way, the group begins a reality television show involving Ian Zering and Brian Austin Green. They are something like hosts and must have been really desperate. <br /> <br /> I found the story entertaining and there was a lot to laugh about. The editing did not bother me. There is also a lot of violence, mainly with weapons and blood. It could have been a little shorter. <br /> <br /> FINAL VERDICT: Good enough to watch.
