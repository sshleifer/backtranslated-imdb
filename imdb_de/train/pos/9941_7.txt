You know the story - a group of brave no-hoppers taking part in a contest they seem to have no chance for is a story that has put Hollywood to death (Bring It On, The Karate Kid, Escape to Victory, Best of the best etc). Now there is a Taekwondo team fighting for glory in Korea? and guess what ?? The result is predictable, but ultimately satisfying. <br /> <br /> The fact that this movie does not fall flat on your head is due to the talented young performers who really care about the characters, and this in turn will keep you looking until the end. <br /> <br /> Fans of your typical Martial Arts movie can be disappointed? Taekwondo does not provide the usual amount of movement and acrobatics seen in most Kung Fu films. The action is limited to (albeit impressive) kicks and occasional blows. However, this does not matter, as the characters' interaction and their struggle to make something of themselves make this movie a success.
