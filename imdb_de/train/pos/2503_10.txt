I am very choosy about the movies I see. I just happened to hear about Moon Child. I've been a fan of L'Arc En Ciel for a while and recently became a fan of Gackt and Mizer. <br /> <br /> I finally found out that the movie was re-released and took it up without a second thought. <br /> <br /> Being as critical as I am about movies, I have to admit that sometimes the action scenes can be a bit hokey ... but they are meant to be what another user suggested the basic calm before the storm, quotes Gary Oldman from Leon ... without throwing myself into the spoiler, the film hit me very hard because you realize that the boundaries of friendship are limitless and, as they often say, true loyalty is loyalty and similar marriage, divorce until death. <br /> <br /> Hyde and Gackt perform, showing why they can give their lyrics so much depth. Her passion for music is happening on the big screen and in the process of creating an exemplary movie that invokes the soul and evokes emotional response. The first time I realized that it is likely to be in strong rotation as far as my collection goes. I'd like to encourage anyone reading this post to pick up the movie if you want to get away from the current Hollywood movie trend. This requires a whole new direction if you use the classic Yakuza movie elements and how you can go wrong with a cameo Ryo Ishibashi of Takashi Miike's "Audition" and "Suicide Club" Celebrity? <br /> <br /> Man..I can not say enough about this movie, but I'll stop here. <br /> <br /> 10/10
