In fact, drug use, storehouse shots, matrix-like dodging, a futuristic city with a mix of Asian peoples, and a lone vampire - all in the same movie - seem to be a story that could only be imagined by a Japanese pop / rock star. And that's exactly what Moon Moon is and more. While all these elements sound like the perfect subject for a Campy B movie of the week, 'Moon Child' sets off with just a few expected bumps and problems. <br /> <br /> The Movie It has a cool, definitely independent feel that jumps from scene to scene, not in a fluid transition, but rather sporadic jumps and jumps that provide insights into the characters' lives and at one barely scratch real conspiracy. But the film does not make any excuses, but turns the story into a story of friendship, love, trust, and betrayal, all covered in the above-mentioned elements of a futuristic society, belligerent gangsters, and vampires. HYDE The gritty vampire "Kei" is excellent, lending depth to the character and balancing Gackt's overly zealous spectacle as "Sho," an orphan who befriends Kei. Lee-Hom Wang also shines as a vengeful "son" who befriends an adult Sho. The story revolves around these characters and their extended friends and family through different stages of life, and how simple friendship can easily be transformed into grief and betrayal. <br /> <br /> Even though the action is sometimes ubiquitous, unrealistic effects and special effects seem only to show what the movie never does, it is assumed that they are the immense popular Asian singers. The superstars as actors have their shortcomings and their characters as well. The movie rarely gets boring and ends up where it should after jumping a good deal. 'Moon Child' is pretty funny, sometimes funny and even touching: it's definitely worth it!
