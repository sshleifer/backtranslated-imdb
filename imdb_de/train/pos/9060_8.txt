I saw this today with my 8-year-old. I thought it was cute. I agree with the other poster that I could not remember this book, but we liked it anyway. All the kids are pretty good and pretty entertaining all in all. Billy is the new kid who accepts a schoolbully's challenge to eat 10 worms a day. If he loses, he has to walk down the hall at school with worms in his pants. The beginning of the film is to show that Billy has a VERY weak stomach and vomits almost everything. Laughter is created by a variety of methods to cook the worms. Good news on how to brave thugs and of course a happy ending.
