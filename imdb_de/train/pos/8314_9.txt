The film was actually a romantic drama based on three sisters who wanted to become a famous girl group. In her efforts, the eldest sister meets a drug dealer and street vendor named Satin, who runs after Sister because she believes he is the "big time" who will give her everything she ever wished for. Although he can be accused of killing her, he really only kills her mind and will to live, whereupon she becomes addicted to drugs and eventually dies of an overdose. It's not about street life or the Italian gangster who wants to buy Stix, then he threatens him. It is about how love itself can overcome the worst tragedies of life, which are portrayed in songs and style, and the character in which they live the times for young women who were then "discovered".
