Citizen X tells the story of Andrei Chikatilo, The Ripper of Rostov, who killed 52 people in 8 years, mostly women and children. It shows how the investigations were obstructed by the Soviet bureaucracy and how difficult it was to investigate the crimes. It does the work in such a brilliant way that it leaves no one untouched. It may be a bit slow in the beginning, but it really grabs you as the story unfolds. All I can say, besides "The Silence of the Lambs", this is by far the best movie about a serial killer I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> It's very hard to say what the actor's performance in this film depends on the others. Stephen Rea is really brilliant as an inexperienced forensic scientist charged with investigating. Donald Sutherland's performance as his cynical superior and the only person in the Russian government to help him is as outstanding as Rea's. And what should one say about Jeffrey DuMann, who plays the serial killer? DuMann has brilliantly created a character that triggers empathy rather than hate. Yes, he is a monster, but he is also a sad character who is being repressed and ridiculed by his wife, boss, coworkers ... / I can only recommend this movie to anyone who chooses a well-made documentary Drama, in which the actors are still more important than the special effects. It deserves at least a 9/10, maybe more, if you ask me.
