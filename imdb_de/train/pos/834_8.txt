Dark comedy? Gallows humor? How do you turn murder into a comedy? It can be risky because the onlooker has to let go of his moral values ​​and laugh at the antics of a man who kills people. Well, the story was absolutely solid with a good dash of hovering reality for it to work. So, Pierce Brosnan, the Irishman's answer to 007 is now thrown as a chain-smoking, sex-addicted alcoholic who kills people and is in a life-long crisis. He meets a struggling businessman, Greg Kinnear, and after a stony start, he learns he needs a boyfriend. But Greg is happily married to Hope Davis and Brosnan sees in him the basic things he does not have: love, home and a life. Add character actor Philip Baker Hall as the batsman's manager and we'll go to the races. Brosnan is wonderfully crass and raw as an antihero and Kinnear adorable as his counterpart, the very human businessman. Hope Davis adds a glamor to Kinnear's very conventional woman, who is fascinated by this abandoned man drifting into her life. The end is sexy and with some surprise. If you are able to expose the deterrent effect of killing people, you should at least partially leave the sense of theater well.
