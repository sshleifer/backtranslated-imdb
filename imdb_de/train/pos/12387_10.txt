Of all the films of the seventies, no one has grasped the truest essence of the battle between good and evil, like the sentinel. I mean, yes, there were films like the exorcist and others; but none of them conquered the human element of the protagonist like this one. If you have time, check them out. You may not be able to get past the outdated devices as such, but this is a story worth looking into. My absolute favorites were Eli Wallach, Sylvia Miles and Burgess Meredith. Then there are the subtle hints that also lead to what's going on. Take care. I had to watch it four times to remember all the little comic statements like "black and white cat, black and white cake". Besides, the books are really good too. I'm just sorry that they do not turn the second book into a movie. It's so scary it would outrun this movie.
