Note that anyone who disliked and enjoyed this movie commented that it was not as good as the book or that it was different from the book. <br /> <br /> I do not understand this kind of criticism. Books and movies are different media. While books have hours and hours to develop characters and storylines, films have about 120 minutes. However, the film has the advantage that it stimulates several senses: visual, acoustic and imagination. I do not care if a movie is that good or actually similar to the book it's based on. Who cares? I appreciate what it is. <br /> <br /> This TV movie was charming. An old and often-seen story that tends to clich√©s could easily have been embarrassing. Reefs and Reeves pull it off, however. One critic found reefs way too old. I never thought she was 40 when she made this movie. It is thanks to her that she played a 23-24 year old amazingly well. I also think that's the best thing Reeves has ever done. The story could have been stronger, and I agree that the video game could have used "streaming". Nevertheless, it is worth watching; clearly not a powerful love story, but rather a charming romance that will satisfy you, that love is a strong emotion and good overcomes evil. And it's nice to see a "love story" without the obligatory word f # $%, bare buttocks or hours of spitting kissing. <br /> <br /> Finally, the music score is excellent.
