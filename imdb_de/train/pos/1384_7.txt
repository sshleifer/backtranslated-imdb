Also known as "Water Lilies," this film tells the story of two girls who embrace the world of love and sex. This story is told at a slow pace and it works very well. There is plenty of time and space to get to know the different characters and grow something in them. <br /> <br /> The use of a small casts puts some more pressure on the players as they all have more screen time than normal, but the people who play in this movie can handle it. Everyone is absolutely believable. The visual setting is great, especially the underwater shots in the pool make for a nice effect. However, many films have been shot on the same topic, and this film is not really through. It pulls some "standard" printing methods out of the hat and works on them. It's not bad, not at all, but it's certainly not great and I think it could have been better if it had taken some less explored angles. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10 synchronous swimmers
