I loved this movie. It's rare to catch a glimpse of postpartum Vietnam, and this movie with no fight scenes, thrilling bombs and shots - that's all. I had no idea that I would be so affected. What an amazing look at how foreign veterinarians feel. It was hard to see, frankly. We all now understand the struggle and the nature of the Apocalypse, but that is so different. What happens when they come back and try to lead a life? You can not. It made me very aware of a large group of men romping lost in America. Not being able to sleep, unable to have love affairs, unable to deal with "normal society". They feel completely disconnected. This is a big tragedy, and not enough addressed. Yes, we have changed our attitude towards Vietnam veterinarians, we like them now, but what? There does not seem to be any difference to them. It is too late? It was a great movie, but I cried a lot. I have no other criticisms.
