This film has a powerful philosophical end. However, this end only matters if you watch the movie from the beginning. <br /> <br /> The alienation in the late 1960s, from the point of view of a young man and a young woman, is the obvious theme of "Zabriskie Point." Neither Mark Frechette nor Daria Halprin had much experience with acting This does not really improve the movie's message, but it does give inexperienced actors a sense of realism, as both players seem emotionally distanced from the turmoil around them. <br /> <br /> This is not a scriptwritered movie For the first ten minutes it is mostly visual with an impressive cinematography, the beautiful naturalistic images take on a different world and are a perfect match for the emotional separation between Mark and Daria. <br /> <br /> I would have liked the thematically weak Pink Floyd Music replaced by the bolder music of The Doors Many scenes call for "Riders On The Storm" <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, I like this movie, it's different, it's unique It is artistic and imaginative. And the desert landscapes are beautiful. <br /> <br /> Over the years, "Zabriskie Point" seems to be more and more attractive. It conveys the mood of the late 1960s in America. It's amazingly artistic, in a way. And the last eight minutes of the film are fascinating.
