SPOILERS INCLUDE TO MAKE OBSERVATIONS. <br /> <br /> Twenty years after 1984, this film talks about the future of Prince in the music industry. <br /> <br /> There is a scene that sums up Prince's musical performance over the last 10 years is perfect, and if you take the best two songs from his last 10 albums, you would have a fantastic album! <br /> <br /> The scene is going on like this. Prince runs into his dressing room after playing a song, and the club's owner enters the dressing room to give Prince an ear for his fall in the 90s and release albums that only most hardcore fans would endure his art. <br /> <br /> Club Owners- "You do not grab them like they used to, the only person who digs your music is you!" <br /> <br /> Spooky huh! How about the musical underline that makes Prince even more evil when he hits Apollonia in two different scenes to the ground! I was frustrated that this was not the only scene in which women in this movie were abused. <br /> <br /> I'm all for the comedy between Morris Day and Jerome Benton, as they stole every scene they found themselves in. But what was funny about throwing a woman into a trash can? That was just uncomfortable! The other nasty little piece was the chalk drawing of Princes father on the floor, thoughtfully provided by the Minniapolis police, which makes Prince even more crazy !! FANTASTIC !! <br /> <br /> Purple Rain is an overall entertaining movie as the soundtrack of Prince songs increases its value by 110%. On the other hand, the movie gives us another theory about Prince and his music, as the movie tells us that Prince's biggest song of the film was written by Wendy, Lisa, and Princess's wife, who defeated her musical father! <br /> <br /> Are Prince and the filmmakers trying to tell us that Prince stole all his best songs from his dad after he found his father's sheet music? Maybe that is why Prince runs out of breath in the 90s because he runs out of his father's ideas ??? ........... Hmmmm .....
