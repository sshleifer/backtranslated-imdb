Perhaps one of the funniest films in the world. Oscar material. Trey Parker and Matt Stone are hilarious and before you see this, I suggest you watch "South Park", one of the funniest cartoons that was created. Buy it, you will laugh every time you see it. Pure genius. If you do not think it's funny, you have no soul or humor. 10 out of 10.
