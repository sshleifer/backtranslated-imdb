This picture was released in 1975 and was the second in the three-part series of the life of Sheriff Buford Pusser. Bo Svenson takes on the role of Sheriff Buford Pusser and Luke Askew plays the role of Mobster Pinky Dobson. The last thing we saw, Sheriff Pusser, was lying in a hospital bed behind him and his wife, who was ambushed on Sunday morning. After recovering, Pusser goes after the men who killed his wife. Is Pusser able to end the revenge he is looking for, or is the mob trying to turn it off before he succeeds? The only thing that bothered me about this image was that it was a really true story. How could you go into a city with this crime and still do nothing about it? Since there really was no name actress in this picture, I can not give 10 weasel stars, but I can give 8
