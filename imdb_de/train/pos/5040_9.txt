I saw the trailer for Frailty for the first time on Yahoo Movies when Stephen King praised him high in the sky. Not really a fan of both stars, I still wanted to see it because I'm a big thriller fan. <br /> <br /> I was not disappointed. The acting was outstanding, especially by the two boys. I usually hate child actors, but Young Adam and Young Fenton were excellent. Bill Paxton did a really good job too. It was beautifully shot. <br /> <br /> You also have to pay attention to the twists and turns of the story. The three turns at the end hit hard and fast and I did not see them coming. The final twist of the film, coupled with the seriousness of what has just been revealed, still gives me shivers, even though I have watched the movie so many times.
