In my opinion, this is one of Superman's best performances on television as well as one of the most faithful comic book times. This series was a tribute to the two 70s / 80s Superman movies and the 1986 Superman comic series "Restart" ("Man of Steel", "Superman Vol. 2", "Action Comics", "Adventure of the Superman "etc.). The opening score and titles moved based on the John Williams score from the films, which was updated for a Saturday morning action series. Marv Wolfman, one of the main characters in the Comics Restart (author of "Adventures of Superman"), was the perfect choice to be part of this animated series. Overall, the series had a more mature feel while still being very kid-friendly. Superman was presented as believable, strong and iconic. His recurring nemesis was Lex Luthor in his megalomaniac / incarnate incarnation. The characters of the Daily Planet, Lois, Jimmy and Perry, were well portrayed. One of my favorite appearances was Wonder Woman, and the story revolved around her home island of Themyscira ("Paradise Island"). Both her design and that of her mother, Hippolyte, were in line with the newly revamped Wonder Woman comic series of the era, and it seemed as if an equally well-made animated series could have been developed for her, if handled the same way. > <br /> It's hard to believe that this was not released on DVD / Blu-ray! It deserves to be.
