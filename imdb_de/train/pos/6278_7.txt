I saw this on a flight to the US and was a bit skeptical at first, as some people said there were so many characters in it that you would not know any of them. But I did not think so. The movie is fast, but that's the nature of the director and the star. The chase scenes are excellent and yes, it can be predictable, but does not apply to most movies. The main villain is a bit disappointed, Christopher Eccelston is not as convincing as he could have been, but he said it was still a good movie.
