This is a great start to the movie career of Mickey Rooney. His talents here show that he has a long career ahead of him. The car and truck chase is exciting for the 1937 era. This launch of the Andy Hardy series is an American treasure in my book. Spring Byington performance is excellent as usual. Please Mr. Rooney or owner of the film rights, take the chance and let them produce on DVD. I think it would be a winner.
