This is a wonderful film about a brothel in a fishing village best described by scene constellations and directing of old Kurosawa works, combined with Dostoyevski's themes of human psychology (O-shin - Sonia Marmeladova), Shakespeare's drama and Hans Christian Andersen's tragic and happy. The script is miraculous, the scenes are colorful and beautiful, some scenes are really memorable. The plot is interesting and unpredictable - each of the characters is very well developed and interesting - there is also a bit of action, so if you do not like all the feelings, you would also get your money's worth. It's not about mysterious geishas and proud samurai with their Bushido pouring everything out of them, but about life, work, and types of people that can be found anywhere, anytime. A beautiful and fascinating homage to Kurosawa, which is certainly worth seeing.
