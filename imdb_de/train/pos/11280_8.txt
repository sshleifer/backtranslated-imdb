A very interesting conversation with the charm of the old movies. Tarzan faces the greatest dangers without hesitation when the moment demands, and we all enjoy his success with him. The most important thing for me is a man without special powers, who face the problems and beat them only with human ability (he was a great swimmer and had a great cry)
