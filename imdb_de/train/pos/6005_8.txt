Although this film is somewhat sanitized (because it was made at a time when people just did not talk about sex), it is an extremely helpful short film that shows prepubescent girls so they know what to expect during menstruation. It's not surprising that it was paid by the Kotex company, which is likely to surprise many that Disney has made this film - since they turned in the 40s and 60s, many educational films. As good as the movie is, I think the filmmaker missed a real chance. Instead of the nice female narrative voice and the relatively mild pictures, it would have been great if they had used Minnie Mouse and the rest of the Disney gang !! I know that would have given old Walt a heart attack, but wow, that would have been a great movie! By the way, although the idea of ​​sex in the movie is barely hinted at, she generally explains menstruation sufficiently. However, some details are lacking (especially about intercourse) which I assume are included in the booklet. <br /> <br /> Well, if only I can figure out why I saw a cartoon about menstruation.
