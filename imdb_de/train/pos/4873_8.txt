For those of you who are unaware that Kusturica is still investigating intermittently in his films - the Western assault on traditional Serbian values ​​- you will not be able to understand his stories. This ongoing theme, expressed through imagination and outrageous comedy as a vehicle, is a theme chosen by Kusturica as its mandate. Since his fantastic work and Magnum Opus 'Underground', Kusturica's films 'Black Cat White Cat', 'Life is a miracle', and recently with 'Promise Me This' his slapstick, the carnival style, underscores the 'Westernization' Balkan culture, its ambivalent arrival and attack on the traditional language. In the case of "Promise Me This", the paradoxical world of urban space and village space (traditional language) are juxtaposed. The world of the city reflects Western attributes that have shaped the spatial and temporal environment; organized crime, sexual exploitation, a broken sense of identity and a vehement disregard for traditional values ​​- as they express themselves to the young villager. The end of the film is further proof of this notion when we observe a funeral service and a wedding on a one-way street. They are gross on a collision; The wedding, which represents the lifeline and pulse of the village, d. H. the traditional values ​​will soon be related to the mourners who illustrate the death of tradition in this context. However, Kusturica brilliantly explores this theme through its unique, stylistic uniqueness. In his outrageous and extravagant style, he serves as a vehicle in his portrayal.
