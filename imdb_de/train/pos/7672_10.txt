I have to admit that Holly was not on the list at the Edinburgh Film Festival. However, after the artistic director of the festival had explicitly recommended this film to more than 200 spectators before presenting another film, I decided to take a look at it. Impressive! <br /> <br /> This film is about the very difficult issue of child prostitution - without compromise. I cried several times during the movie and laughed at others. Speaking of emotional roller coaster. <br /> <br /> The main actor (Thuy Nguyen) is a Vietnamese newcomer (who was only 14 years old at the time of filming) and faced this incredibly complex and difficult role. It reminded me of Keisha Castle-Hughes of Whale Rider, but the role here is much more demanding as she has to play a child prostitute. Chances are that she will win numerous prizes. <br /> <br /> The main story is about a girl who was sold by his family for prostitution and was held as a sex slave in a brothel in Cambodia. She meets an American (played by Ron Livingston in a strong dramatic role we're not used to from him), who after some time decides to help her. At this time, however, she is sold again and he is looking for her in Cambodia. The story turns and turns and the audience can never predict what will happen next. <br /> <br /> The acting was strong all along with a very interesting international cast. Udo Kier (very convincing as a sex tourist), Virgine Ledoyen (touching as a social worker) and Chris Penn (one of his last films). The Asian occupation was also excellent. <br /> <br /> Although the film deals with this difficult topic, it successfully focuses on telling a compelling, powerful story. It was filmed in Cambodia (some scenes in real brothels), which adds to the feeling that you almost watch a documentary. It seems the DP used a lot of handheld camera and close-ups, and overall, you felt you were part of the story. <br /> <br /> After the show I listened to other members of the audience as they walked and it seemed like they were all stunned. This is not a simple movie and I welcome the filmmakers for not making a "Hollywood movie". <br /> <br /> It's by far the best movie I've seen at the Edinburgh Film Festival. Shared opinion of my husband and a few other friends.
