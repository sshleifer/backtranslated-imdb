It finally comes out. The first season will be available in March 2007. ABC Family is currently broadcasting Monday through Friday from 4pm to 5pm Eastern time. The last episode will air on 19 December at 4:30. I missed it the first 100 times. I wish I could buy the whole series now. Who chooses you? I have to write 10 lines to answer the first comment.
