Besides "Star Wars" and "The Wizard of Oz," this is still one of the biggest fantasy movies ever made. It's a real shame that it's not as well known as it was in previous films (perhaps because it sticks to a legend instead of contemporary or sci-fi settings and that it's British, meaning a smaller movie market ), but it's wonderful to know that it has earned that reputation. <br /> <br /> Like all the big family movies, you can be a kid, an adult or even a teenager to enjoy this movie (I'm currently 18), but you have to appreciate classic movies first. I absolutely love this movie. It features an extraordinary music score by Miklos Rozsa (perhaps my favorite classic) that can match John Williams' "Star Wars" score, a fast but not very noticeable tempo, beautiful sets, dialogues and the use of color (both sets and Cinematography) Oscars won) and state-of-the-art, Oscar-winning special effects (for the time and some are still stunning). And of course, June Duprez's 'weak looks as a princess compete with Catherine Zeta-Jones' (she even looks somewhat like Jones!). <br /> <br /> In summary, this is one of my all-time favorite movie (besides "The Adventures of Robin Hood") and it really deserves more attention. It is a true adventure full of enchantment and together with "Robin Hood" it is my desert island movie which I have been able to watch over and over again without annoying myself. <br /> <br /> Stars: **** (Excellent)
