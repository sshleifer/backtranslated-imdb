After seeing Dick Tracy at the $ 6.99 Future Shop, I decided to try it without any prior knowledge and become a big fan of mafia and crime movies. I was very surprised when I saw a very entertaining, entertaining movie that showed consistently solid performances. The film is progressing well, of course it has another solid performance from Warren Beatty, but the real standouts of the film are Al Pacino and Madonna. I was happy to learn that Pacino was nominated for his performance as a towering gangster who wanted to demolish the city. Madonna was great as a girl in need, she really impressed me and deepened her performance. If you want to go with the attitude of wanting to see a fun, intelligent movie with great acting and a solid script, then give Dick Tracy a try. I do not think you will be disappointed. And pay attention to the cameos of Paul Sorvino, James Caan, Kathy Bates and Dustin Hoffman.
