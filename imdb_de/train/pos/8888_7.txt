This movie started slowly and then increased in the middle. The fact that the film went through two nights broke this momentum at its peak. The second part became really interesting, but then turned into a pitiful ending. Playing football in the yard? Could it really become even more sappy and maudlin? Now I hear plans for a similar movie based on the 70s. I will not make much effort to adjust to one if it is something like "The 60s".
