A best-selling book on honor killings in Jordan is being withdrawn by its publishers after allegations that the story was invented; in conjunction with other allegations of his author's past as a fraudster. A few years later, she reappears, acknowledging that she had acquired a certain dramatic license, but was willing to work with a filmmaker to prove the content of her allegations. What follows is a fascinating insight into a pathological personality. Someone who behaved makes no sense unless what they say is true, and who is seemingly incapable of saying anything that is not astonishingly dramatic, but best and most often proven not proven wrong. It is almost impossible to imagine what Ms. Khouri wanted to win with this film: justification? Celebrity? - all it achieves is to project a particular image of itself as a deeply damaged individual, and even that can not be considered evil. Director Anna Broinowski increasingly appears in front of the camera in the course of her film and becomes increasingly annoying; But in the end, it is rewarded with a remarkable, albeit frightening and disturbing story - and one of those films that reminds us of what a weird world we are living in.
