Do not be fooled by the stupid titles, this is a sweet ride! As the true successor of Tetsuo, the Iron Man, and Ichi, the killer, this gem starts with a bang and lays the gusset until the credits roll. It seems that extraterrestrials take over the bodies of humans and modify them into war machines, which are then used to fight each other in a twisted game to amuse their species. The winner of the battle eats the loser alive. This is mostly for the conspiracy, but who cares if the wound is so good? I have no idea how many buckets of mucus were used, but it is disgusting to look at it. Stop-motion is interesting and effective when acquisitions are in progress, and the loving care of all creature and makeup effects is required. The CGI is a bit limited, but that does not affect the overall quality, at least not to me. This was really a fun and twisty movie that earned a lot of praise and earned its place in the Cult Classics stack. Find it and watch it, you will not be disappointed!
