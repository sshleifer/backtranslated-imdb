The Sentinel offers a kind of run of the mill and cliched suspense / riddles, but is uplifted with good acting and tempo. For the most part, these stories have gone through as many permutations as we can endure. What remains is the question of how good the drama is, how smart the setups and bad guys are, how good the main plot is, etc. ... so the Sentinel does a solid job given its content. Michael Douglass and Kiefer Sutherland both have good screen bravura and good attitudes. Eva Longoria (the first time I saw her on the screen) offers satisfactory support. The whole affair side of the story is utterly implausible to knock it down, but it deserves leeway. Worth a visit, if you like the genre.
