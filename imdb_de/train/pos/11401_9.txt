An American in Paris was in many ways the ultimate blend of art and Hollywood musical. Built at the height of MGM's power as a musical powerhouse, the film features memorable Gershwin music, rightly called Beethoven and Mozart's 20th century counterpart. <br /> <br /> Gene Kelly was also at the height of his powers in this film, though it can be argued that this film was just warming up for his best work in Singin 'in the Rain (1952). , The two films are actually closely linked. Apart from Arthur Freed's connection, the Broadway Melody segment in "Rain" owes the incredible American ballet sequence in this film. This may be the only time a dance number is mentioned in the opening credits of the movie. And it deserves it because it shows Gene Kelly's skills as a dancer and choreographer to the highest degree. <br /> <br /> The cast of the film is consistently outstanding. Leslie Caron, who made an incredible movie debut, shows a maturity that gives the impression of making films for years. Her introductory dance sequence, and later her work on ballet, offers some surprisingly sexy moments that can only compete in MGM musicals with Cyd Charisse's work in Singin 'the Rain and The Band Wagon. Oscar Levant is weird as Kelly's stoic buddy who gets two of the best moments of the movie: during the closing party sequence (which I will not reveal to anyone who has not seen the movie) and one of the movie's most memorable music numbers, which incorporates his incredible piano skills with cutting-edge ( for the time) special effects connects. Less memorable are Georges Guetary than Kelly's romantic rival, though he has some musical highlights, and Nina Foch as a romantic rival to Leslie Caron. The May-December relationship between Kelly's character and Nina's character reminded me of the same "Keep Man" relationship seen between George Peppard and Patricia Neal at Tiffany's breakfast. <br /> <br /> There are some elements of the movie that have been made that are less satisfying to me than Singin 'in the Rain. The ballet is elaborate and well produced, but does not fit the rest of the movie. Without giving away the plot, the ballet simply happens without any rhyme or reason. And unlike the Broadway melody sequence, it has nothing to do with the storyline - and in the best musicals, the songs are always a matter of course. <br /> <br /> Worse is the end of the movie, which takes place immediately after the ballet. Although the end should come as no surprise (this is after all an MGM musical), I hoped for a bit more ... film after the end of the ballet. It's as if director Vincente Minnelli felt that he could not pursue the ballet with anything else. The movie literally let me down. <br /> <br /> Apart from that, an American in Paris rightly belongs to the best Hollywood musicals. It does not quite reach the height of Singin 'in the Rain, but it does come close and is evidence of Gene Kelly's abilities as one of the greatest dancers of all time.
