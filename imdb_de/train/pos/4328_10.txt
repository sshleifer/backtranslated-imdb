I bought the DVD of this version to compare it to the current BBC 2005 version (which is awesome). The 1985 was adapted by Arthur Hopcraft, who adapted Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy for television and who died this year (2005). I remember great plays, especially from Rigg and Elliott, and moving music. (The music in the 2005 version is much less noticeable, but very revealing.) To comment on just a few points: Richard Carstone is Ada Claire's friend, not Esther. Esther had no uncle. Charlie Drake has not played Krook, nor Toby Esterhase in TTSS! Krook is played in the 2005 version by the comedian Johnny Vegas. Toby was played by Bernard Hepton. <br /> <br /> Both versions are honorable and admirable adaptations of Dickens' great novel. Read the book now! It's not perfect, and the sentimentality sometimes makes you wince, but I challenge you not to cry - and to laugh!
