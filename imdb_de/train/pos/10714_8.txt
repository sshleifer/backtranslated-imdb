The Scots are characterized by stories. The traditional variety. Many years after the event, I still see an elderly lady, the mother of my friend, who tells the battle of Culloden. She lets the figures come to life. Her passion is that of an eyewitness. One to the events on the soaked heath, about a mile from where they live. <br /> <br /> Of course, it was many years before she was born, but you could not say how she told it. The same story is told in bars all over Scotland. When I discussed it one evening with a friend in Mallaig, a local man came to deliver his version. The discussion lasted until the end. <br /> <br /> Stories that are passed on become part of our nature. Who does not remember the stories our parents told us as children? They become our invisible world. And as we get older, they may still serve as inspiration or as an emotional reservoir. Fact and fiction merge with pretensions, role models. Warning stories. Archetypes. Magic and puzzles. <br /> <br /> "My name is Aonghas, like my grandfather and his grandfather before him." Our protagonist introduces himself to us. And also presents the story that spans generations. It produces stories within stories. Stories that recall the impenetrable wonder of Scotland, whose rugged mountains are shrouded in fog. The fabric of the legend Nevertheless, Seach'd is rooted in reality. That gives him his special charm. It has a raw beauty and authenticity that is tempered with some of the best Gaelic songs you'll ever hear. Aonghas (Angus) visits his grandfather shortly before his death at the hospital. He burns with frustration. Part of him longs to be in Glasgow in the twenty-first century. But he grew up on the western coast in a Gaelic-speaking community. <br /> <br /> However, there is a deeper conflict in it. He longs to know the truth. The truth behind the old stories of his grandfather. Where does the fiction stop? And he wants to know the truth about the death of his parents. <br /> <br /> He is forced to take one last fateful journey to the summit of one of the most inaccessible mountains in Scotland. Can the truth be said? Or is it all in stories? <br /> <br /> In this story about stories, we return to bloody battles, poisoned lovers, the folklore of the old and the sometimes treacherous folklore of the accepted truth. In this way, we connect with Angus as he lives the story of his own life. Seachd: The Inaccessible Pinnacle is probably the most sincere, unpretentious and sincerely beautiful movie Scotland has ever made. Like Angus, I resented the pretext of letting stories hang on more stories. But like Angus I forgave that as soon as I saw the "bigger picture". Forget about the cash pastry of Braveheart and the like. You could even do without the well-known dramatization of The Wicker Man. To see a film that is typical of Scotland, this film is probably unique. If you meditate deeply enough, you may even re-evaluate the power of storytelling and the age-old question of whether there are some truths that can not be told, but only experienced.
