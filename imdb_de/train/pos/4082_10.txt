Hayao Miyazaki is unsurpassed in the use of hand-drawn animation as a form of storytelling, but is often compared to Walt Disney. That's just unfair because Miyazaki's films show themselves to be superior artists. He really does have a gift for adults and kids, and Laputa is indeed a great ride. <br /> <br /> But where can I start to describe a movie that is so magical and breathtaking! Miyazaki's works have amazed me again and again. Laputa is a big adventure and I wonder how a movie can be so full of details and fantasy. Ask yourself this question: If you're a kid who dreams of such a big and magical adventure, what would it look like? The answer would be to strap yourself into a seat and watch Laputa, for it really is a childhood fantasy that has come true. Every minute of the movie is rich and captivating ... from the train hunt to the amazing sequences of flight ... and the wonderful sight of the floating castle itself. Not to mention the excellent result of Joe Hisaishi! Everything you ever want from an adventure movie is here.
