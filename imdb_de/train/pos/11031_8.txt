Sly's best action movie. It's a very enjoyable movie with some interesting characters, solid performances and Renny Harlin's direction is stylishly secured. Stallone is rarely so interesting in his action films and he certainly affects the action scenes. This was one of the best action films of the year and one of the most exciting and entertaining of the 90s, a definitive genre classic. As a Stallone fan I can look back with many memories. Lots of great action and Sly in first-class action-man form. Action lovers appreciate this movie because it has all the hallmarks that make a good Akiton movie. The film looks great and Janine Turner, Michael Rooker and John Lithgow are very supportive. ****
