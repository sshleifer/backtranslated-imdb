This is one of the first independent films I have ever seen. For such a very small budget it was done well; As an insomnia, I can sympathize with the main character, although my sleep problems have never been so intense or disturbing. <br /> <br /> Well-directed, well executed, from a motif that I have not seen much in the cinemas, which triggers light and sets both perfectly for the backdrop of the film. There are few conspicuous antics, but they can be intentional; You will see after watching the movie. The film is very personal and worth seeing twice. No movie is flawless, but a Hollywood version could not make the story any better. all in all 8/10.
