This is a comedy of morality, so that occasionally a gentle touch of bitterness occurs, but a lightness softens all the sarcasm and irony flows, until suddenly a moment brings your heart to a halt and everything changes wonderfully written and staged, is a jewel that perfect shines and looks beautiful. Jean-Louis Trintignant is as always exquisite and Romy Schneider is a pearl, perfect and radiant, that should not be missed. A really wonderful movie !!
