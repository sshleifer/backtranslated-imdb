This is a truly classic film in its history, acting and film presentation. Wonderful actors are full throughout the movie, Miss Sullivan and Jimmy Stewart are the main characters. In real life, she admired and liked Jimmy, and in fact gave him his first first roles, and he helped him be more laid back on the set. The "chemistry" between the two was always obvious and so warm and pleasant to look at. She was such a beautiful young woman and so cute in her personality portrayals. The story of these two young people and how they ultimately come together is charming and magical entertainment. Heartwarming presentations are also held by the other supporting actors in this wonderful story / movie. I wholeheartedly give Miss Sullivan a perfect 10 in this Golden Age Cinema Classic, which has a special appeal for all generations. A must for all!
