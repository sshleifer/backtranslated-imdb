This film shows the essence of growing up for a young girl in micro-city America. The realism and subtle nuances cast by Ashley Judd's character Ruby are captured by what can only be described as a lifelike backdrop to the panhandle of Florida. From the slam of a screen door to the lack of work, the echoes of life on the "Red-necked Riviera" make rude decisions for the young girl. Paradise was not easy. However, she slowly overcomes obstacles and deception and learns to be her own wife, whose strength flows from within. Ashley Judd's winning smile and contagious gait radiate warmth and command respect and admiration. The careful pace of character development is similar to that of "Ulee's Gold" (1997) with Peter Fonda and also Victor Nunez.
