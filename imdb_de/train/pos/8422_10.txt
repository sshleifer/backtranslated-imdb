An extra is invited to play a general in a film about the Russian Revolution. He is not an ordinary extra. It is Serguis Alexander, the former commanding general of the Russian armies, who now has to relive the same scene in which he suffered a professional and personal tragedy in order to please the director, who was once revolutionized in Russia and humiliated by Alexander. It may now be time for this broken man to finally "win" his penultimate fight. This is a powerful film with meticulous directing by Von Sternberg, which gives Alexander's character the utmost irony in every respect. Jannings earned his Oscar for the role with a very moving performance that the general played at his peak and in his lowest valley. Powell gives an eerie support as a vengeful director and Brent is perfect in her role, her face and movements express as much as Jannings's love. All round brilliance. Rating, 10.
