In The White Balloon and Crimson Gold, the two other films by Jafar Panahi I've seen, the director breaks down a surprising amount of depth into subjects that seem superficial. By the way, Panahi's seriokomic tribute to Iranian women campaigning for their rights, I do not think he's that successful. Not that what he says is of course not important (and it's too bad that Iranians, like just about every other Panahi movie, can not see that). But after a while, the film feels a bit flat, and it feels like 90 minutes on. Not that I did not like it. The actors are all fantastic and the celebration at the end of the film is contagious. But in my opinion it is not an important job.
