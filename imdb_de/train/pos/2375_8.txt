I honestly believe that this was the best version of the War of the Worlds that I have all seen. It was funny, but it was also very educational. I learned the whole movie and if I could, I would watch this movie. My favorite part was when the soldiers were killed on robots and another came right behind. I think the last movie war in the world should have been the first, and it would have been better. But in any case, I give this movie 2 thumbs up. <br /> <br /> and if you make another movie like this, I'll definitely watch it. <br /> <br /> Thank you
