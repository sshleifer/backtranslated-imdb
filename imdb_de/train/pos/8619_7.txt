I would first say that somehow I remember seeing this movie in my early childhood. I could not read the subtitles and thought Sonny Chiba would be Sean Connery. But I really liked the concept. If you are unable to at least partially suspend your adult skepticism and embrace your inner seven old values, you may want to avoid this movie. After seeing the restored 137-minute version on DVD, I have to say I enjoyed it, although it was not as much as seven (I remembered the end). <br /> <br /> There are aspects of the film that deserve criticism. The first 15 minutes and the last 15 minutes have some really funny moments. My favorite is the contrast between the scenes that were played in the last 10 minutes, the curious choice of background music (listen to the lyrics). <br /> <br /> In an action movie, great value is placed on the personal stories of certain soldiers and the social dynamics of the team, as the burden of their time travel takes their toll. By the end of the film, I had decided that this was a good thing when I was seven, even though the relationship between the relationships was a bad thing. <br /> <br /> For an action movie, there's also plenty of action-packed action, especially a few epic battle scenes between the Platoon and the hordes of Shogun-era warriors. The creators of the film have ensured that as many deaths as possible are bloody and, let's face it, humorous. I thought that was a great aspect of the movie when I was a kid, and I'm not ashamed to say that I'm still doing that. <br /> <br /> I also like the fact that modern soldiers are generally not able to. If you spend the film with egg shells to avoid the space-time continuum changing, they have heavy caliber machine guns, mortars, rocket launchers, a tank, and a helicopter, and they are very keen to allow feudal Japan do. I would like to assume that every lively IMDb user would put on his shoes. <br /> <br /> In short, the films that are worth seeing are a source of regret to viewers that there are not any more films with a similar premise, and at the same time provide some important clues as to why a movie like GI Samurai is so unique.
