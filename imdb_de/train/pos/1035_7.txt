This film was nominated for Best Picture, but lost to Casablanca, but Paul Lukas beat Humphrey Bogart as Best Actor. I do not know why Lucile Watson was nominated for Best Supporting Actor. I just do not think she did a very good job. Bette Davis and Paul Lukas and their three children leave Mexico and come to the United States in the first scene of the film. They take the train to Davis' family home. Davis and Lukas were underground to stop the Nazis, so they are very tired and in need of rest. But when they arrive home, a Nazi lives there and they can not do much about it. It turns out that the Nazi only cares about money and is ready to make a deal with Lukas. You are more on the plot, but you can find out for yourself.
