This movie is humorous, charming and easily becomes a favorite for those who like light entertainment. Hollywood is hardly the place for serious history lessons, so I just accept it the way it is. Bing performs quite well in his usual, inimitable style as the smith Hank Martin, who happens to be transported back to another age, to the time of King Arthur. The beautiful Rhonda Fleming is as breathtaking as Alisande or Sandy, the object of Hank's affection, though she is betrothed to the brave and fearsome Sir Lancelot, played by Henry Wilcoxon. I love this episode when King Arthur (Cedric Hardwicke), Sir Sagramore (Bm. Bendix) and Hank (Bing Crosby) dress in ragged clothes and go with their backpacks on the road to experience the kingdom up close. King Arthur's comment: "I say we're not alone," while giving his scratchy clothes a good scratch, is one of those fun moments in the movie. The portrayal of William Bendix is ​​unbelievably ridiculous, not to mention his attempts to call the quaint "ye Olde English". <br /> <br /> The story is not profound, but in my opinion well done, and I'm happy every time I see it. It's also a great family entertainment. <br /> <br />
