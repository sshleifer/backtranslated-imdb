Due to the rapid causal shifts between several exciting stories, it pays twice to consider that "Bug" becomes a completely satisfying work of art that keeps on playing optimistic love against countless examples of frustrating reality. <br /> <br /> My favorite characters are Wallace (John Carroll Lynch), whose compelling concern for life - from the cockroach to the passengers, for which he is partially responsible - frames the film; Olive (Christina Kirk), who spends a lot of time creating surreal but tasty meals for her impossible husband Ernie (Chris Bauer); and Mitchell, a cable TV technician with unlimited confidence in fortune - cookie messages: "You will meet the girl of your dreams. <br/> <br/> Against such optimism are the forces of quirky reality, all created by acts of the world Characters: Parking tickets, a clogged outflow in a Chinese food / donut shop, TV interference, a crushed one Car Fender, a hilarious dinner reservation that eventually ends a vacation in Hawaii. <br /> <br /> The movie is funny: Olive drunk at a Chippendale performance, Johnston (Michael Hitchcock) as a customer service representative trying to negotiate with an angry customer. The addictive Cyr (Brian Cox) faces a restaurant inspector, Dwight (Jamie Kennedy), who responds to his girlfriend's girlfriend refusing to have children by writing hostile Chinese cookies: "Your girlfriend is lying to you" and the guy who is while falling asleep on a squeeze-holder, spending the night searching for his girlfriend's missing cat. <br /> <br /> A Public Cable Side Story The Access Home (Darryl Hisse) and a local drama teacher reading "The Boy in the Bubble" expresses the main theme: love comes from the heart. <br /> <br /> "Bug" maintains pretty much the same level as "trains, planes, and cars," but with a lower budget and a fresher eye.
