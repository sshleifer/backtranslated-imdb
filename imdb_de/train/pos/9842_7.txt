A glacier slide in an icy iceberg sends its three characters into an endless wet-slide tube that offers plenty of kick to thrill kids just as mature viewers can be blinded by the Stargate sequence that closes 2001: A Space Odyssey. Miles in the vision, but it is still a scene of great bustle and excitement. A great opening sequence also takes place where a furry squirrel creature tries to hide its precious acorn. You've probably seen this scene in the trailer, but as it takes place, it triggers a domino effect when the mountain starts to crack and an avalanche arises. The horror just keeps going as the animal tries to overcome the impossible. <br /> <br /> The film follows two characters, a mammoth named Manfred (Ray Romano) and a buckothed sloth (John Leguizamo) as they try to move south. They find a human baby they adopt and decide to track down the parent figures to return to them. They are accompanied by a saber-tiger named Diego (Denis Leary), whose predatory intent is to bring the baby into his tiger clan by trapping the mammoth and the sloth in a trap. The carnivorous family of Diego most of all want the mammoth, but Diego's learned values ​​of friendship make the decision easy in the end. <br /> <br /> There are fatalistic natural hazards in the world along the way, including an erupting volcano and a glacier bridge that threatens to melt for a short time and reminds of the flight of the castle in Shrek. The characters think about why they are in the Ice Age, while they might call it The Big Chill or Nippy Era. Some characters wish for an upcoming global warming. Another great line about mating problems between girlfriends: `All great guys are never around. The sensitive ones are eaten. 'Ravishing lines, quirky comedy and light fingerprints make this game pretty easy to see. In addition, the food is so scarce for the nice vegetarians that dandelion and pine cones are considered "good food". <br /> <br /> The vocal talents of Romano, Leguizamo and Leary make their personas good, while the children will enjoy their antics while the adults engage in their own talents. There is some mild violence and intense content, but children will be thrilled with the excitement and get one of their early introductions to the age-old struggle between good and evil. Family tradition and friendship are strong thematic bonds. The entertainers also majestically use background landscapes that are fantastic. <br /> <br />
