"Ranma Â½" is my favorite Anime by Rumiko Takahashi, and the woman really knows how to entertain us with a good story that is not just a comedy, but an action anime as well, and the main character in the story is Ranma Saotome, a teenager Boy, who is also an expert in martial arts: Ranma is engaged to Akane because of an agreement between both fathers who are good friends and have been training together for many years.Akane is the younger and most violent sister of the Tendo: Kasumi is the oldest and is very sweet and Nabiki is the middle and loves to win money, no matter what, Ranma and Akane are struggling all the time, especially since both have a very bad game when they find out that Ranma becomes a girl when she's with them splashed cold water and his father becomes a panda, many new characters and situations happen, and they also discover the reason of the transformation: In the fight fight Ranma and his father fi el in a damn river, but not only did they have such a fate ... <br /> If you saw and liked '' Ranma 1/2 '', I would like to introduce '' Inuyasha '' and '' Maison Ikkoku 'recommend two more good creations from Rumiko's hands.
