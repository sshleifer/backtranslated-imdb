REIGN OVER (2007) *** Adam Sandler, Don Cheadle, Jada Pinkett-Smith, Liv Tyler, Saffron, Donald Sutherland, Robert Klein, Melinda Dillon, Mike Binder, Jonathan Banks, Rae Allen and Paula Newsome. At times troubling and at times mediocre about a downtrodden man who lost his family on September 11 (Sandler in his best role since "Punch-Drunk Love") rejoining with his old college roommate and friend (Cheadle) each role impressively), a wealthy dentist who seems to have everything? Family, wealth, happiness? But actually sees an ally in freedom with the personal life offers of his disturbed friend. The film was written and directed by Binder (who plays as Sandler's former best friend and official accountant) with equally humorous and serious grief. The movie works best when the two stars divide the screen until the final act turns into a nearly film. The week syrup with a solution for the upcoming things.
