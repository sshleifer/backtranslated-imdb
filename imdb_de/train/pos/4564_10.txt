If there was ever an inspirational story that could make anyone, whether disabled or not, to persevere and make it despite the contradictions (even if "it" is made "right" as an expression), it can go a long way a personal truth is), My left foot is it. It's a tough movie that can sometimes be seen: The less peaceful aspects of Christy Brown's personality appear in two key scenes - one when his sister declares she is pregnant and about to marry, while his dad has a bad reaction and At a dinner table, when the woman who spoke to him, could effectively communicate him, announced at one key moment (the inauguration of Brown's art) that she will marry another man - is tough. Very, very hard, moreover, because this is a man who can not respond adequately to these events and can only express himself in the only way he knows: about cries, cries and obscenities that are aimed at hurting oneself , However, this is not a history of heartbreak and family dysfunction, even though there is some of it for the autobiographical report, but that of a man overcoming his severe disability and becoming a functioning human art world. Daniel Day Lewis won an Oscar for his powerful, memorable performance as faulty but tough Christy Brown, and Brenda Fricker did the same for her supporting role as Brown's steady mother.
