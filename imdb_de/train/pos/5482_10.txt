This is an amazing movie. In addition to the actual footage of the main events in the failed attempted coup against Chavez, we get the background image that describes a class-centered society. Many of the rich seem to have a choice between the people's democratic decision and are willing to use the military for a regime change. "Be careful what you say to your servants," is a revealing comment. The head of the largest oil company in the country appoints US presidential new president, and these young Irish filmmakers have everything in front of the camera. A great movie to educate young people about democracy. We see a transparent documentation of how media can be manipulated and used in the interest of big business against the interests of people's democratic desires. Nietzeug.
