I loved it and was so shaken that there is no other season !!! I wish they would do it! It was the best show ever !!!!!! There is probably no chance that they will decide not to cancel the show. ha ha i wish there were! I would be so excited !! I would really do it! I miss it! and most of all was shaken, not knowing what happened to Jason !! I think they should do another .... it's also stupid that you have to write ten lines to post a comment. i really want to know what happened between jason and nicole ... maybe you could make an excuse !!
