Oh my god, I live in Kentucky. When Mellisa Joan Hart came to Louisville, she went right through my neighborhood and waved to me that I'm filthy rich, so she wanted to look at my neighborhood back to my interest in the show ...... this show leaves you with that finger pointing at something and disappearing I mean it's just so creative and I love it, I'd like to be in this show ... .... this show is just amazing, I mean, whoever came up with this show I just want to give them a big kiss. I mean, I feel better when I'm sick and I'm happy when I'm crazy If someone tells me he does not like it, I'll agree with you. OK, OK
