American icon Henry Fonda portrayed "Elegant" John Howard, an aging trucker who had his beloved big drill "Eleanor" repossessed after a lengthy hospital stay forced him to miss his payments. Deciding that he just wants to make a more perfect run, he breaks out of the hospital, steals Eleanor and joins in with old friend Penelope Pearson (Eileen Brennan), who wants to resettle her prostitute troop /> <br /> fondas wonderful Performance is a natural anchor for a movie that taps at the heart as effectively as it tickles the funny bone in the more comedic scenes. An outstanding cast, including Robert Englund as a reluctant young buddy, Susan Sarandon (who also gets co-producer credits) and Dub Taylor (as always a delightful ham in the most uncompromising comedy of the picture), help immeasurably br /> <br /> The ultimately life-affirming nature of the picture and the carrying capacity of the journey have an incredible weight; This is an image that, if you let it in, can remember long after its end. <br /> <br /> Here the promise of the open road is shown vividly; the landscape just looks beautiful. For Craig Safans' wonderful music score, this is a remarkable picture in terms of aesthetics. <br /> <br /> In the final act it loses something (the characters played by John Byner and Austin Pendleton are little more than invaders)), but maintains its good mood thanks to the appeal of its central characters. <br /> <br /> The exploit / drive-in-lock image one can expect from the title (especially the alternate title "The Great Smokey Roadblock") is a rewarding movie experience that I would not hesitate to recommend can. <br /> <br /> 9/10
