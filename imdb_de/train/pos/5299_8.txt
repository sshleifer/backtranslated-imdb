If you've gone beyond the title of the movie, "Pecker" is a great movie, perhaps one of John Waters' best. A wonderful cast, led by strong performances by Edward Furlong and Christina Ricci, makes the story very funny and very real. There are some shocking scenes that are definitely not suitable for small children, but they are there for a purpose. Unfortunately, this film was not mass produced and the public is denied the opportunity to see it. If the opportunity kicks, then watch this movie.
