"I did not want that to be complicated, Leese, I have to assume she'll read that." In this suspense-packed action thriller, fear flies in 30,000 feet. A night flight to Miami quickly becomes a fight for survival when Lisa (Rachel McAdams) realizes that her seatmate (Cillian Murphy) plans to use her as part of a deterrent assassination plan. As the minutes pass, she is in a race against time to warn the potential victims before it's too late. <br /> <br /> One of the many reasons I love this movie is because of the chemistry between the two stars. McAdams and Murphy, who are also two of my favorite actors. For example, the early scenes at the airport are more like a romantic comedy: two people are always running into each other ... I had to hand it over to the two to shoot a movie like this one. Especially Murphy's character. Jackson, who seems to be really complicated in this way, seems charming and innocent. Still, he tries to do his job and make Lisa feel physically and mentally trapped. I mean, in some areas he seems really worried about Lisa. <br /> <br /> A great ride all the way. For many films, I would hate to watch a prequel or a sequel about it, but actually I would not mind a prequel to this one that would play with Jackson overpowering Lisa. The favorite scene is probably this headbutt scene because it was so unexpected. There was also this beautiful composition of the famous "pen" scene. When will she move? There was also this beautiful change in McAdams Lisa, where she turned from a victim into a setback. I also loved the scene where she sits down in the food court and pretends to ask some ladies for a food court poll. How great was Murphy with all his woes .....
