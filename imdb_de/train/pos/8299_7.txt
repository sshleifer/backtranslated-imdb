When scientist and family man Matt Winslow (Robert Urich) finally accepts the invitation to work the Micro-Digitech Corporation in a spacesuit project, he moves with his beloved wife Patricia (Joanna Cassidy) and her son Robbie (Barret Oliver) and her Daughter to Chrissy (Soleil Moon Frye) to a huge modern house in the Group area. They meet their friend Tom Peterson (Joe Regalbuto) and his family, who have completely adapted to the new lifestyle, and Tom invites the Winslow family to the Steaming Springs Country Club. Tom tries to seduce Matt and tell him that every member of the club has a professional ascent to Micro-Digitech, but Matt is not tempted to bid. Later, he is introduced to the director of the club, Jessica Jones (Susan Lucci), who befriends Patricia and makes her join the club with her children. Matt senses how his family's behavior is changing and decides to investigate the club and find a bad secret about Jessica and his members. <br /> <br /> When I saw "Invitation to Hell" in the 80s, I liked it a lot. This movie is partly reminiscent of "The Stepford Wives", where people change their behavior in a suburb. I just saw it today, and I've found a great metaphorical message against the big corporations as people literally sell their souls to the devil to gain positions and earn higher salaries. I'm not sure if the author wanted to give this interpretation of the story, but I think it fits perfectly. My voice is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Convite Para o Inferno" ("Invitation to hell")
