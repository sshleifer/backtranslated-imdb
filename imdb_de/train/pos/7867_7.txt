Aan men at work were a formula movie of him who flopped <br /> <br /> He returns with his superlative. PAGE 3 <br /> <br /> A film that deals with the life of journalists and is a brilliant film. <br /> <br /> The film is well told, although the half-baked romantic parts of Konkana could be avoided, but that's forgiven. <br /> <br /> The entire Upendra Limaye track is superb, while the Atul Kulkarni track is great too. <br /> <br /> The dial between Manoj Joshi and his friends is funny at first glance, though sometimes repetitive. <br /> <br /> The subplot of Bikram-Tara is brilliant as well as the entire hospital scene and also the last child abuse that shakes you <br /> <br /> The film has an open ending that is handled nicely. Madhur does a great job. Music is okay /> Konkana excels as Mad havi, using her expressions to Tara Sharma, is decent, except that her voice Sandhya Mridul is good as usual. Upendra Limaye excels in his role as a police officer. One of the talented actors His little part Boman Irani is aloof and does a good job. Rest is okay
