It breaks my heart that this movie is not as appreciated as it should be. it is very underrated. People have forgotten what movies really are about, nowadays they're just thinking about bum movies with popcorn and friends, like transformers, movies that are focused on hyper-mega-high-budget like 300mln or even more, with special effects can be pretty funny only and they are stupid films without history. It's the kind of movie I do, despite the most. Of course, it's fun to see great CGIs, but we do not gain anything essential from these types of films. <br /> <br /> I honestly think the performance was outstanding. Especially Busy Philipps, along with Erika Christensen and Victor Garber (whom I respect) made this movie an Oscar. The emotional performance of Busy Philipps was amazing, so sad we can not see Oscar in her hands, which she deserves.
