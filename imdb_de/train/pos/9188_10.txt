It is a pity that many people did not understand this and the next episode. <br /> <br /> But do not worry! I'll explain it badly too :) <br /> <br /> This episode is divided into two parts. <br /> <br /> The first part is Tony's "dream" in his coma. The second part is what happens in real life. Well, what people have not understood is that Tony's dream is more than just a dream. This episode is about his preparation for his death. He loses his own identity and finally even forgets himself, so that he gives up all ties to this world. You will notice what I say in the doctoral scene where Tony says he has lost his briefcase containing "his life". They have really done a great job because they have their own thoughts on what happens when one dies. <br /> <br /> If you understand the whole plot, you will consider this and the next episode unique, with great spiritual meanings. <br /> <br /> As with any soprano episode, acting and filming are excellent. <br /> <br /> Only what I did not understand was the role of the monks. I'll take a look at it until I get it. Anyway, this episode really touched me, and I do not think anyone else can take a better look at what happens in a near-death experience. <br /> 10/10 No doubt.
