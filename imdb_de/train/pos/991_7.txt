I'm really shocked to see how many reviews this movie has made in this movie. This movie was not meant to be a "deep thought", which seems to be the vast majority of reviewers. In fact, it seems that NO films produce a life-changing insight and a deep, twisted, crazy plot, they would rate them 1 or 2. Do not trash a movie because you do not like the genre, people. <br /> <br /> This movie was an action / comedy strip and that was all it should be. And for an action / comedy it was done very well. I was actually quite surprised that I liked it as much as I did, I've never been a real Jamie Foxx fan and had the overused plot it has. <br /> <br /> The plot was nothing special The typical criminal leaves the prison and is dragged into a villain while trying to clean up his act (see Blue Streak, Hudson Hawk, 48 hours, etc., etc.), but it was warmed up with a bit of a technological twist. Well, the "bad guys" are actually the "good guys" and the REAL "bad guy" is an over-the-top guy. <br /> <br /> Jamie Foxx actually plays convincingly humorous, while at the same time quite intelligent, is a serious main character, and has not tried to exaggerate the humor side of the movie. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a deep underlying plot like "The Matrix" or a drama like "Of" Mice and Men "then this movie is not for you but if you like the raw action, the excellent Enjoying fast shooting and occasional jokes of humor, this movie will not disappoint you.I would normally have rated it with an 8 (at the same level as the Die Hard Trilogy), but instead given a 10 to try and score on that to bring what it should be. <br /> <br />
