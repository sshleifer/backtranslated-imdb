The American boy Jesse took the train to Vienna to take the plane to the USA. On the train he met a Frenchwoman Celine. Although they met for the first time, they talked like good friends. When the train stopped in Vienna, Jesse asked Celine to accompany him on a tour of Vienna. Then the romantic story unfolded. <br /> <br /> At first they were careful. The funniest scene was listening to CDs in the music shop. They looked at each other, although their eyes had no contact. After detailed conversation, the relationship became tight. Then I saw the most romantic scene they pretended to call their friend. Their deep love for each other has been expressed completely in words. Love is a strange thing. If you really want it, it will not come the way you wanted it to. Love needs mutual understanding. Without them, love will not last long. Spiritual harmony is the most important thing for love. <br /> <br /> A great script and great performance made the movie a big hit. <br /> <br /> One of the best romance. 9.10
