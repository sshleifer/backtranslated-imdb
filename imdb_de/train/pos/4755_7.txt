A bus full of passengers is stuck during a blizzard. The police have closed the bridge - they are uncertain and they are stuck in a small cafe until the road is cleared. After a while, however, their boredom is worrisome, as it seems that one of the passengers was NOT originally on the bus and may be just a foreigner !! This leads to a conclusion that is ironic but is also rather funny in a low brow style. <br /> <br /> This is another funny episode of the Twilight Zone. Instead of the typical phrases or social comments, this does not contain a permanent message. However, it is also very good to see, so who cares ?! Exactly what happens, you just have to see for yourself. By the way, this one star is John Hoyt - a face that most of you will recognize from countless old TV shows and movies. In almost all cases he played a real nagging (like Charles Lane in the same epoch), but I loved seeing him - when he perfected the grumpy personality and was somehow funny at the same time.
