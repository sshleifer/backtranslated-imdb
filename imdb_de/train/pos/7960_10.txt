In the past, there have been countless talking animal films, most of which either feature digitally animated animal mouths that almost conform to the voice, or are ridiculously amateurish. "Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey" is neither. <br /> <br /> This film does not require child-friendly augmentation of moving dog lips or gesturing of cat limbs. It has the ability to make you believe that the animals authentically speak to each other, and you can be more emotionally involved with them at heart (as is the case with all the big boy and dog movies). <br /> <br /> Homeward Bound is the epitome of all family-friendly animal marches for me, offering some nice cinematography, an inspiring soundtrack (by the genius of Bruce Broughton) and an impressive cast ... <br /> <br /> Michael J Fox ... Chance <br /> <br /> Sally Field ... Sassy <br /> <br /> Don Ameche ... Shadow <br /> <br /> Frank Welker (Voice God) .. Various <br /> <br /> This is a modernized version of the children's classic "The Incredible Journey", which was made into a documentary by Disney a long time ago in 1963. The sequel (Lost in San Francisco) is nowhere near good as a movie, but adds to the adventure of my dearest furry friends and is an entertaining urban twist on the grand outdoor adventure theme. Would you like to entertain your children with a funny, pretty, heartwarming mini epic without the idiotic and often ridiculous comedy of modern children's cinema? Parents, buy all three movies for your kids - now! Thank you, Disney, for putting a tear in my eyes every time I look at this classic of the early '90s!
