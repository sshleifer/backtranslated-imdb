I love this movie. It's one of those movies that you can watch over and over again and are still captivating. Congratulations!! I believe that everyone involved in the film and screenplay should be proud of themselves. It's so scary, you feel like a real band. I would like to see more movies of it. I'm glad they did not opt ​​for famous Hollywood stars because it probably would not have worked. And even though Billy Connolly is pretty well known, he really got involved in the role and I could not imagine anyone playing it. Congratulations again, I really believe that this movie has earned the Peter Sellers Comedy Award for Bill Nighy. And if you come to the last scene ..... well what can I say !!!!
