Just got out and can not believe what a brilliant documentary that is. Strangely enough, one leaves the cinema with such awe and wonder. Recently, films have become so exaggerated that the thrill of discovering something truly special and unique rarely happens. Amores Perros did this to me when it first came out and this movie is doing me now. I did not know anything about it before I got into it and what a surprise. If you hear the concept, you may feel that this is one of those delicate films about an amazing triumph that is drowned out in supreme music and tries to convince us what a great story it tells, but does not let us in , Luckily that's not the movie. People tell the story! This makes such a good job of capturing every moment of your commitment as we enter your world and feel every second of it. There is so much behind the Ascension that makes everything they go through much more tense. Touching the Void was also an excellent document about mountaineering and the intensity of the intervention, but this movie is more of a human story. I just saw it today, but I'll go and say that this is one of the best documentary films I've ever seen.
