The first season was unbelievable, the whole idea of ​​settling on the island while exploring (and seeing) the secrets was phenomenal. filled with suspense, tons of cliffhangers and an amazing plot. I mean, I love the whole idea of ​​just getting used to the island. And then, the first time I saw the smoke monster in the first episode, I caught my attention. From then on, I was addicted. The second season was the same with the first season, only a little better. I absolutely loved the idea of ​​hatches and the DHARMA initiative. The entire plot and the sequences of the second season were mysterious, scary and exciting. I loved all the exciting environments on the island, but the DHARMA story made Season 2 truly amazing. Season 3 was not quite as good as 1 and 2 ... but still great. I loved seeing the others' back stories, seeing their camp, and exploring the secrets. ("Tricia Tanak Is Dead" is one of my favorite episodes). This season was not so good, but still breathtaking and funny, but above all exciting! Now the 4th season. I had hope for this season, and we're good for the first episode, but then it got REALLY boring and monotonous. I mean, I really despise the new "saviors" like Miles and Daniel. The storyline got old after the first few episodes ... and MOST OF ALL ... The fourth season was deprived of something that made LOST a perfect series. In addition, some of my favorite characters have gone.
