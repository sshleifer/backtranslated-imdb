Paris, je t'aime (2006) is a film made up of 18 segments. You can do the calculations - 18 segments in 120 minutes means each director had seven minutes to tell his story. The film is based on the premise that you can actually tell a story in this short time. The premise works. Almost all segments are powerful, complete and satisfactory. Each one introduces a different aspect of Parisian experience, and almost every director draws outstanding performance from a cast of great and near-grand actors. <br /> <br /> There were so many powerful portrayals in this film that it's hard to do so. Select one or two favorites. Most memorable for me were Juliette Binoche as a mourning mother in the Place des Victoires segment, Gena Rowlands as an aging beauty in the Latin Quarter, Catalina Sandino Moreno as a maid in the Loin du 16ème segment, and Margo Martindale as a postman from Colorado who has learned French to visit Paris ("14ème arrondissement"). <br /> <br /> Particularly noteworthy is Gulliver Hecq, probably the meanest little boy who has ever molested an American tourist in a Paris metro station (Segment "Tuileries"). <br /> <br /> This is a great movie, and my wife and I decided to rent it in a few months, so we can catch up on some of the subtle points we've certainly missed however, is so beautifully photographed that I would suggest you to see it on a big screen, do not miss it!
