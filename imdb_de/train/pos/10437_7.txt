This is a slow story. No action. No crazy tension. No abrupt surprises. If you can not bear to see a movie about two people talking and going, about a story that is slowly coming to an end, and about a loving romance, do not waste your time and money. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, if you're interested in dialogue, masterful storytelling, thought-provoking ideas, and true love in the stuff of life, then this is your movie. I recommend watching this movie when you're awake because the tempo, music and overall sound of the movie can put you in a fun mood. It is really fantastic. I really mean that. <br /> <br /> Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy sometimes get on with their manners, but luckily the chemistry between the two makes the act very natural, warm and tender. They act and feel each other from the beginning, making you feel like an intruder. In their conversations, there are excellent comments on many topics that lead to thoughts and discussions between you and your partner. I thought it was too deep and too varied for such young characters, but I may underestimate their intelligence. Still, it did not ruin the movie. <br /> <br /> The overall story is very simple, which in my opinion gives the film its charm and, ultimately, its power. <br /> <br /> BOTTOM: The film is flowing sluggish. The dialogue is fascinating. History builds up gently, systematically and in terms of content. The build up to the final is satisfactory and rewarding.
