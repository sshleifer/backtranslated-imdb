One of the better Vance films manages more through interesting plot and artful directing by none other than Michael Curtiz. This time, a hated financier is hit dead in the head - in his locked and locked upstairs bedroom. When Philo Vance learns of the situation on the way to Italy, he decides to end his holiday and try to solve what he considers a murder and what everyone else regards as suicide. William Powell is such a likable Philo Vance as you will find. He never seems to push and is always very smooth in what he says and does. Powell is supported by a number of very talented actors - some first-rate character actors and actresses like Mary Astor as a niece who hated her uncle, Ralph Morgan as a dead man's secretary, Paul Cavanaugh as a rival dog breeder, Arthur Hohl as a Hassler. Helen Vinson remained a mysterious butler as a neighbor blond, and two really good performances of James Lee as a Chinese cook and the skilful Eugene Palette as a clever policewoman. Add to the mix a wonderfully comedic twist by Etienne Girardot, as a public investigating judge who always misses his meal. It is this depth of suspects and a story that has many twists and turns that make the Kennel Murder Case a fast-moving, entertaining mystery.
