This is a great Disney movie. It's the story of an aging high school baseball coach (Dennis Quaid) who was a pitcher on the way to the big leagues, but suffered a career that hurt him. Morris (Quaid) is playing with a major league Team tested and even makes the rank. This is a great family movie. He is inspirational, but not too fat. He is fun and entertaining. Viewers will enjoy this movie as well as kids.it is based on a true story, though I am sure that the filmmakers have taken some liberty in telling the story. Quaid is sensational as a title character and can enjoy very convincing, do not keep looking. 9.10
