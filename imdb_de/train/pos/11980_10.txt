Full House was and is still a great show. It's a good show for people of all ages and also a good family show. There are really no more shows. The kids are very cute and though it's a bit cheesy it's still good, especially for those who saw it as a kid. I would love if the cast was interviewed now. Anyone who wants to see interviews with the performers, a kind of "where are they now for the peculiarities of the DVD," should petition for a petition entitled "Full House Reunion" on the Petition Spot website on DVD Hope the performers want to do this. Yay for Full House!
