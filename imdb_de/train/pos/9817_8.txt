I remember this movie. Pretty intense for an 11-year-old. Good editing, I felt terrible for St. Bernard. I'd look at it again if it was sent again, but the signal passes Pluto as I write this. Robert Culp. A highlight of his career. I'm just glad I did not live in this neighborhood. Oh these 70s. What a decade. If they did it again, it would be very violent and bloody. So, what are you waiting for? An outstanding movie for pre-pubescent suburban boys. It was very intense. I think it was filmed in Los Angeles. Certainly not done in Lodi NJ. The setting with the St. Bernard was the best and obviously the most intense picture from the movie ... and then they left the carcass on the stairs. Lazy children.
