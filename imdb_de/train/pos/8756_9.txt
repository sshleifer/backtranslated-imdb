I accidentally caught this movie on cable in the middle and had to rent it to see the entirety, and I'm glad I did that. I was immediately drawn to the story and took care of the girls involved. Naive high school graduates, best friends since childhood, go on a high school trip and are picked up by a scammer named Nick, who causes them serious trouble. They are used as victims in a heroin smuggling ring. The custodian girls learn to cope with their imprisonment while trying to find a way out of their difficulties. Anything they try to help themselves is inadequate when the Thai criminal justice system is flawed and the girls are in more trouble losing the confidence of their American lawyer Yankee Hank. Hank abandons her attempt to defend her after feeling cheated by Alice (Claire Dane). The Hank Thai native, however, smells a rat in the case and carries out further investigations, noting that the girls were indeed victims. The end of the film, when Alice did a selfless act to save Darlene (Beckinsale), had dissolved into tears. I really enjoyed this movie and I can recommend it.
