This dark comedy with a light touch takes place in a bourgeois neighborhood in the imaginary city of Willard in the 1950s with American obsessions such as gun-mania and violence, materialism and jealousy with the Joneses, fear of others, slavery, golf, and the elimination of the dead , Yeah, that sounds a bit heavy, but trust me, it's almost as light as a feather. <br /> <br /> Zombies are prominently among the characters. Key questions arise: who will become a zombie (90% of Willard people choose this last path, while only 10% prefer a traditional funeral)? Who owns how many zombies who like robots bid (they have become a sign of social status)? And what is the range of possible relationships that can be determined between the living and the reincarnated dead? <br /> <br /> Somehow director Andrew Currie, who also co-wrote the animated script (starring Robert Chomiak and Dennis Heaton), licks this unlikely material for an hour and a half, without making one too boring laugh well. A great cast will help: Carrie-Anne Moss, Billy Connolly, Dylan Baker, Henry Czerny, Tim Blake Nelson, Mary Black and Sonja Bennett are in charge, supported by the young K'Sun Ray as Timmy, the innocent child with a good heart as a fair witness to all the madness of adults. (Having only seen her in "Memento" and "The Matrix", I had no idea that Ms. Moss had such good comedians.) <br /> <br /> The design and music of the production are exquisite 50's , Maybe this is not something for everyone. For my annual Bizarro Prize, it will certainly be a tough one to beat. But intelligent comedies, which remain funny from start to finish, are among the hardest successes in filmmaking. For me, "Fido" is a shout! My grades: 8.5 / 10 (A-) (Seen on 30.01.07)
