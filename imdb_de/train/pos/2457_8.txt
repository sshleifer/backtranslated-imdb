If you are in a bleak or depressed mood, watch this movie. It shows a lot of beauty and joy in a very simple everyday life and is very encouraging, especially from a feminist and humanistic point of view. If you know both the Turkish and the Danish language or in German language, watch the movie in any case. Half of the dialogue is Danish in the original, in the translated version dubbed with German, the other half subtitled in Turkish, Danish or German. When I saw it in Mannheim, the reaction of the Turkish-speaking audience showed that there must be a lot of humor in the Turkish dialogue, which unfortunately escaped me for the most part and is only reproduced incompletely in the subtitles. Nevertheless, the film is interesting, even if you lack the Turkish knowledge. <br /> <br /> Aesthetically, the film plays a lot with speed and slowness. At first glance, there are a lot of physical movements that are lightning fast and make a fast, excited movie. Although this is a kung fu movie, you should pay special attention to the ongoing scenes and express a wealth of emotions. But there are also some very slow, emotionally intense scenes. And above all, the characters develop much more slowly than one would expect from a drama about growing up; Nevertheless, there is some movement in the characters: Watch closely the villain Omar, whose role and acting I like very much. <br /> <br /> The contrast between speed and silence contributes well to the depiction of human anger and dignity - represented at the same time in the same signs.
