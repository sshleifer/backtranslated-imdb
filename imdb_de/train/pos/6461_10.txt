At first I was completely taken aback by the initial lyricism of the film, and then I was completely fascinated by the unfolding story and fascinated by the brilliant directing. The characters were all fully developed, not larger than life, but just like the people we live in, all over the world, in Sweden, in Turkey or in America, all absolutely believable people with weaknesses and nobility. Hollywood could learn so much about this beautiful movie. It shows that it is not necessary to go into every detail behind every action to make the whole subject clear and bright. This shows the brilliance of the director! Many thanks to Kay Pollak and the wonderful cast for this great pleasure !!
