Acting - fantastic. The story is incredible. The script is wonderful. <br /> <br /> Just a few ways to describe this movie. Yes, it's slow and it's mostly talked about, but the whole story of her whole life, and how the inside and outside flashbacks are told, lets you hear everything to learn more about this haunting and tragic story. I myself am reading the book from which the film is taken, and it has shed more light on this story and answered some questions that have remained unanswered in the film. I should also read the Exectioner's song, which is the other half of the Gilmore story. This movie made me think so much about the phrase "piercing the other side of the mirror". The film features a song called Gary Gilmore's Eyes, written by a punk band that wrote a song about what it would be like to have Gary Gilmore's eyes (which was one of the things Gary had given as a transplant after his death) ). And if you listen to this after Mikal saw Gary for the last time, consider the situation slightly differently if you had only the song itself here. This movie opened my eyes this way and in many others. I highly recommend this movie (and the book).
