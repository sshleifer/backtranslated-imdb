Meanwhile, federal agent Jack Bauer has returned to his family in Los Angeles and has problems at home with his teenage daughter Kimberly, who accuses her mother Teri of taking Jack out of the house. Teri and Jack decide to have a serious conversation with Kim, and they discover that the girl has run home. In an attempt to solve his inner problem, Jack will be joined by his colleague Nina Myers for a meeting with their chief Richard Walsh, who reveals a threat to the life of Senator David Palmer, who runs for the president and their relatives Counter terrorist unit called must find the shooter. Later, Walsh conducts a private conversation with Jack, telling her that the agency is plotting against David Palmer and ordering Jack to find the conspirators. When an airplane explodes over the Mojave Desert, Jack has to deal with another problem. <br /> <br /> The first episode of "24" is a promising start to a successful series featuring Jack Bauer. This is the first time I have seen this show, and I admit I liked what I saw: a complex and dramatic story with multiple and realistic characters. Kiefer Sutherland is perfect in the role of a family man and a reliable agent, who simultaneously manages three difficult missions: finding a killer to protect an important politician; find a traitor in his agency; and find his teenage daughter who is in trouble while trying to save his marriage. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "12:00"
