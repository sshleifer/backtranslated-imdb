It's great to see Jorja Fox in a role where she has to smile a lot. Also loved to hear her sing. It's a nice change to see them from their CSI / West Wing / ER roles. The film itself was entertaining, but in many parts seemed to skip some explanations. Some of the characters seemed to be unhappy and happy in the next one minute, and it was up to your imagination to figure out the reason. However, each character was strange and in some cases I could not wait to see what he would do next, or hear what he would say next. This movie was not full of sparkling, clean people, but rather complicated, realistic people who could make mistakes, feel bad, and then find a way to repair them.
