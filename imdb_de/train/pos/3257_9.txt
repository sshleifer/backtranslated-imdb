I have just watched this movie on TV for the second time. It's lovely, warm, sentimental, very, very romantic. I have rarely seen actors who, through their movements and gestures, are better able to show love for another - Cyb Shepherd, Ryan O'Neal, Robert Downey, Jr. and especially Mary Stuart Masterson just outdo each other. Masterson probably has the most difficult role and is just adorable. <br /> <br /> The film follows in the footsteps of both romantic films such as "While You Slept", "When Harry Met Sally, Sleepless in Seattle" and the "High Gimmick" movies like Big, Back to the Future. Peggy Sue is married. I hate to say this because this cast was great and I would never change one of them - but I think it did not work as well as the films mentioned above, because the box office boxing just does not work that well was Meg Ryan, Tom Hanks, Michael J. Fox and Kathleen Turner at the time the film was made. <br /> <br /> It's not written very well - the lines of the characters, for example, are not particularly memorable. It is perfect, though. <br /> <br /> The romantic longings are truly tangible, the "feeling" of the lover is exquisitely conveyed, the timelessness of love and its sweeping momentum, the sense of loss and the desire to regain that connection are so touching , Again and again you will feel moved. In fact, a comparable movie Made in Heaven - the same romantic yearning. <br /> <br /> See this - it's lovely.
