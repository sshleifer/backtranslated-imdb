Of all the football films I've seen, this is one of the top two. The other is fever. But Hero is the biggest World Cup ever and probably the best player ever to play in a World Cup, Diego Maradona. This story is mainly about him, but also about the other giants of the game. <br /> <br /> The music score is evocative and the pictures are powerful. The narrative by Michael Caine is appropriately unbiased and also calmly dramatic. This story is not about the individual World Cup games. It is more about the emotions of the players and the beauty of the event itself. Exciting games like France v Brazil (one of the biggest games of all time) were treated the same way. The last game between Argentina and W Germany also went in the same direction. highly recommended. A classic of world football. Always being watched, especially if you are a Maradona fan.
