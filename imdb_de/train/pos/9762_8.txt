This is a very strange film by director / animator Richard Williams. Everyone who knows of Wilhelm's work knows that it is a bit outlandish (if not awesome), but he takes the cake with him. <br /> <br /> Two unfortunate ragdolls who have to save their owner's new French doll from a lusty life. Pirate toy and are on the way some bizarre characters at the mercy. The strength of this film lies above all in its aesthetic quality. the strange character designs, the powerful animation and the strong contrast to the sweet and uncanny. In Williams' brilliant animation, Raggedy Ann and Andy were portrayed as real rag dolls that were not flared like in simple cartoon versions of the dolls, making them more believable (at least visually). The animation shines on us bringing the camel with the wrinkled knees whose body goes with two different personalities controlling each end, the silent movie hunt with Sir Leonard Looney and of course the greedy <br /> The greedy animation alone may be the most exquisite psychedelic animation that I have ever seen. There's something about this animation that makes your chin fall - and every second is something new. The Greedy lives in an area known as "The Taffy Pit" and is a massive blob man who lives in candy and eats mercilessly. He sings a song that I can not help but remember a few sexual undertones, and then tries to kill Raggedy Ann for her heart. <br /> <br /> The only complaint I have about this movie is that there are too many songs. The tempo of the movie is constantly shutting down as there are sixteen of them. There are about six good songs (which should have been the only ones), including "I look and what do I see?", "No Girl's Toy", "Blue" (though they did not force him to sing it twice) , "I'll never get enough", "Because I love you" and maybe "I'm home". The others just seem to be unnecessary and are obviously not great to listen to. <br /> <br /> This is a funny movie with strange undertones, but if you search for it, you will not find a better one.
