I really love this movie, I saw it again last week after about three years. This movie is perfect, great acting, great story, great direction / camerawork / music. It's a gift to show it to someone you love. pity that jaco van dormael did not shoot after this movie. Top 5 work. Really !! <br /> <br /> Today it is 3 years and 3 days later the comment above. It was never published because it was not more than 10 lines. Anyway, yesterday I saw "le huitieme jour" again. This is undoubtedly Top 3 in my film, along with "Cinema Paradiso," which is also a masterpiece. The soundtrack is really good too. I am really curious about the new movie "jaco von dormael". I hope it will complete my movie as top 3. If you see this movie, you can rent it. Or even better. Buy it. Because you want to see it again.
