This film had a great ensemble of adult actors and a group of young actors who will be seen in the cinema for a long time, if there is justice. The direction and editing was great. I can look up the book from which this was adapted, it must have been great. (I liked it.) Sigourney Weaver, Jon Voight and Tim Blake Nelson were a blast! Henry Winkler and Nathan Davis were not seen enough, but they were fun when they were on the screen. The kids in the camp could not have been better. (as I said, I liked it!)
