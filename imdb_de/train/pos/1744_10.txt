Many years ago, many major studios advertised motion picture series that were shown in cinemas among the latest features, along with a newsreel of current events and cartoons, especially on a Saturday afternoon. (The parents loved it most of the time) "The Return of Chandu" was a series of 12 episodes in which Chandu ("Bela Lugosi"), "The Mysterious Mr. Wong", 34, is a magician with extremely natural powers and on the Island Lemuria travels to rescue the kidnapped Princess of Egypt, (Nadji) Maria Alba, "Dr. Terror House of Horrors," '43. Princess Nadji is being held captive by the black magic cult of Ubasti, who believes she is a reincarnation of her long-dead goddess Ossana. These 12-episode series take you back in time and are very well produced, considering we're talking about 1934!
