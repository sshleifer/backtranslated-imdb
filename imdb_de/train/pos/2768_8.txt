Apart from Susan Hayward's wooden delivery in this film, he was as good as any biblical film. Henry King treats this film in all minor scenes with respect for an epic, and Peck is, as always, impeccable. The rousing Alfred Newman Soundscore with the rousing twenty-third Psalm is unforgettable even after these many years. The scene with Goliath is a bit absurd, but not too bad for the time this movie was made. This also applies to the smaller Bible epics of the day, "The Song of Ruth" and "Esther and the King". It is worth seeing, and Raymond Massy is honored as Prophet Nathan. The film is rounded off by the ever-good James Robertson Justice as Abishai and Jayne Meadows as Michol, David's alienated first wife.
