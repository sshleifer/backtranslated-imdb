The best-selling horror writer Cheryl (a solid and likeable performance by the beautiful Virginia Bryant), her husband Tom (the sympathetic Paolo Serra) and her son Bobby (nicely played by Patrizio Vinci) go to a secluded castle on the country summer vacation. The local legend claims that the area is cursed. Cheryl discovers a creepy, hairy, evil ogre (wearing David Flosi in a strikingly hideous costume) who lives in the basement. Cheryl must overcome her deep-seated fear of the beast so she can defeat the sickening find. The director / co-author Lamberto Bava is an expert in creating and maintaining an eerie and irritating nightmare mood. In addition, Bava renounces the usual blood'n'guts routine to create a compelling and provocative dark, fairy-tale fairy-tale fable that states that the best way to overcome what is terrifying us is towards the Source has stood. Strong side curves of Sabrina Ferilli as a friendly school teacher Anna, Stefania Montorsi as a babysitter Maria and Alex Serra as a bizarre painter Dario. The brilliant cinematography of Gianfranco Transunto provides some fluid tracking and plenty of atmospheric light. Fabrizio Sforza's slight make-up f / x, Simon Boswell's gorgeous spirited Spooky'n'Huddery score, and the damp, dark, cobwebbed cellar set all struck the heavenly creeping spot. It is worth seeing.
