I really liked this movie because it's a true story in the Amazon, a part of the world that has always intrigued me. I believe a condensed version of the book was published shortly after the actual event in Reader's Digest. <br /> <br /> Because I'm a "baby boomer," the character and the actress are my contemporaries, and for that reason, I've referred to the movie. I also believe that the film is valuable for providing survival skills as the viewer observes the character following the rivers that lead to the river and coastal settlements where it can receive help, as well as other survival techniques. Most important was her willingness to survive and a positive attitude. Finally, I hope the audience learns something and sees it as entertainment. <br /> <br /> I wish the film would appear in VHS and DVD as soon as I want to add it to my video collection. It should also be shown more frequently on the satellite channels.
