Since I'm always looking for something new and unique, I've seen this movie online. I thought it would be just another "B" movie, but I was amazed at the acting of the two main characters. All the actors in this movie were very capable and well-directed. The plot was wonderful and unique, with an excellent moral for the story. <br /> <br /> This movie is definitely not for someone looking for a sex trump, "Stupid and Dumber" or Blood and Courage. This is a wonderfully poignant film that reveals some dark realities of life, coupled with the kindness of the human heart and just enough frivolity to keep it interesting. I've even seen a large number of high box office takings. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie.
