I wish children's films were still made that way; dark and deep. There was (get this) character development (and Charlie is the epitome of dynamic character), plot development, great animation, emotional involvement, and a rational, relative, and consistent theme. Without the handful of song-and-dance routines, you would never have thought it was a children's movie. That's why I rate him so high. This movie is an excellent movie, let alone a children's movie. Which brings me to my second point: this is the darkest "kids" movie I've seen in quite a while, dating back to a 22-year-old. I would be shocked to see that every child under the age of eight in the second half and in the first half of the movie was not completely scared, and it ends with one of the saddest endings you could ever meet (ala "Jurassic Bark", for) those of you who are "Futurama" fans) and that makes this movie so good. Just because the film generally creates feelings that we do not usually like to feel and assume that they are bad, does not make the movie itself bad. In fact, it means that it has succeeded. Good funny movies should make us laugh; good horror films should scare us; Good sad movies should make us sad. My point is, good movies should keep you moving, not just entertaining; This movie has moved me. <br /> <br /> Also, this film is incredibly violent by today's standards for a children's film and contains topics that are not suitable for some children by today's standards. Parents, I would say, see first. I'm not usually one who says anything about these kinds of things, but I saw it yesterday and it even came as a surprise to me.
