After a cold sex scene between Andy and Gina in South America, we know that Andy is a payroll accountant in a difficult economic situation where he desperately needs extra money. We also find that he stole from his job and used the money for his drug habits? He also tries to keep up with his wife, who may just have an affair? <br /> <br /> In order to solve all her problems, he persuades his brother - a sympathetic loser - to join him in order to steal the small shop of his own parents. Her parents are happily married and own a jewelry store in New York's Westchester County. Sixty thousand dollars are all you need to save your life from desperation? <br /> <br /> Three main characters are important in this movie. <br /> <br /> First the two brothers? Each of them is a complex individual that is threatened with multiple motives and sinks into doubt and disappointment. The two are desperate characters, financially and emotionally. Andy is selfish. He has the feeling that he never had the love of his father? He is the ruinous influence of making his brother an aggressor and his beautiful wife an adulteress? <br /> <br /> Hank is a puppet too weak to resist his brother's wishes. His ex-wife is one of the reasons he needs money because he owes her hundreds in child support. He longs to regain the trust he once had in his father? <br /> <br /> The third character is her tired and sullen father Charles Hanson (Albert Finney), especially in the haunting climactic scenes of the movie and thus the entertainment ... The power of Tomei conveys great depth and emotion, even with her look, her touch, her special pull. <br /> <br /> Lumet's direction is firm, fresh and brutal.
