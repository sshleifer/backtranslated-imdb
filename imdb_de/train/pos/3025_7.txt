Bacall is doing well - especially considering that this is just her 2nd movie. This is often overshadowed because it lies between two great successes: "Having and Not Having" (1944) and "The Big Sleep" (1945), which they both mated with Humphrey Bogart. Granted, this is not up to the other films, but I think it's not your own fault. I think it was a misunderstanding when she was a British lady-in-waiting. No accent. I think that all the strange accents were distracted - Boyer was certainly not a Spaniard. It was hard to tell which country the people came from. <br /> <br /> I really liked the black and white camera. Mood is used to making a big impact - I especially liked the fog scene. The lighting also contributes very well to increase the intrigue and tension. <br /> <br /> Bacall is just great. Boyer just does not fit into the romantic lead role for me - so he and Bacall were a bit strange together. No great chemistry - and certainly no Bogie and Bacall magic. But I still liked this picture very much. There is a lot of tension and things are going well enough. I have to say, I found the murder of the little girl rather bold for this historical film. Katina Paxinou and Peter Lorre stand out as a side cast. Paxinou as a hotelier is absolutely malicious and evil in her portrayal. Her only scene in which she laughs madly as Mr. Muckerji, after exposing her as the child's murderer, is quite disturbing. Lorre is also pretty good in his slimy, snake-like depiction of Conteras - a sloppy coward right up to the end. Wanda Bendrix also plays the kid Else quite well - especially considering that this was her first picture and she was only 16 at the time (though she looks much younger). It turned out that she later married Auie Murphy, which proved to be a short-lived, stormy marriage.
