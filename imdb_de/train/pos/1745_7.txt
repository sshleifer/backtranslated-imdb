How friendly, charming and welcoming is this unpretentious old series; I was happy to see old Lugosi. It is disarmingly friendly and lively. It is the document of a long-lost craft. (Today's best TV show can barely compete with those old moderately good series.) CHANDU is deeply optimistic and hedonistic. It refreshes the mind. It is not stupid. stupid are those who do not understand the conditions under which such series work. CHANDU has an irresistible feeling of simple, unpretentious and friendly fun. <br /> <br /> Without betraying too much? Chandu is an Occidental wizard who also goes by this Eastern name and loves his niece and protects Sect of Killers. <br /> <br /> Chandu exerts his supernatural gifts in a more discreet and moderate way. <br /> <br /> As for the rather sexy niece Nadji, she is abducted by the priest of Ubasti: the filthy Vindhyan. The poor sexy girl is actually abducted several times in a sarcophagus after falling asleep with a flower; almost kidnapped by a boat; from a fake policeman; The Temple of Lemuria and its strange, spooky ceremonies resemble the KING KONG images and are a barbaric mockery of RCC ceremonies and rituals. <br /> <br /> Would you protect a girl as bravely as Chandu? <br /> <br /> Lugosi looked like an old libidinous and rather heartless, mean drunk, and this only added to his performances. He is the prototypical, drunken uncle, mischievous, cunning and slanted. That may sound like a rather crooked homage to Lugosi? But Burton's Biopics of Wood left me with this impression of Lugosi, and it allies in strong sympathy for the decrepit actor. I like the fantastic ideas of Lugosi. <br /> <br /> This series is wrongly beaten.
