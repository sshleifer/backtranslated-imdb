This is widely regarded in Australia as one of the best police dramas ever produced here ... and for my money everywhere. The characters are real, the characters are real, the situations are believable and do not shy away from the dark side of life, which is daily confronted by police and criminals, victims, lawyers and other people on their various paths. > <br /> This show ran for two seasons and was discontinued because the overseas show did not sell well. We all apologize for the loss. However, like Fawlty Towers, we can credit this as a limited-length series of consistently high quality.
