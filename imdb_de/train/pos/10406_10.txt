Abu, THE thief of Baghdad, helps King Ahmed regain his kingdom from a wicked magician. When Europe went to war and much of the world was in flames, the London Films by Sir Alexander Korda revealed this wasteful escape from the legends of The Arabian Nights. Crammed with swords and magic, in 1940 the audience had a short break from the headlines. It's also a fine piece of film that includes good acting and a smart script. Conrad Veidt receives a top-notch bounty earned by playing the evil magician Jaffar. His Saturnine face, with his penetrating eyes, is reminiscent of the macabre roles he loved playing on Silent Days. Here is a villain worthy of being seen. As the young robber Sabu is perfectly occupied in his third movie. Although he is not a hero in the typical sense of the word, his character is certainly heroic in action. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast is doing a good job. John Justin is both energetic and empathetic as the unenlightened king who has to learn the realities of life the hard way. Sabu gets a significant part of the action (if not turned into a dog), but Justin is sporty when needed. The charming June Duprez plays the endangered Princess of Basra, coveted by two very different men. The mature Rex Ingram, who appears late in the film, shakes things up like a ghost with an attitude. <br /> <br /> Allan Jeayes uses his fine voice as a storyteller. Miles Malleson gets another eccentric role than the childlike Sultan of Basra, who is constantly busy with his mechanical toys (Malleson was also responsible for the film's script and dialogue). Old Morton Rare portrays the Benevolent King of Legend. Mary Morris, later an extraordinary stage actress, plays the dual role of Jaffar's accomplices and the six-armed Silver Dancer. <br /> <br /> The film was started in the UK, but the difficulties of the war brought Korda to Southern California. which probably explains the presence of American Ingram in the cast. The art direction in lively technicolor is the most attractive, especially the fairy tale architecture in blue, white and pink. <br /> <br /> ****************** ******* <br /> <br /> Sabu Dastagir, born in 1924, was born in the Maharaja of Mysore was taken to the stable when he was discovered by Korda's company and put in front of the cameras. His first four films (ELEPHANT BOY-1937, THE DRUM-1938, THE THIEF OF BAGDAD-1940, JUNGLE BOOK-1942) were his best and he found himself after his completion in Hollywood again. After his excellent military service in the Second World War, he continued his film career, but was incarcerated endlessly for years in ethnic roles in undifferentiated small films, with BLACK NARCISSUS (1947) was the only exception. His last film, Walt Disney's A TIGER WALKS (1964), was an improvement, but it was too late. Sabu died of a heart attack in late 1963, only 39 years old.
