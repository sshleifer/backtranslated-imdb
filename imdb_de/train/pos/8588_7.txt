It might not be the best movie of the year 2006, but it was just a movie to rejoice and think about. The Sentinel is a good political thriller movie that resembles some elements from other political thriller films like In the Line or even Borgt of Fire and the Manchurian candidate. The basic plot of this film is similar to other films like this one: a conspiracy to kill the President of the United States. Michael Douglas acts as secret service agent Pete Garrison, who leads the operation to later find out that he has been framed. Kiefer Sutherland is a kind of rival named David Breckinridge and Eva Longoria as Jill Marin, who is a rookie agent led by Agent Breckinridge and Oscar winner Kim Basinger as First Lady Sarah Ballentine. An improvement for this film could have been more action, as it is referred to by some sources as an action movie like a thriller movie. A good thing about this film, however, is just a murder plan to kill the US president concerns a mole (traitor) in the secret service, who leads the president in the wrong direction.
