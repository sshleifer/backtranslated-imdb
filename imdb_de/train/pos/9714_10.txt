What do you get when you cross The Matrix with The Truman Show? <br /> <br /> I'm sure you've seen The Matrix by now. The creators of The Matrix say it's "anime inspired". Only from the trailer to this classic you can see where the action was taken. <br /> <br /> The movie is shot in Japan in the 1980s and really shows it. The costumes, the music, and the words (in the current English version of AD Vision) are all as if they were taken straight out of the era. I think it was made during this time, but due to certain action points, the film does not date! <br /> <br /> As you may have guessed from my reference to The Matrix, the world is not real. It's not really the eighties. In fact, it is more like the 2480s. After a nuclear war, the earth's ecosystem (or "biosphere prime") was destroyed. The survivors must flee to space, where the conflict continued. Once the planets (or "biospheres") were abandoned, people lived in megacons - cities in spaceships where, through hypnotism techniques and Truman-show-like illusions, they believed they were on Earth, in the most peaceful time of all Time ... The 1980s. When the young Shogo gets a mysterious, progressive-looking bike, he leads to learn more than he should know ... The Garland (a bike that becomes a 'Mech), a 2400's weapon, helps Shogo with his Escape from the pursuit military. As more and more is discovered about the Megazone, the war is approaching the homeland and due to conflicts between the military and the computer, the war is also coming to the megacity ... I apologize if these points are considered as spoilers plot essentially becomes outlined this way. <br /> <br /> Emotions are big in this movie, more than The Matrix. They really believe the war is taking place, and Shogo is really scared of what he's discovering. What starts as an overjoyed cool 80's movie becomes a tragic story of war and unreality. These characters are real people, not the pieces of cardboard we saw in Matrix in Matrix. There is a real feeling that people can suffer after being involved in such a conspiracy and a war. It can just suffocate you to the end ... I know it made me. <br /> <br /> The animation is quite impressive for the day and the picture quality on the ADVision DVD is unbelievable for its age. The artwork style is beautiful and reminiscent of traditional anime, very cultural. Be prepared for a lot of violence and blood, there is also an erotic sex scene. <br /> <br /> The end may look like "There can be no end," similar to the Matrix, or, supposedly, look like. The sequel follows, which I have not seen yet. <br /> <br /> I have to say that this is one of the best animes I have ever seen, in fact one of the best films I have seen and considered by many to be one of the greatest anime ever. <br /> <br /> I need to recommend the ADVision DVD, as its English language setting is incredible and the movie does justice, and can be purchased with an artbox to hold the two sequels when they are released who have the same voice. All in all, MegaZone 23 is an incredible movie that deserves to be held high and should be indispensable in any anime fan collection. Heck, my mother enjoyed it too.
