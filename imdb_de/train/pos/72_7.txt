I first saw this movie from 1954 with Vincent Price on Turner Classic Movies. Price portrays Don Gallico, a sorcerer / inventor driven to murder when his boss steals several of his magical inventions (as well as his wife, portrayed in a short role by Eva Gabor). Although Price is a murderer, I've actually rooted for him, he's a sympathetic figure driven by the greedy people around him who use him over and over again. <br /> <br /> Although this movie does not matter. He has the "horror" factor of some of his more famous roles (like my favorite role, "House of Wax"). Nevertheless, he has enough to offer to keep the interest of the audience. <br /> <br /> This is a must for Vincent Price fans.
