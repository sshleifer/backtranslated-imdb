Another example of the unique talents of Cary Grant. A performance that earned an Oscar and was again avoided by the Academy. In this wonderful comedy about a man who decides to leave the big city, Mr. Grant draws the scale from stupid to tender. The pitfalls of building a house are well documented and became (loosely) the basis for the more modern Tom Hanks vehicle "The Money Pit". This film is an absolute must.
