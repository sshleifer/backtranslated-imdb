I think that this film is a rare treasure. It's not just the beginning of Shirley Temple's career, but also a rare look at how our society has changed. You have to understand that certain things we would consider sexual today would be considered innocent at the time. For example, the parents of the children in the movie, as well as the many parents who took their children to watch this movie, saw that these were just children who imitate adults. Most people do not think of someone who considers children sexually attractive, except teenage boys who crave girls. It was not sexual for her. That was before we had Internet, TV, etc. Most sex crimes were not openly raised. Occasionally there was a whisper about the boy with the "funny uncle". But that was often all that came of it. Yes, very sad. But today it is kind of sad, because I too can see this movie as something other than intended, innocent and funny. When I saw Shirley dancing like this and the guys were poking her in the eye, I felt disturbed. I have to remember the time when this happened! These kids did not know what sex was. The parents knew that, both the children of the film and the audience. The thought may not even have come to her mind. In the eyes of an average adult, this was no sex at the time than when Shirley House was playing. Even today, children participate in a beauty contest, many are dressed very mature for a three-year-old. The child is only doing so. I do not blame the child because I wanted to behave like an adult. Or the old movies that show this. To be honest, our media has made a lot of things appear that were sick and wrong at the time. This can sometimes be the best. But I really think that this movie is not one of them. It rarely looks like an innocent mentality that we have long lost.
