When I found out for the first time that Brian Krause was going to star in this movie, I wanted to see. It took me weeks to realize that I had seen the original and loved it. So I had more reason to watch. Well, I watched. It was actually better than most TV movie installments. I hate what happens to Brian's character (which you can figure out for yourself) and I did not like most of the characters, including Brian's. But the movie needed the cheesy, annoying and jerky characters to make Stanley Caldwell (Judd Nelson) shine again. In the end, I cheered for Stanley and his own happy ending. If you liked the original Cabin by the Lake, or if you like horror movies without blood, I'd suggest you take a look.
