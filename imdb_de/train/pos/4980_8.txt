When surfing the internet for previous retail prices I came across these comments. Why are they all so serious? It's just a movie and not pornographic. I bought this short 30 years ago from my parents and was always very enthusiastic. I have shown it to many of my friends and everyone loved it too. I feel privileged to own this 1932 original Shleley 832 black silent movie before it became popular or well-known. After reading the other comments, I agree that the movie is "racy." Big thing! I just wish it was longer. It seems that I need to be the only person who has at least one of these originals for sale. I wonder how much it's worth.
