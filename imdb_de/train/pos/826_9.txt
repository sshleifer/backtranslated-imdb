I'm sick of people complaining about Ewoks! They may not be the best thing Star Wars ever did, but they did NOT happen, so get on with it! Besides, they are cute and I do not care if they are marketable. Yubb Nubb! <br /> <br /> This movie always leaves me in tears. It's perfect. The end could not be better. I'm looking forward to The Phantom Menace, because suddenly the whole story is moved from Luke to Anakin. I love how it will be revealed in the end - it would be too unresolved in any other way. Those of you who complain that Vader's helmet has been removed take a moment to think about it. It is very effective. Vader, the man who hid behind a mask for 20 years, is finally revealed as a sick-looking man. He is not completely mechanical - he is vulnerable. <br /> <br /> I do not know how the casting director happened to pick such good actors in A New Hope. They all do it so well. They are credible characters. Hamill performs outstanding work with his dramatic character development. Fisher does a good job as a female role model (I mean, come on, she killed Jabba, even if so many others failed!). Harrison Ford - do I have to say more? <br /> <br /> The music is brilliant again. It is very touching and meaningful if you can select character themes in different parts of the movie. The best highlight is when Luke "NOOO!" and jump out to fight his father in the last battle. John Williams is nothing short of a genius! What an amazing man! <br /> <br /> Because of Episode I, the movie has so much more meaning to me. I can not wait to finally see him in the cinemas (CAN I WAIT ???) and then check out the original trilogy again. <br /> <br /> Bravo!
