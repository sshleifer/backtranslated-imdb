As a Westerner observing the perspective and tradition of another culture, I found Just Married fascinating and delightful. The idea of ​​marrying a stranger by the mutual arrangement of parents is especially difficult in this modern age. However, this is the case in this Hindi film. With humor and a fresh perspective told, we learn from Abhay and Ritika, who have met only once and are now on their traditional five-day honeymoon. As I said, it's hard to believe that in this cell phone-rich age, there is still such an archaic custom as an arranged marriage. We see the awkwardness that this young couple feels when they meet on the first night, and how they try to connect, even though they do not know each other. We see different views of marriage and engagement, as presented by the other couples on vacation, from a couple of forty years married to others and still unsure whether to commit to marriage. There are songs, funny dialogues, poignant moments, mixing and comparing new ways and traditions. If you look at the movie with subtitles, it definitely loses some of the rightness of the story, but it's still a pleasure to see it. Granted, some of the plot is a bit banal and the bus incident a little tedious and thoughtful; The overall film was worth seeing.
