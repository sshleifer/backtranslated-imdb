Among the standard action films that screen play and logic at the door, this movie is at the top of the class. If the Casting Officer had put "good" actors in the film, it would have been worse (with the exception of Richard Dawson, who did well, if you can call himself a "play"). I love this movie! The Running Man is most likely God's gift to humans (okay, maybe just men). Definitely the most clichible film of our time, so I separate you with my favorite line: "This is all part of the rich pattern of life Brenda, and you'd better get used to it." Ahh, more people were called "Brenda" to quote this movie than I can imagine.
