No message. No symbolism. No dark undercurrents. Just a wonderful mix of music, nostalgia and fun brought together by people who obviously had a great time. It is a refreshing antidote to the presumptuous garbage that is disposed of by the studios. Of course EVERYTHING with the incomparable Judi Dench is worth seeing. And Cleo Laine's brilliant jazz vocals are a bonus. This lady is in the same league as the late Ella. This is on my film shelf and is pulled out again and again when I feel the need for a warm experience and a warm, good-natured giggle. Just a wonderful movie!
