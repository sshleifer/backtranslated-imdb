This may not be one of the best movies ever made, but overall, it's a very pleasant, light-hearted foam that everyone can enjoy. Highly recommended for the feel-good factor alone. OK, Frank Sinatra's "drama" leaves a lot to be desired, but his vocals are a great release, and the songs fit perfectly with the romantic atmosphere of the movie. Sinatra made many more films that showed his undisputed acting ability, but in that regard his first step into Hollywood is his voice, not his acting, his main contribution to the film. I just saw it on TV again and it still sets my mood the same as the first time I saw it for the first time many years ago.
