I have to say it's been a long time since I saw it, but I've seen it five or more times. a wonderful little bustle that was clearly inspired by the musical / comic pairings of new or fading stars with celebrity music groups. The secrets of Kay Kyser would be a good example. <br /> <br /> It's the best part of the show that unleashes Spike Jones as he and his band play many pieces and are part of the action and do their job well support. Hugh O'Brien plays the face, Buddy Hackett the rumor that Lou Costello was offered and thus Abbott and Costello replace the leads. I do not know if that's true. All in all, a pleasant movie, but important to have so much Spike Jones and his band in the movie's story. I wish it was released because I have not seen or heard it for two decades. I hope it is not lost
