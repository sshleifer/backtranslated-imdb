Halloween is one of the best examples of independent film. It is very well done and has more psychological elements than you might realize at first glance. It is a simple movie that is very well told. The music is perfect and one of the haunting scores ... If you have not seen this movie yet, you need to watch it. The cast is great. I wish they had never done episode after episode. The first was by far the best and should have ended without a sequel. It was fun to see Jamie Lee Curtis in the movie. She does not seem to age (she is just as beautiful today, with no hair and clothes of the 70s). The scenes through the mask are one of the scariest things ever!
