Considering that it was done on a low budget, THE DAY TIME ENDED manages to make the most of its budget with amazingly good special effects. <br /> <br /> The story involves a family just pulling into their solar energy Powered in a remote part of the Mojave Desert in southwest California just to find it - of motorcycle vandals, they mean , Her youngest daughter (Natasha Ryan), however, has begun to see mysterious things - a green pyramid, strange humanoid figures, etc. Lately, the light of a triangular starburst has created extremely unusual auroras in the desert skies. So the family, led by Jim Davis and Dorothy Malone, faces foreign alien forces that have put them into a time-and-space warp. <br /> <br /> Mix elements from 2001: Despite the apparent flaws and uneven spectacle, a third-generation ODYSSEY and CLOSE FRAMEWORK DAY TIME ENDED is interesting due to the outstanding special effect work of David Allen. The desert landscape is very well suited for the encounter of this film. And although the film is not really comparable to Kubrick or Spielberg's films, THE DAY TIME ENDED is much better than many other 2001 / CLOSE ENCOUNTERS knock-offs. I'm giving director John 'Bud' Cardos, who created an interesting predecessor to ARACHNOPHOBIA in 1977 with the thriller KINGDOM OF THE SPIDERS, at least the attempt - and on that basis I give THE DAY TIME ENDED a 7 out of 10 points.
