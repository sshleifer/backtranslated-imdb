<br /> <br /> First, I have to say that I own Jake Speed. I have seen it at least 10 times. This movie is one of the funniest movies ever made. The movie begins with Margaret (Karen Kopins) trying to find her sister. Her sister was kidnapped in Paris and the family did not hear anything. Then come Jake Speed ​​(Wayne Crawford), tell her where her sister is and make an offer to find her. Jake Speed ​​is a hero. He does not work for money because he just wants to help and has a good adventure. His partner (Dennis Christopher) follows him and writes her adventures in novels. This movie is a great adventure. It's funny, it's action packed, it's just great. I think it's a cult movie with a very small cult episode. Crawford is perfect as a jake speed and throws out a one-liner you'll never forget. Kopins and Christopher are also good as girls and buddies. John Hurt, the guy whose abdomen was blown up in alien, plays the devilish, perverted fool who adds to the fun. In many ways, this movie is similar to Indiana Jones, in a way resembling James Bond films. Maybe it should have been called Indiana Bond, but whatever the title is, it's a very entertaining movie.
