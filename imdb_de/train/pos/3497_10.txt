One of those brilliant young men who went out of their way and dared to shoot a teenage love movie (can I really call it that? - would challenge the devil out of his fans) - on a small budget, but packed with so much flavor , Sensitivity and skill maturity. Peter Sollett - you deserve more admiration and respect. Thanks again for showing the powers of the "industry" that clich√©s can be flushed down the toilet. A place, a handful of rich characters, low budget, good acting (and amateurs too), decent lighting - true indie cinema supporters should see more of it and stop watching ... well ... you know what.
