I saw this movie as one of my usual times, which is really late at night. Normally, if I'm not interested in a movie, I fall asleep and have to raid the fridge to stay awake. <br /> <br /> At first I thought I had to do that since the tempo of this movie started to slow. along with the fact that his recordings tended to linger long time with the figure. But after some time, I start to dive more into the movie, as more is revealed about the main character through his storytelling. In the end, you have the feeling that you have known him all your life. The movie kept my interest so great that I did not know that the sun would just rise. Not much of Lynch's bizarre style, but there are enough bizarre characters to make the movie amusing.
