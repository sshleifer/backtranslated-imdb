I still love it about 17 years after I saw it for the first time. I actually found out that I had lost my copy and was very excited. Although there is no connection with the original (which I never noticed as a child and as an adult does not interest me), cartoons should be *. Only dark enough to be interesting and bright enough to be enjoyed by all. I'm more than happy that my parents raised me that way, rather than the cartoons we see today that teach our children nothing. The music is great and stays in your head forever ... I downloaded the entire soundtrack at some point.
