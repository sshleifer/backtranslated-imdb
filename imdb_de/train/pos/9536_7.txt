A confused and graphically bloody Japanese film about little creatures who convict people and turn them into necroborg-zombie-like machines that beat and hack each other so the winner can eat the loser. In the middle, two lovers become infected. <br /> <br /> Technically excellent horror comedy (?) Only suitable for those with strong stomachs, as blood and body parts fly. Good taste prevents me from describing what happens here, but let's say it's pretty cruel. If you definitely like this kind of multi-step thing about sleek content, watch this movie. Personally, I'm not usually the one who enjoys movies like this, except how sick and twisted they are on one level. Here I was so fascinated that I can suggest it to people who really like bloody movies. It's also a movie that has enough detail that I want to see it again now that I know what's going on. In the end, I revealed - I want to go back and see what I did not understand. There is an internal logic that is rare in these films. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10 for those who like blood and severed limbs is a zero or, more accurately, an alarm for everyone else.
