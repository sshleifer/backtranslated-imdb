I really enjoyed it - I'm a big fan of movies that get confused in your mind and ask you many questions and ideas for discussion, and this was a great example. But then Terry Gilliam is always good at it (well, almost always - let's just forget Jabberwocky and The Brothers Grimm, right?). <br /> <br /> I particularly liked the way time travel was treated and the avoidance of paradoxes - the way events in the past and in the future have been intertwined and interwoven. <br /> <br /> It was also aesthetically very well done - the art direction was really great and I wish I could have seen it on the big screen. The future scenes in many ways had a similar feeling to Brazil, and even the scenes were often visually compelling. <br /> <br /> But most strikingly, there were usually two actors Bruce Willis and Brad Pitt do not like it, and both have shown amazing performances here. Pitt in particular - I had already seen one or two movies that made me realize that he could actually act (as opposed to what I originally thought), but this one really excelled them. I actually asked my friends once, "Are you sure it's Brad Pitt?" This is probably the most memorable performance of his career (though admittedly that does not say too much).
