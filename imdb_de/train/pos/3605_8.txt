girlfight uses a familiar formula when someone mentioned it, but I've seen a lot of movies that do not do that well or that are not credible. In the end, I believe it is easier for a woman to empathize with the character and thus feel the film more touched. <br /> <br /> The film encourages both mentally and physically, even if your life and environment are totally different, and I think the viewer can still gain a lot from it. Although it took me 5 years to start boxing and sports in general, this is the movie that gave me the spark. <br /> <br /> The plot is so familiar / usual. Actors are good. But the thoughts it can ignite, in my opinion, make it above average. It made a big impression on me and I know that I'm not the only one.
