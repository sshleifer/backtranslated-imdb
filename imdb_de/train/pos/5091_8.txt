Saw both parts twice. I enjoyed the story and enjoyed seeing an older Patrick Swayze as a hero. He was very credible as hunter Alan Quartermaine and certainly surpassed the performance of Richard Chamberlain. I admit that I would have preferred to see someone as "Lady in Need". Alison Doody should stick to modern and not historical pieces. She did not have the look of the 19th century woman. The rest of the cast was great and followed the storyline very well. I am glad to see that the actors of this generation are not afraid to try on different characters and are not afraid to be older. Age is inevitable, but let's not hide from it. A guy over 50 can be a lot sexier (and Patrick is really sexy) than a green boy, no matter how pretty he is. Hoorah, so that the character lines go along with a great smile.
