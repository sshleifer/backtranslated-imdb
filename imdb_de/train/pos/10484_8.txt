Charming does not even describe Saving Grace; it is absolutely irresistible! Anyone who dares to go into this movie will go with high spirits (haha). Grace Trevethyn (Brenda Blethyn) has just lost her husband, but her problems are getting worse. Her dearest deceased left her without money and outstanding debts. Given that she has lost everything, she has to find a way to get a lot of money ... and fast! She gets an idea when her gardener Matthew (Craig Ferguson) asks the famous gardener in the city to give him advice on a plant that he secretly grows. Grace immediately notices that this plant is marijuana. Therefore, they decide to use their gardening needs to grow high-quality weeds and then sell them to pay off their outstanding debts over "Saving Grace" is his sympathy. Every character is extremely likeable and apart from the first 20 minutes, the movie is in a good mood. Everyone wants a happy ending for everyone, even if it means keeping an eye out for some quite illegal activities. <br /> <br /> The acting is first class. Brenda Blethyn is one of Britain's best actresses, and here's the reason. She turns a caricature into a fully alive and breathing person. She is a nice woman, but she is not stupid. Craig Ferguson is just as adorable as Matthew. He is a great loser, but he is so sympathetic that it does not matter. The rest of the ensemble ensemble also fits into this category, but Tcheky Karyo needs special mention. The French actor always has an aura of menace about him, and that suits him well, but he also has great comedy skills. <br /> <br /> Nigel Cole finds the perfect tone for "Saving Grace". It's about the charm. One of the problems I have with British humor is that all the energy seems to be from the movie. Not so here. The film is thoroughly sympathetic and always amusing. That does not mean that "Saving Grace" is just a sympathetic movie that will leave a smile and a good feeling. Although this film is not a thoroughly funny comedy, it has two or three scenes that are nothing short of hysterical. <br /> <br /> If there are problems with the movie, the climax is a bit confusing. The questions, however, are answered, and the end has an unexpected turn. <br /> <br /> See "Saving Grace", especially if you have a bad day.
