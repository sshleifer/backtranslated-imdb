The Devil Dog: The dog of hell is a really good movie. It has a good acting cast including Richard Crenna and R.G. Armstrong. The music is scary and gives this devilish shower! I liked the impact on the dog and I think the creature itself looked very cool with its horns, ruffles like a part of the neck and looked very tough! I have never seen The Devil Dog: Hound of Hell and can find and buy this rare movie. Then it's a good movie, and I do not think you'll be disappointed!
