I love this movie. The songs and storylines are great fun. and the song "goodbye" always moves me. What an ingenious thing to bring dolls to life in such a way that you are really interested in these fabric and fabric things. great voices and great talent. Why were all the other Muppet movies that came after this movie so much less interesting, moving and funny? is it the mr. Henson is just so much missing?
