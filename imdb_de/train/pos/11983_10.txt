This show has a great story! It is very believable! The husband of a man dies and he can not look after his children alone, so he calls his brother-in-law, his best friend, and many others come later on the show. Like Rebecca Donaldson, the lovely but strong dog Comet, Nikki and Alex, who can find out for themselves (I do not want to spoil it for you) and Kimmy Gibler! (The buddy of DJ), but the kids are also wonderful. This is Mary Kate and Ashley pulled off for the first time! And maybe you also know Candace Cameron Bure from shows like St.Elsewere Punky Brewster and that's such a raven! Jodie Sweetin plays Steph, the affectionate middle child who feels left out. Really a very good show!
