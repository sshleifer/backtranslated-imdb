Not a bad movie. Somehow I was forced to persuade the Iranians to win the game played in the film, even though I know nothing about football and am not a fan. The end of the bus was intoxicating. <br /> <br /> The film itself deals with the issue of women in Iran and how they should not go into sports areas among men, because women are inappropriate to swearing for them. Despite this law, some women try to sneak in, but many are caught and imprisoned. It's really amazing that every society could have such old ideas about gender. In an interview, Panahi says his films are documents of the story and its injustices and that someday in the future we will be able to see these films and see how Iran once lived. It is hoped that the future will come sooner rather than later.
