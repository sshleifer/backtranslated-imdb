I may be coming here on my own, but although the film was a technical masterpiece in its own right, I saw it piece by piece on TCM last night, but the question arises: Why did they do that? many of them died on the hike, why should they undertake such a life-threatening journey just to find food for their animals (!) once they reach the "land of milk and honey", why not? Do you just stay there? Would you endanger your life and that of your entire community just to find food for a herd of cattle? As dangerous as it was to do this alone, inbreeding shows the simplicity of these people. Risk death for a cow? Better than me!
