Joseph L. Mankiewicz is not remembered by most today as one of the best directors in Hollywood's history, but this film proves he is. Mankiewicz was already a success when he played challenging American dramas like A Letter to Three Wives and All About Eve and successfully adapted Shakespeare to life in Julius Caesar. He manages to film this hit Broadway play in a stylish way. Marlon Brando is perfect as a Sky Masterson, even if he does not sing well. He is the only actor who can do it perfectly with his sheer coolness and clarity. Frank Sinatra is, as expected, a wonderful singer and behaves well as Nathan Detroit. Jean Simmons is also very good as Sarah Brown and her scenes with Brando are bubbling with great chemistry. All the supporting actors do their part, especially Sheldon Leonard as Harry the Horse in a very funny part. Nevertheless, Mankiewicz should have the most honor to bring a fine musical to the screen in such a way that it feels authentic in many scenes, yet it is a story in his own world. All in all, Guys and Dolls is a great musical and works on many levels that it should not normally have.
