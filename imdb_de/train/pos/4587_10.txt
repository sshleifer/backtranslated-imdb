Although John Woo's Hard Boiled is my favorite movie. But I have to say that the police story is my favorite movie. I say that because the stunts, the fights and the action is my favorite part of the movie as Jackie Chan jumps off the rail at the top of the escalator, grabs the shopping center on a bar surrounded by Chrismas lights and the bar slips down through Skylight and finally land on the hard marble floor. OUCH! Buy it at amazon.com for 14:98. (Or something in $ 14.) VHS New Line Home Video. If you have questions or comments, feel free to respond. (I'm only 14 years old, but I know where to find movies that were ever filmed.) If you're looking for a movie anywhere and can not find it, please answer me. Thank you and good night!
