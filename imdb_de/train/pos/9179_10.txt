This is the (hitherto best) version you will see, and is equivalent to the Bronte work. Dalton is a little hard to imagine as Jane Eyre claims to be "not pretty". But his acting overcomes this and Zelah Clark, as pretty as she is, is also a complete and believable Jane Eyre. This production is a long watch, but worth it. Almost direct quotations from the book are in the script. If you are looking for the very first true "romance" in literature, this is the way to see it. I own every copy of this movie and have read and reread the original. Filming may seem a bit dated, but there will never be such a thing.
