"The Last Wave" is far more than the sum of its parts. It's not just a catastrophe movie, not just an exploration of Australian Aboriginal spirituality and certainly more than a simple court drama. Writer and director Peter Weir takes these elements to the next level to produce a truly effective and thought provoking film with the same eerie atmosphere he gave two years earlier to "Picnic At Hanging Rock", you'll remember years later <br /> <br /> When attorney David Burton (Chamberlain) is called to defend Chris Lee (Gulpilil) for the death of an Aboriginal for whom he may be directly responsible or Not, he not only has to fight the truth of Lee, but to understand what he hears when it comes. Like the Aboriginal beliefs that there are two worlds - the Everyday World and the Dreamtime - the truth exists on two completely different levels, the effects of which are more devastating than Burton ever imagined. <br /> <br /> No doubt the reason 'Picnic At Hanging Rock' is better remembered for its lasting mystery. We are guided the same way, but have to find answers ourselves. In 'The Last Wave' we can put everything together until the end of the movie. Despite all the information, however, we have to decide how much we want to believe, because the film takes us beyond the limits of our normal reality. On the production side, Weir uses his budget with great impact, gradually building a sense of destiny in everything, from soft light to heavy rain and good sound exploitation. The casual music is unobtrusive and never tries to be great. Richard Chamberlain manages to convey the confusion that the audience would undoubtedly feel as he tries to solve the puzzle. David Gulpilil excellently portrays a man trapped between two worlds who wants to do the right thing, but he is scared because he already knows the end. <br /> <br /> Put all these things together, and you have a perfect example of why David Weir is a household name in the cinema after 30 years. Highly recommended.
