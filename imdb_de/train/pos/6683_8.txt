Forget about meaning intensity, let your logic down the door and enjoy a great time with this funny-weird, totally absurd, ultra-campy live-action cartoon. MYSTERY MEN is a broadcast of all the superhero movies you've ever seen, but the unlikely super-wannabes are so interesting, varied and well-staffed that they're stand-alone characters. Dark humor, downright stupidity, good action and even one or two touching moments make this comic fantasy about lovable losers a real winner. The comedic talents of the Mystery Men performers - including a Mystery Woman - are a perfect foil for Wes Studi as something that can only be described as a bargain-basement Yoda and Geoffrey Rush as one of the most absurd in the world. Wand (and bizarrely charming) villains, who have ever run from a dark horse comic book to the big screen. Get ready to laugh, cheer and "huh?" more than once .... enjoy!
