The first time I saw this episode was a shock to me, actually it was the first time I saw "24". The speed at which things happen is amazing, and it's so startling, exciting, and even interesting that it's almost like reading a book. Once you start, it is very hard to stop. From the minute Richard Walsh privately talked to Jack about the possibility of a mole in the CTU, I sat 6:40 hours, which means 10 episodes. (Sounds weird and crazy, but I'm the guy who just can not stop looking interested.) This series is one of the best of its kind. And it's built in such a way that there are some different stories that are linked together. In every way recommended!
