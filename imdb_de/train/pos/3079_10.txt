When listening to an audiobook, Cambpell Scott is the reader. I was so excited to hear his voice and that brought back my disappointment that "Six Degrees" was canceled. They never seem to keep the good shows in the air long enough to capture an audience that can connect with show history. What a shame and shame on the network if you do not give this show a full season chance. This was a great show, with a great cast. The network gave "Men in Trees" a second chance, which is also a great show, but they lost "Invasion" and that was something else to see, not the same old themes. Why can not the networks do it right?
