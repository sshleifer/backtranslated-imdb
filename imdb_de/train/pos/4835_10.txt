It is a story of Siberian villagers from the beginning of the 20th century to the 1960s. It's about passion and feelings, about the Russian soul and very romantic. This movie is NOT action-packed, it flows slowly. In the second part you can find great songs - Russian romances. It is much better than Doctor Zhivago. The director of this film moved to America and made Runaway Train, for example.
