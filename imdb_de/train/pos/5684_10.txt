Wonderland is a fascinating film starring XC-rated movie star John C. Holmes in the brutal Wonderland murders. <br /> <br /> The promotion of the movie tempts this as a romanticized illustration of the porn industry in the aisles of Boogie Nights and that is not the case here. Apart from a few references made by news anchors that John Holmes is a porn star, and a short montage of real photos of John Holmes, this movie is a stark drama about the involvement of a fallen celebrity in murder and how it happened. <br /> <br /> Despite the misleading, the movie is really captivating. The acting from all the cast is excellent and I want to say that Val Kilmer is amazing in his ability to sink All the behaviors of John Holmes. I was absolutely convinced that I watched John C. Holmes probably look and behave in real life. <br /> <br /> If you're a John C. Holmes fan or tell stories about Hollywood, then I think you'll enjoy watching Wonderland.
