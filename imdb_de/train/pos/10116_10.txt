An excellent and accurate film ... McGovern researches and documents his writing and it pays off. He is not afraid to tell the truth, even if it might provoke unfavorable criticisms and comments from some people who like the stories clean, sweet and shiny. <br /> <br /> Once again, McGovern interrupts Christopher Eccleston, though not in such a high profile as he played in Hillsborough. I found this movie so accurate, well played and well presented as Hillsborough, and I greet McGovern for his poignant, unapologetic writing. Well done and my hat goes to the author, the actors, the production crew. A great movie!
