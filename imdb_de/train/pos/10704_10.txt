Are you a giraffe? ... ask John to Nadia, and she answers that she will answer well: Yes. In this way, the communication between a man and a woman who do not know each other and at the same time the questions and doubts in "Birthday Girl" begin. A movie that I've heard many times, but I do not dare to see ... I'll write this up to two hours. <br /> <br /> "Birthday Girl" is a passionate film that leads me astray At the same time, Nicole Kidman is one of the best actresses (except she's pretty and intelligent) I've ever seen. "Birthday Girl" is the story of a lonely and experienced man who is looking for a woman on the internet. The woman he finds comes from Russia. She seems to be that delicate woman, normal, not more. One day, on her birthday, suddenly comes his cousin and his friend. The man starts to discover certain things. Since then he will not be the lonely and experienced man who has always been. Many of us will think that this movie is just a regular movie with a exploited plot. Many of us will think that the action and the thrill are safe and are nothing new. But "Birthday Girl" is just the opposite. This movie is full of good surprises, good performances and an imaginative action that I had never seen and imagined. This romantic thriller with a certain funny touch is an outstanding nature film with many suggestions for his films. "Birthday Girl" has certain beauty and cruelty in his scenes, but at the same time touching nature and makes it so deeper. <br /> <br /> "Birthday Girl" is sometimes sad, sometimes funny, sometimes violent, but in the end is completely satisfactory. And I'm not sorry to say that this is a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> * Sorry for the mistakes ... well, if there are any.
