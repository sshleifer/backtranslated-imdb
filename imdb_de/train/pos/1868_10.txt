This film describes the life of a person who grew up in the worst circumstances, but unlike many other people, he actually became a respectable person. What's more, this is a true story. <br /> <br /> Antwone Fisher is so innocent and yet he was so abused just because he was not white. Antwone Fisher has been married to the same women for ten years and has never messed with women, coke, cigars, weeds, alcohol, or anything that is very popular in the places where he grew up. <br /> <br /> There is not much more to say about this film, it is excellent. The only rating I can give is 10/10.
