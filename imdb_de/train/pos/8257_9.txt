I just saw the World Preem of Fido at the Toronto International Film Festival and we loved it. Here is a welcome revision of a genre that is believed to have pioneered George Romero (certainly copious and successful). But this is a Canadian movie by a Canadian director and it's a comedy! And yes, I think it's better than 'Shawn of the Dead'. Absolutely believable and perhaps even more enjoyable performances by Dylan Baker, Carrie-Anne Moss and the young actor K'Sun Ray, who I suspect will see more in the future. However, I must confess that I enjoyed the delicious turn of Tim Blake Nelson's neighbor Mr. Theopolis the most, essentially a willing animated version of Victor Van Dort from the Corpse Bride (or for those who saw the movie). Even better than reading Corpse Pride?) And of course the Scottish actor Billy Connolly in his least lively but somehow deeply moving role as a title character. Imagine that he did not get that role unless Peter Stormare's commitment to Prison Break had been received (as the questions and answers after the Thursday night's demo show). I can not help but speculate that the scriptwriters must have drawn a lot of inspiration from Day Of The Dead's Zombie 'Bub'. I'm not interested in revealing details of a plan during a comment, and I'm not starting now. Suffice to say, Fido is NOT one of those gritty, graphically bloody zombie movies you can count on Romero. It's more like a movie that will make you laugh all the time, and though (and I had to think carefully to make sure) there's a decent dose of bloodshed and violence, the delicious humor that enhances so well through the surreal environment Created by Director Currie and his co-authors, this helps make it look like a feature that should be considered PG-13. I urge you to see this little Canuck gem. I will definitely buy the DVD as soon as it appears hopefully next summer.
