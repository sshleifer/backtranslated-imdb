Widowed family man Dan Burns (Steve Carell) writes the column "Dan in Real Life" with advice for families in The New Jersey Standard and draws up his three daughters alone. Jane (Allison Pill), the older one, has just received her driver's license, but Dan does not allow her to drive; Cara (Brittany Robertson) is in love with his high school colleague Marty; and the young Lily (Marlene Lawston) misses her mother. When Dan and his daughters travel to Rhode Island for a family reunion, he meets Marie (Juliette Binoche) in a bookstore and they spend hours talking to each other. They are attracted to each other, but Marie receives a phone call and leaves Dan, first giving her phone number. Dan immediately falls in love with Marie, but when he returns to his parents, he realizes that Marie is the girlfriend of his wolf brother Mitch Burns (Dane Cook), who is also in love with her. At the weekend, the attraction between the awkward Dan and Marie increases and they have to make a decision. <br /> <br /> "Dan in Real Life" is a great surprise and a delightful movie with comedy, romance and drama. The chemistry of beautiful Juliette Binoche and Steve Carell is fantastic and it's very easy to know why everyone loves Marie. Trio Allison Pill, Brittany Robertson and Marlene Lawston are awesome and their characters are responsible for some of the best moments in this story. The script is wonderful and the performances of the talented actors and actresses are breathtaking, with a realistic approach to a family reunion. Follow the advice of Dan's column and let the reunification of the Burns family surprise you. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Eu, Meu Irm√£o and Nossa Namorada" ("Me, my brother and our friend")
