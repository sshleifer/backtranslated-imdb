William H. Macy is most likable and captivating here as a beating and loving father who wants to get out of the family business without annoying his overbearing parents. In much of the same territory as TV "The Sopranos" occurs in relation to the midlife crisis of a criminal subject (here he visits a shrink), but thanks to a few strict instructions from Brommel is still worth watching (I'm looking forward to what this guy will conduct next), a great script and all around great achievements. Macy is excellent as always. This is probably his best role since "Fargo". Donald Sutherland is scariest as a domineering father. Tracy Ullman gives as Macy's wife a surprisingly dramatic twist. The young David Dorfman is excellent as Macy's bright and sensitive son (many of his lines sound at will and are wonderful). Even Neve Campell (whom I usually detest) is convincing as the disturbed young woman who captivates Macy's gaze. All this is underscored by a moving score and a crisp pace that leads to a predictable yet powerful climax and meaningful and touching aftermath. This movie deserves a much broader release, as I suspect it would be in contact with the audience.
