I watch them all. <br /> <br /> It's no better than the amazing (_Strictly Ballroom_, _Will we dance? _ (Japanese version)), but it's totally respectable and pleasingly different /> I'm an English teacher and find some ignorance about the language rather annoying in some of these reviews. For example: "The name should not scream." How she moves. "Since when can film titles ignore the grammar?" <br /> <br /> There is nothing inherently wrong with Caribbean English grammar. It just is not a standard Canadian English grammar. Comments on the dialogue seem to make me uncomfortable. I simply AUTOMATICALLY assumed that I would have difficulty understanding everything. It was not too difficult and there was a distinctly different taste, as the other Step movies I saw were so American. <br /> <br /> I loved the fact that this movie was filmed in Toronto, and even wished it were even clearer there loved it that the heroine was so uncharacteristically occupied. I enjoyed the step-by-step routines. I liked the driven mum character. I felt that many of the problems in the film were addressed more subtly than is characteristic of dance films. <br /> <br /> If you like dance films, this is a decent topic. If you have problems with the English standard grammar that you grew up with, your close mind may have difficulty enjoying this movie.
