In this beautiful film, I enjoyed the cinematographic recovery of China in the 1930s. The story is simple. An older male actor wants to pass on his art to a young man, even though he has no living children. The faces of the actors are wonderful to see. The story reveals the devotion and gratitude of the children to those who treat them well and their desire to be well treated. The operas in the movie remind me of FAREWELL MY CONCUBINE, which was more sophisticated and complicated. The story here reminds me of a Dickens story of days when kids almost chatted. The plot is a bit predictable and a bit too sentimental for me, but it's well worth the time for heroism, humanity and history.
