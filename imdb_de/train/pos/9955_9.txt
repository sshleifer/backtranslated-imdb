I saw this movie twice at community screenings and was really excited. I work in the Jane Finch community and feel that the movie has really captured some of the essence and flair of the community - sand, determination, exuberance, creativity in your face with a dose of despair. Writing, dialogue and acting are solid and I really felt drawn into the story of young Ms. Raya as she struggled to pursue her goals and not lose herself. Great dance sequences and not only the bodies move smoothly and with electricity, but also the camera moves fluently and intelligently. All characters are multi-dimensional - neither good nor bad, and the female characters are admirably strong. This is a movie that beats a strong heart and celebrates the irresistible spirit of youth, hip-hop and communities like Jane Finch.
