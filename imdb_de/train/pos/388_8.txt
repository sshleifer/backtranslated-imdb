... and I love it. Many special effects, and for a movie that was not created with mega-budget, this movie is really great at creating a fantasy masterpiece. I'm one of the guys who did not understand the story at all, but that was still a great sight. It's definitely up in standards that surpass Bored of the Rings, and comparable to movies like Harry Potter. What a film means a lot again, which was made on a fraction of the budget of these international hits. <br /> <br /> One thing I really appreciate about this movie is that it expands the envelope of the upcoming adventure movie so out of Hong Kong. The theme is exotic and original. The production quality is unlike anything seen in HK for fantasy action movies, and acting is great. <br /> <br /> One of the best films from Hong Kong, this is the Infernal Affairs of Hong Kong fantasy movie and I hope they continue to work in this area until they outperform Hollywood adventure movies. <br /> <br /> Simply fantastic.
