While making "The Kiss of the Spider Woman" Raul Julia a political prisoner in an unidentified Latin American country, this time he is working for a dictator in a fictional Latin American country. Specifically, the dictator suddenly falls dead, replacing Julia El Presidente with a Broadway actor (Richard Dreyfuss) shooting a film in the country. From there, Dreyfuss has to figure out how to be a dictator while always balancing his own life. Is it appropriate to turn the tense situation in Latin America into a comedy? Well, "Moon Over Parador" is doing a good job with that. No matter what you do in this movie, you can do it. This shows why Richard Dreyfuss is one of the greatest actors of our time and what we lost when Raul Julia died. Definitely worth seeing. Even with Sonia Braga (who played with Raul Julia in "TKOTSW" the lead role), Jonathan Winters and Sammy Davis Jr. <br /> <br /> I agree: The first lady is hot.
