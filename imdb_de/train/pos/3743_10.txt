Close scriptwriting, good direction, excellent performances, strong cast, effective use of locations ... Paul McGann gives a detailed, subtle performance as the man at the center of a new murder investigation that can just happen I've committed a similar murder before. <br /> <br /> There is an interesting moral and emotional journey with his character (Ben Turner) that overlaps with Amanda Burton's journey. Inevitably, they cross each other ... Who did what? <br /> <br /> The study of WHY, both past and present, rather than the WHO, could have resulted in a more interesting, Dostoevsky history, but hey, who complains? <br /> <br />
