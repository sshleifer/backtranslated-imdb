Billy Wilder is co-responsible for the story, and his unsentimental touch is felt in this rather original story by ghostwriting songwriters, both of whom work for burnt-out music legend Oliver Courtney. The obvious misconceptions are getting out of the way, thank goodness, and what's left is a fun and airy compilation with a few beautiful songs (and a few more forgotten ones), Crosby at his most charming, a great twist on the Broadway legend Mary Martin and Basil Rathbone and Oscar Levant provide the most cynical barbs (Levant is rare and his jokes are not dated yet). An enjoyable surprise that is recommended for all fans of the genre.
