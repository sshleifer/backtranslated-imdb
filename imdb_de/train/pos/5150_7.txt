Although Ian Kershaw distanced himself from this project because of inaccuracies in Hitler's life and yes, this is dramatic, but essential. Robert Carlyle plays Hitler during his later years, during this documentary, which deals only with Hitler, from childhood to Chancellor of Germany, including the Night of the Long Knives. This TV movie (also a two-part mini-series) shows how Hitler came to power through a series of factors, such as: the financial disaster of 1930. The series follows Hitler and little else, apart from Fritz Gerlich and Ernst Hanfstaengl. All in all, valuable and filled with interesting actors, but I think it should have been more closely aligned with stronger cinematography; Most actors are portrayed in half figures, which (to me) is a theatrical attitude and not cinematic. The tempo is sometimes drowsy, and the movie suffers from it, it's about 2.5 hours long.
