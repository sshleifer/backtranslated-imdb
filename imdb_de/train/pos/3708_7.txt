A lawyer gets involved in a deadly cat-and-mouse game when he becomes involved in a film adaptation of a Grisham novel. Altman creates an exciting gothic atmosphere, but the script is weak. Branagh convinces with his southern flair as a lawyer and Davidtz lures as an object of his desire. Downey is sympathetic as a private investigator. Duvall has a small role that does not allow him to do much with his funny character. Hannah and Berenger complete the impressive cast. After an interesting setup, the movie breaks and does not really live up to its original promise, but Altman is always worth a look.
