This is the most compelling and outstanding performance Robert Taylor has ever given. It even surpasses his wonderful performance as "Johnny Eager" 14 years after this movie. His looks are still a miracle, but he now has a maturity that gives him the advantage of this violent role. Charlie Gilson (Taylor) is the last of his breed, a buffalo hunter who kills not for money but for pleasure. His wild killing not only of buffaloes, but also of humans is breathtaking. He is basically a lonely man who needs the people around him, but they do not like him for his behavior by sociopaths. His partner is Sandy McKenzie (Stewart Granger), who is fed up with the hunt and only joins in because he is a loser in everything else. Along the way, Charlie kills an Indian family and beautiful Debra Pagent. Charlie tries to seduce her without success, but sees that Sandy is also interested in her. Granger is somehow sad to look at, so tired of the hunt and longs to go away with the girl and her baby. Lloyd Nolan as a drunken Skinner is wonderful with his clever cracks and the accordion playing. Russ Tamblyn plays half the race and tries to fit into a white world. The group is a strange mix of good and evil, young and old. At the end Taylor is scared of the buffalo like many hunters in front of him and runs off to leave Sandy with the girl. On his return, Sandy goes away with the woman that night and chases Charlie to kill Sandy to fetch Sandy and keep the girl for herself. The final confrontation comes in a blizzard and the last scene is so shocking that you'll never forget it. It's Taylor's movie and he was really a much underrated actor of that era.
