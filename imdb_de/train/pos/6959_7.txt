Well, this is a movie by Ivan Reitman. With the rare exception Ivan loves to entertain. His films are generally not "deep," but they are often entertaining enough. My super ex girlfriend surprised me that I laughed more than I thought. Uma Thurman is just great and I love her depictions. I also like Luke Wilson, and Rainn Wilson was a complete shout. Never taken seriously, the film is exaggerated and yet not very unique, nor does it go where no-one has been before headaches and do not want to burden your brain. It is escapist fun and there is nothing wrong with that. When you strip off the "Super Girl" fabric, you have a story about relationships and bad relationships. It is a boy who meets a girl, a boy leaves a girl. And in the end, the characters are looking for love. Not all take it as well as possible to be "dumped" ... a piece of life with a twist.
