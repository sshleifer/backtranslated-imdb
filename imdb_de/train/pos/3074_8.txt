I recently got this little gem from a movie over cable. It surprised me, although I should have expected it from the team involved with this film. <br /> <br /> Henry Bromwell has directed this film with a sure hand, and that shows. One always wonders about the secret life of killers. You do not have to go too far to realize that they are probably your own neighbors or social acquaintances or even friends. They do not differ from us, at least on the surface. <br /> <br /> In this story, the grandfather is an abominable personality who does not hesitate to turn off someone for the right price. He has no scruples in teaching his own son and even the grandson the ropes! <br /> <br /> Alex, a man who lives in turmoil. He knows what he has done in the past and suddenly realizes the consequences of his actions. He needs to see someone who helps him to find peace with himself. When he went to see Dr. Parks goes, he tries to find absolution, although he does not find them there. On the contrary, there is a dramatic twist when Alex learns who will kill next. Alex, brilliantly portrayed by William H. Macy, fascinates us. Not only is he a fantastic actor, he makes us believe he is this man. One of the best things in the movie is the late John Ritter. He is as convincing as Dr. Parks, the man who solves the puzzle. Donald Sutherland, because the grandfather is perfect. He is a natural actor in everything he does. Neve Campbell surprised in her key role as Sarah. It shows incredible ability and range. Tracey Ullman is Martha, the suffering woman, and she can not do much. Also Barbara Bain is in rare appearance the grandmother from hell. David Dorfman is a joy of the movie. He shows a maturity beyond his years. <br /> <br />
