Carter Wong plays a noble hero in search of a healing book that seeks ultimate revenge! The tempo is good in this movie and there are many fight scenes to keep the movie going. The flying guillotines look bad and the main villain has no problems with it. Although the story is not strong, the action is fun and pulls you to the end (which in my opinion could have had a sequel) !!
