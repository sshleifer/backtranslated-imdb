Personally, I think the movie is pretty good. It outlines the actual situation of the triads in Hong Kong and gives the viewer an insight into the organization of the triads. Not only that, it also shows the viewer how the police in Hong Kong are controlling the triad situation and why the police are not getting everything out and erasing the triads. <br /> <br /> Overall, the film is more violent due to gangland methods of killing and torturing. Nevertheless, the film remains true to the real world, so violence on the screen is just a reflection of what's really going on. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this movie to any Triad / Mafia movie fan. Another good watch would be Dragon Squad. This movie has more rifles than this, as there are more knives in this movie than guns (in fact I can not remember seeing a single weapon).
