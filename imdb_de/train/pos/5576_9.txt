This movie is funny! I looked at it with my girlfriend and we just had to see it again. This movie is not for you, just watch the movies nominated for Academy Awards (you know who you are.) <br /> "Whipped" is a carefree comedy I laughed through and through. It does not take itself too seriously and should be seen with your friends, not with your girlfriend. It will not win prizes, but it just has to be viewed to be appreciated. Certainly, some of the jokes are toilet humor, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. Everyone can sometimes use some of it. Some people need to lighten and see that it is "beaten", not what it is not.
