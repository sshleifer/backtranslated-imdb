My favorite movie "Imperialism" and one of the best action-adventure movies ever. Grant, McLaglen and Fairbanks dominate the screen with daring and white cracks to delight everyone but the "PC" of the filmgoers. Memorable scenes abound - the 3 sergeants and their 20 sepoys fight off hundreds of thugs; MacChesney & Cutter give Bobby Coote the edge ("save something for the elephant"); Cutter to MacChesney - "I'm an Expedition"; Din break cutter from jail, with a fork ("What do you think I'm trying to break? A bloody pudding ?!) And the incredible temple scene with Cutters singing and annoucing, brave like brass -" All right, you're all arrested ! "<br /> <br /> I could go on, but suffice to say that I always try to watch the movie when it's running, which is hard for adventurers and generals to imagine 2 hours.
