"The Deathking" -Jorg Buttgereit's second full-length feature film (the first was infamous "Necromancy") has no central characters or characters, but thematic continuity in the act of suicide, a series of set pieces, each containing the self-destruction of a stranger. Yes, the production values ​​are low and it is disturbing, but in many ways, "The Death Kinking" is extremely effective. It makes you think, which sometimes is more important than pure entertainment. Unlike the other works by Buttgereit, it is not very bloody, but there are some unpleasant images, such as a castration scene in the Tuesday episode, a devastating corpse and various suicide actions and pain! - just amazing, if you want my opinion. 10 out of 10 times this postmodern shocker! Disturbing art in the purest form!
