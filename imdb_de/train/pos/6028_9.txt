This is the film in Antonioni's mid-term that most critics quickly dismiss as a "flawed" view of American youth culture / politics of the 1960s. For what it's worth, I found it more touching and memorable than its more prestigious films like L'AVVENTURA, perhaps because it shows more emotion and empathy than anywhere else. The story is simple, but used as a framework for Antonioni's brilliant observations and critique of American consumer culture, student life, counterculture, and the entire anti-establishment anti-war reaction that was so prominent at the time. <br /> <br /> From a purely technical point of view, too, it is a remarkably designed film. From the opening sequence, to the bizarre desert love-in, to the use of billboards, to this breathtaking, cathartic finale, where 17 camera setups (in his own way as the climax) were used, the wild bunch). In addition, Antonioni and Daria Halperin, one of the finest ever seen on screen, chose a damned leading actress. It does not involve much "acting" as it feels more like a documentary drama and the use of non-professionals as a guide pair in this context is very effective. And the soundtrack is not only filled with wonderful music, but also impressive in the use (I can not forget the start of the movie, mainly because of the selection of music - by Pink Floyd - that maintains the look so well). <Contrary to popular belief, this is quite a hit in the cinema, and I would highly recommend anyone who has a taste or tolerance for the off-beat. It's worth looking for and one of the key movies of the 60s that require a DVD restoration / release.
