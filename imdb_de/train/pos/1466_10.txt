THE PERVERT'S LEADER TO CINEMA (2007) **** <br /> <br /> If the loving cinema makes me a pervert, then so be it! <br /> <br /> If you're a real "movie" like me then I'm sure you do not get enough movies about filmmaking and I do not necessarily mean the dry documentary and then. I mean a total discourse about the movie experience. Well, if that's the case, I have a lulu from a movie experiment for you. <br /> <br /> In Sophie Fiennes (sister of Ralph & Joseph, if you wondered), the philosopher cum Cinephile Slavoj Zizek, who does his analysis of the cinema, has some impressive (and often outrageous) disputes from the silent era from Chaplin to the modern era of the Wachowski Brothers, in which the psychosexual foundations, the socioeconomic, political, and, of course, undefinable magic of the film experience are analyzed, scrutinized and documented with his tireless, determined and almost frenetic dissertations. In order not to explain how The Bates' home in PSYCHO is indeed the mirrored psyche of conflicting Norman Bates, with each level as his ego, Superego & Id is one thing, but then the same thing is about every Marx brother in barely a stroke to say a remarkable test of faith that convinces the skeptical layman. <br /> <br /> Although I had no idea who Zizek was? he resembles a hybrid of filmmaker Brian DePalma, European actor Rade Serbedzija, and the hyperkinetic energy of filmmakers Quentin Tarantino and Martin Scorsese? With his hissing tongue and passion, the host acts as a crazy prophet. <br /> <br /> Fiennes cleverly integrates Zizek into several movie clip backgrounds that add a humorous tone while still maintaining the chatter and excitement and talking about the full range of films in three acts Kubrick, Lynch, Hitchcock and movies as diverse as THE WIZARD OF OZ, THE RED SHOES and FIGHT CLUB. <br /> <br /> There is something for everyone and if a man can provoke an argument or at least a reason to discuss the topics of a film? even if they are to blame Freudian / Jungian ?? Then I say that this collection of film theory is worth the clock. Look for it now, if you can, before it comes to home videos; That is the only way to appreciate it.
