The film adaptation of James Joyce's Ulysses is excellent. The actors, the speakers, the direction, everything captures the feeling of the novel, without sacrificing its own merits. The Milo O'Shea does an excellent job as Leopold Bloom, the man with the cuckold who is married to the naughty Molly. I absolutely love this picture.
