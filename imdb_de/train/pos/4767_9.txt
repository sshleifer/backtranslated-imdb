I do not see how this show is like the OK at all. <br /> <br /> First of all, the OK focuses on teenagers and their parents trying to get through life. North Shore is about a hotel staff trying to run the hotel while having a social life. Second, the OK takes place in California. North Shore takes place in Hawaii. <br /> <br /> And why should Fox do a show as well as one of the other shows on the same network? I think this is a great show with great actors. It has a good plot and action. I like the events that happen and how people take care of them and work them out. The most recent episode was surprising, as the story looked. It was unpredictable like most stories in most shows. <br /> <br /> I hope Fox keeps it in the air.
