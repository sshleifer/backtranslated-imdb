Contains Spoiler <br /> <br /> "Hollow Man" is probably the weakest movie Paul Verhoeven, director of great films like Total Recall, Starship Troopers and Robocop, ever did. <br /> <br /> That's probably not his fault. For some reason, Verhoeven stuck with a very mediocre script and made the best of it. <br /> <br /> The first part of this movie is pretty good with lots of cynical jokes, great special effects and even Skunk Anansie on the soundtrack. Unfortunately, in the second part, the movie falls flat when it degenerates into a standard Slasher movie or a very bad "Alien" clone. The end is particularly ridiculous <SPOILER>, as Kevin Bacon comes back to life after a series of incidents that should have killed him (in the logical sense of the word). </ SPOILER>. And the whole thing is indeed quite flat: the topic of invisibility is never fully investigated. <br /> <br /> But all in all, Verhoeven manages to stay well above average with this film. <br /> <br /> ** 1/2 of **** stars
