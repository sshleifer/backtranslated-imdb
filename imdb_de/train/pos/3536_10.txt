EA has shown us that they can form a classic 007 agent and give you the feeling of being in the 60s world. The graphics of the game are excellent and the voice recording is very professional. I got this game in April 2007 (two years after its release), and I'm still impressed with the gameplay. It's a shame EA does not make 007 games anymore. <br /> <br /> I give this game 10/10 for the levels it contains, especially the "Consulate" level. I would recommend this game to everyone from 13 years. The only thing I did not like in the game is the Russian boat level, it was too much pressure. On the whole, I like the game MUCH !!
