Old movie fans will know why I would call this "The Man in the Gray Flannel Robe". Most Bible-based films are basically a hit - which may cause a smile and a giggle, is how Peck tries to raise awareness of a variety of psychological and social issues when the spear carries Neanderthals around him. As a great romance it falls flat like unleavened bread. But this movie has something exciting. Of all the great Hollywood bible images, it most impressively conveys the ambiguous attitude of the average American toward belief in the biblical God. The thesis of Billy Sunday deals with H. L. Mencken's antithesis throughout the script. Whoever benefits from the synthesis assisted by Heavenly Chorus depends on your point of view. Otherwise, D & B offers good performances from Peck (especially in the final loyalty scene) and Jayne Meadows as bitter first wife Michol, lively, moody atmosphere (good idea to put the most action in the morning or at night) and the rousing rendition of the Twenty-third Psalm at the end.
