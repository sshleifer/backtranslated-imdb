Only now and then do we get an R-Rated comedy that gives everyone time and attention. Even less often will the critics like it. I just came back from The 40 Years Old Virgin and honestly say it was one of the biggest laughs of my life. I went to a 10:35 show and every row was filled. Not only that, everyone laughed their ass all the time. It's two hours of uninterrupted laughter. I dare you to watch this movie and not to laugh. <br /> <br /> The plot is simple. A man is forty years old and he is a virgin. However, behind this simple five-second joke we get a deep, complex story that is not only one of the funniest you've ever seen, but also has real lessons to do. Steve Carell plays Andy Stitzer, the 40-year-old maiden. We know Steve Carell as one of the best thieves ever. Steve Carell steals amazing scenes from Bruce Almighty, and especially from Anchorman, and has come a long way since he finally and proudly gets his moment as a star. No one will forget his name when they witness this thoroughly funny, pervasive, comic comedy. <br /> <br /> The beauty of the movie is that it's not 100% stupid. The brilliant writing of Judd Apatow and Steve Carell really has a purpose and it's not just a damn story to tell. Behind the cruelty and the vulgar non-stop ride of the film is an important lesson to learn. Although the film is not presented optimally, it offers us more than just a pleasant time. His good-natured attitude makes you laugh all the time, while at the same time seeing the real struggles of people like Andy and his colleagues. The end could not have been better. It not only delivers what we promised, but also one of the most memorable final numbers a comedy has ever seen. It would have been perfect if there had been Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson, but somehow you can not win them, now you can. <br /> <br /> Finally, as Roger Ebert puts it, I think: Catherine Keener gives an inexplicably perfect performance as Trish, for a woman for whom Andy really has his heart. Not only does it make us laugh, it's also crazy to see how bright it fuels the story. She was perfected in the role, and she and Carell have fantastic, not to mention, hilarious chemistry on the canvas. Alberta and Manitoba beat the 40-year-old maiden with an 18A. The same happened with Four Brothers, in my opinion the second best movie of the year, and I can honestly say that I love Ontario more and more for it. To all teenagers in the US: Good luck with sneaking! <br /> <br /> Overall, Steve Carell is one of the funniest performances I've ever seen, and pretty much everyone in the cast distributes the nonstop laughter. Everyone will love the 40-year-old maiden this summer and I would like to encourage everyone to see it as soon as possible. It's the best comedy of the year, no doubt. It beats everywhere in The Longest Yard, The Wedding Crashers and of course the last memorable comedy by Apatow and Carell, Anchorman. <br /> <br /> It is a comic masterpiece and deserves the remarkable praise of critics love it. Every one of my favorite critics loved it and it immediately earns a spot on the IMDb Top 250. Steve Carell is a big star. Just look at one of the brightest summers. <br /> <br /> My rating: 9/10 <br /> <br /> Lens ?? 9/10 <br /> <br /> Subjectively ?? 10/10 <br /> <br /> Eliason A.
