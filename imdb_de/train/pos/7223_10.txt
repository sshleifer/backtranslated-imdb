The comparison with Sleuth, the former director, is obvious, and on my first sight I thought Sleuth would be better, but Deathtrap has, at least for me, many more repetitions than Sleuth. > <br /> I bought Deathrap for a bargain at Wal-Mart and found that it had Caine and the undervalued Reeve and was worth $ 6. It was one of the best DVD purchases I could ever buy. <br /> <br /> It is one of the best kept secrets that movie lovers always enjoy discovering. And it is worth repeating the visits. <br /> <br /> Although Laurence Olivier and Michael Caine performed well in Sleuth bravado, I was doubly impressed with Christopher Reeve as Clifford Anderson. Reeve, rightly associated with his now-legendary Superman depiction, stole the show in an Oscar-worthy performance. I always had the feeling that Reeve was a guy-cast actor who did not have much opportunity to shine outside the Superman movies and some other flawed but entertaining films like Somewhere in Time, but this movie shows its potential Really I was knocking and putting it in, thank goodness. <br /> <br /> I absolutely enjoyed the performance of Michael Caine. He was reckless, deliciously manipulative and sadistic. It was an absolute pleasure to see him working with Reeve and Dyan Cannon. In fact, thanks to this film, I entered a "Michael Caine phase" and started renting as much of his material as possible. <br /> <br /> As far as Deathtrap is concerned, there are enough juicy dialogues here to fill in the "memorable quotes" section. (Unfortunately, much of the dialogue would spoil the immensely entertaining storyline.) <br /> <br /> It's really hard to talk about the movie without affecting important points of action that are infinitely more fun when you do she discovered herself. Needless to say, it is a must. But for me it was the biggest and most rewarding blind purchase ever. <br /> <br /> Repeated visits are a must. <br /> <br /> And it's worth sitting on your DVD shelf next to Sleuth. <br /> <br /> I leave you with this nicely written quote from the movie: "I wonder if it would not be like that ... well ... just a little thing with little eyes from me, like that to engage in risky and exciting collaboration where I can not rely on any moral obligation ... whatever.
