I'll gladly admit that I'm a good movie and can use enough imaginative camera movements and angles to keep my interest in a fairly long film. Not as long as Gojoe, though there were some of the most notable cinematographs I've seen since the Korean play MUSA. Gojoe, however, offers much more than just beautiful pictures (like MUSA ... do not make a difference) - the second biggest strength is the excellent acting and a fascinating story with a very dark philosophy. I have to admit that I was rather unsure of what it was all about, but it definitely puts some thoughts on the way. Vague, but definitely thought: p <br /> <br /> One department where the movie could have been better is the action. There's a lot of bloodshed in the movie, but the action is filmed with hyperkinetic close-ups and often obscured by objects in the foreground. It produces some very intense and impressive visuals, but it would have been nice to see a few more real moves, something to make it more credible that the bad guys could simply ransack entire armies that wereted all. > Still, the movie is definitely one of the most interesting and beautiful movies I've seen in a while. Recommended!
