Eugene Levy is one of John Funniest. He's great in this movie, too. I wish the studio would find out that this movie has to be on DVD. Kung Fu Uuniversity (Kung Fu U) Sketch is as funny as the whole movie, even the scenes he has with his girlfriend and family are great, this movie never seems to be on TV But he loses most When it's cut for Broadcast TV, it's funny. If you can find the video, I would suggest you to buy it (ebay is a good place to find a copy.) I will keep my VHS until one day we watch on DVD. There are so many great films that have not yet been released on DVD, and this is one of them.
