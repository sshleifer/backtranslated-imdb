Many of the comments people have made will fail me as (unfortunately) the point. Kasdan wants to present life, just ordinary life. The conventionally structured story, in which characters have insights that change and then end their lives, play music, and the movie is over, is included in this much larger screen. Some characters in this movie have just such illuminations and then move on. Sometimes they can keep their insights, sometimes they can not, and so life is real. In other words, Kasdan Jettison's conventional dramatic structure in favor of a study of the longevity of life ?? there is no happy ending, just one last end; and everything before that is still in work, still to have? and if you absolutely insist on a topic, exploring the role of the miracle in our lives. What is a miracle? Well, life itself for a start. Then add all the random incidents and cross-links that make up a life or several connected lives, and you have a miracle at the bucket. Kasdan easily emphasizes this rather than insisting on it, and underlines it in various ways, most likely through the device in the middle of the movie, having Mac and his wife lying in bed, each of them dreaming their own dreams. Later in the film, it shows how these dreams have the power to shape the reality within the film. This is not a movie with a simple or obvious message. You just have to let it play out in front of you and then let it sit in your head for a few days, a month, a few years and see what it did there. This is undoubtedly the best film of Kasdan, his most mature, most human. An important meditation on the life of one of our most gifted authors and directors. The tragedy is, of course, that he has not been allowed to work for several years, mainly due to limitations in the studio around "Dreamcatcher". I hope we have not heard the last one from Larry Kasdan yet. A great movie by a great artist. Remember that art does not have to be completely rationalized to succeed.
