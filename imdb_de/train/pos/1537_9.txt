The film is set in a small Swedish town where everyone knows each other. Here Mia visits her parents on her father's birthday, which occasionally always has a kind of tragedy. The question is, how will it be this year, and you'll be surprised ... It's an extremely well-composed film with a story that has a perfect balance between humor and seriousness that is rarely seen. You become happy, you get hurt and basically everything in between. After all, you can not fall in love with Mia (if you're a boy, I think (the lead actress)). She is an extremely well-chosen actress, like many other actors. <br /> <br /> Enjoy
