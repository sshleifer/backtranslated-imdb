This is a great 1940s movie classic and well produced. There are very dramatic scenes in this film with John Garfield, (Al Schmid), "Force of Evil," 48, and Dane Clark, (Lee Diamond), "Last Rites," 88, who fight and combat the Japs during World War II only a machine gun. When Al Schmid was able to go home after a terrible injury, his problems started with his family and his girlfriend. Dane Clark played an outstanding supporting role as Lee Diamond, who did everything he could to help his buddy Al bring his life back together. There is never a complete victory in the war, and we must not forget that all the brave wounded military personnel in the Allan Wars Veterans' Hospitals and our today's Iraqi Veterinarians!
