I'm a fan of ART, I like everything about art, I like paintings, sculptures, etc. This movie shows it, so I like it a lot, it shows how a woman wants to paint something about art, especially naked bodies, but you can not do it because of her strict family (father), at the beginning of the film she painted herself naked, but she wanted a man for her pictures, but her family did not let her paint naked men because it is against the man's morality. Nevertheless, Artemisia could paint her friend and her art teacher completely naked. She falls in love with her art teacher, and it seems that the art teacher is also absolutely in love with her, and in the end he sacrifices his freedom by lying. He said he raped her, but that was not true. Artemisia fell in love with him, but when she says that she is going to suffer a lot because in the process in which Artemisia, her father and the art teacher were, someone violated their artistic hands to tell the truth. I think that's a great movie about ART and an artistic love. Valentina Cervi is great as Artemisia, she plays very well, I also like her appearance in "The Portrait of a Lady" as Pansy Osmond. 8.5 / 10
