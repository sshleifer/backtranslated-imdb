Based on the James J Corbett biography "The Roar Of The Crowd", Gentleman Jim is a wonderfully airy image that reflects not only the rise of the pugilistic praiser Corbett, but also the wind of change around the 1890s. <br /> <br /> The story tells of Corbett {a perfectly cast Errol Flynn} from his humble beginnings as a bank clerk in San Fransico to a fight with a former boxing champion who eventually leads to him John L. Sullivan (Beefcake ), who fought the fearsome World Heavyweight Champion, was wonderfully personified by Ward Bond. Not all fights take place in the ring, and it's all the spin vignettes in Corbett's life that make this picture a great entertaining image. There are class problems here that must be solved perfectly if other club members are paid to knock one or two blocks. Corbett not only has to fight to get respect from his so-called peers, but also to overcome his ego as it grows as fast as his reputation. Along with the wonderful Corbett family and all their stoic, humorous support, Corbett's journey is as exciting as it is joyful, but as bold and brave as he is, he is a very sympathetic figure, and it's a character that matches the tagged moniker he got from gentleman Jim. <br /> <br /> The film never sagged for a moment, and it is a testament to director Raoul Walsh that even though we are anxiously awaiting the final battle, we maintain the outer ring, not even the love interaction harms it Image {Thanks Alexis Smith}. The combat sequences are good and they perfectly show how Corbett became the champion he was. His brand of dancing rings around slugger fighters is now firmly anchored in the boxing history. As the final part rolls, we all come to Earth as an after-battle meeting between Sullivan and Corbett brings all the brutality into context. Here, humility and humility become the absolute winners, and as far as this viewer is concerned ... .......... it will be safe for me to be safe, 9/10 for a truly wonderful picture.
