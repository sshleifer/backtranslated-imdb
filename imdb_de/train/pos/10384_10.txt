Almost 30 years later I remember this original PBS movie as almost unbearably tender. At regular intervals I check here at IMDb in the hope that someone had the sense to buy the rights and put on a DVD. It is September 2004, and I hope for more - deep sigh. <br /> <br /> One of the two leading actors made a small career especially in a prime-time evening soap. the other, Frances Lee McCain, was seen here and there in small roles for a few years. But nothing they did before or after matched this little film that I remember was produced in a short-lived PBS series that featured original scripts by new and emerging playwrights. I've watched it every time if it was shown on PBS, maybe 2 or 3 times. That was before the era of video recorders, so I have no record of it except in my mind's eye. <br /> <br /> 31.12.2006 in addition to above: Happy New Year, ladies! This wonderful movie is finally available on DVD at ladyslipper.org. I understand that the DVDs are burned by the personal copy of the author.
