A clever, indisputably entertaining trumpet starring Peter Ustinov as a career oppressor targeting a US conglomerate in London. He is supported by foxy (and deceptively sharp) Maggie Smith and threatens the jealous company man Bob Newhart. This is a raid movie with many heads. Ustinov is extraordinary like Smith and Newhart is pretty funny. The real surprise is Karl Malden, who breaks the pill as "Deputy Vice President". Malden was rarely so easy. Cesar Romero and Robert Morley appear in comic cameos. The excellent score is by Laurie Johnson. Eric Till's direction is nimble, and the screenplay by Ustinov and Ira Wallach is first-rate and very clever. A swinging time!
