SPOILERS This is a gripping movie about grapples. But who does who here? When does the hunter turn into the prey? This dark, dark movie moves slowly and seductively. It pulls you in and pulls you down the proverbial garden path just to mislead you the way you think you're safe. I did not notice the background music, but it never bothered, so it must have been done right. <br /> <br /> I was very surprised that I liked this movie because I do not usually like that genre but this sucked me in and held it to the end.
