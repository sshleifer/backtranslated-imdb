Scott Henderson (Alan Curtis) meets a mysterious woman (Fay Helm) in a bar and invites her to see a show with him. It agrees on the condition that they do not exchange information about each other - not even names. Sometimes these are the best dates. However, when he returns to his apartment, Inspector Burgess (Thomas Gomez) and his team are waiting for him. Scott's wife was murdered. His alibi is the mysterious woman, but no one remembers seeing her, and Scott is sentenced to death for murdering his wife. His secretary Kansas (Ella Raines) is not convinced of his guilt and goes in search of the woman who can save him from the death penalty. <br /> <br /> This is a good movie and the viewer is 100% behind Kansas attempts to find the truth. We follow her through some memorable scenes, such as her pursuit of Mac the Bartender (Andrew Tombes) at night and the claustrophobic locale where Cliff the drummer (Elisha Cook Jr) takes her along, drinks and dances while joining jam his friends. This is such a stark depiction of sexual desire that it is an outstanding part of the movie as everyone sweats intensely and rhythmically for the duration of the scene. Ella Raines is good in the female lead and Thomas Gomez makes a sympathetic policeman. Alan Curtis started well as a confused, innocent man, but when he was arrested, his performance took a left turn as he became uncomfortable with Kansas. God knows why she stayed with him. <br /> <br /> The film does not tell you who the killer is, as we know it in the middle of the movie, but that does not matter. In fact, this adds to the excitement and dramatic evolution of the story as we Kansas find out what's going on and then get the hell out! It's a good movie with great scenes, but although Elisha Cook Jr has a memorable role, I just never like him in something I see him. Someone hands me a tie .....
