Hitokiri (which roughly translates as "assassination"), a / k / a "Tenchu", roughly translated as "divine punishment", shows Hideo Gosha at the top of his mold. DO NOT miss this or Goschas other classic, Goyokin! Hitokiri is not only one of Gosha's best films, it's also one of the best "Samurai / Chambara" movies ever made, and perhaps one of the best Japanese films ever to be exported. <br /> <br /> Be Forewarned, All Complicated The details of the plot in Hitokiri may be a little hard to follow for those unfamiliar with 19th-century Japanese history. The underlying human drama, however, is obvious and open to all viewers. As usual with Gosha, Hitokiri offers another variation on his traditional theme of "loyalty to his master" compared to "doing the right thing". However, Gosha develops his favorite subject with such sophistication that it really is the movie (along with Goyokin of course). <br /> <br /> I think it breaks down like this: If you want a simpler, more action-oriented story, you might want to see Goyokin. However, if you want a more thoughtful, multi-layered (if grim) drama, you will find it. <br /> <br /> (OK, OK, essentially, the historical background is a huge power struggle between many different Samurai clans that are either (1) endeavoring to reform but retain the Tokugawa Shogunate and (2) those who try to install Emperor Meiji as the supreme ruler of Japan Of course, the clans who worked for "Emperor Meiji" were often less interested in "reforming" Japan than giving his own clan more power in the " Ironically, the entire feudal system was officially abolished as one of the Meiji government's first reforms, so ironic twists - Gosha's great irony - that makes the entire plot all the bittersweet.) <br /> <br /> What? " Hitokiri "is different from Goshas other films, Goshas is mature sense of cinematography. Each shot is thoughtfully composed, and (like Kubrick's Barry Lyndon) every frame of the film could claim itself to be a still image. This is of course typical Gosha. Hitokiri is characterized by breathtaking scenery, including (as in Goyokin) many fascinating seascapes. Just look at the opening sequence and you're addicted! Make no mistake, this is not an English play: Hitokiri is extremely violent (do not say you have not been warned). <br /> <br /> What sets Hitokiri apart from cool camera work? The performances seem a bit more subtle to me. Katsu Shintaro (by Zatoichi / Hanzo, the razor-fame) presents himself in a star performance as a conflict-filled protagonist / anti-hero Okada Izo. Katsu manages to impart humanity to a man who seems to be almost more of a wild animal than a villain. Throughout the movie you are never quite sure if you are busy with Okada's character. At the same time, Katsu's portrayal of Okada's greedy respect for respect and his later pitiful attempts at salvation seem so human that one can not help but feel empathy / compassion. After Nakadai Tatsuya played the tortured hero in "Goyokin", it's great that he plays such a ruthless villain in "Hitokiri". He is just perfect, there is nothing left to say! <br /> <br /> As a final note, perhaps more interesting for fans than for casual fans, do not miss the last screen of Mishima Yukio (yes, the closed gays) right-wing ultra-nationalist writer who committed suicide by seppuku before the crowd Japanese military, which he "kidnapped" in 1970, filmed a film about his life and work by Paul Schrader), who is actually a pretty solid portrayal of the honorable (for an assassin) Shinbei Tanaka.
