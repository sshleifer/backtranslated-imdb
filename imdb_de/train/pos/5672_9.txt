In this episode of the series, Edmund Blackadder feasts in the British Regency era (during the later section of George III.). This time the prospects for Blackadder are much worse - because he is a servant of the very, very fat George IV (the Preisregent) instead of the king. Contrary to George IV's historical accounts, this one is about as bright as a tomato, and as a result, Blackadder can take advantage of it and plan to his heart's content. The only major difference in style between this and earlier is that the series ends on a very, very, very different note - you just have to see it to believe it. Apart from that, all the usual story elements are there and the show is hilarious. The only reservation I have (as always) is that this show is not suitable for children due to its rough language and adult situations.
