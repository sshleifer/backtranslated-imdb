A film that dramatizes an understandable aversion to the inevitable coming of World War II when a Spanish Republican sent by his soon overthrown government (Charles Boyer) searches in England and seeks to seek support for his cause reach out to the wealthy Mine owners to sell coal to the fascists in Spain. He annoys the locals, is convincingly beaten in a scene, and later faced in the movie with an angry crowd of miners who see him as another threat to their shaky livelihood. Regardless of the socio-economic hierarchy, xenophobia and world politics, this film skillfully plunges into a dark and exciting intrigue in which unfaithful compatriots of Katina Paxinou and Peter Lorre are played. The film is filmed in numerous darkly lit scenes by James Wong Howe and manages to get under the skin more than once.
