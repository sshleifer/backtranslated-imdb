If you have trouble dreaming, you can give this movie a low rating. But you just have to realize that this movie was not meant for everyone, but only for people with a sense of humor. For these people, the movie is great! It plays in old science fiction films and radio programs that did not exist anymore. In terms of Spaceballs and Airplane 2, you may need to broaden your imagination to get jokes, but it's worth it.
