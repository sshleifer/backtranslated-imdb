All dogs go to heaven is on par with Watership Down for eerie kids movies. Both were dark and quite scary, but at the same time the most fascinating experience a child can have. This was one of my favorite movies as a kid. I fell in love with Charlie and at the tender age of five or six, I admit ... I was in love with a cartoon dog. All Dogs tells the dark story of the lovable Cad Charlie and his criminal Itchy. The story begins with Charlie escaping death row and chatting to the next club to play. Of course, as a kid, I did not understand the concept of this film. I loved the songs and the animation, but as I got older, I wonder why I was not disturbed as a teenager by this movie. It covers pretty adult themes - gambling, murder, hell, and jail, but in a world of Goody Goody Disney movies, every kid should be seen once. <br /> <br /> Yes, there is some kind of crazy transvestite crocodile scene, and the hell scenes make me more scared now when I was little, but it delivers such a poignant message that parents do not ignore should!
