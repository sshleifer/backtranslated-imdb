In the US also called "Stairway to Heaven". During the Second World War, the British plane Peter Carter (David Niven) is shot down in combat, but he survives. He meets and falls in love with beautiful June (Kim Hunter). But it seems as if a mistake had been made in heaven - he should have died! A French ghost comes to get him, but he refuses. He will soon plead before a Heavenly Tribunal for him to live. <br /> <br /> Sounds ridiculous, but that's really an incredible movie. The script is good with the actors who play the roles completely straight and are beautifully directed - the scenes on Earth are in stunning technicolor (I have never seen such a beautiful blue sky) and the scenes in the sky are in black and white ! Niven is sometimes a bit stiff, but Hunter is just great (and very pretty) and Roger Livesey is great as a doctor trying to help Niven. The pictures are all amazing (especially the stairs and during the final test sequence) and the special effects are really great (considering the age of the movie). There is also a very strange sequence when Niven meets a completely naked boy who keeps sheep! This is an absolutely beautiful, thought provoking film - highly recommended. This is still unknown in the US, which is a pity.
