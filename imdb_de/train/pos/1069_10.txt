I bought Dark Angel seasons 1 and 2 two weeks ago after seeing some episodes of the first season on Channel 5. Nothing prepared me for how brilliant the show is. I have not enjoyed so much since Firefly (even on an amazing show). I'll admit Season 2 is not that good, but there are still some amazing episodes (see Designate, Bag 'Em, Berrisford's agenda, Harbor Lights, Freak Nation, etc.) and Alec is awesome. I've heard some plans for Season 3 coming up and I have to say I can not believe it was canceled - I will not spoil it for you - but it would have rocked! I also think it has a lot of potential as a film (though it seems highly unlikely at the moment). Proof of my obsession is Max's barcode number 332960073452, and in the two weeks I've had it, I've lost three episodes of seeing both seasons twice. It's just too good.
