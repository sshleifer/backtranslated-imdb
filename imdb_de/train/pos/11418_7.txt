I saw this movie for the first time during an international film study course. I am a "non-traditional" student and, perhaps because of years of experience or gaining wisdom, appreciated the slow, reflective tempo of the film's narrative. The story, exhausted by the heat and dust of a dry climate, is deeply psychological, full of multi-faceted symbolism and an articulated reversal of the theme of "the other" in a country one does not understand. The understanding that comes is associated with the unresolved memories and the subjectivity of the outsider. Made almost 20 years ago, it is also a forerunner in a genre of many other international films that deal with colonial issues in colonialized spaces, ignoring the nuances of the cultures in which they have entered. Much more elaborately filmed - and heavily funded - works that have been made since then reflect the same themes: Indochine, nowhere in Africa are two that may make Chocolat appear pale and boring by comparison. It has no adrenalin action or extreme violence. The fighting is mental, emotional and subtle. But it's a nice movie worth visiting.
