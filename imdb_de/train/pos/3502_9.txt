Impressive! I loved this movie and LOVE Judy Marte !! This girl is not only a great pretty face, she is funny and really talented !! She often made me laugh just because I was very naturally with Victor, who desperately beat her! We will see a lot in the coming years ... and probably also by director Peter Sollett and co-star Victor Rasuk! <br /> <br /> Raising Victor Vargas is one of the best movies I have ever seen a long time! Very refreshing! It's true, nice, funny, well filmed, it has everything: good story, good actor, good movie direction! <br /> <br /> If you like simple, slow, real life, city movies like Jersey Girl by Kevin Smith, you'll love Victor Vargas! It is better!
