The British newspaper reviews seem to have focused on the fact that the reviewers get to know Toby Young, the journalist on whose real experiences this film is based. The keyword here is "based". How To Lose Friends is a fictional Romcom. <br /> <br /> Sidney Young comes to a prestigious gossip magazine in New York, where he gradually gaffs before he finally gets it right. This means that it is sold out, and the film has some serious issues regarding journalistic integrity. However, they are not exaggerated: the main substance remains a comedy centered on Sidney's mishaps. The script has its cake and eats that Sidney is a stupid, well-intentioned buffoon and at the same time a smart, moderately offensive capable writer. This contradiction is never so important because Simon Pegg (as Sidney) projects sympathy too well. Jeff Bridges overwrites Sidney's editor a little too effectively, and Kirsten Dunst is more of an anonymous object of Sidney's affections as a conflictive event. And with regard to Megan Fox (who plays an Airhead bimbo star), all I can say is this: Just say the word Miss Fox, and I'll leave my wife, sell all my things, and buy me a plane ticket to take my place by your side as your wife. Of course, if I'm a fat 56-year-old English accountant, my offer will not be too tempting, but it's on the table anyway. Given the short career of her career, Megan Fox may have come too early to take on a role that mercilessly is the kind of actress she is supposed to be. However, she does it sweet, with some skill and extremely sexily. This girl will go far. <br /> <br /> There is strong support from a variety of experienced performers - Miriam Margolyes and Bill Paterson from the United Kingdom, Gillian Anderson and Danny Huston from the USA. <br /> <br /> There are some laughing moments and I smiled all the way through. As always, the F-word appears when it's not really necessary, though at least some of them are very funny.
