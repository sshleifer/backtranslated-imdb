"Before Sunrise" is a wonderful love story and must be one of my Top 5 favorite movies. Dialogue and acting are great. I love the characters and their ideas and thoughts. Of course, the romantic Vienna that was featured in the movie does not exist (no poet sits by the river in the middle of the night) and it's not possible to reach all locations in one night either (especially if you're a stranger and it's your first night in Vienna). but that is not the point. The relationship of the two characters is much more important and this part of the story is by no means unrealistic. Although nothing really happens, the movie never gets boring. The end is really sad, without being "Titanic" or something. Even if you do not like love stories, you should watch this movie! I am a little skeptical of the sequel that will be released in the summer. The first part is perfect in my opinion.
