My wife and I have seen this whole series at least three times. I can not imagine how it could be better. This is not the "complete" story of World War II - no library could contain such a story, but it is the best summary of this story. Many details, many personal stories and yet keep the overall picture in view. Olivier's story is superbly written and, of course, excellently written. The interviews are from all sides except the Russian, because the producers were not allowed to speak with many Russians. It is worth to have this complete program on DVD. We appreciate our copy. <br /> <br /> The producer does a great job of delivering pictures and action where there is almost no archive left: there are almost no movies of convoys and submarine battles, but still the episode on this topic is very well done.
