Caught this movie at the Arizona International Film Festival. I did not expect much (although the festival director told me that this was one of the best submitted films). After five minutes I was sold. This movie is shot in B & W for a cheap price and is hilarious. The effect is solid, the writing is solid and the look of the film is solid. Acting is probably the biggest revelation, as most movies shot on low budgets have amateur or stage character. Not this one. It shows one of the most convincing, lovable, and funny depictions of a figure with Tourette syndrome I've ever seen. The plot is confused, without being confusing and scary, without being in vain. If you have the chance, watch this movie. Filmmakers like Majkowski (hopefully I got it right) deserve the chance to make their stuff accessible to a wider audience.
