This is a lukewarm docu-drama that does not break new ground, that all clich√©s are overworked and that the facts are sloppy. For example, Munich is a very flat city. Why is it hilly in the movie? For example, the end of the First World War in 1918 was not a capitulation but a truce. However, it is announced as surrender. For example, European news providers (and none) have made headlines as they haggle over their papers. However, this strictly American custom is used in the film. For example, the Nazis did not adopt the German eagle until after the seizure of power, but there he stands on the rostrum, as Hitler supplies one of his root winder. In fact, most of this disappointing production consists of little more than the Hitler Oratorio. The film also perpetuates the myth that the coup of the beer hall in the Munich Hoffbrauhaus had hatched. It was not. Robert Carlyle portrays his topic very well. But his understudy is sufficient at best and very often not even that. These comments only refer to the first episode. One can only hope that the second will get better, but do not bet on it.
