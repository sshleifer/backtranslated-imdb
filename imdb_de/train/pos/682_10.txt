This is one of my favorite movies of all time, and although it moves too slowly for some, it's worth watching. A company lawyer (Richard Chamberlain) is involved in a case involving "city" derivatives, and this is not an ordinary case. OK, a man died, but it was not a normal murder. There has also been an above-average rainfall lately, and the atmosphere of most movies is a bit claustrophobic and depressing. The Aborigines harbor a secret and refuse to spill the beans. This has a lot to do with white men making assumptions about "city" and "tribal" aegigines, and of course no big city subscriptions would practice tribal practices. Um Chamberlain has weird dreams and somehow he's the key to what happens, though no matter how many times I've seen it, I can not quite understand the exact connection. This is a very scary and creepy movie and a good example of Peter Weir's ability to create tensions out of nothing. The end is a bit ambiguous, but I take it literally, it's the easiest and scariest way out. 10 out of 10 and highly recommended.
