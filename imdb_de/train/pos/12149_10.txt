I agree with another user here and have to say that this is one of the best kung fu movies ever! I saw that as a kid and was totally excited! The scaffolding scenes are brilliant and you can really empathize with this guy because he's treated as an outsider. Nice humor and fantastic kung fu movie rock this movie! If you like Kung Fu, you would love that !!!
