Since the Pate saga was the view of the Mafia from the executive suite, this series is a complex mafia story from the perspective of the worker. If you have never seen this show, you can expect an expanded pleasure. Yes, there is violence and nudity, but it is never unfounded and needed to confront Tony Soprano, the thinking man's gangster, with the reality of the life he was born into, and frankly, he would not have known how he would do so many of his employees have landed. Tony Soprano can discuss Sun Tzu with his therapist, then kill a man with a pan in a tantrum and, while he dismembers and eliminates the body with his nephew, take a break, sit down and watch peanut eating butter out of the glass, and give this nephew advice on his upcoming marriage as if they had just spent a Sunday afternoon watching the NFL football. Even Carmella, his wife, who has been given a chance to find a way out, finds that she has really preferred life with Tony and its benefits and considered his indiscretions as opposed to life itself. If you followed the whole thing, you know how it ends. If not, trust me, you've never seen a TV show like this.
