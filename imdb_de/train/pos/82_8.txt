Luckily for us real McCoy fans (most likely all Baby Boomers who grew up in the late 50's and 60's), three of the adult actors / actresses appeared when they did 2000 for the reunion show shortly thereafter. As gratifying as it was to see Luke, Sugar Babe and Pepino back together, it was just as puzzling that Lydia Reed and Michael Winkleman were not mentioned. In my understanding, Little Luke passed away in 1999, but I do not know how. There is no information about Hassie on the internet that I can find. Very curious, why they were not even mentioned? It was so striking, her absence from reunification, that I suspect that the family of Michael and Lydia herself (if she is still alive), 1) asked to be excluded from the discussion, and therefore her wish was fulfilled or TNN could not find anything from either Michael or Lydia (like all of us), they seemed to have disappeared. Therefore, it would be the safest policy to let them all out of the conversation together. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, looking back on Walter Burning was wonderful. They did not object ... it was the grandpa who made the show so successful. I remember when I was a child imitating Grandpa's Gimp Walk and my parents were laughing (I'm sure a million other kids did it then). One annoyance that bothered me a bit was Richard Crenna's tendency to dominate the discussion. Sometimes they interrupted Tony and Kathleen to say something. Although Tony Martinez was apparently perfectly capable of contributing to the conversation, he was not allowed to talk too much during the reunion show. Unfortunately, because I wanted to hear about all three equally. All in all, the Reunion Show was a real treat for me. I have seen it several times on DVD and I liked it every time. <br /> <br /> Dodgerdude
