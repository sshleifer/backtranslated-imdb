In my opinion, this review may contain spoilers, but I like watching movies without knowing what's going to happen. So I think that many of the other reviews here in this movie contain spoilers! I've just watched this movie again, and I have to repeat that it has the best ending for any movie. Ever. Ever. Ever. Strangely enough, the actual translation "Hitting the Wings of the Butterfly" is not used as a translated title. I suppose they thought most Americans would not know what Chaos Theory is (except those who have seen or read Jurassic Park). The film is based on chaos theory and how a small event can influence the outcome of seemingly unrelated events, all of which are traced back to an event. The movie is a whirlwind of miraculous cause and effect as we follow the chain of chaos as it finds itself between several characters (about 20?). In a way, the end seems unavoidable, but if you think about it, it's a perfect ending. Remember "what else needed to be said"? It is also a very courageous ending. Too bad we have to go overseas for a jewel like this, but an end like this would NEVER come out of Hollywood. <br /> <br />
