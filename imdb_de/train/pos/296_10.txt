Sublimacy is the path we need to reach for The Beauty. And the grandeur is the stuff this movie is made of. If not his best, then it's my favorite of all Bogdanovich films. <br /> <br /> Like most of the director's other films, this unique masterpiece reminds us of what life is (or should be) about: love, lost (or failing), and hope and faith and charity. As the song of which the film has its title (Gershwin's well-known composition), the film makes the impossible true and tries to make us realize that no one can judge anyone; All this with the ease of a comedy and the time of a masterly direction (the first ten minutes, with the detectives following the ladies almost without a dialogue line) built on the looks and views of the characters - with this "Bogdanovich touch" based on the point of view - is a class for Cinema Language (something that PB learned well from his admired directors in the Golden Age of Movies). With a stellar cast and a great soundtrack (including the best of Sinatra's "Trilogy"), this film of self-esteem and compassion and far from self-enjoyment and emptiness (as some critics have written it) deserves a better place on the history of American cinema than where it was placed. It is not "long on style, little substance": It is complex in its simplicity and beautiful, absolutely beautiful.
