Peter Sollett has created a charming portrait of real people living in poverty on the Lower East Side of New York or Loisaida, as the locals call it. <br /> <br /> Mr. Sollett's heart is in the right place as he examines this dysfunctional family that is typical of the various "inner cities" of the country. Mr. Sollett emphasizes the positive in his story. These are basically good children, the children of parents who have left them and whose grandmother has taken under their wing. <br /> <br /> Instead of presenting his characters as losers, Mr. Sollett shows a positive side that everyone has. These children are not drugged or stealing because they are poor. If this story had been made by Hollywood, we would have seen a parade of stereotypes instead of children fighting, but deep inside they are not defeated. Victor Rasuk, like Victor Vargas, was a revelation. He is a natural. This is Juli Marte. Her character shows us a sober girl who can not be fooled or made to do something she does not want to do. Altagracia Guzman, as grandmother is excellent. She expresses her frustration that she can not steer her grandchildren into the things she believes in and that are so important to her. All in all, this was a great picture thanks to Peter Sollett.
