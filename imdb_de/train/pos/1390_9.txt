If you love 1970s cult sci-fi like me, or if you like movies like "Repo Man" or "Buckaroo Bonzai," then you'll love this movie. It's a stream of 70s science fiction awareness, including a 22nd-century junkyard and the earth in a million years. This movie is pure 70s. Put on Steve Miller's "Fly Like An Eagle" or "Dark Side Of The Moon" by Pink Floyd and off you go!
