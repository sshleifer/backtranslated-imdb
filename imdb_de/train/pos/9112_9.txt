Being a Portuguese half does not blind me when talking about Portuguese films. Not that I do that very often anyway. But this movie was such an adrenaline rush! Yes, that's right - it was mostly true in terms of history - but it has spared no effort to venture beyond the usual Portuguese film area: things like using real locations in the midst of low-traffic Lisbon and recruiting a real crowd of people the real mass of almost 30 years ago. And by God they got it right! OK, to summarize: very emotional, if you have experienced it, but you will notice minor improvements that could be made, as well as necessary necessities. If you look at it only at random, you can expect a good historical trumpet, which comes only from recent history and offers a little more thought than usual. Even by European standards yes.
