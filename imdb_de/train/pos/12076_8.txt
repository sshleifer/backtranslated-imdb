This was a typical 1940s Hollywood grade B film, but far beyond its expectations. Why? It has a wonderful storyline and is supported by Nina Foch, George MacReady and Dame May Witty as the female villain. <br /> <br /> If a young lady responds to a secretary, she will undoubtedly get more than she expected. The only talents her employers seek are the ones that will lead to her death. Apparently Witty and MacReady want to spend her as a daughter-in-law and wife. MacReady has killed his real wife and wants to make Foch so that a corpse can be claimed. The film is about how Foch tries to believe the city's inhabitants and how they practically thwart everything she does. Why do not people believe her?
