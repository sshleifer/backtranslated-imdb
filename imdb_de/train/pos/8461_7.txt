Since the title will be listed as English in English and IMDb lists in the main language of the show, I will focus on the English version of Gundam Wing (2000) featured in the Bandai-published DVD series. My actual review for the entire series is in IMDb's entry of "" Shin kido senki Gundam W "(1995). <br /> <br /> Very little is changed in terms of plot, script and characterization of its adaptation to English and it It really depends on your own taste in which language you want to watch this show.Purisists can follow what they want in Japanese, but for a more "realistic" experience, I recommend the English track, as all characters except Heero Yuy are not Japanese are (Most of them are actually Caucasian with a few non-Japanese Asians.) On the one hand, the personalities of the characters are more "direct" than in the Japanese version, and the contrast between the characters is stronger thanks to some-or-take appearances Wing Gundam's pilot, Heero Yuy, is a well-trained soldier who suppresses his emotions, but slowly realizes the value of his men Learning from Mark Hildreth, who does it Deadpan delivery can be criticized as "bad acting" - it fits very well with Heero's personality. <br /> <br /> Deathscythe duo Maxwell of Gundam, always happy in the face of death, receives a crash course in which the value of life and his friends is valued. He is possibly the best-played character in the entire show, masterfully played by Scott McNeil. He may sound a bit too old for his age, but Duo's English voice ranks slightly with his irritatingly nasal Japanese voice. <br /> <br /> Trowa, the pilot of Heavyarms, is a lost, lonely soul who has so far only had a sense of struggle. Despite his inner longing to make connections with the people around him, he only knows how you kill, do not make friends. Kirby Morrow gives as Trowa Barton a grim, but realistic performance. <br /> <br /> The winner of Quatre Rebarba is voiced by Brad Swaile, who has no trouble finding out the caring nature of the character and the destruction of his innocence during the horror of firsthand war and death. A big plus is that Quatre no longer sounds like a girl (and yes, he is voiced in the Japanese version of a female actress), but a good typical 15 -year-old guy. <br /> <br /> The impulse, but determined Wufei Chang, voiced by Ted Cole, seems a bit exaggerated, but he stands in stark contrast to the rather subdued roles of Heero and Trowa. Relena Darlian sounds older in English and is voiced by Lisa Ann Bailey. This may not suit her youthful personification at the beginning of the series, but as her character later grows into the story, her voice follows the suit and fits very well into character development. <br /> <br /> Zech's Merquise would do one of the drastically altered voices compared to the Japanese version. Both voices bring out different sides to the same character. His Japanese voice is haughty, authoritarian and deserves respect and is consistent with his high status and charismatic nature. His English voice of Brian Drummond is more restrained, sounds rather daunting and "snakelike" and underlines Zech's mysterious nature in terms of his hidden goals and his confident belief in his ideals. The members of OZ are a mixed bag really. Treize Kushrenada, voiced by David Kaye, has a more realistic and down-to-earth performance compared to his larger-than-life Japanese style of speaking. However, Lady Une does not convey her divisive personality in the opposite way as in the Japanese version, and Lucrencia Noin just sounds ... boring. The cannon fodder pilots and the military leaders do not speak either. <br /> <br /> I would have appreciated if they had taken the time to give different characters different accents to reflect their ethnic backgrounds. The voices of Maganac Corp were generally uninspired, but could have been more interesting with Middle Eastern accents. The members of the Romerfeller Foundation also sounded better with a noble European accent that reflects their nobility status. <br /> <br /> Although the minor characters are too few actors, the main characters succeed in wearing the show in a generally less exaggerated and realistic rendition of Gundam Wing's script. Very faithful to the original Japanese script, which contains all the underlying ideas and ideas about politics, war and human nature. Unfortunately, it also retains the shortcomings of the original Japanese script.
