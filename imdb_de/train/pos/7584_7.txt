This PM Entertainment production is full enough to tell John Woo, "Enough!" Of course, it's not nearly as nice as Woo can deliver, but it'll be done in 90 minutes. Eric Phillips (Don Wilson) is a covert policeman in the near future. When his wife kills the governor from a team using a looking cyborg, it's up to Eric to erase her name. Wilson takes on Van Damme as he plays the heroic lead role and his evil cyborg doppelganger. Why the academy did not notice it, is not me. As PM production, there are tons of chases, exploding cars (4 in the first 5 minutes!) And shootings. I especially liked the van, which swings in the middle of the air, before it comes close to an exploding truck. My other favorite was that a girl from the neighborhood came to perfect her karate in Don's simulator. It's just a chance to show some cheap LAWNMOWER MAN effects around 1995.
