Dog Days are one of the most accurate movies I've ever seen to describe life in modern cities. It is very hard and cruel in some places and unfortunately very close to reality. Isolation, despair, deep emotional dead ends, problematic affairs, perversion, complexes, insanity. All the things that exist today in the big, advanced cities. Once again they recognize the compassionate state in which people lead society. <br /> <br /> The negative side of city life has never really been displayed on screen. I just wish it was a lie. Unfortunately not. That's why ... 10/10.
