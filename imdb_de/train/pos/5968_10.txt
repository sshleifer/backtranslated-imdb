If you come across such a jewel, you will realize why the 1980s were the greatest decade to live through. The rock music ruled and also the movies ... especially the horror movies. The filmmakers knew how to entertain us, and "Trick or Treat" is obvious. Rocker Sammi Curr, most likely after W.A.S.P. Singer Blackie Lawless dies in a hotel fire, his # 1 fan Eddie is disturbed. He goes to Friend & Local DJ Nuke (Gene Simmons) for help. Nuke gives him a copy of the last shot Sammi made; This is the only copy available. It was given to the radio station to be played live Halloween night. Anyway, if Eddie plays it, Sammi will bring it back. He helps Eddie with the thugs in the school, but then gets out of control. It's definitely a great movie. The bad thing is that this movie is out of print. I paid $ 25.00 to finally get it from eBay. You should also ... well laid out!
