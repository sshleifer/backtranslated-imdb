A documentary without words lost ... always ... <br /> <br /> Let's say that the narrative is more than a spoof, let's say it's a commentary on Japanese society. And since this movie is as fast as an absurdist documentary, the constant wordplay is as fast as it gets, and as poorly translated as it is - in its current festival screener version, as seen tonight at Copenhagen's Cinematek is always still very pleasing. <br /> <br /> But for the patients and ONLY the really patient and open-minded people, I'm talking to Jim Jarmusch fans with ADD relapses. I think that's a movie for you. It's a smart movie if you let it convince you. <br /> <br /> Very nice and pretty cheesy and pretty Japanese. And pretty experimental. Static 2D in a 3D world. All in all a fun for all who want to see a Japanese movie that falsifies the Japanese food culture. A thumbs up, if you feel like something else.
