Gandhi, my father, looks like a book, read chapter by chapter (with your eyes) and learn more about Harilal Gandhi and beyond Kasturba Gandhi. About both is so little known and this film describes them clearly. However, the title is misleading, it is a film about Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi and his son and about Harilal and his mother. And Akshaye Khanna and Shefali Chayya live up to their respective roles. <br /> <br /> Such films are like leap years. They only come after so much time. <br /> <br /> Gandhi, My dad, is also about an inner struggle that is sometimes more difficult than any freedom fight ever undertaken. <br /> <br /> If you like quality cinema.
