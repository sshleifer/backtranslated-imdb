I really miss the production of good old fashion Spooky movies. If Ismail Merchant and James Ivory had been given the task of producing such a film, it could have been this film, apart from the lack of an internationally known top caster. This is one of those movies that you see alone on a dark night with a pizza and some popcorn, and you do not have to deal with the dishes until the morning because you just want to hide under the blanket. Bravo to director Herbert Wise, authors Susan Hill and Nigel Kneale, top production design by Jon Bunker, art direction by John Ralph, and a superb cast that makes me shudder and feel so isolated even though I'm one of the most densely populated Cities live in the world at the beginning of the 21st century. I gave him a "9" out of "10" because they were really pulled off a great show because of the production and budget constraints of television.
