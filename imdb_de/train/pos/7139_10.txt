John Thaw by Inspector Morse Fame plays the old Tom Oakley in this movie. Tom lives in a tiny English village during 1939 and the beginning of World War II. A bit retired, Tom has not yet recovered from the death of his wife and son when he served in the First World War. If you can imagine that Inspector Morse was old and retired, twice as crooked as when he was a police officer, then you have the figure of Tom Oakley. London children are evacuated before the lightning. The young William (Willie) Beech is charged with the protesting Tom. Willie is well played by Nick Robinson. <br /> <br /> This boy needs care with a capital C. After school, still getting his bed wet and unable to read, are the smallest of his problems. He comes from a terrible background in London, with a mother who can not cope, to say the least. <br /> <br /> Slowly but steadily, man and boy warm each other. Tom discovers again his ability to love and care. And the boy learns to accept this love and care. Watch as Tom and Willie build a bomb shelter at the end of their garden. See Willie's delight over his probably first birthday party, which is hosted by Tom. <br /> <br /> Not to betray the end, but Willie is adopted by Tom after much struggle and the couple begins a new life that is much richer for their mutual love. <br /> <br /> In this film, Thaw and Robinson follow in a long series of films in which the man meets a boy and develops a mutual love. See the late Dirk Bogarde and Jon Whiteley in Spanish Gardener. Or Clark Gable and Carlo Angeletti in "It started in Naples". Or Robert Ulrich and Kenny Vadas in Captains Courageous. Or Mel Gibson and Nick Stahl in "Man without a Face". <br /> <br /> Two interesting points. This is the only performance of Thaw I know where he sings. Just a verse from a hymn, New Jerusalem, but he sings. Second, the young Robinson starred in a second film with "Tom" in the title "Tom's Midnight Garden," based on a classic children's novel.
