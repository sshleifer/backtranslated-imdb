I immediately realized that this movie is really not based on Dodie Smith's novel. Anyway, it was a nice idea that Pongo and Perdita's son now had their own puppies. The cutest of the Dalmatians, of course, was the little snowball, which was completely flawless until the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> To be honest, I did not know what to think when Cruella de Vil changed nicely. In fact, I've often thought about the possibility that she could make friends, but now that she has so quickly changed back into "herself" and announced that she's Cruella again, I was almost worried about Chloe's Dalmatian , Actually, the scene where the puppies watched Lady and the tramp while Chloe and Kevin had dinner was much better than I expected. I was also thrilled with the parrot that played as a dog and it was unbelievable that the dogs had learned so many tricks for this movie. <br /> <br /> Of course I was satisfied that the Dalmatians were finally rescued, but I would have liked to know what would happen to Cruella after she lost all her belongings. And what can the house of the dogs do with so much money? <br /> <br /> After all, it was pretty touching that Snowball stained at the very end of the film.
