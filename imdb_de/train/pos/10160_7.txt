I went into this movie and thought it was a fucking B-rated movie. I came out surprised and very amused. Eva was good, but Lake Bell stole the show. She had an amazing comedic timing. The jokes in this movie were surprisingly original and very funny, with one or two flat jokes in between. The plot was enough to tie everything together, a woman (Eve) dies on her wedding day and comes back to chase the wife going out with her husband, it sounds farfetched, but it works pretty well well. <br /> <br /> 7/10 - All in all, it's a worthwhile movie watch if it does not appear on DVD when it comes out.
