When I saw this movie for the first time, I fell in love with it. The atmosphere was what drew my attention in the first place. I had expected a gore feast, but instead I had to watch a highly intelligent killer mess with a shuddering soundtrack (at the moment it's my wrestler: P). The fact that I could not predict when he would kill and when he would disappear was a big plus in my book. Predictable horror movies bore me. Well, I know that the story had some disagreements, but if you're like me, you'll notice them long after the movie, and you'll lie down in bed because you've just seen a masterpiece movement. The soundtrack is, as I said, timeless. It's one of my favorite plays, so I'm delighted to hear that Rob Zombie leaves it untouched in his remake. Speaking of remake, I have read a very detailed article about it, and now that I know that Mr. Zombie worships John Carpenter, I have great hope that he will accept this classic. This movie is great for any time you have a craving for a tingling spine, but it's the perfect match, the opener or the finale. They call it an All Hallow's Eve marathon. :)
