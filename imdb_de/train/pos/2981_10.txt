Why is this movie rated so bad ?! I've seen this movie over 25 times, I know every line of this movie. It's obvious that I love this movie. Trey Parker and Matt Stone (creators of South Park and the new puppet masterpiece Team America) play the main characters Joe Cooper or Coop "Airman" Cooper and Doug Remer or "Sir Swish". Mainly they are referred to throughout the movie only as Coop and Remer. Right at the beginning of the film, the film reminds of the money-hungry corrupt world of overpaid sports starts. They even go so far as to call themselves "Townsell". I have to cite that part of the movie because he's in with some sports starts: "And after playing for New England, San Diego, Huston, Saint Louis, a year for the Toronto Arganauts, and another season at the Desert Inn I am happy to finally be able to play here in the beautiful city of Miami. "His agent leans forward:" Minnesota ". Let us not forget this important piece of the film. So it starts that Coop and Remer are at a reunion party in high school and realize that they are still nothing when they talk to their old classmates. Outside, they create the sport BASEketball after being challenged by presumably high school basketball heroes. After being ashamed, the sport becomes professional in about a year. During this time, they manage to recruit their third teammate Squeak, who is actually one day after the invention of the game. As the movie follows, we learn that Coop, Remer, and Squeak are the only virtuous sports heroes. The story follows with crazy blackmail, the cheerleaders of Milwaukee Beers, and humor so absurd that you'll cry for more. Look at it, it's weird.
