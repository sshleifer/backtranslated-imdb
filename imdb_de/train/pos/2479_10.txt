(Sorry for my faulty language, I'm not a native speaker ...) Yes, this is a movie that almost requires an overwhelming response. Personally, I agree with all superlatives. But I do not use this rather halfway empty way to describe the movie here. Because those who "perfect! The only! Best-ever!" - Reviews make some people turn away (including me) Potential to compete with many theater and cinema artists - Then you should not miss this if you find it somewhere. (Unfortunately, not too many people will have a chance to see it.) It seems that there is no DVD and the German version - which is pretty well done - is not available in any format.) <br /> <br /> Only in case you decide to make a copy, save yourself the two hours (or so) shortened version of this movie. It is pointless and no fun and gives a false impression of a movie that deals interesting with river and architecture. And it is also crippled to 4: 3 aspect ratio. <br /> <br /> Greetings from Germany, F.L.
