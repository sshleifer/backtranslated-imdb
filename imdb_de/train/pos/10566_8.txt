I have never seen this movie and have enjoyed the singing and dancing of Cagney and the other performers, Dick Powell (Scott Blair), who had a great tenor voice, and Ruby Keeler (Bea Thorn). James Cagney plays the role of Chester Kent, who writes musicals and eventually produces prologues, which are shown between the feature films shown in the thirties in the cinema. Chester has problems with people trying to steal his ideas for his shows. This is a very entertaining movie with a lot of comedy and a lot of laughter. Joan Blondell (Nan Prescott) gave a great supporting role, which was also very young and pretty. Dick Powell was great as a singer and dancer and just started his long and successful screen career. Enjoy.
