I remember watching this movie on a Saturday afternoon on TV in the 1950s or '60s. It was well presented, but I remember that in one of the recent maniacal executions for impending liberation, a message of hope was sent out that sent out in Lampost leaked stations. I'm not sure the facts are the same as the facts. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, the movie is well done. The German High Command reported dry without emotion "The Russians move down the Fredrichstrasse", as if everything went according to plan. off based on the British historian Trevor-Roper with a similar title Last Days of Hitler. I was surprised to see Trevor-Roper disapproved. <br /> <br /> I agree that the latest German movie about DOWNFALL was just as well made as the classic. The American knock-off was a bit flat. <br /> <br /> Few numbers have attracted as much attention from the cinema as Adolph. Still, I find it interesting that none of the many films and books that have come out ever hinted at Hitler's doppelganger in John Toland's magnificent historical play. <br /> <br /> Was there?
