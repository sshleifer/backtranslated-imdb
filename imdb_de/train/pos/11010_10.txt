When The Matrix appeared in 1999, questioning existence and identity, it was expected that many films would use it as inspiration. This did not really come as a surprise and it took until 2002 before a movie with a similar theme appeared. But to say Cypher is a clone would lead to his discrediting. <br /> <br /> The story is about a Morgan Sullivan applying for a job at a high-flying techno company called Digicorp. His job is to be a spy and get information about a competing business while standing under an assumed and false identity. His domestic life is completely normal, but he has to lie to his wife about what he actually does. But things are starting to change on purpose, and before he knows what's going on, he asks who he is. This is not helped by a strange woman who shows up ... <br /> <br /> Twists and turns in every direction keep you absolutely mesmerized, and at no point does anything seem to be anything unimaginable or unbelievable a rousing journey through a not too distant future, and with good playability you will always stay at the height of your seat. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
