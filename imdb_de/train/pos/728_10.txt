The Ramones, whom I believe are the founders of modern punk rock, give their then unique sound an incredibly twisted film about a fast-paced rock fan (PJ Soles), who faces a ruthless, joyless principal (Mary Woronov) Rock. <br /> <br /> With a soundtrack full of unbelievable music, RRHS fascinates in concept and execution. It's full of riotous view worms (like the mouse experiment), teenage ghost (probably my favorite movie opening ever) and bizarre, off-the-wall moments (the straitjacket scenes). If you are looking for a movie that seems to be pure fun on a molecular level, look no further. But if you are looking for a beautiful, dignified, dramatic epic, you might want to look a little further. "Hello everybody, I'm Riff Randell and that's Rock & Roll High School!"
