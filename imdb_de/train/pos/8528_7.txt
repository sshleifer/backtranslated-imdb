I like Peter Sellers most of the time. I had never seen him until this movie. He does it pretty well, though you see Inspector Clouseau in the mix. It does not get interesting until Goldie Hawn arrives. <br /> <br /> I never expected the young Hawn to perform so well. Her timing was great and her expression was priceless. The way she shoots alternately Sellers horny character and seduces him, is nice to look at. Verbal sparring, as I have seldom seen from a movie of that time. <br /> <br /> The last thirty minutes of the movie fall flat. It is worth to see the first 60. Hawn is naked for a few glorious seconds early. Enjoy it...
