On MTV nativity scenes, all the hitters and hitters pull the classic movie Scarface out of their DVD collection. This might give you an idea that Scarface is a "gangster movie". Sure, there are gangsters and mobs, but that's not the point of Scarface. Tony Montana (Al Pacino) is just a Cuban refuge looking for a new way of life. He falls into the mob group and becomes a well-known drug lord. Montana was everything you wanted to do with your life. The classic phrase: "Say hello to my little friend!" is in Scarface. This quote is what always comes to mind when I think of Brian DePalma's movie Scarface. This is among my top 10 favorite movies. I would rate it *** 1/2 (from ****). Definitely a movie you have to see. PHENOMENAL.
