Poor Ivy: Although she was born to the born-way, she had the misfortune to marry a charming Wast (Richard Ney). As the film plays in the 1920s or 30s, when rigid Victorian class ideas began to fringe on the fringes, this uncertain status becomes overly annoying. The Gretorexes (as they are called) do not know where their next shilling comes from, but there are yacht parties and costume balls in classy colors that tempt them. When Ivy (Joan Fontaine) meets a wealthy older man (Herbert Marshall, who was born in middle age), she introduces him to one of her extravagant chapels. Fortunately, one of the Beaux she still takes with her (Patric Knowles) is a doctor whose consulting rooms provide a venom store to say goodbye to her husband. The fact that it implies Knowles does not get her into the stage a bit, even as the hours pass by until he should be hung by the neck until he is dead. The turn depends on the police inspector Sir Cedric Hardwicke; Knowles' mother (the suspect Lucile Watson); and the faithful housekeeper of Knowles (Una O'Connor). Sam Wood adds subtle accents to this far above-average melodrama. Fontaine's shining face delivers the rest.
