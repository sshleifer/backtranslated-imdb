and that is a very disturbing movie. I'm wrong, but this is the last movie where I saw Burt Reynolds as a real actor, who turned the role and sent a message. Jon Voight and Ned Beatty are also excellent. They are modest and unaware; Business people who want to enjoy the country. They did not know what would happen next. <br /> <br /> The photography and sets are realistic and natural. This was before the days of Wes Craven. <br /> <br /> What's most disturbing about this film is the fact that such places still exist. In America, peoples still abhor city dwellers; It has been almost one and a half centuries since the Civil War. <br /> <br /> You will enjoy this movie. It was filmed in the rural areas of southern Georgia that still exist. Just do not drive past Mobile, Alabama. This area has not been repaired since Hurricane Katrina. 10/10.
