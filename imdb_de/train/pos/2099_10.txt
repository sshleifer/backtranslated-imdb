That's great - wonderful drama, sets, clothes, music - but most of all the story itself. <br /> <br /> I'm amazed that there are not any more reviews on this movie - certainly one of the best 1980's. <br /> <br /> It is also a wonderful movie to be seen along with the great "Random Harvest", which has essentially the same opening crisis. <br /> <br /> - an unknown middle-aged English WWI The officer is in a hospital near the end of the war. He suffers from grenade shock and utter amnesia without knowing his name, background, or anywhere else where he belongs. He turns out to be a very wealthy established man. I will not remember the years before the war - <br /> <br /> But there the similarities of the films end. <br /> <br /> My heartfelt thanks go to all those who participated in the film - especially actor Ian Holm, Alan Bates, Ann Margret (what a great and surprising casting choice), Glenda Jackson, Julie Christie. <br /> <br /> This one stays with you forever.
