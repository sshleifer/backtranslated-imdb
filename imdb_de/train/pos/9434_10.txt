I remember watching this movie a few years ago on television and not paying full attention, maybe even missing the first half. I came to the conclusion that he was boring and overrated. I decided to revisit it last night to see if I had missed anything the first time. I certainly did. This is one of the most disturbing and amazing films of all time, and it clearly has a big impact on today's films and will probably do so forever. I can not believe that I thought this movie is boring! <br /> <br /> A young Jon Voight and Burt Reynolds show off their careers and are supported by Ned Beatty and Ronny Cox. This story will leave you with a feeling of disgust and fear, long after you've seen it, it's really awful. Oh, and did I mention that the title song is great, too? Well, that's it, and this movie should be seen by movie fans everywhere. <br /> <br /> Everyone should see this movie for the experience. Just do not expect a picnic.
