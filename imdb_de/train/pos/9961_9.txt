I have to give How She Move an almost perfect rating because the content is really great. As a previous reviewer commented, I have no idea how this movie was in the bottom 100 list of IMDBs! That's absolutely ridiculous! Other films - especially those that have the dance theme in common - can not give a candle to this film in the combination of first-rate, credible acting and amazing dance routines. From the beginning The underlying story (it's not just about winning a contest) is very simple and surprisingly realistic. None of the main characters is in any way two-dimensional, and at the end of the movie, it's very easy to emotionally empathize with them. (And even if you're not the crying guy, you could be a little whiny before the credits.) <br /> <br /> I can definitely recommend this movie to dance lovers and, even more, for those who want a gripping and appreciate well-done action. How She Move is of course not perfect (which movie is that?), But it's definitely a cut across movies that use pretty faces to hide a half-baked plot and / or characters that lack substance. The actors and settings in this film make for a very realistic ride that is equally mesmerizing thanks to the amazing talent of the dancers!
