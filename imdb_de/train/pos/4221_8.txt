I loved the episode, but it seems to me that there must have been a brief indication that the secretary is being punished for being an accomplice after the fact. I like it when an episode of Columbo has an unpredictable turn like this, but its dissolution should be part of the end of the episode, along with the killer's discovery. <br /> <br /> The interaction between Peter Falk and Ruth Gordon is priceless. At a certain point, Gordon, who plays a famous writer, commented on the flattery of the famous Lieutenant Columbo by referring to the detective's real detective as a crime detective. This is one of the best of many great Columbo rates.
