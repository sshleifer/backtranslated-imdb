The film is a real show of how unemployed and selfish the upper society has become. It has many characters and each character represents a different person category. No character is 100% good and moral unlike the heroes of all typical Indian films and no character is 100% bad, but all are just different. The film is a very perfect mix of emotions, drama and entertainment. For the first time, I liked a movie that raises some social issues. I would recommend to everyone to watch the movie. Madhavi Sharma is a journalist who covers Bollywood's hot-blooded parties for the newspaper, but this is the story of becoming a crime reporter for the newspaper. But that's not all. Then it shows that she could not survive there and when she helped save some innocent children, how brutally her voice is suppressed. Even she is fired from the job. Then she could not find a job as a crime reporter and has to do it again. Not only they, but a very large number of characters are interwoven in the film and all give a different feeling while watching the movie. I really want to congratulate the director for making such a great movie. Please do not afford to miss it.
