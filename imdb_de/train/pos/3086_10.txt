Here Italy (I am writing from Venice). Why canceled? The ABC should have given him the chance to build an audience. The cast (with Hope Davis, Campbell Scott, Erika Christensen, Zoe Saldana, Jay Hernandez and Bridget Moynahan) is one of the best I have seen lately. We need more shows like this one, where viewers feel they are intelligent individuals rather than thoughtless drones. I hope ABC will reconsider its decision or another station will pick it up.
