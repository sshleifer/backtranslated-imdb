People do not seem to give Lensman enough credit when it matters. A few issues were overlooked that are critical to understanding the Lensman experience. <br /> <br /> The Year: For the year Lensman (1984) was made, Lensman offers some of the most impressive effects I've ever seen. As a person looking at many animations from the early '80s, Lensman is unique in using seemingly computer-generated imagery at a time when computers were extremely primitive. Kim's fight against the geometric milling cores in the laser labyrinth is a prime example of this. Every time I watch, I have to say again and again that it was 1984, when it was done. <br /> <br /> The Soundtrack: Lensman has one of the craziest soundtracks I've ever heard, and this crazy hysteria beat pervades every corner of the movie. Lensman has borrowed heavily from two Western mistakes and managed to deal with the first thing - the need to fill every second of silence in a movie with music and the need for a heroine. While the music is well tuned and triggers scenes like the motorcycle battle in the Thionite factory on Radelyx, the heroic theme fails at the sheer trouble of Chris. It's interesting to note that the constant music thwarted my attempts at noise reduction when I archived lensman from an analog tape to a digital format - since there was no second of silence available as a reference point. <br /> <western influences: Helmut - sounds like "helmet" and has about the same voice as Darth Vader. Clarissa Fairborn - has the same hairstyle as the Princess of SW and her name sounds suspiciously similar to Marissa Fairborn of Transformers. Takes over the role of Han Solos, flying the ship and having technical knowledge. Buzzkirk - a significant improvement over Chewbaka. The lens - a beautiful concrete copy of the force that seems less than an opportunity to preach Christianity to the public, as in the original SW. While the power was much more than just concentration, the lens is a pure concentration agent. Theoretically everyone could use the lens. The lens is far less than the power - it is a pure defensive / offensive weapon. <br /> <br /> Technology: The Boskone Alliance has interesting meatball sponge vessels. They look like storm troopers only with red uniforms instead of white ones. The idea of ​​a DNA weapon would be nice if it had just been developed. The Galactic Alliance looked like Starblazers (or whatever it was called - this' 60s series fighting the Xylons). There were not enough ships to deliver battles - this was significantly improved in the second Lensman movie. <br /> <br /> Finally, a hint to Worzel. This character is a unique and very interesting character design that fortunately continues with the second movie. <br /> <br />
