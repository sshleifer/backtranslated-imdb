I did not know anything about the movie before I looked at it, and I think it was the "no expectation" factor that helped me endure first and later on like more than I expected. <br /> <br /> The setting was interesting, strange but interesting. The story had gaps / jumps that I think will shake off the audience a bit. There is no great soundtrack in the background that creates the "romantic" ambience. BUT they did not care. <br /> <br /> The chemistry between Emma and Luis was just exquisite. There was an inexplicable strange chemistry that I could not resist. I fell in love with her and here I write this review. The subtle love portrayal of the two actors was outstanding, and I think that's the essence of this film. <br /> <br /> This movie is not an everyday romantic comedy; In fact, not all of us will appreciate it. I had to sit for a while and slowly started to understand the little things that I did not understand at first. I can not guarantee that everyone will like it, but I hope you do.
