Especially for a time when not much science fiction was filmed (1973), this is a great vision of a future where everything went awry. Too many people and nothing works. The only people who can live in comfort are the rich. It's in New York in 2022 (I think) and reminds you of your worst vision of Calcutta. <br /> <br /> I appreciated Charlton Heston's acting after seeing him in Orson Welles' Touch of Evil. He was (perhaps he is) able to portray a number of heroic or semi-heroic people. Here he is torn between a policeman who is just a bit corrupt (taking rare foods from the rich) and totally corrupt (actively tolerating evil). <br /> <br /> The movie seems to be playing all night, and sweat drips from all but one of the rare air-conditioned apartments. Although I had not seen it before, I knew the famous end (which will not be revealed here), but the end is certainly anticipated. <br /> <br /> Great scenes with Edward G. Robinson: Go to the Council (consisting of older Jews with strong accents, it seems) where the truth is revealed. And then on to the Thanatopsis to try it out. <br /> <br /> Gritty, dystopian science fiction before Star Wars.
