I really like Miike's films about Yakuza, I saw this one about 2 years ago and it really did me good. Never seen such a sick and twisted thing. The story is good and the actors are doing very well. I have not seen the UK or Japan version, but I have to say that the German DVD is a bit censored. If you have not yet seen the movie and live in Germany, you might want to look for a DVD from the Netherlands or Austria. The I-ON DVD contains many very hard and unpleasant scenes, but at the showdown I felt like something was missing, like one or two very short scenes. <br /> <br /> All in all, a good perverted movie crazy characters and a high degree of violence, but I like Miike !!
