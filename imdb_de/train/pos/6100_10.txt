This is a really funny (and sexy) movie - not only stupid, but also great at acting. It's a kind of movie where the characters are so entertaining that you feel connected to everyone in the theater. I saw it at the Boston Film Festival, and I often laughed aloud with everyone else and also moved through some of the more serious parts of the movie. It's a unique movie about two doctors, and I do not want to reveal anything, but there are some powerful scenes that are really funny - and the dialogue is great. Wood Harris's character has a unique relationship with his girlfriend Zoe Saldana, and Brian White and Mya are also funny and sexy in their roles. If you get the chance to see it then you will not be disappointed. It is worth seeing again. Wood Harris deserves an award.
