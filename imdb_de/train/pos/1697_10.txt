Basically, this movie is one of those rare movies that you either hate and consider suicide as the next best thing, instead of going through two hours. Or, as in my case, you see it as a cult hit, one of those films in which humor, conspiracy, acting are in fact very hidden, but for those of us who are willing to look for it, and trust the director well. The reward is: U laugh at your A .. from !! The fact that you have to find the things mentioned above makes the movie even funnier because you have the impression that the director does not know how funny his movie is, which does not seem likely and in that the intelligence is at the top of it great project called Spaced Invaders !!
