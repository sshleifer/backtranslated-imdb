And my kids love it now! Granted, I can see it now and notice that the animation was not so great and that the plot is banal. Hey, if every Villianer introduces himself as "I'm DAAAARRRKK HEEEEAAARRT", I think you could laugh about it, but for little kids, that's a moral story with catchy music, that I remembered the words after watching this movie had not seen in twenty years. I would definitely suggest this for younger children.
