This movie surprised me. My friend told me that this movie is a "chicken movie". Boy, he was wrong! This movie has a great family atmosphere with no sex scenes like _other_ movies. Jake Gyllenhaal does an excellent job in Homer Hickams shoes. The side occupation is great as well. Science, growing up, family quarrels, a great train scene ... This movie has it all. The soundtrack is good, although the score is rather choppy. The music of the 50s beats the movie beyond the brink of greatness. <br /> <br /> The DVD is definitely worth the weight of coal. The replay value is great - I've seen it a few times.
