I do not think I have to tell you the story. Because it has been told for years and years. So I will just share my feelings. I saw Cinderella for the first time when I was five years old. From then on, I was a good Disney kid. The animation now looks childish and old-fashioned, but that's what makes it so appealing. In the age of high school musical and computer-generated images, it seems people have forgotten the ingenious and magical essence of early Disney films. Fortunately, I was born before, so I got introduced to this classic. It seems, no matter how old I get, I turn back into the five-year-old who watches him on the VHS. Which is the true magic of Disney.
