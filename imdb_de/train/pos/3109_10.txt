The third and final movie of this trilogy is finally crystal clear. It is more a political film than a pure entertainment. Jason Bourne will finally know who he was, and he will discover and remember the tortures he was subjected to in order to kill his old identity: he really killed someone who became his dead body. The film eventually reveals that all of this was organized and planned by the CIA as part of a Blackfriars program, which is also clearly expressed in this film and aims to eliminate all American citizens who have the control of the entire society through an established one and have tried to prevent limited group of people. Who was an important CIA officer until 1980 when he became vice president? This agrees with what is said on the internet. Then the truth will come thanks to Jason Bourne himself, but the main person who is able to expose this truth to the public, and the only authority that can make a decision on the CIA, is a woman, and that woman brings the senate into a general an investigation. A wife and the senate; Read my lips. In the US, politics is being fought in the media, and two media are essential to any presidential campaign: music and cinema. In Hollywood and beyond, academics and intellectuals use cinema in general, and this film in particular, to build in public the idea that salvation comes from a woman and the Senate. So go and watch the movie. It is quite entertaining and has the sweet scent of the end of a period and the great change that some are expecting and waiting for others, but no one can pretend it would not come: the only point is to know how deep and serious will it be. <br /> <br /> Dr. Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris Dauphine, University of Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University of Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines
