Amazing movie that should theoretically be boring but delivered with subtle and incredible acting that I have long been desperate for. Instead of relying on clich√©s and dramatic moments, the plot unfolds through a series of incredibly realistic moments. The main characters are not perfect, so it's easy to refer to them as people you might know. The film does not try to laugh or push an ideal towards the audience, but simply shows us the possibility of true love in all circumstances. <br /> <br /> I am now restless and waiting for the weekend so I can see the sequel. A moving, thought provoking, funny look at love, which in my opinion should be an absolute romantic classic, along with Casablanca and Breakfast at Tiffany's. Will soften even the hardest heart.
