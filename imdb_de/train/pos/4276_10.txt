At first glance, it seems to be an absurd and excellent comedy? Only with a kind of unusual, quiet and slow movement: What a mistake! <br /> <br /> Starting with two singers in a desert landscape, then a bus and a wonderful bunch of actors, a gem hides! <br /> <br /> The folded story and a false rhythm make you think, yes, it's funny, but lets only assume that this is a gentle movie. Not at all: very funny, darkly subtly cynical to others, its evolution surprises you throughout the story? Very cleverly and skillfully presented, all characters are important and the performers give them life. <br /> <br /> And amazingly, it's based on deep observation, great mastery of camerawork and great meanings, and really everything, the general direction and the details being presented, that you just let it forget that it's one Film is: It's like a friendly human society that you do not know yet, shot by a friend behind a camera. <br /> <br /> And you're the one behind him. It's easy and just extraordinary! <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong; That would not mean the script, the quality of the picture, the music score has a kind of amateurish style, no, no! It's great art! <br /> <br /> Because it flows like a river? High up in the mountains, down to the sea, with all the different kinds of reasons and trails that a real river will encounter on its journey to the sea? From a tiny thing to a mainstream. <br /> <br /> This metaphorical image that I have used is the best way to find all the charm that Wh Wh singing. For me, I'll take the hammer again: just extraordinary ... <br /> <br /> I've seen that The Director is the one who made Chat Blanc / Chat Noir, whom I know is quite famous ? But since I have not seen it yet, I had no idea of ​​this gentleman. <br /> <br /> Other reviewers have written dithyrambic comments on this film, I fully agree! <br /> <br /> European Eastern Cinema is not well known because it is rarely translated, but I am fortunate to have this copy in the original language with good English subtitles. All in all: deep, delicious and extraordinary ... <br /> <br /> For fast and empty exploding types and special effect buffs, avoid this at all costs, it may be too subtle and good for you! <Br /> <br /> However, if you're interested in different genres and / or classics, you probably will not regret it, and if you buy something, it will have a good connection to your personal DVD library than deserved big names like Billy Wilder, Lubitsch or Sacha Guitry among some of my favorite directors. At least for this movie! <br /> <br /> *** A movie is never really good, unless the camera is an eye in the head of a poet. Orson Welles ***
