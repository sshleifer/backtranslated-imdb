I saw this movie as a teenager and immediately identified myself with Reese Witherspoon's portrayal of Dani Trant, a 14-year-old tomboy in rural Louisiana around 1957. She believes she will never be as beautiful as her older sister Maureen (now a rare one) Emily Warfield) and out of place with regard to her conservative Baptist education. Then seventeen-year-old Court Foster (Jason London), the son of her mother's close friend (Gail Strickland), moves in next door, Dani experiences her first crush, while Court enjoys her company and idiosyncratic mind. Dani manages to get her first kiss from him, but when he sees Maureen, he falls headlong down his neck, leaving Dani behind. The close ties of the sisters are severely broken by the pronounced rivalry that only deepens when Court dies in a tragic accident. The girls should then realize how much they need each other. Sam Waterson and Tess Harper are just perfect as loving parents trying to balance the individuality of their daughters while trying to keep them together the family together The beautiful cinematography and the wonderful soundtrack with Elvis Presley, The Platters and many others are wonderful Atmosphere of the film at a simpler time. <br /> <br /> A touching film from the epoch of time with a timeless message.
