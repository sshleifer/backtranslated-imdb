This Wrestlemania just did not do it for me. While some things, like the battle-kingdom and the involvement of celebrities, were, so to speak, a return to the good old days, it seemed more of a high-profile "in your house" than anything else. Above average ... it pays off for several games like the tag team title match, although it's worth noting that the title change meant nothing, as it was reversed the next night.
