We have high expectations for this. , , because his Zombi 3 is the official sequel to Zombi 2 and is directed by Lucio Fulci. , , however. , , Co-directed by Bruno Mattei (The Night of the Zombies), it was not written by Dardino Sachetti but by Claudio Fagrasso (Night of the Zombies). It was filmed in the Phillimines like the Night of the Zombies and much resembles the Night of the Zombies the Living Dead). As a result, it is more of a companion in Hell of the Living Dead than Zombi 2. Fabrazio DeAngelis, who produced Zombi 2 and its publisher Tomassi (?), And efx gianetto De Rossi gave Zombi 2 its magic. , , Zombi 3 is not magic. , , It's like a peanut butter-jelly sandwich without peanut butter. But over the years I have adopted Zombi 3. I swore that I saw a version where a soldier was bitten on his arm and walked into the hotel room. , , There was a pointless fulci cut and the Mattei / Fulci cut is on DVD.
