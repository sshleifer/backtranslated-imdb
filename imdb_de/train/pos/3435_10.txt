This movie is a wonderfully easy job. From start to finish pleasing, it is both sad and uplifting at the same time. The performances of Miranda Otto (oh how much she deserves so much appreciation!) And George del Hoya are beautiful and yet almost painful to see when the two tortured souls understand each other. The staffing of the Dead Letter Office is a wonderful part of themselves, as is Alice's long-lived friend, whom I could not help but feel sorry for. There is a certain scene that I can watch over and over again (and I have it!). It is a shame that films like these are not recognized and therefore bring them to the public for more viewers. I cried, I laughed and sighed. I would recommend this movie to anyone.
