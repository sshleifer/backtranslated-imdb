For someone who has never been in the sport, it seems to be difficult for me to get into the football (or as we Americans inexplicably call football) - "Bend It Like Beckham". But I have to say that was a cool movie! The Anglo-Indian Jesminder Bhamra (Parminder Nagra) and their WASP girlfriend Juliette Paxton (Keira Knightley) like to play football (yes, I say this on British and international level), and love the football player David Beckham. But the traditional Sikh parents of Jesminder disagree (her mother has at the beginning of the film a really crazy description of football). Okay, maybe it was a cliche in this sense, but you have to love this movie! And if you're like me go to this movie, you do not know the definition of "bending" in football ... do not worry, the film explains it (I had before this film never heard of David Beckham). And we all know that Keira Knightley has made it great: A few months after "BILB" came on the market in the States, she played in the equally cool "Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl".
