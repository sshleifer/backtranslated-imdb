I remember seeing this when I was seven or eight. I must have found the characters around because they left an impression that lasted a long time after the end of the movie. And the end, now it is sad, well ... for a 7-8 year old child. <br /> <br /> I had the opportunity to see this movie lately, and found that the plot was too simple, the character, two-dimensional ... I think it's a kind of movie you just have with the innocence of a small child ... Pity ... <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie for all parents with small children ... (I have seen it in the original French version, so I can tell you do not tell if the translation is good or not.)
