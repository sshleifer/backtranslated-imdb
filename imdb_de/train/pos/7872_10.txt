The first report I saw said, "What does Madhur Bhandarkar finally want to say?". Should he say something so crucial. <br /> <br /> The nicest thing about page 3 is that it does not take sides. No propaganda. This is the movie that captures so many aspects of a problem (I do not know what I call "problem" here) and yet, like any mediocre film, there is no solution. I was so fascinated to realize that the movie ended in almost the same scenario it had started. <br /> <br /> The film defines so many characters that have very different priorities and different ideologies and yet all are part of the system, which is all the more apathetic. I wish I could say more, but there would be more spoilers ahead of us. So, take a look if you want to see one of the most mature films of recent times.
