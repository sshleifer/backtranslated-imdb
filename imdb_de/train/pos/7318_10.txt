John Carpenters Halloween <br /> <br /> Is it the biggest horror movie ever? no .. maybe not for everyone, but for me it is and always will be. The movie is just awesome and will always have a very special place in my heart. <br /> <br /> It's unfortunate that I saw this movie only twenty years after its release, but even twenty years later, after so many Slasher copies had been released, the movie still seemed to have done the same , My father suggested I go to Halloween H20, and I lend Halloween 's 1 and 2 to learn the full story. After watching Halloween, it was pretty clear that it defined and defined the Slasher genre. The plot of the movie is simple: In 1963, Michael Audrey Myers killed his sister Judith in cold blood with a big butcher's knife. He was imprisoned for fifteen years, where he received Sam Loomis was treated. He escapes and returns to his hometown Haddonfield, where he pursues three young girls: Laurie Strode, an innocent bookworm, Annie Brackett, a hard, sarcastic speaker, and Lynda Van Der Klok, a beautiful woman and sexually strong young girl. Dr. Loomis follows Michael here, seeking the help of Sheriff Leigh Brackett, who is skeptical of his story about the psychotic murderer. Michael watches the girls mercilessly and begins to kill them, until only the sweet, innocent Laurie is left, which is the main target on Michael's list. <br /> <br /> The casting of this film was brilliant and all actors and actresses actresses gave first-class performances, Jamie Lee Curtis was stunning in her first movie role as Laurie Strode and Donald Pleasance made an exciting performance with his small role as Loomis. Nick Castle, who portrays Michael, did an excellent job as a soulless and vicious killer, and his movements and movements were perfect. <br /> <br /> One of the great highlights of this film is the frightening music that John Carpenter himself made that created one of the most well-known horror themes known today. The Blue Lighting was scary and effective and one of the big moments in this film is the young Laurie, who is crouched against a wall after seeing his dead friends, and in the shadows behind her face, Michael's face manifests before he strikes , Michael's mask was one of the things that left most shivers on his back, the white, emotionless face worked perfectly. <br /> <br /> What makes this movie so great is that, unlike kitschy Friday The, it's not a bloody movie. 13. Movies, there's really little blood in this movie, and instead they're working with excitement and tension. <br /> <br /> It became so obvious that Halloween produced movies like Friday The 13th and characters like Jason Voorhees, which he only portrays as a rip-off of Michael Myers. Conclusion: I suggest that you see this movie at least once in your life as it is a milestone in film production and is without a doubt the greatest horror movie of all time.
