I saw the description of the movie on TCM and just let it run because I like both Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smith. I was very surprised to find that the movie was really nice to me and he found it extraordinary. Of course, it is seriously outdated, but as a historical piece it is worthwhile, especially against the backdrop of subtle humor, to gain insights into life and lifestyle nearly forty years ago. Now the only problem is finding it on DVD so I can watch it more often. The performances of Smith and Ustinov as lead actor, as well as Karl Malden, Bob Newhart and the cameo appearances of Robert Morley and Cesar Romero have made me very happy.
