If you like Star Wars / Trek, come and see where they got all their ideas and movies from. It's my top 2 favorite movie of all time, from other worldly, futuristic and psychotic thrillers. The intensity of the root material (Shakespeare's "The Tempest") is not overshadowed by Whiskbang-Gimmickry (a la Lucas of later). And because it was made in 1956, you can not assume you can see the strings that hold the flying saucer. This was the first movie you COULD NOT COULD. Wonder it was done in the "A-Movie" scale, economy and taste were then heavily stacked against it. Director Wilcox's previous hit was "Lassie Come Home". By the time I visited it, I assumed that "Fred Wilcox" was a pseudonym for a director who already became famous or later became famous, but at the time did not want to be associated with sci-fi back then. This was either a very VERY visionary production or a random "mistake" made by the people who finance Hollywood. <br /> <br /> There are massive masks with live action that Lucas has used almost microscopically in great detail. There are intelligent machines that go beyond the stereotypical "user interface". "Computers", as they are presented in later works much less futuristic. The "transporter" of Star Trek is virtually unchanged almost 10 years later by Roddenberry. If you put off the Trek / Wars Technobabble, FP's scientific references are not over the top, and they're still accurate today. The "Ship" set is all-encompassing, sparklingly realistic, pretty much everything you've seen so far, and more convincing than anything Trek did for TV or movie. We were not allowed to spend as much time there as I would have liked. <br /> <br /> If you've ever wondered how movies got so competent into space, watching FP will explain everything. It's definitely not "Wagontrain to the Stars".
