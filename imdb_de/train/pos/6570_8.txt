This movie is harmless fleeting fun. The latest Tomb Raider movie was missing something. I can not wait to get the DVD. How can people rate this with a low score and still see Titanic without a guilty conscience that I do not know. Everything Karen Kopins wears in her underwear has to be worth one or two points!
