This is a classic action movie from the 80s, in which Arnold Schwarzenegger plays in one of his most memorable roles. In a futuristic police state, where the government controls everything, including the TV channels. One of their most popular television programs is The Running Man, where convicted criminals are chased and killed to entertain millions. It's built like a game show where the audience votes for its favorite "stalker" trained killers who hunt and kill the show's "unlucky" contestants. Viewers also win prizes for correctly predicting who is killed by whom. The presenter is played by none other than Richard Feawson of Family Feud, who is well suited for this role because of his game-show experience. If Ben Richards (Arnold) is falsely accused of mass murder, he must play this sadistic game. <br /> <br /> This film is full of classic Einliners by Arnold, such as his famous "I" was back just before he enters the arena. And he mocks a stalker armed with a flamethrower with "How about a light?" I could go on and on, but I do not want to spoil the movie. It is strange! <br /> <br /> Whether it's intended or not, this movie is a great parody of today's "reality TV" crime. There are already numerous programs that show people who endure pain and humiliation for the entertainment of the audience, and even legal proceedings are televised for their "entertainment value". Running Man shows what would happen when reality TV reaches rock bottom, and it's a scary picture. One can only hope that the networks have the common sense not to let it go that far. Overall, this is a fun movie and I highly recommend it. 9 out of 10!
