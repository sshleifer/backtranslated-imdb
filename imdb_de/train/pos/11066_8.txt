For a long time it seemed like all the good Canadian actors had moved south of the border and (I guess) that all second places occupied the top slots and left the sex for the sex comedies. <br /> <br /> This movie was a real surprise: despite the alien conspiracies that are typical of farces, the actors seemed to be integrating something into their characters, and what we got back as spectators was almost the suspension of faith. When the extras from the music video attacked the displaced police, you almost believed that it was possible. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of better sex farces (Canadians or not), you should definitely look out for this. And the big surprise, this sex-farce is also loaded with very good nudity.
