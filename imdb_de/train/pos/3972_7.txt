In the tradition of G-Men, 92 Street Street, The Street Without a Name, comes the FBI story, one of the most carefully watched films that showed the Federal Bureau of Investigation in the best light. While 48-year-old director J. Edgar Hoover was alive, it would not appear in any other light. <br /> <br /> The book by Don Whitehead, on which this film is based, is a direct history of the office From its inception in 1907 until around the time the movie The FBI Story was released. Sometimes it's important to remember that it was an FBI before J. Edgar Hoover took over. Part of this time is also covered in the film. <br /> <br /> Warner Brothers did not do any documentary, however, so the FBI was given flesh to create the fictional character of John 'Chip' Hardesty. Hardesty, as James Stewart played him, is a career FBI man who graduated from law school and took a job at the office in the early 1920s. <br /> <br /> In real life, the office was headed by William J. Burns of the Burns Private Investigation Bureau. It was actually a rough political operation, as shown in the film. Burns was on the edge of the scandals of the Harding government. When Hoover was appointed in 1924 to introduce professional law enforcement techniques and rigorous competence standards, he did just that. <br /> <br /> Through the Hardesty family, Stewart and wife Vera Miles, we experience the story of the FBI. In addition, we see much of their personal family history, which is fully integrated into the history of the FBI. Stewart and Miles are definitely a pure American couple. We follow the FBI in some cases in which Stewart is involved, Ku Klux Klan members arrested, a plan to murder oil-rich Indians, the annihilation of the infamous criminals of the thirties, their participation in the arrest of Nazi sympathizers in World War II and against Communists espionage during the Cold War. <br /> <br /> There's a kind of prologue section where Stewart tells a class at the FBI Academy before he goes into the office's history while weaving his own. This is a bomb that was placed with a carrier by a son who had taken out life insurance with his mother prior to the flight. Nick Adams will complain about you as a perpetrator, and history is sad nowadays. <br /> <br /> If The FBI Story were written and produced today, it would reflect something different and not all American. Still, the FBI has a story to tell that is not negative at all. <br /> <br /> The FBI story is not one of Jimmy Stewart's best films, but it's the first one I've ever seen with my favorite movie actor in it, so it has a special liking for me. If the entire FBI is made up of Jimmy Stewarts, I would feel much better. There is also a good performance from Murray Hamilton as his friend and agent who was killed in a shootout with Baby Face Nelson. Vera Miles not only married Stewart, she actually married the FBI as a movie show. It is mostly dated but still has a good and interesting story to tell.
