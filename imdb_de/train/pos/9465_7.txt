Steve Carell once again starred in a slightly romantic movie about choices, family and pressures. Judging by the plot and cover of the movie, I expected a flat comedy, lots of laughter and unrealistic elements, but I guess I was wrong. Sure, the movie had a bit of comedy, but it felt more like a light drama to me, and Steve Carell once again did a great job. The movie itself is really about true observations, and that was a strong element I found. But the end felt a bit rushed and predictable. The camera was consistently great, the spectacle was great, and the message was obvious but still very important. However, it came to an old, flat and predictable end. I would expect that if other decisions were made at the end of the film (maybe even for the bad ones), this movie would get a better advertisement. Still a funny movie.
