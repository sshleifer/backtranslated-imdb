Many of the user comments I've seen in the IMDB for this movie do not really do it justice. Let me first say that this film should not be taken seriously. It's supposed to be a funny but stupid movie that does not need to be thought just to enjoy it. If you see this movie with the intention of seeing a masterpiece in filmmaking or humor, you will be very disappointed. But if you just want to see a crappy movie with talented actors and good keywords, you'll enjoy it.
