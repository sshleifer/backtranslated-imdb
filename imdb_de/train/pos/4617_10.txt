I'm a Jennifer Connelly fan since Phenomena, and after hearing about seven minutes in the sky, I saw it as fast as I could. The movie is not just a comedy when you think that many of these things have gone through most of us as children and are currently going through them. The movie was not only fantastic, led by the phenomenal Jennifer Connelly who fascinated me I loved it and have seen it time and again and for those of you who enjoy a good laugh or love Jennifer Connelly, you can not scare off this movie!
