This applies to the original manga of the same name (Tramps Like Us in the USA). However, it can be enjoyed even if you have not read the manga. It's a different kind of cock that shows a strong and independent woman who hurts just like everyone else. However, because of her outward-looking power, she fears to show her inner feelings, so let her fellow human beings offend you with her blunt comments. The only one who really finds her out and makes her feel good is her new pet ... human ... Momo. If you want something other than the normal boring stuff with some wonderful J-Dorama (Japanese Drama) actors, then this is definitely the series you should watch ... and read!
