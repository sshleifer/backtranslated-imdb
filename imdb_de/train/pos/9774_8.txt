This movie has its ups and downs, but for me the good in this movie outweighs the disadvantages ... <br /> <br /> What's not so good about the movie are, in fact, sometimes dialogues, sounds, sounds lighting (I'm the only one who noticed that the sets were lit, was amateur, and acting .... <br /> <br /> What's very good is the very original plot, the very intense atmosphere that Gore factor that is very high, and the effects that are performed excellently. <br /> <br /> Definitely worth a look, or maybe even a must for all horror and Gore fans.
