TIGERLAND / (2000) *** 1/2 (out of four) <br /> <br /> By Blake French: <br /> <br /> Over the years, viewers have seen war films with every item on the film and understood perspective, and producers and writers have always new and innovative methods to represent different soldiers on the battlefield. Joel Schumacher ("8MM", "A Time To Kill"), one of the most risky directors, has been similar to "The Thin Red Line" as his new drama "Tigerland" follows in the footsteps of a single soldier. This film, written by Ross Klavan and Michael McGuther, has more courage and irony than "The Thin Red Line" or even "Saving Private Ryan." Although the film's dramatic influence diminishes due to the perversity of the existing material, it certainly gives us a new perspective for young men training for war. <br /> <br /> I would like to get to know Joel Schumacher's experience with the army. Are the men really so intrepid and brutal? I'm sure some of them are, but the film looks at its uncompromising world through the eyes of a young man named Roland Bozz (Colin Farrell), who rebels against the ideas of war. His personality immediately counters with several other characters, one who becomes his best friend, Paxton (Matthew Davis), and another, Wilson (Russell Richardson), whose flamboyant temper often annoys Bozz's suspense with the idea of ​​a war. The war depicted in this production does not take place on a battlefield, but on the training grounds of a Louisiana-based training camp between ideas and fears of training soldiers. This film is especially about the preparation of the war, nothing more, nothing less. It ends when the soldiers finally go to war, a kind of disappointment, because the witness of the characters in action would have served as a temporary gain. <br /> <br /> Filmed on location in just 28 days with a 16mm shank and a tiny budget, Joel Schumacher shows an accurate, perverted, cruel and ruthless atmosphere using hand-held cinematography, unique lighting techniques and direct sound , Schumacher's grainy and blown-out images make the film seem like a documentary. This unusual style of filmmaking contributes only to the hard core of the film, which is quite vivid in the use of gross language and may seem a bit too disturbing. Waves of four-letter words hit the audience, some are shocked at what they hear. Even the extreme degree of vulgarism does not stop the dialogue from asserting itself as a heartbreaker, true and emotional. <br /> <br /> If anything, "Tigerland" offers a low appreciation of how much our soldiers are doing for us land in the early stages of the struggle. Such courage must join the army in wartime to know what needs and risks are being taken. These thoughts are made possible for reflection by the heartbreaking performances of the young up-and-coming actors, who represent the various trainees. This movie is not intended for all audiences, but young men should take a look at it before joining the army ... and the adult audience should have the courage to go along with it. <br /> <br />
