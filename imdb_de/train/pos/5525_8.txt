Many people have a problem with this movie, that they think the story should have been more entertaining (if ignored, based on a true story) or that they rant about a movie that glorifies Che). This movie is very close to Jon Anderson's final biography of Che and brings the story right. Soderburgh is an excellent job to set the mood for the debunking debacle of Ches Bolivian adventure. One really gets the impression of the complete shyness and confusion of the Bolvian peasant against the revolutionary ideas of Che or the difficulties facing his men with hunger and the terrain. I am sorry that I have worn the attention required movie lovers, but so it happened. So do not go into this movie and expect a rambo shoot, it's a true story!
