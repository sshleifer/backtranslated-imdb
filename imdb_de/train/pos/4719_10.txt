In this movie I found this website. I could not find this movie anywhere else! I'm so glad we found it here! We've already seen it on TV and desperately wanted to find and buy it and have several friends who are interested. Another poster commented that it was boring, though I have to say that it is NOT. Especially if you are a horse, you will love this movie. The horses are great, well trained and the movie is well done. It is certainly one that we will buy for our home DVD library. We will recommend it to our friends. The connection between man and horse in this film was so inspiring that you wanted to spend more time with your horses. This is certainly a movie that we will see several times.
