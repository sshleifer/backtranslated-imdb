Excellently developed characters in many funny situations full of spirit, absurdity and Serbian mentality. Film is a great comedy, enjoyable, interesting, unpredictable. The best point in a movie: characters, then humor, history and dialogues. Humor has an "inner development" that is rare in Serbian films. It is therefore a consequence of the characterization, is well motivated, spontaneous and convincing. It is also sharp, intelligent and clear. Unfortunately, most movies had humor (construct a joke and stick it in the mouth of a character) or an ordinary sitcom, burlesque, farce. Some of the "art immortality" are included in this movie. Small masterpiece, barely accessible.
