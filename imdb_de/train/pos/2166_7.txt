I'm not a big Tim Matheson fanatic, but I have to admit that I liked this movie. It was dark and a bit disturbing with some scenes that were a bit nervous. I do not know if I should classify this movie, it's a bit of SF and a bit of horror slash thriller. I saw this at about 2 o'clock in the morning or something on my local channel. There was nothing else on. So I decided to look at it. If you have not seen this movie, we do not recommend it. It's not that bad, the characters are interesting enough I did not really use their full potential, which could have made this movie even better. I do not know if this movie went to the movies, but it felt like it was made for TV or went straight to the video, I would buy it. If it's on DVD, it suits my kind of movie and it is a small piece of the X-FILES story attached. Government companies or dodgy companies involved in shady, shady businesses. Overall, a good movie.
