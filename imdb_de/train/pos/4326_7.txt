I can not say exactly how the film follows the novel without having read the book, but since it takes about six and a half hours, it is a good bet that most of the base is covered, or at least we can say with some Certainty that this is not a shortened Reader's Digest version. <br /> <br /> The production values ​​are high and meet the standards of other BBC classics like Inspector Morse and Sherlock Holmes. We can believe that Dickens' London looked, sounded and thought so much. There are occasional smaller spurts - some athletes firing a pistol with a percussion cap in 1840 or 1820 or whenever that happened. <br /> <br /> Acting is also applauding. Suzanne Burden is the polite and honest heroine who quietly does good. She is also sweet in a mature way, her beauty in her compassionate nature, not in any caress. Denholm Elliott is her guardian (and more than that, as it turns out). Burden and Elliott are two of the few unalloyed good guys. Another is a former sergeant who is forced to evil by evil people. Another is a poor and helpless boy. <br /> <br /> I do not think anyone else could have written that. It has all the hallmarks of Dickens - poverty, tragic deaths, capitalism in the rough, the generous, wealthy guy in his housing estate, hidden descent, shadowy motives and the powerlessness or utter malice of the justice system. Well, not the judiciary as a whole, but the law firm, which was apparently a court that decided on matters relating to the distribution of property. (So ​​I'm from Wikipedia.) It became so notoriously rigid and dilated that it was thoroughly revised in 1973 in England. Twice, Elliott's character describes it as a "curse." The most impressive scene concerns a bankrupt creditor following a retired soldier in his gym during a fencing lesson. The sergeant is more masculine in the traditional sense than any other male character I remember Dickens. The apoplectic lender and tenant yells threats from his seat, and the sergeant turns to him and performs a delicate exercise saber after sword. Each move brings him closer to his tormentor as the old believer recoils with his red face. <br /> <br /> A few things are missing. Dickens often stays in at least one or two funny lines of dialogue. ("Humbug!" Or "The law is an ass.") Not here. "Bleak" house is the right title. Second, there are virtually no Weberian "ideal types" - no Mr. Micawbers or Artful Dodgers or Scrooges. Third, the atmosphere, the whole ethos, is relentlessly grim. One tribulation follows the other, mostly with money or a shameful Peccadillo from the past. <br /> <br /> My God, it's depressing. It's as if the author hated his spleen in everything he did in the world he knew. Poverty, okay. He knew poverty. But one wonders what Dickens law firm did to deserve this kind of treatment. <br /> <br /> Maybe I should add that I've just seen the first episode of the 2005 series - and that's better in two ways. There are more zips in the direction, so the tempo is a bit faster. And the business of Jarndyce Vs. Jarndyce is explained satisfactorily in the first place instead of hiding in the shadows as a mysterious "curse", making it easier to trace.
