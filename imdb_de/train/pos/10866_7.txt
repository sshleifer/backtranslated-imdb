Johnny's To's ELECTION has some cool opening credit and a nice opening credit design, a kaleidoscope of Chinese characters and Asian gangsters solemnly taking an oath or doing sacred stuff. In fact, the whole movie is rated well. I learned something about To from Bishop Seraphim Sigrist and was very curious about a to-film. The one I started with, ELEKTION, is exciting and interesting and by today's standards only moderately violent-moderate and also very violent; It is the story of an Asian godfather, who uses a puzzle game of elements, violent facts from the life of the gangsters, the race for the scepter and true details. As with Coppola, it is expected that some of the morally enamored gangsters are eligible and nice and personable. The performances are reasonably amusing and colorful. <br /> <br /> ELECTION is well-done in the pleasant, somewhat negligent style of Hong Kong cuisine; The end is bitter, true, straight and will scare the children.
