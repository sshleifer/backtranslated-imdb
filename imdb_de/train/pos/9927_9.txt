Domino is a great movie. It's about a young woman named Domino Harvey (Kiera Knightley), who becomes a bounty hunter because of her boredom with her lifestyle. She joins forces with two other hunters (Mickey Rourke & Edgar Ramirez) and the adventures begin. The script is good. Very down to earth and realistic with the sound of the movie. The only problem I've had with this movie is that it's focusing on the different things it does instead of the character of Domino. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, Kiera Knightley gives a fierce performance. It shows the right amount of anger and commitment in this performance. Mickey Rourke's Oscar-worthy performance in 'Sin City' with another performance. Edgar Ramirez really does not do anything but speak Spanish and stares at Kiera. Delroy Lindoi offers a good supportive performance. Mo'Nique was herself, though she had surprised me in a particular scene. Lucy Liu has great chemistry with Kiera Knightley in her scenes with her. <br /> <br /> But the best thing about the movie is the direction. Tony Scott's fast style really makes the movie come alive. The camera is one of the best I have ever seen. It takes a regular movie and relies on acidity. All blacks are blacker, the whites are lighter and it has a kind of green glow. The action scenes are intoxicating. <br /> <br /> OVERALL: If you like Sin City & Man on Fire, you'll love Domino.
