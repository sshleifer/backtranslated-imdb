I did not like the overbearing and overrated Apocalypse Now. Probably my favorite movie in the Vietnam War is The Deer Hunter. The stag hunter focused on part of the war and then focused on life before the war. This movie is essentially Deer Hunter 2. The script is too loose compared to the Deer Hunter. The story is never so well developed that the audience can really understand and feel the characters, as was the case with Deerhunter. The Vietnam flashbacks are not as gripping or involved as Deerhunter's. That's why I can only give this movie 7 out of 10 points. <br /> <br /> But I think the acting was excellent. DeNiro and Harris are truly amazing actors. They completely immersed themselves in their characters and expressed the great fear of two former friends who had lost their best friend Bobby in the fight. Harris's character is a half-dead alcoholic who hides the guilt he has caused by Bobby losing his life trying to save his life. Everyone in the city is part of the movie. Obviously, the city can not handle Vietnam veterinarians well. As in many small cities, the main thing is to be calm, humble, and take care of your business. However, Harris' character can not be one of those things. It's interesting how wars affect people. Some people recover quickly, others never really recover.
