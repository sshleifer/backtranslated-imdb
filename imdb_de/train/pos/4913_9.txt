The title overestimates the content of this film, which can lead to unrealized expectations. Honestly, there is very little "panic on the street" here. In fact, throughout the film, few people know that there is a killer who is at large and may spread the plague to everyone and everyone he encounters. However, here we have a very well-made story with a tension that is quite high anyway (because unlike the people "on the street", viewers know what's going on) and director Elia Kazan builds very consciously. When the killer infected with the plague was being sought, one of the more interesting sidebars I had found was the developing relationship between dr. Reed (Richard Widmark) and police captain Warren (Paul Douglas). In the beginning, they really do not like each other, even though they have to work together. In the end they really respected each other. Kazan has done a good job with it. <br /> <br /> Pretty much all the performances here were excellent. Widmark and Douglas were great and I was quite surprised when Jack Palance played his typical "heavy" role. I found very little to criticize here. Perhaps Barbara Bel Geddes was a bit flat like Reed's wife Nancy, but her role was not really central to the story. All in all, a great job. 9.10
