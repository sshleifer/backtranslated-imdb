Perfect movies are rare. Even my favorite movies tend to be flawed - Rear Window sometimes looks a bit snappy, Chris Elliot's character on Groundhog Day does not work, the music in Best Years of Our Lives is too cheesy, the beginning of Nights of Cabiria is a bit too slow - but this movie is perfect from beginning to end. <br /> <br /> The script is brilliant, the acting is great (although Reese Witherspoon and Sam Waterston are amazing, the whole cast shines), the director and the photography are inspired and the music score does not touch on being pushy (like some Miramax results that are too manipulative). Every sad moment is really on the move, every light moment makes me smile. This is truly one of the best movies I have ever seen, and I wish there were more such films. <br /> <br /> I'm glad that Reese Witherspoon has become a star after this movie, but I am sorry to see that her latest films are much more elusive and stupid than this serious film about real life People are leaving. real feelings and real problems. Brilliant! Something you must have seen.
