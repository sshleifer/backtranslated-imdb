I'm really addicted to Caprica because it's a really good prequel series for Battlestar Galactica. It really has a slow start, but it is sure that it will continue soon after further episodes. <br /> <br /> I heard great things about future episodes and guest stars in season one. <br /> <This sci-fi drama will please fans who love a mix of both genres. Eric Stoltz does a great job, as does Polly Walker as Clarice Willow! <br /> <br /> Absolutely worth seeing !! <br /> <br /> Catch Caprica Fridays At 21.00 / 20.00 in the center of SYFY
