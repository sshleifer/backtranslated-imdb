Yes, it's cheesy, it's not a zombie, but not so bad either. The Beatrice Ring is a big bonus and it's entertaining. I was fortunate enough to meet Fulci later in his career, and he remained philosophical about the experience, as he was never completely satisfied with it. It's worth a search, especially for genres and fulci fans. It's a movie that goes by far too often.
