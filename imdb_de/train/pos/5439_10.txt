Obviously, a movie not only has a big impact on the buddy genre, but also on the action genre. George Lucas had to be a fan of this band because so many of his Star Wars series seem to pay homage to Gunga Din. The characters Grant, McLaglen and Fairbanks play are just precursors of Han Solo, Luke Skywalker and Chewbacca. Even Sam Jaffe's Gunga Din turned into C-3PO and R2-D2 and likes him or not: Jar Jar Binks. <br /> <br /> Today, this movie is considered non-PC, but Eduardo Ciannelli gives a speech as the guru of the leaders of the Indian opposition to the British Raj, which is repeated in the minds of many today. <br /> <br /> For a little boy this was a great movie. Three strong male leads and just a touch of romance. There was a time when boys who wanted to kiss the girl on Saturday, the matinee movie was just mush. Not like today, when more skin is welcomed with joy. Too late to complain about the lost innocence. Hopefully this movie will not be forgotten, and some who surf the channel will be at the TCM Station watching a movie with action, adventure and a cast of thousands instead of CGI actors.
