A female executioner (played by the sexy Jennifer Thomas II) Has the fun job of fulfilling all the fantasies of all men on death row before they meet their maker. And what a way. Luckily this movie is not real or we have many more people in this world on death row. <br /> <br /> It starts really slow. Little light and bad behavior, like most (B) movies. It gets better when it moves. And ends with a bang. <br /> <br /> I would appreciate it very much in the cheap, very sexy movies of the 90s. It is a must when the children are away or in bed.
