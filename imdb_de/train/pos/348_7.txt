These slasher pictures are sold by date, but this is great fun. <br /> <br /> The Valentine cards themselves are funny and thoughtful. <br /> <br /> The film has a peach of a line ... "He is not an angel ...", if he is actually angel !!! The repetition of Buffy will never be the same! <br /> <br /> The cast is a seething performance of young talents, but history does not give them real depth. Denise Richards on the DVD extras seemed to think the girls on the set were well connected, and that would make you feel empathic with their characters. Sorry, but no! <br /> <br /> The direction is very good, we manage to show very little gore and rely on your implied threats. Much can also be said for the similar way in which Miss Richards and Heigel do not take off their clothes ... :-( <br /> <br /> Essentially, the main advantage of the director is in the "lending" of various others Ideas from past Slasher flicks - Psycho's shower scene is honored, along with masking Halloween. <br /> <br /> Killing someone who hides in a body bag is, as far as I know, a rather original one! !!> <br /> Slight contemplation, not very scary, but a few good jump moments, if you choose The Hole, you choose The Hole.Slasher movies had their day and this is just another slasher good Slasher, but nothing groundbreaking !!!
