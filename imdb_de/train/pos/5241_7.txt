Outstanding film by Thaddeus O'Sullivan with strong performances by British and Irish actors. The film deals well with a sensitive subject and captures the hopelessness and gloomy atmosphere of the 1970s Belfast. Surprisingly realistic, it glorifies no side in this conflict. On the one hand, it shows a young Catholic father trying to raise his family without getting involved in the difficulties. On the other hand, it is a loyalist gang that wants to exercise violence. Very interesting and fortunately entertaining. But do not expect a laugh. 7 out of 10.
