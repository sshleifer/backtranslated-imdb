Brothers with psychokinetic powers (yes, really) are not just dueling for Debra Winger's affection, but a mystery from their childhood that left them in a fight over their powers. There are surreal touches (the firefighters, who seem like a singing Greek choir), but there is also humor, wit and romance. The soundtrack is great too. And much like American Werewolf in London used every great wolf song they could get but with fire and I do not think I'd ever forget Dennis Quaid (mmmmm Dennis Quaid) and make his own trailer rocking a lady ~ priceless;) <br /> <br /> Best line is missing in the quote section By the way ~ 'If you've ever had a clown, never go back! '<br /> <br /> I love the movie (I just ordered the DVD from the US) and if the comments from people who are happier with Legally Blond 3 do not scare you ~ give it a try :)
