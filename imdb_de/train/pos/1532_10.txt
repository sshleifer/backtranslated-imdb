Like Murder She Wrote, this is one of the shows that I sit in front of the TV after a stressful day at school watching. Why? Because I really enjoy it, and it is a pity that it is not in the air anymore. Dick Van Dyke is amazing as a dr. Mark Sloan, a detective who solves murders with his son. To him comes a largely unknown, but very competent side occupation, namely his real son Barry Van Dyke. Victoria Rowell is good, too, but I've noticed her hairstyle change on every show. I also liked Scott Baio and Charlie Schlatter, but I loved Michael Tucci especially as Norman and was amazed at how he suddenly disappeared. This show is so entertaining, with great guest stars, like Colombo, it's sometimes a bit obvious, but in every episode there's always something to laugh about. Finally, a great series with two thumbs up and a 10/10. Bethany Cox
