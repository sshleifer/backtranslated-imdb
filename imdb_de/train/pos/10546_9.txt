I came across this movie because I had a free non-new release from Blockbuster and had to get something fast as the store was preparing for the evening. The plain white cover and the title fascinated me. I am a (relatively speaking) "old" lady and my son is a young man of 30 years. I love movies that are pure entertainment, like The Sixth Sense, Interview with a Vampire, Harry Potter and Beetlejuice. My son, on the other hand, is a film graduate and enjoys very specialized foreign films, such as those by Bergman or Hertzog. We generally hate the movie selection of the other, but we have both seen and loved the movie NOTHING. It was different than any movie we had ever seen. We're both cynical / critical personality types, and we usually crack films as we watch them - but in that case, we just laughed and enjoyed the movie from start to finish. We believe that the movie would have gone very well in the mainstream theaters of the USA if this film had been advertised and shown.
