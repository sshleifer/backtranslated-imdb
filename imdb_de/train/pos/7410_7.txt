I appeared on the foreign film department of my local video store on "Shower" and handed it over several times because it looked like a farce or comedy on his cover. I then bought a copy for a reasonable price and am happy about my luck. "Shower" is the story of three (3) men, one father and two (2) adult sons, who are dealing with the changes in life as the world around them changes in modern China. As with many "foreign" films, Chinese culture itself is one of the most interesting facets of this film. The intriguing features of the local, Chinese color, which forms the background to this story, include the difficult but touching relationship between the men and a single woman involved in the story, all against the background of a village bathhouse. The family history moves from alienation to understanding and made me happy that I knew these people. The main story is the numerous small figures, Badhauskunden and their individual conflicts and friendships. "Shower" is a film that you leave out of the smile and touch his warmth and humanity.
