When I was a kid, it was Lex Barker's time as Tarzan. I have often heard from older people that Johnny Weissmuller was "Tarzan" and I could not understand why, as I saw some of Weismuller's last films in the character and I thought that he was somehow out of shape. After many years I came across "Tarzan and his comrade," and then I understood. Weism√ºller is in shape in this image and has the presence and rugged look that does not yet meet the character traits, such as Barker, Gordon Scott, Jock Mahoney, Denny Miller, Miles O'Keefe and Cristopher Lambert. <br /> <br For this film, I was also surprised by the sensual presence of the beautiful Maureen O'Sullivan, a strong, selfish, active and "unrestrained" woman, as Jane is way ahead of the times when the movie was filmed is (Tarzan urges) she becomes naked while she is amused; one of the researchers kisses her by surprise and although she does not kiss him back, she somehow lets him do it for a bit and does not make a big deal out of it;); Such behaviors were unthinkable at the upcoming "Janes" such as Brenda Joyce, Vanessa Brown, Virginia Huston or Dorothy Hart. They all played to perfect, vulnerable women who made it hard to survive in a hostile place like the African jungle. <br /> <br /> O'Sullivan's sparkling personality steals the show itself from Tarzan, unless it's an act, and Weismuller easily takes the lead. the combination is perfect. Another highlight of the film is Cheetas supporting role and not as the main actor as in later Tarzan pictures, where she often saves the day. <br /> <br /> "Tarzan and his comrade" is the finest product in his genre (Tarzan films) and perhaps the best, though I have to admit that I also have "Tarzan's Greatest Adventure" (1959) Higher budget and a strong side cast (and despite the quite acceptable Gordon Scott in the lead role) have enjoyed with his too perfect "all gymnasium" physical appearance, which is not suitable for a rustic ape man. <br /> <br /> Good for Jane and her buddy!
