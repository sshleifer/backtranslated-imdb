"I like cheap perfume better, it does not take that long ..." - Ralph Meeker's convict figure (Lawson) tells Barbara Stanwyck the Helena figure after he gets a touch of the perfume she has chosen with her husband in Tijuana ...! This line broke me and also seemed to be a metaphor for this movie - cheap is better than expensive, because a cheap, perfuming man who gets along with a 2 x 4 is a better man in the long run! I agree with some of the other comments written about Helen's appeal to Lawson. Although her story says she wants Lawson to be put away, she seemed attracted by his fiery nature, and the passion he unleashed in her would probably not be mitigated by the tide!
