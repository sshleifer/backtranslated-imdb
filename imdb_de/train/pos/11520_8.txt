The epitome of a road movie ... if your idea of ​​a road movie includes three possible magicians with Eastern European accents and Claire Forlani. (Well, one out of four is not bad ...) A no-talent mage with an eye for showmanship (Max) watches a very experienced pickpocket (Hugo) doing his craft in New York. After convincing Hugo that he (a) is a) spiritual and b) desperately needs a partner to fulfill his dream of the stage magician, the not-so-dynamic duo may have the management knowledge of an inventor of illusions (Milo) and the alas , softer qualities of a beautiful waitress (Lydia). The unlikely four pile up in a van (bought by Hugo ... guessing where they came from) and drive to Vegas. Havoc follows. Still, it's funny, it's well written and the ending is surprisingly good. A solid comedy with a warm heart and all the better that it was totally unexpected.
