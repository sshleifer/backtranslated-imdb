Probably the most bizarre installment of the first season, "Shore Leave", has ups and downs. Some parts are drawn too long and others are unpretentiously shortened, but one can not deny that they throw everything in, but the proverbial kitchen sink makes this an entertaining episode. Kirk and his crew seem to have found the perfect planet for the shore leave, after an extensive onboard service has led everyone aboard to rest, relax, and so on. It seems to be an uninhabited earth with a beautiful landscape and an ideal climate in every respect. The first indication that something could go wrong is when McCoy, who leads an advance team, tracks Alice (from Wonderland) to a big white rabbit with a vest. Kirk beams down and finds the other bizarre events and encounters reporting. Everyone has one thing in common: Each crew member thought of the person / place / what they discovered before they discovered it. This does not happen immediately to Kirk or anyone else. Other oddities arise, including sightings of Don Juan, a Siberian tiger, a fighter aircraft from World War II, etc .; Kirk meets Ruth, a beautiful old friend (of course) and a tyrant from his Academy days, Finnegan. The hunting / fighting scene with Finnegan continues too long, but at the same time McCoy is pierced by a knight on horseback with a lance and apparently killed. Finally, an elderly man appears and explains what happened. The planet is a futuristic "amusement park" where visitors just have to imagine something to make them appear. Nothing is forever; McCoy is not really dead. Once this is explained, Kirk decides to make shore leave for everyone. Despite the 'all was a dream', 'Shore Leave' ended as another episode of Star Trek's first season.
