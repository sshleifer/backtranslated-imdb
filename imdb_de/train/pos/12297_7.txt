Anna Christie (1931) <br /> <br /> This version of Garbo's Anna Christie, which was recorded a year later with a whole new cast in German, is, according to her own ideas, only so attenuated and refined that she is better works as the English version (both are American MGM productions). Garbo is more commanding (or more beautiful than screen presence) and her acting is rather restrained. And, frankly, it seems to be calming down, probably for a lot of reasons, but we can speculate that she did not make her first talking picture and quickly adapted. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, without comparing a movie to film, on the other hand, this Anna Christie is still the same O'Neill game with too many words. His themes about a woman who wants love without losing her independence are here, but it seems strangely old-fashioned. It lacks some scenes - the Coney Island area is shortened and not so good - but overall it's a direct echo of the first movie. The director, Jacques Feyder (Belgian-French), simply repeats what has already been done, which, in my opinion, must be a frustrating experience. <br /> <br /> It's interesting to see both movies in a row because they're locked exactly the same way (not just the sets, but the settings are all the same). There is a scene that was occasionally removed from the previous film - part of the storm, understandably, but also a short scene in which Marie Dressler (in the English version) walks on a plank with her friend over a canal, so drunk as it can be. But it's just silhouettes, and when the next scene shows their faces, we see the German actors playing their part. Although there is no substitute for Dressler, but for me, the German father is credible and honest in his performance. The topics - immigration, obstinate fathers, daughters dedicated to prostitution - and the difficulties of finding true love - then strong currents, especially with European threads (Garbo suitably plays a Swedish young woman).
