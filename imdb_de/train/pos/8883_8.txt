The design of the film seems to be the alpha and omega of some of the major problems in this country (USA). We see relationships throughout the university for the film. Fittingly, the obvious is the student v. Teacher is present. But what the movie adds to its value are its other relationships: male vs. female. female, white v. black, and the single v. Society. But most important of all and in direct relation to all other relationships is the individual vs. myself. <br /> <br /> I was amazed at how the director showed the racial relationships on campus from a bilateral perspective. Most movies usually show the injustices of one side and the suffering of the other side. This film showed the injustice and suffering of both sides. No attempt was made to show how both were correct, although I would say skinheads were shown to be much crueler and vindictive (quite obviously towards the end). The film also talks about sex and rape. Ironically, this injustice temporarily brings the two races together. Lawrence Fishburne performs outstandingly as the fabled Professor Phipps. He crumbles the idea of ​​racial fantasies and instead shows the parallelism of the lazy and the downtrodden with diligent and positive. Other stars making the film include Omar Epps, Ice Cube and Jennifer Connelly. Michael Rapaport shows a superb depiction of a confused adolescent with a false sense of annoyance looking for acceptance. Tyra Banks makes her movie debut and proves that supermodels can act. Higher Learning has its name in referring to college as something other than going to class and getting a piece of paper. In fact, I would say that the film is almost a satire when it shows the interactions of students with each other and not some dry book as a real education at a university. It is a lifelong process, not textual. I think you will find that "Higher Learning" is appropriate for the important issues in many universities and even life in general. 8.10
