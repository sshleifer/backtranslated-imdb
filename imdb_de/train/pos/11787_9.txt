It's a short movie by David Lynch in just 8 minutes, but he's got all the "Lynchian Ingredients"! It is mysterious, dark, indecisive, scary and strange. and before the blond girl starts to talk, it's even a bit scary! The soundtrack is extraordinary to create this strange atmosphere because it is also scary and mysterious. <br /> <br /> In terms of the environment itself, there are not the "traditional" red curtains, but purple-painted walls that create an equally eerie effect. <br /> <br /> The plot is about a girl locked in a dark room and she screams for help. Then comes another girl who mysteriously talks to her and says that she's just there for her guilt? We do not know what happened or what will happen next? it ended unsolved and puzzling because a good Lynch movie has to end! <br /> <br /> Despite some amateur acting, it's a great short film. The girls are professional actresses, but I think their acting could have been better in this short time.
