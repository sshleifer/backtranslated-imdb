Cross Eyed is a very original and funny movie. I think Adam Jones refreshes the comedy genre and reinvents it. This movie is intelligent, concise and thoroughly entertaining and funny. As an author / director, Jones shows complete control over his both absurd and lovable characters. The story is definitely something you have not seen, which is good. It's unique and fun, and manages to put together visually stunning elements and the long-lost slapstick genre to form a hearty comedy.
