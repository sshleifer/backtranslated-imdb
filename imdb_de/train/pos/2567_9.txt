The books by James Michener, which brought readers with far-fetching names to distant lands, were probably the most popular in the 1940s and 1950s. His stories from the South Pacific became a big hit with Broadway for Rodgers & Hammerstein. South Pacific was staged by Joshua Logan and he was a natural, to perform the movie adaptation of another Michener hit, Sayonara. <br /> <br /> It was only a decade before American films in World War II the Japanese did not portray friendly. I am sure that it was not easy for people who led the Pacific War to change their attitude overnight. This and a general no fraternity policy with the occupied peoples in general are at the heart of this story about racial romance. Sayonara is a relevant movie today. The military has always been involved in the personal lives of its personnel, as a civilian employer would not be able to do. In America, at the time Sayonara was made, abuse laws were still on the books in many states. Today, gays in the military are a big topic. Someone could one day make a Sayonara-style movie on the subject. Joshua Logan was on a familiar basis. The South Pacific also had racism as part of its conspiracy. With a sure hand, Logan put together a great cast and made a beautiful story. Marlon Brando, Patricia Owens, James Garner and Kent Smith, some of the Western players are doing a good job. But the picture is stolen here by the Orientals. Miko Taka meets the brand interest as a brand interest. But the real stars are the two who support Oscars, Red Buttons and Miyoshi Umeki. <br /> <br /> Buttons is your everyman who is a member of the Air Force. He falls passionately in love with Katsumi, played by Miyoshi Umeki. They marry and the military cruelly does everything to separate them. They expect to know what's best for Buttons and Umeki. Buttons was a TV comedian and a real talent, but he never got as good a role as this rest of his career. <br /> <br /> And Miyoshi Umeki's Oscar was the first to be given to an Oriental. There was a lot of attention because Miyoshi played in Flower Drum Song at the Academy Awards on Broadway. I was privileged to see it on Broadway, it was the first Broadway show I've ever seen. I still have the memory of it. <br /> <br /> This Oscar also symbolized something different. Our war with Japan was over and we saw Sayonara as a great nation with a proud tradition and culture. Ricardo Montalban plays Nakamura, an actor from Kabuki Theater. If Sayonara had finished today, Logan would never get away with it. But Montalban is fine. <br /> <br /> Good location photography and a great story. This film should be revived more often, he has a great moral.
