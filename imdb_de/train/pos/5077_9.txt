Indian cinema refers to two policemen in two categories: they are either the honest or the bad guys. The honest guys always scream with the highest voice and fight against the system, while the bad policemen enjoy the most but end up suffering. <br /> <br /> This film breaks at least this common formula and gives a refreshing view of policemen and their lives. The direction gives an insight into the life of a young ambitious policeman. The music is interesting and the cut is a trendsetter in terms of Indian cinema. <br /> <br /> The movie is at times slow and the dilemma Anbu faces over Maya is sometimes overplayed. But I would still give this 9/10, just because it has many novelties.
