I once saw this movie as a child on the late-late show and fell in love with it. <br /> <br /> It took me 30 years, but I found it on DVD recently - it was not cheap. either - in a catalog that specializes in war films. We saw it last night for the first time. The audio was good, but it was grainy and had the trailers between the reels. Still, it was better than I remembered. I was also impressed with how true the play was. <br /> <br /> The catalog is here somewhere. If you find it sincere, write me a letter and I'll see if I can give you the information. cartwrightbride@yahoo.com
