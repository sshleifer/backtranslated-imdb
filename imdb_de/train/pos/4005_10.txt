Although I thought at a certain point that graduating would become The Graduate, I must say that The Mother does an excellent job explaining the sexual desires of an older woman is a British movie because Hollywood never did, and even if they did, they would have ruined him by not taking the time to develop the characters. The spectacle is great, the characters are credibly flawed and the dialogue is sensitive. I tried many times to predict what would happen, and I was always wrong, so I was very fascinated with the story. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie. And I must confess, I will see my mother in a different light forever!
