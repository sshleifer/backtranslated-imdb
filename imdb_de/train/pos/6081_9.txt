They do not become darker or more tragic than "Othello" and this movie captures the piece pretty well, with outstanding performances by Lawrence Fishburne and Irene Jacob. Fishburne expresses the fear of the viewer Othello when he very convincingly succumbs to Iago's lies and even delivers a realistic epileptic episode. Jacob is the loving and faithful wife who either becomes the instrument of Jago's revenge on Othello or the target of his wrath (it is unclear what cause for the behavior of Iago is not given). Although Kenneth Brannagh (sp?) Shows his usual talent for Shakespeare in this film, he is somewhat marginalized. The figures of Cassio and Emilia also wander in and out of scenes, though they seem more crucial to the plot, like Iago. I did not test the movie against the play to see how many lines were cut, but I know that Shakespeare develops his characters, even those seemingly unimportant, very good. <br /> <br /> If I had any criticisms of the movie, it would be that the story unfolds too fast and that the relationships between some characters are no longer explained. The director had a great cast and no one offered a bad performance. The relationship between Cassio and Othello and that between Emilia and Desdemona must be further developed. I feel like they were closer to each other than the movie suggests, even though you get this into the movie very late. Also Othello and Desdemona need more time together. Although their fear is convincing, the amount of interaction they have with each other seems like they've just met. On the other hand, maybe they just met - like Romeo and Juliet. <br /> <br /> Coming soon: good services too short. <br /> <br />
