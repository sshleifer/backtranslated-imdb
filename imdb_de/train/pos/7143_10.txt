"Holes" is my favorite movie of all time! So far, I've watched this movie three times in theaters and look forward to buying it on DVD this coming September. After watching the movie, I read the book and was amazed at how book and movie looked alike. The director of this film has transformed the book into film form. All the actors selected to play the roles have played their characters wonderfully, especially Max Kasch as ZigZag. Props to all who made this movie, it was a real hit! 10 out of 10 stars, I would definitely recommend it to anyone!
