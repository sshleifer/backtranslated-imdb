Dumb movie is really funny. Yes, it has its dead moments, it may be a bit too obvious, it falls off a bit in the second half and the story is an incoherent mess, but it laughs the whole way funny. And especially for Ed McMahon, it's an interesting buzz. This movie is in the same class as Elvira, Mistress of the Dark, another hilarious, underrated movie.
