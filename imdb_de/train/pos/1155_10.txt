It is very funny. It has a great cast, each offering great performances. Especially Sally Field and Kevin Kline. It's a well-written script by Andrew Bergman (Honeymoon In Vegas). I do not like soap operas, even if I never see them. But I love this movie because it's so crazy and off the wall that it defeats hell out of every stupid soap they have on TV. In my opinion, it is the best movie of 1991.
