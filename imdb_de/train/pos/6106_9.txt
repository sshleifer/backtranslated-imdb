When it comes to the erotic genre, I'm happy to survive the first 20 minutes of the plot without getting up or looking for something else. This movie is different. Julie Davis (I love you do not touch me) led the two very strong actor Kira Reed and Doug Jeffery in this thrilling thriller. Kira convinces as "Kim," a sweet, innocent romance that enters the net of seduction of Doug Jeffery's "The Man," a handsome stranger. Kira loses control of her inhibitions in the role and gives as an actress what could have been just another T and A, depth and credibility. I think it's her best performance so far. And the direction of Julie Davis is a great gift for eroticism.
