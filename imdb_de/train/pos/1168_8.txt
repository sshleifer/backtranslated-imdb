Tony Arzenta, a Sicilian hitman or professional killer, decides to leave the business, and his former employers are not in agreement. In terms of content, this extremely entertaining action film does not contain any; As for pleasure, it is fun, it is very melodramatic, violent, quite brutal, the chases are remarkable. "Arzenta" is an unpretentious but very likeable movie - much better than the current Hollywood trash that gets the same label. It comes from Delons rather flirting with the Italian B-cinema of the 70s. It carefully uses Delon's hard person, who belongs to the gallery of the evil assholes he made in his youth. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed the fact that Delon made this movie and that he played a part in a good Eurocrime movie. <br /> <br /> The score is very good, with a good introductory song The feeling that the Italians had a synthetic work for the film in which musical art played an important role. <br /> <br /> In Tony Arzenta / Big Guns / No Way Out that was very appealing Erika Blanc (31 years '73) appears as an unnamed hooker. In the meantime, Arzenta's girlfriend Sandra is being played by Carla Gravina (an asterisk who practically left the movies after '75). <br /> <br /> "Arzenta" Interestingly, an ambitious visual conception is filmed, some expressionist peculiarities. The film was staged by the successful Duccio Tessari, who also made Zorro (the Delon comedy). It should be noted that these two films, Tony Arzenta (1973) and Zorro, are very different action film - the second is a carefree comedy, rather confused, but remarkably coherent and clever. Duccio Tessari directed films like Kiss Kiss ... Bang Bang (1966), Sons of Satan, The Bloodstained Butterfly, Â¡Viva La Muerte ... Tua! Tough Guys (1974), Safari Express (1976) etc.
