In any case, this is an exciting and captivating eye-opener that cleverly reveals the hypocritical lifestyles of the elite of Mumbai. From the wrong kisses to the plastered smile, no stone can tell the shocking everyday life of the rich and famous. In every dark corner of the world of glamor and glamor lurks entanglement, gossip, corruption and scandal. Humanity and generosity correspond to a desert oasis in this world where social Darwinism is the predominant mentality. Everyone is craving for more money, more celebrity, and a higher reputation, driving them to do the most shameful things you can imagine, from signing movie contracts at a funeral to child abuse. In this metropolis, anything is possible where the social classes are so far apart. The audience sees the ugliness of these two classes through the eyes of the protagonist. She observes the stifling atmosphere and the overwhelming frenzy in which the socialists live. Bollywood, business tycoons, politicians and the underworld are all intertwined in a confused chaos! Kitne Ajeeb Hai is a beautiful track, as is the cunning Kuan Main Doob Jaongi. Great movie with excellent character development!
