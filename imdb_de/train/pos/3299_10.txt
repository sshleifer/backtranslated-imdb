A great movie that requires a good taste. If you are in action, wham bam movies and hate serious love stories then it is not for you. Otherwise, if you want to sit in front of a good intelligent movie from time to time, I highly recommend this. Probably the best movie produced in Bollywood this century. <br /> <br /> The only other Indian movie I would give 10/10 for is Dil Wale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge. Even then comes second to this masterpiece.
