This movie was impressive. My first experience with a foreign film was neither too long nor too complex. I myself enjoyed the subtitles; and the plot was surprisingly fresh. The story of a grown son who visited his older father and retarded brother after a long break seemed to be a clich√© at first, but it was very touching and realistic. There was also some subtle humor, so as not to oppress or bore the audience.
