This is the last Dutch-language film made by Paul Verhoeven before he shot the mainstream films Basic Instinct, Robocop and Total Recall. He prepares the stage by opening this story with a black Widow Spider catching prey in their web before we meet Gerard Reve, an annoying, selfish writer with a morbid imagination. Gerard was invited to be guest speaker at a meeting of the Literary Club in the coastal city, about an hour from Amsterdam. With Verhoeven we can take a look at how Gerard's imagination turns reality. Asked if writers are a bit close to insanity, he admits when he reads the paper "and it's called 'boom', I read 'doom' when it says' flood ',' blood 'when it's' red ego "Dead." "If he tells a story enough, he starts believing it." "I'm lying the truth." He accepts an offer as an overnight guest to the club treasurer, a handsome, wealthy salon owner when he meets her and When she learns that her husband has died, he begins to imagine she is a "black widow." Is that more his reality or is she a murderer? This is a psychological drama when I tell which of these old films have stuck in my memory If you look at his work, it also seems to be Paul Verhoeven, and he is a master at challenging our understanding of reality, it's a nice change from the usual Hollywood- Tariff I saw it in 1983 and it's a movie that "sticks".
