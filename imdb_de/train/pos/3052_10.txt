A strange, but emotionally disturbing chiller about a middle-aged man (William H. Macy) who eventually decides to leave the family business (murder hire), which is led by his quietly overburdened father (Donald Sutherland) as he shrinks (John Ritter sees) and flirting with another patient (Neve Campbell). <br /> <br /> Talk about a big dilemma, but "Panic" is a first-class thriller that looks like "American Beauty" and "The Professional". Macy and Sutherland are the outstanding ones here. Notable debut for first author and director Henry Bromell. I am surprised that this film did not stay in the cinema for more than a few weeks.
