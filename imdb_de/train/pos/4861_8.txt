Joan Fontaine is "A Damsel in Distress" in this 1937 musical starring Fred Astaire, George Burns and Gracie Allen. The plot is about a British woman (Fontaine) who is in love with an American confused with Astaire, a musical comedy star. The film, directed by George Stevens, contains some wonderful Gershwin music, including "Nice Work If You Can It" and "A Foggy Day." The best scene is the "Stiff Upper Lip" number, which takes place in a fun house. The singing voice of Astaire sounds more robust in this film than in others, and he has some excellent dance numbers. Burns plays his towering publicist and Allen is Burn's secretary. She is funny. The problem, as others have pointed out, is Fontaine, who has to dance with Astaire at the end of the movie. Stevens could easily have needed a double because he shows the dance in the distance, and it takes place between the trees. I thought it would be a doppelganger, except that dancing was so bad. <br /> <br /> Despite its shortcomings definitely worth seeing.
