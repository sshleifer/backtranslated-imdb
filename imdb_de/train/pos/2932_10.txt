I've seen a good deal of comedy and standup films, but this is so original, so fresh that you'll wonder why you've always walked past the video shop. Murphy has some slippery jokes, but that's just too funny to go through. If only every movie could be so funny. it should be called "107 minutes of the most incredible comedy". Murphy is a genius comic genius in this movie and lets you say, "That's the guy who dr. Doulittle!" He talks about the ice man, shoe-throwing mothers, his aunt with a mustache, racism and everything else you could think of and the ones you can not imagine. Please, if you ever see a comedy in your life, that's when only all the movies could be delirious.
