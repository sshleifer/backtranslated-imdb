I liked Antz, but I loved "A Bug's Life". The animation put into this program has paid off. I will definitely get that on DVD. Incidentally, Disney should create a widescreen version of this movie on tape. (I've heard how to push all the characters in standard video format into the screen). Most have to agree that the credits were funniest! I only saw one of the two sets, but I can not see the other!
