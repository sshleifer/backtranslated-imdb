This game show lasted only one season, but was intriguing to the audience because it required visual talent and a steady hand. A wrong move would discourage the participant from winning, although it was clear that the participant knew the correct answer. It was always exciting when the candidate started drawing and wondered if he would finish the drawing or go out. The other participant can easily win the contest. It was a carefree show, but it was clear that participants were often embarrassed by a stupid mistake made inadvertently. Rarely seen, the game show has not survived a single season. Only an experienced game show addict will remember this show because it turned out to be quite unpopular, although game shows after the scandals of the 1950s game shows had a big return to the TV screen. But it was a unique concept for a game show that has never been seen before.
