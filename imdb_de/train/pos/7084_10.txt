I can not decide if this is one of my favorite movies. It's a good thriller and has an emotional core, but I still can not decide. I definitely liked it. This is the first Terry Gilliam movie I've seen. My first impression? I was engaged until the very end and it's not that complex (confusing). <br /> <br /> The film is located in the future. One man, James Cole (Bruce Willis), is sent from the future to receive information from the past (1996, to be exact). One virus killed 5 billion people. He will be sent from the future to get information about it. Again, a psychiatrist named Kathryn Railly is involved. The love story is beautifully presented and you can really feel the yearning in this love and yearning for a normal life. The loose ends are connected in a very interesting way at the end. <br /> <br /> In this movie, I liked that the film, unlike other post-apocalyptic films, favored no boring social character preference and instead focused on that one man and his longing for a normal life. "You want to see the sea, be with her" is a particularly moving line in this film. It focuses on the tension and confusion in the mind of the person. Therefore, it is not a post-apocalyptic film, but a romantic science-fiction film with themes ranging from time travel to blurry realities, etc. That makes this film a special film of the 1990s. The complex plot runs smoothly without adding too many characters. <br /> <br /> The services are pretty good. Bruce Willis surprised me here because he did not play the normal, tough guy here, but he showed a good performance from a confused man in love. His desperation in certain sequences is nicely portrayed. I have to watch his other films. The beautiful Madeleine Stowe is a real treat. I have become so obsessed with her since watching this movie. She has done a great job to a woman who sympathizes with her patient and eventually falls in love with him. Brad Pitt is the real surprise with his portrayal of a crazy man named Jeffrey Goines. His Oscar-nominated performance is quite surprising given that he does not have many critics who have kind words for him. <br /> <br /> The end is pretty refreshing and that's another reason to watch the movie. The length or complexity is not such a big issue, as this movie is pretty fast and there are enough incidents to interest people. And every incident in this movie has meaning and nothing is unnecessary. <br /> <br /> Good thriller 10/10
