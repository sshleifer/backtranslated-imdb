Unlike another user who said that this movie was shitty (and that Olivia Hussey was terrible), I do not agree. <br /> <br /> This movie was amazing !!!!!! Olivia Hussey is great in everything she's in! Yes, she is older now because many of Romeo and Juliet remember her, but she is wonderful! <br /> <br /> This action is often used, but it is a unique movie and I will defend myself against anyone who disagrees! I enjoyed this movie as much as other Olivia Hussey movies. Olivia's "my girl" and I love her work. <br /> <br /> I saw this for the first time on Saturday (14.04.07) and fell in love with it. Not only because it's an Olivia movie, but also because of its unique plot and wonderful direction.
