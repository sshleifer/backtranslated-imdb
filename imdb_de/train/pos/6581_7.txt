Looking for Quo Vadis in my local video store I found this version of 1985, which looked interesting. Impressive! It was wonderful! It is a kind of film by Ken Russell - weird, stylized, very artistic and of course "different". Nero was not presented as a bad incarnate, but as a crazy, unfulfilled emperor, who would rather have had a circus career. He probably wondered why he was able to "lead an empire" - it was not much fun and he wanted to have fun. Maria Maria Bandaur had a great time with this role and played it for everything she was worth. Yes, Nero persecuted Christians with all their might. one of many who did that. At some point, one of his followers murmurs: "Nobody will ever understand that we just protected ourselves." He understood that correctly.
