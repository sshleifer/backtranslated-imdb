Love Trap is not a short thing, it's obviously a full movie with a playing time of 105 minutes. <br /> <br /> As I write this, I can just as well talk about Love Trap. I am often asked what distinguishes Love Trap. So I answer that question: 1) It introduces characters - especially one - that were never seen before in the movie, period. <br /> <br /> 2) It reveals more truth about love and delves deeper into the concept of love than any other US movie I have ever made in my humble opinion. <br /> <br /> 3) Structurally like on the way The story is told, it's different from any love story you've ever seen. <br /> <br /> 4) It provides extremely timely insights into various cultural issues, both inside and outside the Black Community. <br /> <Over time, people will see Love Trap in this era as a most original work, wonderfully refreshing, authentic and honest. It is a rare moral game full of food for thought. <br /> <br /> Please visit www.lovetrapmovie.com for complete and accurate information about this film.
