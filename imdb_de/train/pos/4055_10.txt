This movie is fantastic and I would recommend it to children and adults alike. The animation is beautiful, the characters are rich and interesting and the story is fascinating. far better than anything the American studios produced at the time. However, there are some reservations about this statement. It's a shame that Disney bought the Studio Ghibli Back catalog and then started slaughtering. My main argument was that Disney called the movie again, although the original English version is very impressive. The new cast with Van Der Beek and others has ruined it and the appeal of the characters, eg. Pazu and Sheeta went from adventurous companions to a few teenagers. The original music is far better than the Disney remix. The question arises as to why Disney made such changes. It seems to me that the occupation of Van Der Beek et al. Disney can collect more money, which is fair, but in the process they are filming. It's still a beautiful movie and I would recommend it to anyone anyway. My main meat is that Disney ruined a childhood movie that I loved and still love. I am fortunate enough to have an original Japanese import with the English original dub, which I am now guarding with my life!
