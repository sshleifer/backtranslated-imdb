MGM was not sure how to market Garbo when she arrived in Hollywood. Mayer had a lot of faith in her and her acting in "Torrent" justified that. She did not speak a word of English, so it was hard for her to work, even Ricardo Cortez did not make it very easy for her. <br /> <br /> The torrent of the title is the river Juscar, which passes through a sleepy little village in Spain. Leonora (Greta Garbo) hopes that one day her voice will bring great prosperity and happiness to her struggling parents. Leonora and Don Rafael (Ricardo Cortez) are in love, but he is under his mother's thumb and can not get her to agree to his marriage. Meanwhile, Dona Brull (Martha Mattox) has driven Leonora's parents out of her home and they send Leonora to Paris, hoping to give her a career as a singer. Leonora sends a message to Rafael and asks him to remember his promise and to come with her. His mother is angry and forbids him to leave - so of course he gives in to her request. <br /> <br /> Years pass. Leonora has a new identity - she became La Brunna, the toast of the Paris Opera. Rafael behaved exactly as his mother wished - he ran for office and courted a "safe" young girl, Remedios (Gertrude Olmstead), who is a "pig breed". Mack Swain plays her father. Leonora decides to visit her old home, and I agree - why did not she help her mother? Her mother still lives in the family home, works as a skivvy, and takes the laundry with her. Leonora and Rafael meet, but Leonora is ridiculous. Garbo is so adorable that it's hard to believe he could be happy with Remedios. <br /> <br /> The dam bursts and the torrent flooded the city. Leonora's house is on the path of the roaring river, but when Rafael tries to rescue her, he finds out she's pretty safe. They then kindle their romance. In this film, there is a "horizontal" love scene that is very similar to that of "Flesh and the Devil". <br /> <br /> Dona Brull spreads gossip about how Leonora really got her wealth and Leonora's mother believes her and tells Leonora to go. Rafael meets Leonora just before she travels to America. He wants to go again, but he lets her down again. He has spent so much time crushing other people's reputation - "What will she do for you, but pull you down?" The irony is that she has just secured a government job for him when he comes along. They meet again years later - she's as fresh and alive as ever - he looks older than he, depressed by mediocrity. <br /> <br /> It's certainly a good movie with a positive message following your heart. <br /> <br /> Lucien Littlefield does a good job as Cupid, the barber and the old and faithful friend of Leonora. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
