I really liked this movie, it was good and the actors were brilliant! Leon Robinson, who played Richard and many other classical singers, is very good at his work. If you see him in a musical, you know it's going to be okay! I would suggest that people see this heartwarming, sad and special movie if they want to know more about Richard! Outstanding! Fresh!
