1958. The sleepy small town of Clarksburg in the south. The wicked sheriff Roy Childress (the almighty Vic Morrow in malicious form) beats Raser extremely hard by forcing the offenders from a cliff to a premature death on a particularly dangerous track. Childress meets his match as cool young hot-rod driver Michael McCord (a gorgeous supple and brooding account of Martin Sheen) shows up in his souped-up car in the city, with the special intention of killing his brother (Sheen's real sibling) to avenge Joe Estevez in a short cameo). Director Richard T. Heffron, who is working on an exciting and intriguing screenplay by Richard Compton (the same guy who directed the 1970s drive-in movie gems "Welcome Home, Soldier Boys" and "Macon County Line"), tells the story gripping tale of a brisk pace, neatly creates a spicy 1950s stance and skilfully milks the tension between wit and will between Childress and McCord. The evenly-matched cast helps a lot: Sheen emanates a brisk James Vines rebellious mood, Morrow makes the most of his meaty villain and there is also superb support from Michelle Phillips as sweet diner waitress Maggie and Stuart Margolin A popular substitute, Nick Nolte as friendly gas station attendant, Buzz Stafford, Gary Morgan as Buzz's loveable younger brother Lyle, Janit Baldwin as cheeky local tart Sissy, Britt Leach as avaricious taxi driver Johnny and Frederic Downs as stern judge hooker. The radical vehicle confrontation between Childress and McCord is a true, vibrant, white knuckle experience. Terry K. Meade's sharp cinematography, the well-drawn characters (for example, Childress became obsessed with raging hooligans after his wife and child were killed in a fatal accident), the groovy, syncopated score of Luchi De Jesus and The Beautiful Mountain Landscape the overall sound quality of this outstanding TV winner.
