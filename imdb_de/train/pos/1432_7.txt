I was really looking forward to seeing this movie because it is a must for people who love nature films. The film shows different climate zones and the associated animals, starting at the North Pole and falling south during the course of the film. The footage from this film is often breathtakingly beautiful, and I've often wondered how they could have taken some shots underwater or in the sky on Earth. How nice, a lot of the material that I've already seen in the television series 'Planet Earth', which was told by David Attenborough. I found Attenborough's account of planet Earth much better than Earth's narrative. "Earth" is a simple movie. It leaves much of the scientific detail that Attenborough treats in his series "Planet Earth." The earth, for example, will say that a tropical sea is an ideal nursery for a young humpback whale, since there are only a few predators. The planet earth will tell you that a tropical sea is a good nursery because the water is low in oxygen and does not contain enough nutrients to carry very large animals like big sharks and so on. That's an important difference for me. Together with Attanborough's far superior voice, Planet Earth is far better documentation than Earth. Still, I think it's worth seeing the earth for the beautiful shots, and the fact that it's easier to understand makes it interesting for children too.
