Wow baby, that's indeed a fine Asian horror and a crazy, fancy movie. This is a Japanese Splatterfest that reminded me a bit of Tetsuo, except in this case with all the blood and courage, there is a bizarre love story. It's hard to imagine how they came up with this visually stunning movie, with some unique extraterrestrial creatures that infest humans as parasites and turn them into submachines or cyborgs. The only thing wrong with these creatures after they take over one person is that they have to kill each other and eat each other. hmmm, yum yum. This would probably be called an industrial splatter or something similar, with an excellent soundtrack that enhances all the fun. The film also borrowed a bit from Carpenter's "The Thing" in creature design and effects. I would put this in the must have category for Gorehounds, as there is continuous slaughter and some very fine bleeding. And for Stoner a must, because you do not even need to read the subtitles, the visual images alone are enough for a train of thought. The design of the little creatures that inhabit the human body like a fetus reminded me a bit of the films of Frank Henenlotter, which is another homage to some great humor-packed Gore films. "Meatball Machine" is great fun for Gorehounds, there is no doubt and I just loved it.
