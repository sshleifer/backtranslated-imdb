A fantastic Arab adventure. A former King Ahmad and his best friend, the thief Abu (played by Sabu of Black Narcissus), search for Ahmad's love interest stolen by new King Jaffar (Conrad Veidt). There is hardly a bad moment here. There are always new adventures for the heroes. Personally, I found Ahmad and his princess a bit boring (you do not have to ask why John Justin, who plays Ahmad, is in fourth place in the credits). Conrad Veidt, always a funny actor, is a great villain, and Sabu is a lot of fun as Prince of the Thieves, who eventually finds a ghost in a bottle. I also loved Miles Malleson very much as Sultan of Basra, the father of the princess. He collects amazing toys from around the world. Jaffar bribes him with a mechanical flying horse for his daughter's hand. This would probably be considered one of the great children's films of all time, but the special effects are terribly outdated these days. Children will surely mock the superimposed images when Abu and the ghost stand together on the canvas. And the scene with the giant spider looks particularly terrible. Although the majority of the younger generation probably thinks that King Kong looks bad at the time, Willis O'Brien's stop-motion animation is a thousand times better than a puppet on a string that does not even look like a spider. 8.10.
