Sorry, I do not have much time to write. I'm not a psychologist, but I've known one for 25 years. She said that Scott Wilson portrayed a sociopath (without conscience) extremely well. Exactly! She also said that Robert Blake portrayed a person with anger and impulse control who had a conscience but could not control himself well. Exactly! What a horrible and enormous movie. I've seen over 2000 movies and would rank it in the top 100. My lifelong friend trades regularly with such clients. My only criticism was the sermon message at the end of the film. Many people grow up in less than ideal circumstances, but only one in a million will behave the way those two losers did.
