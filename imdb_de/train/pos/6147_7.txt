Okay, this movie is about bedknobs and broomsticks. It's one of the most adorable movies you've ever seen as a kid. It's the unforgettable movie about two adults and two spooky kids who are having an adventure for fun. It is undeniable, but try it. I also did not think that my mother did not think it was bad. I was very excited about the movie and the animation, they were all pretty good. <br /> <br /> It's a wonderfully wonderful comedy for the whole family; Even the kids. From the age of 7, this wonderful musical comedy with you and your family will especially enjoy the animation. The animation moves and layouts are really nice and deserve a thumbs up.
