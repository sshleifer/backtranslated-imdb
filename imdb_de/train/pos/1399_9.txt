This is one of the slimmest episodes in which the storyline was really an excuse to just have fun. BUT, I really appreciated this carefree approach and this is truly one of the best episodes to see on a purely fun level. Think about it - the crew members have encounters with the White Rabbit and Alice from Wonderland, a Bengali Tiger, a samurai warrior, a knight on horseback that kills McCoy, and a number of other bizarre-looking events that just do not make sense to the end. Despite all the dangers, you can not take everything seriously - it's just too funny and the whole episode looks very surreal. So on a purely nonaesthetic level, that's great stuff.
