This anime has been underestimated and still is. Hardly a Dorky Kids movie, as I said, I'm still 10 years after I saw him for the first time. One of the better movies that have been released. <br /> <br /> The animation is not perfect, but the camera ticks give a 3D feel. The story is still so good today, even after I grew up and saw pioneering neon Genesis Evangelion and RahXephon. It's obviously nowhere near, but try to see it from a carefree point of view. It's an entertaining story, not to question. <br /> <br /> Still one of my favorites, I also come back when I feel like a giggle about lighter animes. Not to say, it's a childlike movie, there are surprisingly sad moments in this movie and you need a sense of humor to see it all.
