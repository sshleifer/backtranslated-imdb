I read most of the comments here. I came to the conclusion that almost everyone thinks 9/11 is a shocking piece of history. There are some who think that the extra narrative is weak, and I agree that the narrative is weak and unnecessary. About two brothers who find themselves after the disaster and the cliff about Tony. But I do not think that narration is unnecessary. Like many theorists, I think our own lives are narratives. We live and make our own autobiography. So when we talk about our lives, it's always in the form of narrative. We do not summarize facts like birth, childhood, high school, etc. We create a story about our lives. <br /> <br /> Since we are familiar with stories, we also want to bring history into a story. Because we can identify ourselves in the form of a story. We can better understand the things in the story when they are told in the form of a story. So that's the purpose of including a story in the documentation. The story is weak, so be it, but we understand what's going on. If I were out there, I would be worried about my brother. <br /> <br /> And the second point to make a blockbuster movie about it. True, it was recently a big movie about September 11th. There were a few on the subject, but none of them likes this documentary. But what if there will be a movie in about five years? I agree that it's wrong to make a lot of money with September 11th. I also agree that movies are one of the best ways to tell stories. How many films about World War II have we seen? If I had not seen these films, my view of the WW would be completely different. I remember seeing Schindler's cunning, and I cried for one hour during class. Movies give you a good picture of the events in the story, and although it is a fiction, it contributes to the memory of the catastrophes and the victims. <br /> <br /> My point: telling stories is not always bad, we identify with the story and never forget what happened.
