Director Brian Yuzna has made an uneven career in the horror genre, creating masterpieces such as "Return of the Living Dead 3" or "Bride of Re-Animator", as well as terrible films like "Faust: Love" for the damned "or the He is obviously better off at the Producer headquarters, where his work producing Stuart Gordon's films was outstanding. <br /> <br /> "The Dentist" is one of his lesser works as a director, but that little Reputation Has Benefits Film and its lack of pretensions make it a very enjoyable experience, telling the story of Dr. Alan Feinstone (excellently played by Corbin Bernsen), a successful dentist who one day discovers his perfect life is not really perfect when he figured out that his beautiful wife (Linda Hoffman) is having an affair with the pool boy. This incident bothers him and puts him in a deadly spree when he takes revenge on the world because he is so "dirty". <br /> <br /> The premise is handled very well by Yuzna as he takes us to Feinstein's Vengeance Day. What sets this movie apart from most slashers is that we are not in the victim's perspective. We follow Feinstone because he is the main character. We see him turning into a psychomord from a respected professional in one day. Yuzna manages to give the film tension, but adds a good dose of dark humor that really helps the movie. <br /> <br /> The biggest success of the premise lies in Bernsen's performance as Feinstone. It can make you feel and hate sympathy at the same time, and the subtle humor his character has is another aspect that supports the film. The rest of the cast is not that good, and I think their underplay hurts the movie more than it should. A notable exception is Ken Foree, as the detective tries to catch Feinstone. Although his part is quite small, he does a great job. <br /> <br /> Bloody scenes are expected with a dentist as a murderer, and Brian Yuzna delivers great SFX in the right amount. It's good to see that he does not overdo it as usual, and I dare say this is a highlight of the movie. It has exactly the expected amount of Gore, not less and nothing more. Yuzna stayed away from his usual excesses and the result is great. <br /> <br /> Although this is not one of Yuzna's best-known films, I would say it's one of his best. Sure, it's not a classic material like its masterpieces, but it's a movie that entertains and never gets boring or boring. It's a simple, low-budget movie, but for what it is, I think it rocked. 10.7
