Another outstanding foreign film that thwarts the endless harvest of Hollywood coming from Hollywood! This is a story of life and life. No, definitely not the perfect little life that is so often portrayed in the totally artificial Hollywood movies, but the real life with real characters with strengths and weaknesses, just like the real people in our lives and ourselves. <br /> <br /> The dynamism of all those lives that are in the walls of this bathhouse, and especially its older owner, is magnificent, heartbreaking, and thought provoking the simple and beautiful life. There is real wisdom in this movie if you just open up to it. <br /> <br /> You will not be disappointed.
