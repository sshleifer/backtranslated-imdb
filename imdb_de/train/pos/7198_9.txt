This is a really good movie I've enjoyed several times. Michael Caine is fantastic as always. Michael Caine has earned the reputation of playing a role in any film, regardless of quality or lack, but he plays a good role in Sidney. It's so well written from the beginning. Who would have thought that Ira Levin, who wrote such scary stuff as The Boys from Brazil and Rosemary's Baby, could write such a funny thing. Let's face it - Michael Caine, Chris Reeve, Dyan Cannon, Henry Jones ... how are you going to go wrong with a cast by this good director of Sidney Lumet? <br /> <br /> I'm really shy, because if someone says something about this movie, it's a crime. Just look at it and love it.
