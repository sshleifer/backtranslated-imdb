I saw it in the cinemas and absolutely loved it. Geoffery Rush showed the best performance as a super villain I've seen since Gene Hackman as Lex Luther. Kel Mitchel and Paul Rubens were a string girl in heaven. This film also introduced me to William H. Macy, who is one of my favorite actors today. Hank was great as Blue Raja and I loved that the character was not really British. Telling the scene with him and his mother that he was a superhero almost brought tears to my eyes. I loved that The Bowler talked to the ball. Some of the funniest things Stiller and his character Mr. Furious were involved in were the false rage and the fact that his threats and one-liners were all gibberish and made no sense. I could hardly stop myself from applauding when he said, "Fraculater, Freinken-Puss". But most of all I liked that Captain Amazing actually dies in the movie. I recommend this movie for any occasion, and I give it my personal two-thumb thumb.
