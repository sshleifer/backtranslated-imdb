Nobody can spoil this piece better! Great movie! Expertly written by experts such as Ira Levin and presented with the best performance by Christopher Reeve and one of Caine's finest, this is simply excellent. I wish I could capture a staged version somewhere ... maybe one day I will. I hope that this totally underrated, overlooked movie is not hard to find because it's a must-have for any Hitchcockian, Agatha-Phile or lover of a great movie. One of the very few films I could not solve or predict right away, and which is worth a second or even third review, gets "Deathtrap" 9/10 and earns every iota of it. We need and deserve more movies like this!
