Hitchcock was of the opinion that the audience is not really interested, which puts the protagonists in danger - only that they are in danger and have to flee. <br /> <br /> This movie proves that Hitchcock was not 100% correct. The police assume that Jean Simmons is guilty of a crime, even though it obviously is not. Trevor Howard decides it's best to run for it. And so the body of the film, in which our charismatic couple dodges in and around trains, buses and coaches - and leaps over rocks on a waterfall - hops over the roofs of the shipyard. <br /> <br /> but I could not find out from my head that everything was unnecessary. They should have stayed. <br /> <br /> In other words, the MacGuffin was not strong enough.
