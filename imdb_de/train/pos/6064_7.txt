I have to start by telling you how I came across this movie. It was winter time in Alaska around the year 1990. A friend of mine from Australia was in a shoebox of an apartment with me and my girlfriend. Winter in Alaska can be a bit brutal and most people stay indoors, drink a lot and see everything that comes on TV. I had found this movie outside a junk shop that was in a snow bank and immediately new it was a treasure The best worst movie of all time. We spent the next two weeks watching this movie and drinking fish like a true gem. The laughter will come uninterrupted and the memories will last forever. If you find this movie in a video library for rent, steal it. You will not regret it!
