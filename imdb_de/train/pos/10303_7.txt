Bruce Almighty is the story of Bruce Nolan, an average man who believes that God messes up his life. God confronts him and shows Bruce the error of his ways. Of course, giving someone God's powers could make it worse. Bruce Almighty is a good comedy, Jim Carrey is good, no matter how Morgan Freeman is first-rate and how God seems at home, and the cast brings the plot together well. The jokes are almost always on target, although sometimes they rely too much on Carrey's facial expressions. I liked the fact that the movie actually portrayed God, not only that, but also a black man. I thought that was pretty good, especially with the brilliant Freeman. There are some fun scenes, such as the opening cookie scene, others miss the finish a bit but are still a good movie. 6/7 of 10
