I was very touched when I saw the movie. How Jonny maintained that hope and the belief was incredible. So many people are only interested in what they want and are busy with things they do not have. and they are such little things as Clothes, money for a new car. I saw people in tears for a flaw. This film brings everything back to basics. Love, hope the beauty of the simple but so important things in life. It makes our everyday problems as small and really unimportant. You watch this boy and you notice it as long as you are blessed with food, a roof over your head and your loved ones around you I know Jonny will see this, and I want to thank him so much for believing me Who has given strength and humor.
