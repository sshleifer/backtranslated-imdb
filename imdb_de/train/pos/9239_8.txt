As I said in my comment to the first part: These two films are better than most science fiction fans confess. <br /> <br /> The scenario in the second film is not so moving, as we do not see the destruction of human civilization, but the aftermath, thousands of refugees fled in tiny space cans, protected by only a mighty spaceship. <br /> <br /> But when the battlestar Pegasus appears, the story gets hotter and the battle is carried to the Cylon planets. Okay, it has a bit of Mad Max, because they are just fighting for fuel for their spaceships to find the distant earth, but it works for me. It's an exciting sci-fi entertainment with fine actors and decent special effects (though these tend to repeat, to say the least) :-)). <br /> <br /> I would have liked a sequel with Starbuck and Apollo Chalkboard. Instead, we got a second sequel without a name, which proved that the story had worked well before, especially because the feature characters were so well chosen ... <br /> <br /> So, fingers crossed for the productions of 1980, but thumbs up for the two films from 1978.
