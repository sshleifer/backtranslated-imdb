The Sensuous Nurse (1975) was an Italian sex comedy, in which the former Bond girl Ursula Andress played along. Man was she hot in this movie .. She was stacked and built like a brick house. In this movie, Ursula smoked hot. I've never seen a nurse outfit that was filled. <br /> <br /> Ms. Andress plays a nurse who is hired to look after a rich older man. Even one in the house seems to knock the boots. One night, the nurse decides to measure the grandson's temperature and get some needed T.L.C. to her old customer. The old man takes to his nurse and this annoys the rest of the family. What job did the family hire her for? Will the Geezer fall on her car? How can she deal with the eight-headed woman and the rest of the family? To find out, you must have a copy of SENSUOUS NURSE !! Italian, but poorly synchronized in English. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
