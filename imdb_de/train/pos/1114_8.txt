At that time I remember that I was pretty scared and amused by this movie. I have described it as the most important movie I have seen in ten years and came across people who said similar things. <br /> <br /> Bernhard has an unusual behavioral notebook. And she has shaped the bitter youthful personality that we all had into a corrosive, adult worldview. The two together make a surprising mix that may be too nervous for some viewers. (Hi Skip, I wish you were not my brother, so I could fuck you!) Bernhards is looking for her return from New York to LA, which leads to an intense trying on different personas (all of whom fit badly) to our amusement, but enough of them involve acting to appeal to a "black imperative" value system, that the real barometer of their new position is whether the black culture accepts them. (It's been a while since Nina Simone comes to mind and she has an impressive, solid black lover in the movie.) A pretty black girl attends the shows and seems to authorize Sandra's Faux Black but refuses. <br /> <br /> Just as Catholics are fortunate to suffer for Christ, Sandra portrays herself here as suffering from a black culture in which she longs for a place; as if she appreciates her dignity and her rejection. It is the only value system involved in the film world outside of Bernhard's artistic confusion. <br /> <br /> For a nation whose main themes are racism and money, it is refreshing to see one of the two topics that are dealt with in an atypical topic.
