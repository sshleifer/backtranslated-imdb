I just looked at I.Q. again tonight and had forgotten how much I love this movie. It is wonderfully entertaining and gives you the feeling that everything is alright with the world. I love the allusions to Mozart from the beginning, when "Einstein" played the violin "Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star" and he hummed a little night music during the Ed Walters IQ test. I think it's great that a woman is portrayed as smart and encouraged to make a career, a particularly unique situation for the 50s, the time this movie is playing. (I've been a teacher myself, but I stayed home to raise my kids, so please do not think so, I'm a convinced woman's beaver.) It's wonderful, like a man who is "just a fat monkey", after all is important and worthy as Catherine's fianc√©, clinical behavioral scientist. The message to me is that we are not what we do, but who we are is defined by so much more - no labels. There are so many little gags and one-liners that almost throw you away if you do not pay close attention and listen. <br /> <br /> I caught some things in the movie that are not listed on the goofs page. In the scene where Ed Walters speaks at the symposium, there are three instruments (protractor, ruler, etc.) hanging to the right of the chalk strip. In the credits of our video Tony Shaloub's character is listed as Bob Watters, not Bob Rosetti, as he introduces himself in the movie, and is listed here on Imdb. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie. It may be a bit of fluff in some estimates, but it has much more substance than many acknowledge. Not only what is put together for a great cast here. Look at it and enjoy it!
