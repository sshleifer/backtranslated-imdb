BASEketball is great! It's hilarious and so damn funny you'll laugh your pants wet. I've seen it so many times that I stopped counting. But it is always funnier. <br /> <br /> Trust me in this case ... BASEketball is a sure-fire hit and I loved it and I'll continue to love it. I hope one day a special edition DVD will be released !!! <br /> <br /> Ten Thumbs Up !!!
