I found this episode one of the funniest I've seen in a long time. The creators of South Park have made the best parody of a Romero movie I've ever seen. They really touched on Romero's underlying social commentary that he made with each of his films. I'd like to know what George Romero's opinion on this episode was. I am sure that it was positive! Keep his true vision for his zombie epics! Most spoofers deal with pure blood pressure, without making the viewer think, as Romero tries with his films. I think if a zombie outbreak happened, we could actually worry about our real estate values ​​before our lives, as shown in this episode!
