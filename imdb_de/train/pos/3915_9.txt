I've seen this movie at least four times since '84 and it's still great when I see it. It is a very addictive version of the opera Carmen, with amazing flamenco dances, bare bone sets and, of course, wonderful music. <br /> <br /> This tale of Carmen is a story within one story, in each case the other, to the doubly tragic end. Obviously a Spanish production on a low budget, the film includes dances of some of the leading Spanish flamenco dancers. The combination of rising operatic music and the sound of the dancers' boots on the wooden stage makes storytelling even more powerful. <br /> <br /> It's independent filmmaking at its best and probably my absolute favorite foreign movie.
