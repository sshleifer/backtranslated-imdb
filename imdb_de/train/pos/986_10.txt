If you like Jamie Foxx, (Alvin Sanders), "Date From Hell", "01", you will love to act as a man who never experiences a balanced life expectancy and is familiar with Shrimp, (Jumbo Size) and the Same Time many gold bars. Alvin Sanders has many eyes of the FBI watching him, and he is hit by a rock in his jaw. David Morse (Edgar Clenteen), "Hack" '02 TV Series, decides to put poor Alvin in a nutshell and use him as a so-called Fish Hook to attract the criminals. There are lots of laughs, drama, killer kills and excellent movie locations and many expensive cars being sent to the Junk Yard. Jamie Foxx and David Morse were great actors in this movie and it was a great conversation throughout the movie.
