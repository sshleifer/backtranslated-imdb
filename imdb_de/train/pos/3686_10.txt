Diane and I saw this fantastic film in Fremantle today and we agreed that the pastiche films were anything but usual. I say that because we loved the short, five to ten minute sections that compose the film, and because this film had a theme around which each piece was composed, and of course that theme was love in all its many forms , <Br /> <br /> The film seems to have played out in the various Parisian arrondissements, giving each segment a special touch. Having been in Paris only a few times, I was not so well informed that I could easily identify the locations, but I am sure that Europeans, and particularly the French, can easily identify the city's locations. In any case, because of its great production, the viewer is immediately drawn into every story, so that these cities deteriorate as a result. <br /> <br /> The movie moves fast and the viewer remains only a scenario, while the new film is staged one is on the screen. The stories themselves are not like a Hollywood nonsense, but subtle and provocative and gentle like most life without the media burying so much of the beauty of life under the next bastard just to sell, sell. Sell ​​... <br /> <br /> Go with someone you care about and let this magical little movie bathe like a spa treatment. When you go, my guess is that you feel renewed.
