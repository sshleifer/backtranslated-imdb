Good show. <br /> <br /> The basic background is that humanity is at a crossroads. There are a number of moral dilemmas that we face. Humanity has made a number of technological breakthroughs, but is humanity ripe enough to cope with its new toys? There is moral decadence in a virtual world. There are religious fanatics who are ready to kill to get attention. I assume (based on the BSG background) that there will be a problem with Cylons and slavery. In addition, there are all the other problems that we humans put to ourselves. <br /> <br /> This show is not a BSG - at least not as far as humanity was on the run from a reckless problem ultimately out of its own making. There are not many shoot-em-up or space special effects - at least not in the first episodes I've seen so far. <br /> <br /> What it has are very good stories. Signs and topics. It also has good performances from the actors. They can create a culture that is similar to today's society, but at the same time completely alien. Like BSG, this show is about humanity - our strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and mistakes. It may seem a little odd that a human society on another world group has ties, antique cars, and chickens. But these things are really more than a half familiar background than anything else. If you get stuck with these details, miss this point. Whether you're from a mafia culture or a wealthy high-tech culture, in a hi-tech past, 150,000 years ago, humans and nature are no different than what we see today in the world. I wonder if the authors are trying to tell us something.
