Friz Freleng's "Rumors" is an excellent caricature of Private Snafu, which warns against propagating panic-stricken rumors during wartime. Like all Snafu short films, which are to be shown to the military audience as entertaining educational films, "Rumors" is extremely resourceful and brings a lot of ideas into its short life. When Snafu triggers a rumor about a bomb attack, the rumor escalates that America has lost the war. This is exemplified by a long, rubbery piece of nonsense and several weird, fictional creatures watching Snafu with more and more terrible news about the military in his country. "Rumors" are imaginative, quick, and funny, all of which helps to overshadow the rather arduous "Do not badmouth the military" message. It is considered one of the best snafu shorts.
