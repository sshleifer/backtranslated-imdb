THE GREAT CARUSO was the biggest hit in the world in 1951 and broke all box office records in Radio City Music Hall in a year when most of the "doers" were at home watching their new 7-inch TVs from Motorola. Almost all new box office The numbers are wrong, because they can not adjust inflation. Obviously, today's $ 10 movies will dominate: in 1951 they cost 90 cents to $ 1.60 in Radio City, the first run at Loew's Palace in Washington DC 44c to 75c or 353 to 50c in the neighborhood. What matters is the number the people who react to the picture and not the box office "Media Spin". The genius of THE GREAT CARUSO was that the filmmakers did most of the actual life of Enrico Caruso (really not a great story) and We threw it in the bin, instead 90% of the film focused on the music. So MGM gave us the best living opera singer MARIO LANZA, who played the music of the best historical opera singer ENRICO CARUSO. The result was a wonderful movie Too bad that LANZA would throw his life and career away from overeating. Too fat to play THE STUDENT PRINCE, Edmund Purdom took his place - with Lanza's voice and the once handsome and not fat Lanza depicted in the ad. If you want to see THE GREAT CARUSO, it's almost always available on eBay for $ 2.00 or less. Do not be put off by the low price because it only reflects the easy availability of copies and not the quality of the film.
