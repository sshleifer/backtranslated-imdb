Raggedy Ann & Andy is the first movie I've ever seen in theaters. My dad took my sister and me with me, and the funny thing is, when we got home, Dad asked, "What do you want to do now?" and we said we want to see Raggedy Ann & Andy again! lol, and my dad actually took us to the theater to look at it again - at least I remember it. I was five years old then. <br /> <br /> This film was pretty scary for a five-year-old. The scene with the gigantic ocean of sweets and the hypnotic camel scene ... I do not remember much about this movie, of course the beginning was magical and a few scenes - I wish I could find it again and I'll remember that myself Raggedy Ann & Andy loved it.
