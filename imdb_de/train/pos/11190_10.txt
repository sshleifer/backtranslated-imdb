One of the best (if not the best) show by Stephen King. Dark and dark can be, surprising ending without Hollywood, terrifying atmosphere, amazing book adaptation, excellent cast, instructive (do not play with the afterlife), in short, everything that should be an excellent horror ... /> My favorite Horror movie, just 10+.
