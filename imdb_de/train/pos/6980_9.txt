I have to admit, I was one of the skeptics who prematurely judged this show before relatively much information was disseminated about it. I decided it was a cheap spin-off run by Ronald D. Moore, who ran the Retcon wand. <br /> <br /> I was wrong! <br /> <br /> The pilot leaves an excellent performance impression on the spectators. The accessibility is wonderful! Experienced BSG veterans, of course, plunge into the conspiracy that focuses on the development of the Cylons before the First War. (58 years before the events of the BSG pilot). The pilot also enables newcomers by clearly presenting their plot and ideas in the first part of the episode. <br /> <br /> Do not confuse: "Caprica" ​​is not a BSG. An immersive, cerebral drama is presented, which is characterized by provocative, bold and controversial ideas. <br /> <br /> The casting complies with BSG standards; Stoltz and Morales are just amazing. Morales 'portrayal of Joseph Adama, inspired by Olmos' portrayal of William, gives a wonderful view of William's heroic father. Stoltz's account of Dr. Ing. Graystone provokes a lot of thinking and questions. <br /> <br /> If the quality of the pilot is an indication of what's to come, RDM and the creative team will be the heritage of the BSG as their first continuing television program with another masterfully created television masterpiece.
