It's films like these that make you want to never choose the nerd who grew up in school. If you liked this movie, I would suggest you look at Valentine. I just found out that the guy who played Marty (Simon) had a little bit of a kill after releasing the movie, which is a shame because he did a good job. I wonder if it's the role he played in the movie. It starts when Carol gets him to go to the girls' room to pretend they're doing it. As he changed in the shower, Carol's beloved friends sneaked into the bathroom and got everything ready, camera, electric shock, rod. When Marty opened the curtain naked, he realized he was being tricked. He tries to cover the shower but the kids open it, grab Marty and start being mean while the camera is running. They picked him up, dipped his head in the toliet while it was being rinsed, and electrified him (lightly). When the children are detained by the coach, two of the boys give Marty a joint that will puke him. Skip breaks off one of the glass windows in the gym with a stone for the teacher to excuse him. While Marty pukes in the bathroom, Skip jumps into the science lab and mixes something that looks like cocaine but is not sure what it was. The lab explodes and severely disfigures it. Five years later, the children who tortured him that day were invited to a five-year school reunion in the old school, which was burned the day it exploded. Gradually people are killed. I do not understand how the girl who drowned really drowned. She could have gotten up after Marty left. She almost got off the first time.
