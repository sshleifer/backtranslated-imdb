Gabe Ryan (Frankie Thomas) leaves the Reform School and heads back to the slums. His sister (Ann Sheridan) is doing her best to protect him from anger, but it just seems to follow. Apart from his associations with the termite gang, gift is followed by real-life gangsters who have a system to set fire to arbitrary buildings to collect the insurance. They need someone to blame for the arson, and it is Gabe. It is up to the termites to use the law in their favor and give the gangsters their just desserts. <br /> <br /> The scene in which the Dead End Kids are introduced is really good. The boys walk to the new resident's furniture on the street and make it their own. They talk with false accents and talk about how they drink tea together; Bernard Punsley takes a nap in a chair. The boys then start a fight with the new boy, but after he proves to be a good fighter, they ask him to join their club. <br /> <br /> The initiation scene is also pretty good and full of mischief At first glance, it seems dangerous, but it's really pretty smart and innocent. <br /> <br /> Later, when Billy Halop studies to become the young mayor, he has a dream of schoolwork. This is wonderfully staged, with tiny holograms of children walking on his face asking questions. <br /> <br /> Angels Wash They Faces is a great title because it plays the success of Angels With Dirty Faces and really tells what the kids are doing. These guys are known for bad behavior on and off the set and are doing well in this movie. But instead of being insincere, it laughs a lot. This is a preview of what many of the guys in the Bowery Boys series would become. We even get a few mutilated words from Leo Gorcey.
