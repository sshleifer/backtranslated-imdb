Our song is a wonderful example of passionate filming in terms of aesthetics. It is indeed a real movie wonder; a pervasive and enlightening work of art that records the lives of three young girls in the city center (Crown Heights, Brooklyn) during a particular summer in their lives, in which the confusion of approaching adulthood causes each of them a series of difficult ones Life changes make decisions that are likely to redefine who each of them is, as well as the way in which they will continue to relate in the years to come. Jim McKay's writing / direction is graceful and confusing. In this film, there is no juicy, unfounded sentimentality and no clich√©-evoked solutions. What we see here sometimes seems to be a heart that is a breaking heart. There's a naturalism - a credibility, if you will - in Our Song that surpasses other giants in the genre, including American Graffiti and Cooley High. <br /> <br /> Much of the film's spirit goes to its main actors. The combined presence of Melisa Martinez (Maria), Kerry Washington (Lanisha) and Anna Simpson (Joycelyn) is stunning. It would be easy - and dull, of course - as some have apparently done, to reject the accomplishments of these three as apathetic or insincere. In fact, her quiet charm, her instinctive sense of dignity, and her rough, sometimes unconventional intelligence are absolutely mesmerizing throughout the movie. One would have to be completely "casual" with the behavior of teenagers or completely indifferent to miss the resounding authenticity of what these three young ladies bring to the screen. The minor cast, in particular Marlene Forte as Lanisha's mother, complements the work of the three girls as well as the overall sound of the film. <br /> <br /> Our song is a movie nobody should miss from any age.
