The first movie was a nice movie, but it's not as good as the wonderful animated classic that I found more exhausting and lovable. This sequel is inferior, but not bad at all. Sure, the slapstick is too much, the script has its weak points and the plot is a bit uninspired. But the dogs are very cute here and Eric Idle is funny like the macaw. The film is beautiful with stylish cinematography and stunning costumes (especially Cruella), and the music is pleasant. Acting is usually very good, Ioan Gruffudd is appealing and Gerard Depardieu, while performing better, is fun as Cruella's accomplice. But the best asset, like the first movie, is the amazing Glenn Close in a deliciously superior performance than Cruella, which is even worse than before. All in all, nice. Bethany Cox
