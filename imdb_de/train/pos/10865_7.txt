This movie is great fun if you love organized crime movies. Those looking for a charismatic lead thriller starring the dreams of poor takeover may be a little disappointed as the movie progresses. You are unfamiliar with Hong Kong movies, and you'll be pleasantly surprised by this movie his. I was a little disappointed with some of the story-related decisions but overall a good crime movie. Some things made no sense, but that seems to be the norm in East movies. <br /> <br /> People just happen to make things happen regardless of how their personalities have been set up before. It's a rather annoying pattern that pervades even in this film.
