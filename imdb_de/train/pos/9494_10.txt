WHITE FIRE was recommended to me by a man who owns it on two separate DVD releases and on VHS. He claimed it was one of the funniest and coolest low-action actioners ever made. In general, I do not watch movies that know they are going bad, but I made an exception ... and I was very glad that I did that. <br /> <br /> It's filled to the brim with action (much of it surprising, graphically bloody), sleaze (isolated on nudity with a female key figure, but there's so much of it in a scene that it gets weird) and outrageously awkward dialogue that makes everything laugh. The sound of the film is stimulated. <br /> <br /> Ginty, the awesome-looking star of THE EXTERMINATOR (and countless other low-budget action fools), is amusing at the top and delivers the best performance he could muster. Williamson is better than usual and hits it with unparalleled joy (and he only comes half way through). The rest of the cast is also fun to watch, especially the bad guys, one of whom is a sadistic sexpot who speaks with an accent that seems to be a mish-mash of Spanish and Italian. She is priceless. <br /> <br /> I can not stress enough how bloody it was. It is not so bloody that it is disgusting, but in some cases it is unusually violent, with some fleshy explosive devices going off in the shootings and there being a hideous torture sequence that no man will soon forget. When Ginty is swarmed by a bunch of vicious guys, he's comfortable catching a chainsaw and the following splattering moments will make all action fans cheer and spill their beer. <br /> <br /> Don't miss WHITE FIRE. It's a crazy action classic.
