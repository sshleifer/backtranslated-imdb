I saw this movie at the Vancouver Film Festival and thought it was deadly smart, stylish and FUNNY. <br /> <br /> The cast was ROCK SOLID. Great work by Carrie Anne Moss, Dylan Baker, Tim Blake Nelson, Billy Connelly and Alexia Fast. Alex Selie. Oddly, I thought about the movie after I saw it. <Br /> <br /> The authors, Dennis Heaton, Robert Chomiak and Andrew Currie, have put themselves in a lot of political subtext - but you have not been over the top with that. <br /> <br /> The world they created had depth. and made sense. There is a dizzying, carnivorous spirit in this movie. <br /> <br /> FIDO is guaranteed to help heal grumbling. <br /> <br /> Loved it !!!
