Matthau and Lemmon are best here - everyone else in the movie is great too. The dialogue is excellent and very, very funny - and the scene in which Lemmon's character tries to clear out his sinuses in a restaurant makes me roll laughing on the floor whenever I see him. Who happened to see the not so great sequel, should not be turned away from the original. I can recommend this wonderful movie to everyone - I just love it. And the fact that the Jack Lemmon plays his character so straightforward with tragic overtones contributes, in my opinion, just for fun. These two great guys have made a series of films, but this is the best - no doubt.
