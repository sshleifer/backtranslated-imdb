This is a fairly slow movie that is slowly building the story of a former stripper who starts a new family life with a completely different person. The viewer is beginning to feel that something is wrong here ... <br /> <br /> I really loved this movie, even though it leaves a slight bitter taste in the end. It's smart, in a good mood and played very well. Both Philippe Toretton and Emmannuelle Seigner are deep in their characters. <br /> <br /> The little son "Pierrot" is also very touching. <br /> <br /> A thriller that does not look like one. A very unconventional movie, a very special atmosphere throughout the movie, although you may feel clumsy with a few scenes a few times. <br /> <br /> I give him an 8/10 !!
