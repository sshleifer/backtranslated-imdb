A pretty shopgirl in London is being ripped off by a millionaire tea plantation owner and is soon married and living with him at his mansion in British Ceylon. Although based on Robert Standish's book, this initial d√©cor is strongly reminiscent of Hitchock's "Rebecca," with leading actress Elizabeth Taylor and the imposing villa chief of staff bumping (almost instantaneously) under the thumb of her own husband, who is still there his deceased but dominant father. Taylor, a last-minute replacement for ill Vivien Leigh, looks creamy in her high-fashion wardrobe and her performance is quite strong; However, as soon as husband Peter Finch starts to drink heavily and shout orders, one might think that her devotion to him is more masochistic (this feeling also hinders the end). Nevertheless, the film offers soaps for soap lovers an intoxicating crowd: romantic drama, a little travelogue, interpretation dance, an elephant storm and a perfectly coordinated cholera outbreak! *** from ****
