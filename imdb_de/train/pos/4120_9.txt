<br /> <br /> After a five-year absence, Kurosawa shot his first film in color in 1970. Dodes' Ka-Den is a movie about many interlocking stories that take place in a small slum in Tokyo. The title comes from the sound a mentally retarded boy makes when he imagines he's on a train. We are beginning to get to know more of the people in the small community, of the two drunks who are exchanging women because they are not satisfied with those who have them. The old man, who is the center of the city, helps a burglar trying to rob him. The very poor father and the son, who can not afford a house, imagine one thing. At the end of the film, all stories form, some become happy, others become sad. <br /> <br /> As this was the first color film by Kurosawa, you can see that he uses it to his advantage and shows it. Maybe too much. This movie goes in many different directions and it's hard to settle down and get in there. Do not get me wrong, Dodes' Ka-Den may not be Kurosawa's best, but from the best director of all time, he's way better than 99% of today's movies.
