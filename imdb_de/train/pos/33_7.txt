This interesting giallo is a typical but still exciting plot and a truly sadistic murderer who apparently chased his victims before he murdered them bloodyly. <br /> <br /> Director: Emilio P. Miraglia also made the very interesting "La Notte che Evelyn Usci della Tomba" (see also my comment), the movie starts a bit slow, but all in all there is no time wasted with unnecessary subplots or sequences /> <br /> This film is a German-Italian co-production, but was released in Germany only in a version that was shortened by 15 minutes under the stupid title "Horror House" , At least the murder scenes that will satisfy any gorhound are completely intact, and the viewer still gets the murderer's motive in the end. Of course, the Italian version, which contains all the footage, is still just the thing. <br /> <br /> A convincing giallo with compulsory turns and red herrings, "La Dama Rossa Uccide Sette Volte", is highly recommended to fans of Giallo and a little better than the other mentioned thriller from Miraglia.
