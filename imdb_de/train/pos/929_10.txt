Father of the Pride was the best new show to see on TV since Family Guy. It was another masterpiece of talented people at Dreamworks Animation. Like the Simpsons, the show revolves around a nuclear family (in this case white lions). It also contains many memorable companions, including Roger the surly orangutan, Vincent the Italian-American flamingo, the eccentric white tiger Blake and Victoria, the patriotic snout brothers and the elephant chutney. The other stars of the show are Sigfreid and Roy. They are incredibly eccentric and do everything in a grandiose way, making the most banal activities entertaining. The combination of cute animal figures with very adult dialogues and controversial topics (drugs, prejudices, etc.) is the source of the brilliance of the program. <br /> <br /> The blame for the failure of this show lies with NBC. They decided, the episodes in no particular order to send (possibly influenced by the guest stars who could promote it) and not more logical sequence of production. Several times the show was thwarted for another half-hour of dirt like The Biggest Loser (as if 60 minutes of it was not enough)! It is indeed a bad omen for the future of television as art, when an original and daring show like this fails, while Fear Factor and American Idol dominate. Luckily, the full series was released on DVD and in the show now has the opportunity to attract a larger following. 10/10
