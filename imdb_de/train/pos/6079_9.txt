Shakespeare's plays have a chance to transcend time. The language somehow breaks through the time barrier. But maybe it's the actors who really do that. <br /> <br /> After the disappointment in Romeo and Juliet (the version with Claire Danes and Leonardo DiCaprio), they were reluctant to adopt another modern account of Shakespeare. To my surprise, Othello was great! <br /> <br /> Iago's character was played so well by the Kenneth Fellow! Although Iago is really evil and despicable, the character was played so well that she does what Shakespeare should be for the dancer, a joy that the audience can hate. I have to say that Fishburne's performance was really good here. <br /> <br /> I recommend this for both Shakespeare scholars and lazy students (who refuse to read the book) alike.
