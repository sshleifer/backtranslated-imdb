I rented this movie many years ago and was totally excited. Only recently did I have the strange need to revisit some of the too few films I've enjoyed in my entire life. I decided to revisit "Erendira". And I am glad that I did that when I soon found out that even the passage of time did not in the least cloud the splendor of this film. <br /> <br /> The story is about a teenage girl (Erendira, remarkably played) by Claudia O'hana - in some ways she resembles Winona Ryder!), who accidentally burns down her grandmother's mansion, prompting Irene's Daddy's downright hypnotically played grandmother forces the girl into a life in prostitution to repay the damage. <br /> <br /> Viewing is intriguing and captivating at one and the same time, despite the fact that despite the fundamental premise that deals with prostitution, tasteless sexual content is lacking. The story is more about the interactions between the girl and her grandmother and the various other colorful characters they come into contact with during their stay - which, incidentally, is in the rugged part of rural Mexico. <Br /> <br /> The film is very atmospheric, fascinatingly puzzling and has a fantastic quality. Sometimes it borders on the bizarre, but not on a David Lynch movie. It's also worth noting that the movie is very allegorical, read the comments of previous viewers below. <br /> <br /> In the background you often hear the sounds of a lonely accordion, soft and melancholic, adding just the right musical accents to highlight the Mexican attitude. The cinematography of rural places, many of which are in the desert, is great. <br /> <br /> The movie moves at a good pace, neither too fast nor too slow, and after each scene I felt like I was rewinding the tape and playing it again just because you want it. For me it is really so convincing. <br /> <br /> Hopefully the movie will be shown in Spanish with subtitles. I studied Spanish both at high school and at university and was happy to understand much of the dialogue. From ejemplo: "El mundo no tan grande como pensaba." ("The world is not as big as I thought" - that is, it is a small world.) <br /> <br /> This film somehow reminds me to stumble on a dusty old bottle of wine that is so drinking is immensely satisfying, but you are saddened to find that there are not more bottles like these.
