This movie consists of Wild Bill Hickok, Calamity Jane, Buffalo Bill and General Custer. Gary Cooper plays Wild Bill and Jean Arthur plays Calamity Jane and Charles Bickford the villain who sells weapons to the Indians, and you barely recognize him. This was the first time that Cecil B. DeMille and Gary Cooper worked together, and the next film that was shot was essentially the same but was shot at a different time. This film begins with the murder of Lincoln and also deals with an Indian war. Calamity Jane is in love with Wild Bill and Buffalo Bill got married and wants to stay home now. This film also looks at Custer's latest state and is far from accurate. Gary Cooper is good as always and I do not usually like Jean Arthur, but I like her here.
