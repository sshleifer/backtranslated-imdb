This was one of the best shows ever made for television. Full of secrets and intrigues and twists. Obligatory consideration I was lucky that I saw this in the UK. You may have misunderstood the sequence of the episodes, I can not remember, but at least every week it ran at a regular time. My girlfriend and I were thrilled with the trailer and none of us is usually a big fan of the American series. After the pilot, we knew that this was something special. We missed a few episodes, and it made you sad and angry to miss them for a week. Lol. <br /> <br /> Great casting, excellent acting. Gary Cole was absolutely brilliant, even better than his role as Custer. Lucas Black did an amazing job for a child, and Paige Turco has also been in great shape since the Party of Five. And of course, Nick Searcy as the sheriff's longtime passionate buddy. <br /> <br /> Yes, there were some confusing and confusing things that I probably would have explained later and probably would have been in a later series. That made the end weak and you could say they killed it. WHAT let's go Why did you do that with one of the best shows ever? Shoot the exec.
