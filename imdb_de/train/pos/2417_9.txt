"Going Berserk" is actually one of the funniest candy movies I've ever seen. Sure, it's a small budget, but it's an uncompromising tour-de-force. There are countless memorable quotes. For example, when his soon-to-be father-in-law asks how much he earns, Candy says, "Oh, I'm somewhere between thirty and ... eleven thousand dollars a year, sir." Oh yes, it's Candy's delivery that sells it. Only classic stuff. Eugene Levy also shows in a funny performance as a sloppy filmmaker. A clip of his terrible low-budget movie "Kung Fu U" gets you started. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of Candy and want to rediscover a forgotten gem, I can not recommend this movie enough.
