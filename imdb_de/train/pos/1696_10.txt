This is cult material. My friends and I meet once a year to enjoy this movie. It is very funny and very dry. I have seen this move dozens of times and do not have to enjoy it yet. The actors are funny and it gets better with each watching! If you've enjoyed "idiots from space," you'll love this. A great game about War of the Worlds. I love the red-neck madness to get the aliens, the hood on the hood, the DOD, the Heat Seeking Populous Annihilator, the minefield and the red camouflage. "I'll get the bucket!" Very funny. I would love it if it comes out on DVD! Forget the negative reviews and see for yourself!
