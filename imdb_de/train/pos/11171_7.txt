Overall, this film was excellent for its time and will be interesting for many generations to come. Although the plot is not 100% consistent with the book, almost everything is correct. The movie jumps ahead and misses some important parts. I found the book and ready and immediately wished that they made a movie (because I had not heard anything about the movie yet), but later I found the film in a bargain at Wal-Mart and decided to buy it and to see if that was what I expected. Overall, I give these films a 7 out of 10 score for their good parts (relatively accurate and meaningful overall) and for their bad parts (big leaps in time and small but noticeable inaccuracies).
