I turned this on to see the incredible Ethel Waters whose autobiography I'm reading. I admit my jaw dropped when the pork chops and watermelon references began, but people can not view this film as a stereotypical or racist piece. It is, so to speak, a short film made by black people for black people, at a time when the entertainment industry was quite separate and the stereotypes for the people involved were the jokes of their time. We see that modern black movies do the same, but with the new trends (stereotypes), "ho's" and "hood" and so on. I think if you look back in eighty years, you would find that today's films look just as racist. What the viewers should appreciate about this film is the talent of Waters and little Sammy Davis Jr., who pulls out his contemporary Shirley Temple and looks the same in the face as he does as an adult. Everyone involved in this movie clearly had a lot of fun doing it. Why do not you enjoy it for what it is instead of what you think it should have been?
