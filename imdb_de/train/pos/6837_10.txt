A typical De Palma movie with a lot of style and some scenes that will bring you to the edge of your seat. <br /> <br /> The thing that makes this movie better as an average thriller is the style. It has some brilliantly edited scenes and some scenes that are really nerve-wracking and will get you to the edge of your seat. The best scene is from the movie; The museum landscape and the elevator murder. There are a few mild erotic scenes, and the speed of the films may not be fast enough for the casual viewer to fully appreciate this movie. Therefore, this movie may not be suitable for everyone. <br /> <br /> The story itself is pretty good too, but it's really the style that gets the movie going! It may only be for the fans, but occasional viewers should also appreciate the excitement in the film. <br /> <br /> There are some nice characters represented by a good cast. Michael Caine is an interesting casting choice and Angie Dickinson looks just as good as she looks (not bad for a 49 year old!). The music of Pino Donaggio is also typical De Palma I like and fits very well with the film, as well as his score for the other De Palma movie "Body Double". <br /> <br /> Brilliant Thrill Thriller. I love De Palma! <br /> <br /> 10/10
