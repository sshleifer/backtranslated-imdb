This movie is made up of such a great emotion, especially because of its excellent soundtrack, which coincides with the movie. Tom Cruise is one of my favorite actors because he is passionate about making and entertaining movies. The movie was not the best when I saw it for the first time, but after about three more tries, I decided that this is one of the best movies I've ever seen. It takes place in New York and is continued by his lifestyle. He discovers in his life a delimma with his girlfriend (Diaz). He goes through a state of depression and then a mixture of imagination. This movie exceeded my expectations and is one of Cruise's best films ever!
