I was just wondering why damn FOX canceled Season3 even though Season2 was not as good as Season1, which is really great !!! I like it so much that I even think about buying DVDs on Amazon and it's inconvenient for me to get an international credit card and $). I just hope that FOX DA can bring back someday!
