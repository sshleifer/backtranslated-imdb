I think I read that somewhere: Joe Johnston (director of the film and one of the guys who founded Industrial Light and Magic to work on the first Star Wars movie) and one of his producers or something that gets a title Movie "Rocket Boys" (I think) was missing something. <br /> <br /> One day they played around with a PC program that spells out words from other words (ie, you type in a word or a series of words and it mixes the letters and formulates other words.) I think Anyway, they typed "Rocket Boys" and really, what comes back is "October Sky." They were shocked, to say the least, the title covered everything in the movie As the film revolves around Sputnik, in the beginning Homer Jr did not agree with the idea, but he got warm after the "Movie Poster Paperback novel" came out and took off.
