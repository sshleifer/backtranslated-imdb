After staging the sitcom world with "Father Ted," Arthur Matthews and Graham Linehan's next creation was a forgotten gem for the BBC called "Hippies." The two screenplays, however, were written exclusively by Arthur Matthews. <br /> <br /> 1969 in London - Ray Purbs, a hippie, is editor of an anarchist journal. His friends are his roommate, the very casual and cannabis smoking Alex, his "girlfriend" is the feminist Jill and the not too smart Hugo. Simon Pegg was great as Ray, but he's great In all that he's in, this sitcom has 'Citizen Smith'. Ray was very much like Wolfie Smith, who tried to beat the company, but failed miserably. Finally, this sitcom will be released on DVD in March, I can not wait to buy it. It was set up in 1999 and has been repeated on terrestrial television so far - my memories are not good for the sitcom, but I remember two episodes. The first was the opener "Protesting Hippies", which I thought was a great start - where Ray was protesting against sandpaper and the other episode was "Hippy Dippy Hippies", which I think was episode 4, again a clear memory to the police. Unfortunately, the sitcom got a negative response from viewers (I can not imagine why). The BBC commissioned another series, but Arthur Matthews decided against it because of the negative response. Well, I can not wait to wait for the DVD. <br /> <br /> Best Episode: Hippy Dippy Hippies - Series 1 Episode 4.
