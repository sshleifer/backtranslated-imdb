I had heard some not very good things about this movie and probably had seen the low score here on the IMDb, so I avoided it. Today they were showing Vanilla Sky on TV and since I had nothing better to do ... and it turned out I found it hard to find something better. Vanilla Sky is a scary, sad and touching movie, actually one of the best I've seen in a long time. I was surprised how I saw it. It's hard to explain, but during the movie, your feelings about the characters and their perception of what's going on are changing, and it's a very emotional journey. Vanilla Sky has really touched me in a way that is very rare for a movie, or media for that matter. <br /> <br /> I really recommend everyone to watch this movie. Regardless of what you have heard of it.
