"Magic" is not too strong a word for the magic this movie weaves. They feel relaxed and see others in a more benevolent light ... Any movie that has a civilizing impact on the audience deserves serious attention. Rarely have we been soaked in such beauty. As if that was not enough, it's funny. The performances are invariably extraordinary, but the wondrous Miranda Richardson and the great Josie Walker are particularly notable - both open like roses. <br /> <br /> Why is not this movie on DVD? It deserves to live forever.
