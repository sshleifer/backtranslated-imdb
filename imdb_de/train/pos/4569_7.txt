DANIEL DAY-LEWIS does a remarkable job in the role of Christy Brown, the artist who grew up with cerebral palsy, but was able to lead a productive life, successfully dealt with his handicap and became a respected artist and writer. The film is very difficult though to check - or even to see. Fortunately, I had the subtitle function to capture every spoken word, which would have been impossible if I had seen the movie in a theater. While I respect it as a brave piece that deals with difficult issues, I can not say that it is the kind of movie I want to see more than once. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, my attention was caught by the storyteller, a retrospective framed by the present, where we see Christy honored for his accomplishments, before looking back on his youth and his struggles DANIEL DAY-LEWIS is certainly notable as a remarkable man who falls in love with a therapist (FIONA SHAW), much to his mother's fear that his heart will be broken, if love is not reciprocated. There is a painfully long scene in a restaurant where he confesses his love for others and then gets into a furious rage after drinking too much. BRENDA FRICKER does an excellent job when the mother takes care of him, his father and a brood of siblings who have tried to keep a roof over their heads until Day-Lewis succeeds in his work. She complements Day Lewis' performance as a warmhearted mother and shares with him many poignant moments. <br /> <br /> Richly detailed story of a family that has stayed together in unusual circumstances along with the detail of their time is every frame of the movie. Both Fricker and Day-Lewis won Oscars, but HUGH O'CONOR and RAY McANALLY are also excellent. O'Conor is Christy as a boy and McAnally is the father who spends too much time at the local pub but loves the boy. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: Elmer Bernstein's music is an additional plus factor. It's worth it, but definitely not a movie for everyone.
