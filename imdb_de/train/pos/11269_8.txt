Have you always wanted to know how much Hollywood could be handled before the official implementation of the Hayes Code? Well, unfortunately "Convention City" has been lost, so you just have to watch "Tarzan and His Mate" to find out. For 1934, there is a remarkable amount of sexual innuendo and even exposed meat. Just look at Jane's naked swimming. While Tarzan is often thought of as b-adventure movies for little boys and nobody else, this picture proves that the series was originally very grown-up. Seventy years later, it's still as sexy as it was when it came out. <br /> <br /> In addition to the taboo-style envelope, it's a great and exciting adventure story. I've always enjoyed the jungle movies that Hollywood produced in the '30s and' 40s, but there are few in the genre that I would call great movies. "Tarzan and his comrade" is by far the best movie from this long-left subgenre. The consequences of monkeys or natives' safari attacks still create tensions today. Also, the animals are all too cool (especially the monkeys throwing boulders). Acting will soon win no big prizes, but for this type of image is certainly more than enough. The film is again stolen by Cheetah, the smartest monkey in the jungle. One of the most entertaining examples of Hollywood in the pre-code.
