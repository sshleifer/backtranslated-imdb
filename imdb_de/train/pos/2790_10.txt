Gurinda Chad's Semi-Autobiographical Film (2002) is a gentle, poignant comedy in the ethnically diverse community near Heahthrow Airport in West London. Like the passenger planes that are constantly coming and going, we follow the ups and downs of the two main characters, Jess Bhamra (Parminder Nagra) and Jules Paxton (Keira Knightley), while forming an unusual friendship centered around their shared passion for football and their own technical infatuation with David Beckham stands. <br /> <br Much of the comedy comes from the misunderstandings of the families of these two talented girls as they break all the expectations and conventions of their very different family backgrounds. <br /> <br /> Somewhere in the middle, as broker, Peacemaker and degenerate athlete Joe (Jonathan Reece-Myers) - team coach of the Hounslow Harriers - enters in times of crisis and remains the main object of affection of the two main characters. <br /> <br /> Eventually, and not without many obstacles and triumphs along the way, we will finally see our dedicated and beloved football heroines who are making their dreams come true. <br /> <br /> With great performances by Bollywood veteran Anupam Kher (Mr. Bhamra), Shaheen Khan (wife Bhamra), Juliet Stevenson (wife Paxton) and Frank Harper (Mr. Paxton) is a movie that is the urgent passion of adolescence and crosses all ethnic boundaries. <br /> <br /> Pinky Bamrha (Archie Panjabi) and (Taz) Trey Farley are fighting for their own fights, but they are still helping to understand the movie's main characters. <br /> <br /> In its own special way, this film tells an important story, which definitely has an effect on itself. It celebrates the development of the understanding of ordinary people in ordinary families and the innate ability of young people to teach the elderly.
