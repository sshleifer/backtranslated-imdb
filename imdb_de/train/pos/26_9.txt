When I was a kid, I looked at it many times and I remember how many times I had the song "Happy Cat" whistled. All songs are great and memorable, unlike many children's musicals where the songs are recorded for no real reason. The scenes and costumes are elaborate and the drama is very well done, which is not surprising given the cast. Christopher Walken is very feline and does not need stupid makeup or a cat costume so the viewer can believe he is a cat that turns into a human. And Jason Connery is as sweet as the shy and awkward miller's son Corin, who falls in love with the beautiful and courageous Princess Vera. This is a really fun, entertaining and boring movie where the characters get personalities unlike most fairy tales. Some of my favorite parts are when Puss Corin pretends to drown. on the ball, when everyone starts to dance a country dance, as this is "the latest craze abroad"; when walking in the kitchen and dancing on the table (he's also a pretty good dancer!); and when Vera tells Corin all the things she did in her youth, like pretending to be a miller's daughter. I would recommend this movie to children as well as parents who love magic and fairy tales. And it's actually a movie that you can watch together because it can not put adults on the wall.
