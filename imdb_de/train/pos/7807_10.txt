The performance of each actor and actress (in the movie) is excellent NATURAL, what should be film acting; and the directing ability is handled so brilliantly in every detail that I never tire of seeing them again and again. However, I am quite surprised to see that this film is not included in some of the actors and directors. Attenborough's credits make me confusing audience? I hope I get some answers to my riddles from someone (possibly one of the "knowledgeable" staff members (insiders) of the movie).
