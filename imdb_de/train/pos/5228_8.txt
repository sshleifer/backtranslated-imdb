I found this movie funny. The spoofs of other popular films of that time were some of the funniest ones I've seen in this kind of movie. Try it. If you've seen the movies that spoofed this movie, and you get the humor, you should enjoy the movie. <br /> <br /> Me (and the others who saw the movie with me) felt the funniest part of the movie (this is not a spoiler because I'm NOT going to tell you what's actually happening). This was a scene with the "flashy thing" from MIB. When you discover the device for the first time and do not know what it is, and then later in the movie ... you will understand when you get there. <br /> <br /> My only complaint about the movie is that I never found it on DVD so I could buy a copy.
