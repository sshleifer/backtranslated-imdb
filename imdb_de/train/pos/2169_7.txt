OK, first ignore the person's last check. They admit to having fallen asleep through their sleep, so it's no wonder they did not understand what was going on !!! How thriller / horror is, this movie is not so bad, he is certainly very good to see. Just as with the opening scenes, you get a general idea of ​​what exactly the reason for all the craziness will be, and in the end you proved to be right, since everything is clear movie, it was sometimes quite scary and how old movies go it is passable. Great to see late in the evening! I give him a generous 7 out of 10 points.
