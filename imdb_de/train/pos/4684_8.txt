Petter Mattei's "Love in the Time of Money" is a visually stunning movie. Mr. Mattei offers us a vivid portrait of human relationships. This is a movie that seems to tell us what money, power and success mean to people in the different situations in which we travel. <br /> <br /> Being a variation of Arthur Schnitzler's play on the same topic, the director transfers the action to what is now New York, where all these different characters meet and connect. Everyone is connected in one way or another to the next person, but nobody seems to know the previous point of contact. Stylish, the film looks noble and luxurious. We are taken to see how these people live and how the world lives in their own habitat. <br /> <br /> The only thing that gets out of all those souls in the picture are the different stages of loneliness that everyone lives in. A big city is not exactly the place where human relationships find sincere fulfillment, as is the case with most of the people we meet. <br /> <br /> The acting is good under the direction of Mr. Mattei. Steve Buscemi, Rosario Dawson, Carol Kane, Michael Imperioli, Adrian Grenier and the rest of the talented performers bring these characters to life. <br /> <br /> We wish Mr. Mattei good luck and are looking forward to his next work.
