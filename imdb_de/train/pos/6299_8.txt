There are good ways to make a movie and bad ways, and that's a lot sooner. This short capsule does nothing but what it gives the audience. It's a simple story that is simply told with enough jokes to keep you going. Then it gets better and better. Clooney's cameo is fun and very welcome, but the leads, including Sam Rockwell and Luiz Guzman, can easily make it on their own. Sympathetic and funny, in the end funny, Welcome to Collinwood is a welcome addition to the genre.
