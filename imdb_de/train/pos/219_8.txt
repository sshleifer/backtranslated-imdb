Simon's carefully written dialogues are really electrified by Matthau and Burns. You can hear the script literally crackling. There are few films that can develop such a relationship between the actors and the screenplay. For example, the famous reunion scene with less skilled actors could have been a lot more boring. Matthau seems to have been born to play Willie Clark (of course, Oscar moreso in Odd Couple), and with all the little peculiarities and behaviors that Matthau puts into the character (the line in which he argues that he's been there ever since he lives in the city while Lewis lives in the country where Lewis is "out of touch" (this is the fundamental example), which makes this one of the best performances I've ever seen of any actor in any role be it weird or dramatic or whatever Period Matthau and Burns work well together, the contrast they represent underscoring Simon's great talent for creating comedic conflicts, this film is simply one of the ultimate must-see and calls for a legitimate, prestigious place in the pages of film history.
