Fabulous actors, beautiful scenery, strict reality. I will not go into all the comments of other reviewers because you receive the picture! The film is not for the squeamish. The reality is the slaughter of pigs and other animals to survive. I also have Elinore Randall Stewart's homestead book. I read it a couple of years ago, I have to re-read it since I just saw the newly released, remastered DVD of the movie from a video store that went out of business. But Yippee! The DVD is now for sale, I bought it on amazon.com. Not cheap, but worth it for me. This is a movie I will see until the end of my days!
