How To Lose Friends & Alienate People is not based on Tiger Woods' infidelities. It's a mediocre romantic comedy, based on Toby Young's book about his experiences as a journalist who tells celebrities. The film stars Simon Pegg as Sidney Young, a crazy British journalist who takes a job at a famous celebrity magazine in New York. Young is restless when he has caught up with all kinds of shenanigans to alienate him, hence the movie's title. He is rebellious, daring and feeble-minded. But for some very bizarre reasons, he is a somewhat sympathetic character. Sidney befriends a journalist colleague who composed Alison Olsen, who played quite admirably Kirsten Dunst. Sidney, however, is especially longing for sexpot actress Sophie Maes, who is played by the fantastic woman Megan Fox. This foxtrot is a lack of acting skills, but of "eye candy" material. Sidney goes into all sorts of stupidities to the journalists leader in the magazine co. These are the most comedic moments of the movie. However, I think director Robert Weide and scriptwriter Peter Straughan could lose some viewers and alienate authentic Romcom material by developing an implausible romantic storyline between Sidney & Alison; Even if the team Weidstraughan otherwise formulated an entertaining narrative. Pegg has stuck his character to the wire with his weird performance as Sidney Young. Jeff Bridges rebuilt "The Dude" Bridges with his enigmatic supporting work as Clayton Harding, the magazine's polite Prez. But the rest of the movie was not worth being shown here. "How To Lose Friends & Alienate People" should not be completely alienated, but you might lose some movie friends if you release it as a romantic comedy of superlatives. *** Average
