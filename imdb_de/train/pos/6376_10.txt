If you have sons or daughters who love action, adventure, intrigue, and fantasy without having to break into a song every twelve minutes, then this is the Disney movie for you! My sons loved every minute of this movie, and I have to admit that I've laughed a lot of times throughout the movie. There are no juicy songs that could stand in the way of a wonderfully narrated story, and the characters are all gracious and self-identifiable. This should be considered one of the Disney classics due to the beautifully illustrated landscape and the uninterrupted excitement.
