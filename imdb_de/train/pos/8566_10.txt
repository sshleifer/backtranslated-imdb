I really like 101 Dalmations when it came out in 1996. Now, 5 years later, in 2001 I visited 102 Dalmations. I thought it was awesome, but I think 101 is better because I think it's funnier, more humor and also the movie I wondered if there are plans for 103 Dalmations. I hope there is, maybe yes, maybe no, all of us dalmation fans will have to figure it out if there will be 103 dalmations in the future.
