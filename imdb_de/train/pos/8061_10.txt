The performance of Victor McLaglen is one of the best in film history. <br /> <br /> I think we can all feel for "Gypo" because we all fight with what's right and what's wrong and wrong. This was one of the first art-house pictures released by a major American film studio (RKO Radio Pictures). Joseph H. August's cinematography is best here. However, the amazing part of August was mostly overlooked; He did not receive the Oscar nomination, which he rightly deserved. <br /> <br /> This is a psychological drama with thought, philosophy, sadness conveyed in as few words as possible.
