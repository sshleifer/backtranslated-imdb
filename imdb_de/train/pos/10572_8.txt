I feel that the musicals of Warner Bros' Depression era will become more relevant in the years to come. Yes, we are in an economic lull (or have you lived under a rock) and look bleak. But we always have the films to escape our problems. In the 1930s filming was extremely popular even in times of economic depression. "Footlight Parade (1933)" was one such movie to which the audience poured. While this musical, directed by Lloyd Bacon, does not quite capture the social problems of the time as "Gold Diggers of 1933 (1933)," it is still a wonderful venue for talent. We have to wait until the end of the movie for the three middle parts of Busby Berkely's extravagance, but boy, are they worth waiting for me. Yes, little Ruby Keeler is a terrible singer and actress, and her knocking is so-so, but Busby's magical "By A Waterfall" takes her to a dizzying water wonderland. Of course, Busby's numbers could never really be performed on a stage (on the one hand they oppose the gravitational frontier) and are in stark contrast to the realism of hard, white, non-musical scenes. And "Footlight" also has James Cagney on one of his too few musicals (what could not this man actually do?). He can even take over the lead man, put on a sailor suit and get over the sex pot Shanghai Lil (which is really little Ruby in China Girl Wig!) Shitting overlooks in favor of other women (until the final roll). Evidently Blondell was the only other woman Cagney loved next to his wife. And you can see the mutual worship in every scene.
