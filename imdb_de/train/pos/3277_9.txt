This movie is awesome as it tells stories and fantasizes about what a child would do to adults. The idea that a child's drawing becomes a place to visit and influence is wonderful. At the same time, you could let all child psychologists know and say that they are really exploring their subconscious as we all do in our dreams when we sleep. The bit that gives me goose bumps is when her dad is in the paper house and she is persecuted. The only thing I can not stand is that it was marketed as a horror movie ... it really is not. If you want to see something British with a lot of story that you would expect without the usual cheap thrill that most movies have to use, then check out Paperhouse.
