This is the kind of movie you want to see with a glass of wine, fire and feet. It does not take so much brainpower to follow and is very good after a long day. I would say it's very unrealistic - if you expect something serious, do not worry, but it's very funny. Just the idea that a businessman would go so far as to live in a slum for a while and actually enjoy it ... I would definitely recommend it.
