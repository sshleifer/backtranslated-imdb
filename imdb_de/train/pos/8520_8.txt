I actually thought the movie was pretty good. I enjoyed the acting and it went well. The director seemed to really understand the story he was trying to tell. I have to see how the big budget comes out today. Obviously they had much more money to throw on it, but it was very accommodating. If you're watching a movie like this for a small budget, you'll need to take this into account when you watch it. There were a few things that could be better, but most are budget related. The acting was pretty good, the F / X and stunts were well done. A few standouts were the guy who played the camera. and the boy who played the child. This kind of movie has kept LA going and this is one that turned out to be OK.
