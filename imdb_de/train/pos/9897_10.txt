Okay, sorry, but I loved this movie. I love the whole 80s genre of this kind of movie because you do not see so many anymore! I want to ask all people who say that this movie is just a rip-off or a cheesy imitation. What is he imitating? I've never seen another movie like this, well, no horror anyway. <br /> <br /> Basically, it's about the popular group in the school that wants to make everyone's life hell, so they chose Nerdy boy, Marty. It will be fatal if he is really hurt by one of her little pranks. <br /> <br /> Well, it's like 10 years later, and the group of friends that hurt Marty starts receiving Reunion letters from high school. But ... they are the only ones who receive them! So they're going back to the old school, and one after the other is being ... Yeah, you probably know what's going on! <br /> <br /> The only part that disappointed me was the end. It could have been abandoned or better thought. <br /> <br /> I think you should try it and try not to be too critical! <br /> <br /> ~ * ~ CupidGrl ~ * ~
