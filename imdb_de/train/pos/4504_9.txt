Here I thought, "Nanook of the North" is the last word in archaic semi-doc 'Eskimo' films. How Wrong As an avid sea kayaker, I stayed awake until 330 o'clock and watched as I hoped to see some hand made "skin boats". The movie did not let me down. Every student of the kayak / umiak construction should check here. (Note for other skis: They seem to use Norton Sound kayaks with single-bladed paddles.) However, the film went well beyond this admittedly close interest. Although it has, as others have noted, some small back-shot fakey bits, the film has so much heart that they are just a little annoyance. It was probably (from the point of view of this amateur ethnologist) the perfect time to shoot this film. Beginning of the Thirties: The "Talkies" are so new that they (including Louie B. Mayer!) Actually let the Inuit speak in their own language. And there is so much that was still authentic despite the infused melodrama. They really beat that polar bear, this whale and that caribou. A version from the fifties of this film would have been so cheesy with "Stars", Technicolor, etc., to spice it up. The seventies version? Not even a very good companion to this excellent film is "White Shadows in the South Seas" (1928). The reflection on "Eskimo" also deals with the relentless and profound disturbance of Western culture / technology in an unsuspecting person.
