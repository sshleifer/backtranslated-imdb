I loved this movie when it came out in the 80s and still! I still quote classic lines like "Say it again" and "You said you'd rip my eggs off, sir." Ron Leibman was hot and very funny! Although underestimated and disregarded by MAD, I have to say that this little gem will always be a treasure of mine and a movie I would take with me if I send it to a deserted island! I just wish someone would release the DVD because my VHS cassette is almost worn out! If you like cheese comedy, this is definitely for you and should be considered a cult classic! It is best military humor and worse! Rent it if you can not own it!
