Hilarious, evocative, confusing, brilliant movie. Reminds me of Bunuel's L'Age D'Or or Jodorowsky's Sacred Mountain - many strange characters who are frolicking and searching ... what is that? I laughed almost all the way, keeping an eye on the confused and occasionally horrified reactions of the audience in the theater. Entertaining through and through, from the beginning to the guts and poisoned bowels to the end, when it was an end. I just wish I could remember every detail. It haunts me sometimes. <br /> <br /> Frankly, I have only the most positive memories of this movie. Since there seems to be no takeaway and reputation, I'll probably have to wait a few more years before Crispin Glover returns with his Big Slide Show (and "What's That?" Screening). I saw this movie in Atlanta almost immediately after a devastating car accident. I was stunned then, which was perhaps a very good state to see the prophetically speaking arthropods and the retards in the US Superhero costumes and the godlike Glover in his proper setting - Q, lifting up the lightly dressed girls, like one great, wet dream of DADAist. <br /> <br /> Is it a statement about Life as We Know It? Of course, every art expects to be just that. I rather think that the truth is more obvious in the absences and in the negative. What you do not tell us is what we need to deduce from it, but it's far more valid than the lies that feed other people day after day. Rather a "WHAT IS THAT?" than 5000 movies like "Titanic" or "Sleepless in Seattle" (shudder, gag, groan). <br /> <br /> Thank you, Mr Glover (also a funny man on screen or in his big slide show - smart, funny, quirky and terribly hot). Make more movies, write more books, keep the nightmare alive.
