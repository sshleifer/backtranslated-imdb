The book on which this movie is based was excellent; It took a while for Houellebecq's unconventional style to come to grips, but once I understood the mood behind the writing, I was fully immersed in the author's sadness world. In fact, no other book has influenced me that way. This is not necessarily a good thing - it has clarified my own personal struggle and made the futility of my own struggle more difficult. Houellebecq's insights are masterfully captured by Harel and the apathy and indifference of the hero to a world that rejected him is perfectly represented. This is a film that reveals today's society for the lower man in all its horror. Hopefully things will change in the future, but for the time being we have to accept the rat race as shown in this movie. It is probably best that Harel or Houellebecq not create an ingenious work again. One is enough for every man.
