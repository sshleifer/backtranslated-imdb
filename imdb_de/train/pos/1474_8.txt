I saw this movie at the Toronto International Film Festival. It's not as bad as it sounds, this is a three-part documentary (each episode lasts 50 minutes), featuring Slovenian superstar philosopher / psychoanalyst Slavoj Zizek. Zizek takes us on a journey through many classic films exploring sexuality, fantasy, morality and mortality. Sophie Fiennes was directed by the multi-talented Fiennes clan (she is the sister of actors Ralph and Joseph). <br /> <br /> I enjoyed that a lot, though I think it will be even more fun on DVD, because there is such a stew of ideas that can be digested. The analysis of Freud and Lacanian can be quite hard, and seeing the whole series at once became a bit confusing after two and a half hours. It did not help that badly-brewed coffee and possession of a bladder made me feel uncomfortable in the last hour. <br /> <br /> My only real problem with that is that Zizek chose movies that were pretty good, obviously full of Freudian themes. He spends a lot of time with the films of Hitchcock and David Lynch, who are not exactly masters of subtlety. I would have liked to see him try to support his theories with a wider range of films, though I just want to say that I would like to see parts four, five and six. <br /> <br /> Zizek is very funny, and part of the humor was watching him watch a lecture as he inserted himself into the actual scenes from some of the films he's discussing. For example, we see him in a motorboat en route to Bodega Bay (from Hitchcock's The Birds) or in the basement of the Bates Motel (by Psycho). That does not mean that his theories are not provocative. Even if I disagreed with him, I definitely had to think a little bit deeper about the movies. Which is exactly what he is trying to achieve.
