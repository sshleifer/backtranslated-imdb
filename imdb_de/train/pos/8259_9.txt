I suppose the ultimate curse of attending the Toronto Film Festival is when your schedule runs out. To be honest, I'm just happy that Fido was picked up for the US distribution. In any case ... <br /> <br /> Ever seen Shaun of the Dead? Well. How about Lassie? Able to reconcile the two? Well, if you can, your name could be Andrew Currie, the Canadian hero of the first zombie comedy, Family or Zomedy. (Seriously, that's what the press-book in Toronto called it.) Although Fido is not as violent, dry, or British as Shaun of the Dead, it remains true to his roots' infamous sci-fi pulp, which was pumped out during that time. <br /> <br /> Fido's talented headliners (Carrie Anne Moss, Billy Connelly, Dylan Baker and Tim Blake Nelson) testify to the brilliance of the script. The film explores all the implications of its premise: a world where zombies have been turned into servants due to their sheer numbers due to an unusual accident. What would you use your new undead for? A butler? Handwork? A pet? Unpronounceable acts? Fido attacks all these possibilities in a sweet and surprisingly elegant way, thanks to the work of Connelly (as one of the aforementioned zombies) and the young television actor K'Sun Ray, who sometimes seems to be a better young Elijah Wood than the Der Young Elijah Wood was. <br /> <br /> If you expect another Shaun of the Dead, do not waste your time. The genre is far from satisfying, and you'll leave the theater bitter and depressed. But if you're ready to catch a glimpse of what's going on with Shaun of the Dead when he jumps across the lake, you'll be looking forward to something. Imagine Fido as the sensitive, more often beaten little brother of Shaun of the Deads rebellious loser, and you start getting the drift. If you like (or at least tolerate) zombies, little kids, and lots of deadpan satire, Fido is the movie for you. If that is not the case, then you know the drill. Just hit the square between the eyes.
