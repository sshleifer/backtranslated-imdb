Lars von Trier's Europe is an extremely good movie. How is that? Von Trier has a very stylized way of telling a story, at least he had it with Europe. For me, the whole movie was like an experience, even though I saw it on a small TV screen. In my opinion, despite all the tricks, this movie is the most complete, REAL and moving piece of cinema and then most of the movies on the list of the 250 best. I also think that maybe it's the scariest, gothic, and complete movie out there. Well, there are other good ones too, but this one is my favorite. The last scene is one of the most shocking scenes ever.
