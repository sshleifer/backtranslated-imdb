This is a pretty decent example of Film Noir. The scene is in the early 1950s, when the Communists wanted to steal gun secret from the US government. Richard Widmark is the most polite pickpocket without scruple. He gives a pretty decent performance, but there's nothing A-list about him. The interesting thing was that he was not just an antihero, but an unlikely antihero to most of the film. That is not completely normal. Jean Peters performed as well as the whore with the heart of gold. This great actress Thelma Ritter shines as a stool dove. <br /> <br /> The plot had quite a few twists, turns, jokes and tough conversations. There is a fight scene at the end of the movie (in the subway station) that was pretty bleak and exciting. <br /> <br /> I think noir fans (like me) will enjoy this movie. For non-Noir viewers it may seem a bit old-fashioned and the whole commie thing is a bit over the top.
