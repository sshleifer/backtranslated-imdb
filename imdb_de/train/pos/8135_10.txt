I'm shocked. Shocked and dismayed that the 428 of your chosen IMDB users who voted in front of me did not give this movie a rating above 7. - that's a C! If I could give FOBH a 20, I would like to do it. This movie stands on the pantheon of modern comedy alongside Half Baked and Mallrats as one of the funniest films of all time. If you know _alles_ about rap music - you have to see that !! If you do not know anything about rap music - learn something! And then you will! Comparisons with "Spinal Tap" can not appreciate the inspired genius of this unique film. If you liked Bob Roberts, you'll love that. Take a look at it and choose a 10!
