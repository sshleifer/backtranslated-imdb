A well-made ghost story that will give you goose bumps and a few nasty scares along the way. The story develops slowly and builds up atmosphere until you can see the woman in black. You will not forget them when you have seen them. No gore, no knives, no hockey masks - just a well-built story that is best viewed at night without light.
