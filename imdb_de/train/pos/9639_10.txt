A very accurate and sharp description of the bubbly and dynamic emotional world of an 18-year-old man who has his first experiences with his gay love given to another boy during a vacation with a part of his family /> I liked this movie because of its extremely clear and surrogate narrative, with all those "close-ups" and quiet moments that were full of intense moods. <br /> <br />
