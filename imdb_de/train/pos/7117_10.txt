This movie is a fantastic movie. Everything about it was first class in my opinion, from acting to directing. I know Mr. Garfield was blacklisted in the 1950s, but most of his other films are on video, if not on DVD. Why is not it? A friend took it for me from TCM, but it would be great to have it on DVD. For peculiarities one could say that a marine historian talks about the battle, and if Mrs. Schmid or his son is still alive, they could also be interviewed. Anyway, this is a great movie, and I highly recommend it. If he ever comes out hopefully, he will not be colored. Dyeing would, in my opinion, ruin the overall effect of the movie. The fight scene was quite realistic for a 1945 film. Mr. Garfield has presented Mr. Schmid very well. Some actors may have been tempted to surpass the role of Mr. Smith's disability, but I think he got it right. I sincerely hope that, someday on DVD, they will release this film as a tribute to the courage of Al Schmid and all the other Marines who sacrificed so much for us during the Second World War.
