It's just a pleasure to have seen this fascinating project. So refreshing and educational. Not just for a filmmaker who can learn what can be achieved in 5 minutes of screen time, but also as an audience that may not be so ready for such love in such a short time. <br /> <br /> 20 short Films about love in Paris are all unique, but some of them are as expected. I thought the Tom Tykwer (Natalie Portman) segment was the best, though the mimes made me laugh as well. <br /> <br /> I clicked on the option "spoiler" on this check bus. Reading is a spoiler enough. Just look at it. Do not read what I write, but watch the movie instead. <br /> <br /> And you smile.
