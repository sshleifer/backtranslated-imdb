This story is beautifully played. It's sad and heartwarming about a young girl's journey to find out where she's from and where she's going. Stephanie was adopted by her mother's best friend after her mother and father were killed in a car accident. Since she is called a miracle baby, she is dyslexic and finds life a bit hard. Their insights on the way affect those closest to them. Her relationship with her guardian and her guardian's ex-boyfriend is handled very sensitively and sensitively, and the entire cast is real, three-dimensional and believable. In a small peach canning factory in the Australian town, this is a warm, gentle erotic film that will make you feel comfortable when the end credits ends. After reading some of the other, rather shallow comments on Hugo Weaving, I would like to add that in my opinion he was brilliantly cast and extremely sexy. No, he's not Brad Pitt, but that does not mean he's not attractive.
