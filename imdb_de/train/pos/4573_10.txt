Daniel Day Lewis is one of the best actors of our time and one of my favorites. It's amazing how much he throws himself into each of the characters he plays to make them real. I remember, many years ago we had a party in our house - the friends came by, we sat around the table eating, drinking wine, talking, laughing - having a good time. The TV was on - there was a movie we did not pay much attention to. Then we suddenly stopped talking and laughing. The glasses did not ring, the forks did not move, the food became cold on the plates. We could not take our eyes off the screen, where the young, crippled man, whose entire body was directed against him and who was only in control of his left foot, picked up a piece of chalk with his foot, and what seemed like eternity wanted just write a word on the floor. When he had finished this one word, we all knew that we had experienced not one but three victories - the triumph of a human will and a human spirit, the triumph of cinema that could capture that moment in the film, and the Triumph of an actor who did not act, but who became his character. Jim Sheridan's "My Left Foot" is a fascinating, unsentimental Biodrama about Christy Brown, the man born in cerebral palsy, a Dublin slum; The artist and writer was found and found a love of his life. <br /> <br /> I like every appearance of Day Lewis (I have mixed feelings about his performance in GONY), but I think that this is his biggest role was Christy Brown in "My Left Foot"
