Return To The 3th Chamber is the comedic sequel to the epic 36th Chamber Of Shaolin, in which Gordon played Liu Shan Te, a young man who became a monk and a formidable fighter. In this sequel, Liu plays a luckless loser who has to learn Kung Fu after his friends are beaten. He mimics the original Shan Te, tries all sorts of tricks to get into the Shaolin Temple to learn, and finally gets some unique skills to fight some mobbing bosses. It's a classic light martial arts story, with the ace values ​​of the Shaw Brothers and the sure leadership of Lui Chia Liang. The choreography is fantastically fantastic, be it for the fight or slapstick comedy and for Gordon Liu's performance, as well as for the others, especially the sympathetic monk works perfectly for the material. The film is less epic or profound than some of the other stars, and there are certainly bigger, more violent and far-flung Shaw Brothers films. But few have such a magical blend of slapstick, unique training and fighting, with a subtle but warming story of a useless guy who succeeds. Full of carefree joy it is impossible not to rate this with the highest score.
