I think that's a nice family movie. There are many funny scenes and heartwarming moments throughout the movie. The actors are great and the effects are consistently good. Danny Glover plays George Knox, who directs the terrible baseball team "The Angels" and is great throughout the movie. Also fantastic are the young actors Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Milton Davis Jr., who are good as Al 'The Angel' and the effects are great in this first-class Disney movie. A touching and heartwarming movie that everyone should enjoy.
