This movie is great! It touched my stone-cold heart. I could not report on the racial discrimination that Antwone experienced because I live in my own country. I think it's really hard to be discriminated against. <br /> <br /> We saw this movie in our sociology class at New Era University, and I did not know that this is a true story of an intellectual who wants to bring fresh air into the industry. It is very good. <br /> <br /> The part that shocked me was when Nadine Antwone (just six years old) sexually abused her. If I were on his shoes, I could have built a ten-story building. I greet him, that he is so strong! <br /> <br /> The scene that touched me here is when Antwone finally saw his mother Eve face to face. He did not scold her or whatever, instead he told her about the achievements he had made in the long years separating them. (I think I will do that if I have the chance to trace my roots.)
