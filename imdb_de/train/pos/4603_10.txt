There is a detail that is not common in Jackie Chan films, but is present here. It has a very hard and serious atmosphere, while the fun elements are also present. Jackie is here threatening and psychotic. He is not a hero who is attacked and only then defends himself (in an ordinary relaxed pattern), but he is the one who can start the turmoil. His way of putting that bad guy in the glasses is amazing. Every time it goes "crack". I also especially enjoy the scene when Jackie goes to the bar and beats up the bad guys who have come across his girlfriend. It is one of the best blitzkriegs on the screen. The whole scene is filmed against the wall with the background of an action figure (it also looks like a "rabochiy" poster from our Soviet era) and a few lines in Russian on the left (I noticed that by chance). That looks great (and nostalgic for Russian people). I also like it when the windows in the movies are smashed. There are a lot of them here. It's amazing how the characters fall, jump, run and drive through all sorts of slices. <br /> <br /> All three films are great. I was preparing to see the quality slipping down, but I saw a perfect trilogy of sense and incredible stunts (and not only does Jackie Chan's character appear in all three films - it's also great and maintains continuity). > <br /> I would like to describe each film in only a few words: # 1 - great (in every way - it's a gripping story from start to finish) and funny (many scenes are ridiculous); # 2 - raging (Jackie is really here) and painful (Jackie is being tortured); # 3 - unbelievable (the woman fighting alongside Jackie is unbelievable) and bombastic (should I mention many guns and explosions?). <br /> <br /> As for the rest, so was the other. <br /> <br /> It is a trilogy that can be viewed again and again (at least by me). His place is among the top 10 action / comedy gems. After all, it has been released on DVD in Russia (the second movie offers the best options - the Chinese / Russian soundtracks and the English / Russian subtitles). <br /> <br /> Solid 10 out of 10. Thank you for your attention.
