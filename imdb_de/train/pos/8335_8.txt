While the sparkling chemistry between Ryan and Robbins alone is reason enough to see this movie, the minor cast (including Matthau, Fry, Shalub, Durning, and the jolly trio Jacobi, Saks, and Maher) is an added bonus. Matthau shines as Einstein, Fry is perfect as Ryan's clinical fianc√©, and Shalub's line on Einstein's gonads is, as mentioned, one of the movie's highlights. The speech that Robbins makes at his first public appearance is pure poetry. Kudos to the authors who handle this foam with wit and lightness. I also thought that Keene Curtis as Eisenhower is wonderful. This could be considered a kind of movie, but I think everyone will get a kick out of it. Eight very solid points.
