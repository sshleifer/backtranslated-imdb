Glacier Fox is one of the most exciting and beautifully photographed wildlife films ever made. <br /> <br /> The movie makes every member of this fox family take care of it, from the blind cub to the strongest - their adventures are at times hilarious and tragic. In the midst of an inhospitable landscape, the hearts of the public warm to the family members. <br /> <br /> The music score and the text tell the story related to the story of what happens in general terms. <br /> <br /> Man is still one of the biggest predators, but we have no doubt that foxes can live and not only survive beyond human effort.
