This movie was amazing. It had an original concept (that of a vampire movie and a yakuza mob movie). It is a humorous yet highly dramatic and tragic film about friendship, love, immortality, death and happiness and comments that subtly comment on society. On the side of Gackt Camui, Sho's role was taken excellently, and HYDE was surprisingly good for his first movie as the tortured but humorous vampire Kei. I laughed and cried about the happy character Toshi, who grew up with Sho. I loved every second of this movie, especially moments like the funny cigarette scene, the fight scenes and most of all the heartbreaking ending.
