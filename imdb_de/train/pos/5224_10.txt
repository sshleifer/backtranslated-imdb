Ayone, who whines about the fact that this film was crap or that he had no action, must have searched for "Jean de Florrette". HELLO! This film was made a random act of comedy and does not involve any action whatsoever. I also want to remind these ghosts that if you peel the crap out of this movie, they seem to lack the sense. This film is clearly made for people who do not appreciate the so-called "American humor" that seems like a bunch of rotten shit. The point is that everyone has an opinion, and you should put a little more emphasis on the humor of some people not matching your own before you shoot your mouth. <br /> <br /> Thank you
