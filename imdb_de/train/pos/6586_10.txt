Jeremy Brett is simply the best Holmes of all time, who of course just outscores the great Basil Rathbone, and this is probably the best adaptation of a Conon Doyle short story. A length adjustment contains some new storylines that fits well with the surrounding drama and increases the hatred you feel for Milverton. Excellent performances, especially from Robert Hardy, and both Brett and Hardwick are plump and comfortable in their roles great piece of drama.
