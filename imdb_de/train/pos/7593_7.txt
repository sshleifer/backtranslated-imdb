The movie is absolutely stupid. <br /> <br /> But did you expect an intellectual movie based on a comic called Slam Dunk? "Really?" Jay Chous acting is not the most moving thing I've ever seen, but I definitely liked the movie. Was it anywhere near the genre that someone like Jet Li or Stephen Chow can produce? No not true. Was it completely entertaining if you only look at the surface value? Absolute. It is a film about Chinese idolians and musicians who can play basketball at an unrealistic level. There's a bad Triad guy and a crazy, crazy guy who gets Jay Chou involved in all of that. A love interest. It's formulaic, but really, exposing unbelief for a while. Come on. It's called Kung Fu Dunk. What do you think, did you really sign? Do yourself a favor, if you see it - I found a copy with some Engrish subtitles that made the movie almost incomprehensible, but we made a big laugh out of it. They seem extremely focused on Jerusalem and the numbers 1, 10. <br /> <br /> I laughed, I cried, I flung. I would take a look again. <br /> <br /> Especially for this fight scene in the bar. Well choreographed and well shot. I especially like the plexiglass-lit pool table - I would love to play on one of these. <br /> <br /> Slick enough for me, but I'm digging in the dumpster.
