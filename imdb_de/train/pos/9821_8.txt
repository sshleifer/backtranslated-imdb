I saw this movie on True Movies (which automatically made me skeptical), but actually - it was good. Why? Not because of the amazing changes of plot or the breathtaking dialogue (of which there is not much), but because the film, in spite of people's statements, in my opinion, was exactly in its depiction of teenagers concerned with pregnancy. <br /> <br /> It's NOT Dawson's Creek, they are not graceful, cool, funny characters who move through sexuality with effortless insight. They are children and behave like children. <br /> <br /> They are dull, awkward and annoyingly confused about everything. Yes, that could be a coincidence and they might just be bad actors, but I do not think so. Dermot Mulroney gives (if not trying to be cool) a very credible performance and I loved him for it. Patricia Arquette is whiny and annoying, but she was pregnant and a teenager? The combination of the two is not exactly lavender on your pillow. The plot was very predictable and yet what? I believed them to cope with their stress and inability - their courageous but somewhat misguided attempts to bring them closer together. I think the characters played by anyone else were really annoying and unbelievable, but they were not. It reflects the surreality of the situation in which they find themselves, he sits in class and she walks with the baby on campus. I was angry with her for that, I was angry with him for being such a child and accusing her. I felt everything. <br /> <br /> In the end I loved it and would recommend it. <br /> <br /> Watch out for the scene where Dermot Mulroney runs from the catastrophic counseling session - career performance.
