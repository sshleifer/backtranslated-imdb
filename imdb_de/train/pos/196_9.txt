This was a wonderful introduction to the talents and beauty of Marion Davies. She is not only beautiful, but also funny in this movie. (I believe that Lucille Ball may have borrowed her later career from Davies' style, which could be described as "crazy beauty.") Vidor's direction is light but sure, the story is of course a chestnut, but the drama is wonderfully contemporary and the star-watching element for fans of the Silent era with many cameos contributes to the overall fun. It combines the elements of slapstick with the adult drama and the good old, timeless romance quite well. For all movie fans who have a slight reaction to silent movies, sit back and change your mindset. <br /> <br />
