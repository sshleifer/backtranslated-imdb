The material in this documentary is so powerful that it moved me to tears. Yes, I tell you tears. This popular struggle of a traditionally exploited population should inspire us all to stand up for our rights, to create the greater good of the community and to renounce cowardly excuses, not to question the institution. Chavez represents the weak and unfortunate in the same way Bush is the face of filthy businesses and capitalism amuck. In fact, Latin America is being redesigned, and the marginalized majority has finally got a voice in over five centuries. In the case of Mexico, however, the election was clearly stolen by Calderon. Chavez is not perfect, far from it. He tries to change the constitution so that he can govern indefinitely. That can not be tolerated. Enough with politics and back to the movie; The pace is breathtaking in the moments and deeply philosophical in others. It portrays Chavez as a popular hero who is not afraid to question the hegemony of the US and the dominance of the world's resources. If you think that the author is biased towards Chavez, nothing prevents you from doing your homework. A key message of the film is the questioning of sources of information. This was clearly demonstrated by the victims of Snippers who were ashamed of Chavez's followers. Venezuela shames the alleged democracy in America. Hasta la revolucion siempre!
