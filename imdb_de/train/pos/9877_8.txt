<br /> <br /> The presentation by Lily Mars belongs to a film genre that unfortunately seems to have disappeared with the studio system. Ok, now that you know my prejudices, here are some reasons why I think this movie stands out. <br /> <br /> 1. Although the basic plot - Lily Mars (Judy Garland) - goes to New York, becomes a star and wins the heart of her director (Van Heflin), this is a pretty Hollywood story this time more than usual. Although Lily makes her big break when the star stops, she is not successful and has to swallow her pride and play a secondary role in the show again. <br /> <br /> 2. Judy Garland (enough said!) <br /> <br /> 3. The minor cast includes some really great performances. Spring Byington as Lily's mother is really wonderful, as is Fay Bainter (the mother of the director - John Thornway (Van Heflin)). However, the outstanding supporting performance goes to character actress Connie Gilchrist as Frankie, a one-time actress who became a theater keeper. <br /> <br /> Worth a watch. One of those movies designed to make you feel better about the world and your dreams.
