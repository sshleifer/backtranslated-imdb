This is not a "laid-back", but a precise, true-to-life remake of Monicelli's 1958 classic "I Soliti Ignoti" featuring Toto, Mastroianni, Gassman, Cardinale, etc. And that's why all the funny characters and plot are copied, also in detail (like the scene where the photographer steals the camera from the local market). <br /> <br /> I looked at the excellent old version many times and knew all the gangs and the end by heart, but I still enjoyed "Welcome to Collinwood", which has its own freshness and atmosphere. It is interesting to see how the life and ways of the little thieves in Italy of the 1950s are adapted to the US of 2002. Things have not changed much. 8.10.
