I look at this page, and it seems to me disapproving to have to listen to someone rippling a real classic. Sure, I agree that everyone has their say, but here's mine: <br /> <br /> This movie should not be a classic horror watcher and should be seen by many casual audiences around the world. Sure, it has lost some of its flair and size with age, especially in today's world of CGI effects, but that's why you should not like it. <br /> <br /> You should like it because it is actually a scary movie even for today's standards. It is ickyness overall that you will crawl just like the original audience. So do not hit a classic if you did not give it a chance. Watch it, but not with a critical attitude. Watch it for fun, as originally intended.
