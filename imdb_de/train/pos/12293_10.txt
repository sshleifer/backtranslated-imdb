This is an excellent movie and a kind of treasure that can only be caught through sporadic movie screenings, as it is not available on video / DVD. The way the movie begins with the arrival of the two lovers and ends with leaving (although quite a bit in between, and they do not stay in one place at the same time) gives you a sense of closure and feeling that everything goes along with it the world is right. If you have the opportunity to watch this movie, do it. I can not wait to see it again, and I wish it could be widely publicized.
