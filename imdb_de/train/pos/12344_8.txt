The Sea Is Watching was created after an original Akira Kurosawa script and is indeed a lush and warm movie. It will be a pleasure to see it! <br /> <br /> Keiai as a director is certainly not up to the old but everlasting masters (especially the mass scenes at the beginning of the film seem terrible), but the overall mood and scenery is very pleasant. Another thing missing here: Kurosawa has always managed to leave the characters so much more than what they actually show and do. <br /> <br /> That was probably his magic at the shoot; and maybe this script was not quite up to date yet. <br /> <br /> Maybe we just miss the Master's eye. <br /> <br /> This is a beautiful and sweet movie, but it's not Kurosawa's to expect that, could be very stupid ...
