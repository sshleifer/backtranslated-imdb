The movie "MacArthur" begins and ends with General Douglas MacArthur, Gregory Peck, Alma Mata of the US Military Academy of West Point on the Hudson. We see a frail 82-year-old Gen. MacArthur holding the closing speech of 1962 on the honor of serving her country. The film then goes on to look back on Gen for almost two hours. MacArthur's brilliant as well as controversial career begins over in the darkest hours of World War II on the beleagured island of Corregidor in the Philippines in the spring of 1942. <br /> <He had said he should leave the island for Australia before the Japanese military was conquered by General MacArthur for the first time in his military career. He resisted almost a direct order of his superordinate US President Franklin D. Roosevelt, Dan O'Herlihy. Feeling that he would leave his men in the worst hour of hardship, MacArthur reluctantly did with his wife and son what he was told, just to trace him in memory of the war. For this reason, the flight of the Japanese from death or imprisonment, General MacArthur broke out every two years to get the FDR to launch a major invasion of the Philippians instead of the island of Formosa. Support his promise to both the Filipino people as well as the thousands of US POWs left behind. That he will return and return with the power of the US Army & Navy to support his promise! <br /> <br /> In the two years leading up to the invasion of the Philippine Islands, General MacArther invaded the Japanese forces in the South Pacific in a series of brilliantly designed island hop battles that isolated and starved hundreds of thousands of Japanese troops to surrender. The General did so much less than the US military than any other commander of the Allies in the Pacific War! <br /> <br /> It was the Korean War in 1950/51 when General MacArthur achieved his most brilliant victory and his worst military defeat. After outflanking the deploying North Korean army in a brilliant and perfectly executed army, the marching US Marines had less than 100 dead, backdoor or left hook invasion by Inchon Gen. MacArther felt invincible and sent the US / UN troops under his command too much along the Yalu River from communist Red China. His subordinates say he is under threat from a massive attack by Communist Chinese forces Gen. MacArthur, which was in any case pushed on until this attack disintegrated the US and UN forces. The unstoppable wave of attacks by Red Chinese forces forced the US / UN forces to retire into the "Big Bug Out" of 1950, leaving all their equipment behind and leaving the South Korean capital beyond Seoul's North Korean border! It turned out to be one of the biggest military disasters in US history. The US armed forces lost a record. In the Korean War, 1,000 lives were claimed on the first day, the first day. 29/30 1950's Communist Chinese invasion! Shocked and humiliated with what he admitted by his own arrogance, MacArthur went on the offensive, not against the rising Communist Chinese and North Korean forces but his own Commander and Chief Pres. Harry S. Truman, Ed Flanders, in which he is unable to do what needs to be done: Start a full-scale invasion of Communist China with nuclear weapons, if necessary, to prevent his forces from becoming Korean Peninsula surprise! For Pres. Truman, who had just taken enough garbage from General MacArthur, in which he shut his mouth in public because he had maltreated the war by not doing everything MacArthur wanted, against the Red Chinese, that was the last straw ! On April 11, 1951 Pres. Truman experienced gene. MacArthur unceremoniously from his command as Commander-in-Chief of US / UN troops in Korea! Pres. Truman's courageous but very unpopular decision prevented World War III from breaking with the ally of the Soviet Union-Communist China-which at that time-like the US-had the atomic bomb, because it did not follow MacArthur's entire war strategy. Pres. Truman's controversial decision, the very popular gene. MacArthur's dismissal also cost him his re-election in 1952, as his poll ratings in the mid-1920s were so low that he retired from the US presidential campaign in March this year! <br /> <br /> It was the misfortune of General MacArthur to be near when the political and military climate in the world changed, as future wars should be waged. With the horrors of a nuclear war, 1950/51, it would have been a reality, it would have been a national suicide, like General MacArthur's attempt to crack down on the Red Chinese, possibly triggering a nuclear holocaust that would devour not only the US. USSR and the red China, but the whole world! This important reality of the future war was never taught by General MacArthur, since the A and H bombs at West Point had not yet been invented. Back in 1962 we can now see this gene. MacArthur, having finished his speech at West Point, was both an older and wiser soldier and, since his resignation from the US military, an older statesman in his sense of war and utter futility. One thing General MacArthur had taught at an early age, from his Civil War general, Dad Douglas MacArthur Sr., who had held him up all his life, was that for a soldier like himself, war would be the very last resort in the settlement should be problems between nations. In it the soldiers must fight and die. With the advent of the nuclear age, it took a lifetime for General MacArthur to realize how right and wise his father was to win a Congress Medal winner like he really was!
