This is a simple, old spooky ghost story. I showed it to friends in my movie club and they were banned to the end! No blood or blood, just good old tension. It starts right from the start and builds and builds. The end is a real twist that surprised me. <br /> <br /> Well judged and played well. It is also a "period piece" that plays in the 1920s and enhances the atmosphere. <br /> <br /> I was so impressed that I got the book from Susan Hill from Amazon. The film follows the book pretty well. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that it is not readily available on DVD. My copy is VHS. Together with "Haunted" these are probably two of the best ghost stories I've ever staged. Which only shows that a little creativity comes over every day "in your face"!
