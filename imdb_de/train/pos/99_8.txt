A Christmas Together actually came before my time, but I grew up with John Denver and the songs from this special were always my family's Christmas music. For years, we made a crackling tape from a record, which meant it was Christmas. A few years ago, I finally found a video of it on Ebay. After listening to all the music for over 21 years, I saw John and the Muppets themselves in action. If you ever get the chance, it's great fun - great music, heartwarming and cheesy. It's also interesting to see the 70's versions of the Muppets and compare them to their newer versions today. I think Denver actually took some heat for a show like this. Usually, performers make no compromises when they do sing-a-longs with the muppets, but I'm glad he did. Even if you can not find the video, the soundtrack is well worth it. It has some traditional Muppified favorites, but also some original Denver songs.
