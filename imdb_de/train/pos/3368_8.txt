A visit by Hitler to Rome is the background to this delicate story of love, friendship, homosexuality and fascism. Sophia Loren plays the housewife and mother of six children who stay at home while her entire family goes to the military parade in honor of Hitler and Mussolini. She has to stay home because the family can not afford a maid. She would have liked to leave because, together with the entire residential complex in which she lives, she is a passionate admirer of Il Duce. <br /> <br /> But there is one exception. On the other side of the courtyard, Marcello Mastroianni sits in his chair and thinks about suicide. The reason? He's gay and has recently lost his job as a broadcaster. The movie really starts when these two people meet by chance. Mastroianni is desperate and desperately needs a friend. Loren, frustrated by her own deceitful husband, misunderstands Mastroianni and in a masterfully shot, controlled and auditioned scene on the roof of the building complex her body offers him only the rejection. The initial stumbling block soon becomes replaced by her hunger for this man, this antifascist, this homosexual, this other world so willing to give her everything she longs for, replacing film with two of the most talented actors of all time. Loren proves that she is a Californian actress with good direction. This is a simple yet powerful film about fascism, love, ordinary people and above all the human situation. Despite the sad ending, there is a glimmer of hope in the dissolution, things will change, somebody has understood.
