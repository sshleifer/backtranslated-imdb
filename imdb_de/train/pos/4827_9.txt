And that's why historical / biographical films are so important to us all, even if they're made as good as these! <br /> <br /> Before I saw "The Young Victoria" I knew a few things about Queen Victoria, but in the end I got a lot more knowledge about it. <br /> <br /> Emily Blunt is just great as Victoria (who would guess that!) and she's likely to get a nomination for this year's Oscar. Personally, I rejoice for you ... <br /> <br /> For technical questions, I am pleased to say that this is a very successful production, with wonderful Art Direction / Set decoration and of course how it was expect it to be a fantastic periodic costume design! <br /> <br /> The only downside is that I want to see more and find out more about this interesting queen, but above all an incredible wife and mother! <br /> <br /> BRAVO: 9 out of 10!
