This is one of the best movies on the market and that says a lot that it was for television. I really wish it was on d.v.d. She played a rookie cop who was perfectly thrown into the serial killer case. If she falls apart because he kills another child, that was amazing. She is so alone, so he comes to her. When she talks about her mother! WOW! <br /> <br /> Steven Weber as a serial killer was so shocking! He really brought her into his dark world. It was Oscar-worthy. When he talks about killing the children, scary! If he realizes who she really is! What a scene !! <br /> <br /> You really do not do it like that anymore. It was a real thriller without being bloody.
