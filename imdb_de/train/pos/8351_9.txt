I remember riding to Spain at the age of 25 and bringing along two people who had defied themselves as little Italian crooks. They did a lot outside the law, but from the other side they wore a little portrait of Jesus in their pocket for their protection ... fair and unfair, good and bad, criminal and right, here in a new combination, out of the categories, I knew. 'Les Valseuses' gives me, though a film and not the real life, a picture that comes close to my own experiences: the intensity of every single moment as soon as you 'leave everything behind' and the serious seek mental state and also 'dangerous' Life form, because, as we all know, there are people who are not ready and willing to prosecute you for "theft" and so on ... This film touches "values", It's a story about what right and wrong is: morality. It is the resurrection of the individual who freely fights against 'false morality' and conformism ... There are dangers, because how far can you go with your own 'freedom' and your own moral boundaries and those of others transcend people? What do you do with people who are willing to hurt you, imprison you, or even shoot what you are doing, for example, steal "gas from a multinational oil company for your fifth car"? Les Valseuses raises these questions in me again, because morality, in contrast to the usual "media message" is quite complex ...
