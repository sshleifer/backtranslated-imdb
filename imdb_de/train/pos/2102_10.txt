When I sat down to Largo Winch, I expected nothing more than action scenes and fascinating cars. When I got up, I saw both of them; and more. <br /> <br /> At first, Karl Roden was not the antagonist in a movie. Kristin Scott Thomas played her role well, but in my opinion the real two stars were Tomer Sisley and Miki Manojlovic, both of whom played superbly. In Radivoje Bukvic Goran played well. <br /> <br /> The mixed linguistics brought a nice color to the movie, but I understand why people would get bored. <br /> <br /> The landscape of Hong Kong, and especially the breathtaking Croatian sea, both inspired me, and I hardly wanted to take my eyes off the screen as Largo entered the incredibly beautiful island. Rolls Royce Phantom; Mercedes S500 and BMW 7; if someone loves expensive sedans; that's her movie. It's also a movie for people who love action sequences, good acting, landscapes of extreme beauty, and above all, a fast-paced, well-written action movie with a dazzling fight and an intricate inner drama. </ Br> /> My voice, as it has lit up a gloomy day, is: 10/10
