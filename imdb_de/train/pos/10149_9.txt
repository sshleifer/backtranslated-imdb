A cute funny story of two people preparing for their wedding. The former police and public school teacher collapse in this magnificent New York setting, though they marry other people. Maybe a bit banal, because the "partners" are both Type A personalities, while our protagonists are much more relaxed. Nothing hard, but I had to smile. And hey for the guys - sell the Natasha Henstridge Angle and the girls - sell them the juicy romance, everyone wins!
