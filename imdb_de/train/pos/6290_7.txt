Using Buster Keaton at dusk for his career was an interesting decision. He was perhaps the most talented comedian of the quiet age. This gives him the chance to present these talents in a small time travel history. He associates with a man living in modern times and it is obvious that we are best left in our time. I've heard his voice before. I think he made some of these beach party movies and played some empty characters just to make a few bucks. Serling seemed to have respect for him and portrayed him like that. It is not a bad story. It shows how to react when we wish something we do not have and get that wish.
