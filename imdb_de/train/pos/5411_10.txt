I do not see any sense in burying such a film in sulphurous sarcasm, when it is by no means intended to be more than a vehicle to entertain children and prepare them for the next line of goods that cares like crazy /> This is a funny movie. My children sat quietly through the whole thing and loved every minute. Granted, the bad guy is a bit over the top with his stupid costume and crazy laugh, but that's a lot easier to take than the dark, gloomy and very morbid Pokemon 3. My kids got it. I've watched Pokemon from the start and they'll be in soon eternity, where they will "put off the childish things" and pass to others. I am glad that we could enjoy this together.
