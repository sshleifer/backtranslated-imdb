I thought that was an extremely charming movie. The story seems to be a veiled autobiography of John Waters: Pecker's greatest gift is his ability to find beauty in unexpected places. Edward Furlong is good in the lead but the best performances are achieved by his grandmother Mink Stole (a funny cameo) and especially Patty Hearst. I think the reviewers are far from that. They seem to consider Pecker's worst assessment of his work as a gospel, if I think that the film pretty clearly says that he is indeed a promising artist.
