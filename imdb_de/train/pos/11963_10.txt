"Scoop" is Woody Allen's funniest movie of the 2000s. Allen, though he's finally looking his age, is Sidney Waterman, the low brow magician, at the top. His one-liners and his appearance are funny. Do not let the criticism influence your opinion. "Scoop" is a first class "Woody-Lite" picture. <br /> <br /> The classical music score is a great compliment to the action on screen. Scarlett Johanson looks beautiful in this bathing suit. Jackman is dashing. The cinematography lights up. "Scoop" is wonderful escapist fare from start to finish. Alone the last shot of the movie is worth the price.
