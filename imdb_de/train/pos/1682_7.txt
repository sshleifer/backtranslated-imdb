After the director Sergio Martino had dipped his toes in the masterpiece movie "The Strange Vice of Mrs. Wardh" (1971) in the Giallo Pool, followed him in the same year another curious suspense thriller "The Case of the Scorpion's" dick. "Like his earlier attempt, this great, handsome macho-type George Hilton is the star who would star in the following year in Martino's Satanic / Giallo hybrid" All the Colors of the Dark. "In" Scorpion's Tail. " See also the actors Luigi Pistilli and Anita Strindberg, who later became an unlucky couple (to say the least!) in Martino's "Your vice is a locked room and only I have the key" (1972). (I just love this title!) I think Edwige Fenech was busy the month they made this movie, and in any case, this movie offers the stylish direction that Martino fans would expect, as well as a curvy storyline, a couple of fei n made murder sets and beautiful Athenian locations. This time around, it's an insurance agent (Hilton) and a journalist (Strindberg, who looks like Farrah Fawcett's prettier, smarter sister), who, after a plane crash and the inheritance of a million widows, become involved in a series of cruel murders. I really thought I had seen this picture half way through, but I was totally wrong. Although the plot makes sense in this giallo, I may need to revisit the movie to see all the subtleties. Highlights of the picture for me were Anita's cat-and-mouse fight with the murderer at the end, a particularly exciting house burglary and a skilful fight on a tiled roof; There are many good action bursts in this movie! The fine people of No Shame are still a great DVD with beautiful subtitles and interesting extras thanks. It has turned out to be a great outfit to rescue these lost Italian gems from oblivion.
