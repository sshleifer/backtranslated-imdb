Talk about a dream cast - just two of the most wonderful actors ever to appear in the world - Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smith - together - in "Hot Millions", a fun, quirky comedy starring Karl Malden, Robert Morley and Bob Newhart. Ustinov is a former embezzler who receives the curriculum vitae of a talented computer programmer (Morley) and occupies a position in a maldemated company - with the aim of embezzlement. It is not smooth sailing; He has attracted the attention of his competitor in the company playing Newhart, and his neighbor Maggie Smith (who knows him at another place under her residence) becomes his secretary for a short time. She can not keep a job and is seen throughout the film in a variety of employment relationships - everything ends with her being fired. As Newhart takes her step forward, she asks Ustinov to curry as a cover-up in her apartment, but the two soon decide that they are made for each other. Of course she does not know that Ustinov is a crook. <br /> <br /> This is such a good movie - you can not help but love Ustinov and Smith and be fascinated by Ustinov's machinations, genius and genre as he gets out of trouble. But there is a turn-end that will show you who really has the brain. Do not miss this movie in London in the 60s. It's worth it if only Maggie Smith hears moaning, "I've been fired."
