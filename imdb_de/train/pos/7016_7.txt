Although I can understand the bad things someone has to say about this movie, I still found it amazing. It will touch you, and if your critic does not dive deep into the mistakes and misadventures of any movie, or you are not touched by anything, it's worth a visit. Do not come into the movie and do not expect anything, you only have a box of handkerchiefs and you are open minded. It's beautiful and the acting is brilliant. I think Will Smith, though once again playing another, lonely, depressive person, is amazing. I think a good actor is someone who can express feelings and emotions that we have all experienced during our worst / best experience in a way that he can reach you and make you feel something. And that's exactly what this movie does. Give it a chance.
