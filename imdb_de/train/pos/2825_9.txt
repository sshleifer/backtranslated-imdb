This movie was pretty surprising. I did not expect much, to be honest. Greta Garbo's first Hollywood movie? So what? Probably something rough and with the usual exaggerated arm angles and facial distortions that so often show inferior silent films. <br /> <br /> Well, I was wrong. Greta Garbo must have shocked the studio people as much as she did, because this film made her a star, and rightly so. She instinctively understood the power to just stand still or simply hold meaningful expression for a long, long-lasting moment so that her impact could be felt and not just seen. I kept thinking about how this modern actress became a squeaky silent movie. She was only years and years ahead of her time. <br /> <br /> The story is not particularly interesting, it is the usual story of love found and lost. It's just the image of Garbo as Leonora, the poor village girl who does well in the big city and then returns to get the man who got away with what gives him life. Co-star Ricardo Cortez is ready to go, but his character is never really developed and he is humbled by the entire script. Once he has to wear Garbo's clothes, let it go terribly, then shamelessly return and give it back. And let's not even talk about his horrible final scenes with Garbo and his wife. Far too ordinary, he has not had a great career and I can understand why. But it is enough as an enigmatic object of Leonora's obsession. <br /> <br /> There is an absolutely fantastic line in this movie that says it all. "Leonora, you will be conspicuous." Yes, conspicuous indeed. <br /> <br /> If you really want to know what it's about without watching the movie, just look at the last 30 seconds. "She has to be so happy, she has everything she wants" - yes, Garbo's face says it all. I have to see that again, Garbo is just incredible.
