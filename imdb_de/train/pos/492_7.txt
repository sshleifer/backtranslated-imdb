First of all, let me say that even though I have reviewed every episode of StarTrek at least twice, I do not consider myself a trekker or trekker. These are people who live in the basement of their parents and attend conventions in costumes with pointed rubber ears. I gave this movie seven casting, apart from the historical mistakes of fiction. The drama was better than the average, but the plot had no surprises in store. They went to great lengths to reverse the technology, but the special effects were still too much of a temptation. Well, the historical mistakes, if you call them that, was the first Capitan to drive the Enterprise, Commander April, then Pike. I trained them and gave them the technology (that's why a world-class policy was created). But as I said, this is no reason to discredit this beautiful series. I hope the actions get deeper, and special effects can take a back seat.
