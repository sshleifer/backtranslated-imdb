Maybe I loved this movie partly because I felt in the dumps and it's such a nice little fairy tale. Whatever the reason, I thought it was perfect. Great, intelligent story, nice effects, excellent acting (especially De Niro, which is great). This movie made me happier when I was awhile. <br /> <br /> It's a very funny and smart movie. The frantic joke about the history of the Kingdom of the Princes and the consequences, the magical effect on the witch, and dozens of smart little touches have all cast a spell on me. That matters a lot, what makes it so good; It's a lavish, special effects-laden movie with more stories than most fairytale films, but there is incredible attention to small things.
