James Cagney is known for his tough character and gangster roles, but he has also played a lot of soft characters in his career. This musical is one of them and it was the first, but not the last, musical movie that Cagney would play. <br /> <br /> Cagney even sings a bit and a lot of dancing in this movie. And it must be said that he was not bad. He plays the role with a lot of confidence. He apparently had some dance jobs in his early life before his acting career began to take a long time. So it's no strange thing that he also took on some musical roles in his career. Obviously, he also feels comfortable in this completely different genre than most people are used to seeing him. <br /> <br /> The film is directed by Lloyd Bacon, perhaps one of the best and most successful directors of the genre. His first 30s musicals pretty much determined the genre and he was also responsible for genre films like 42nd Street. His musicals were always easy and fun to watch and more comedy than anything else. "The '30s musicals were never really about their vocals. This was something that was used more in the 1940s and later made musicals, mainly from the MGM studios. <br /> <br /> As usual, it has a light and simple history. In the musical world, of course, this is also predictable and develops in a formulaic way. Still, it's a funny and simple story that makes it easy to make entertaining movies. Likewise the characters and actors who represent them. Somehow weird that the movie's entire plot line is somehow abandoned towards the end of the film when the movie starts to consist of musical number routines. The end of the movie is also amusing and well done, even though I'm not a big fan of the genre , Once again, the music numbers include a young Billy Barty. He often played little boys / babies / mice and whatever earlier in his career, including the film score "Gold Diggers of 1933" from a year earlier. <br /> <br /> A recommended movie from the early genre. <br /> <br /> 8/10
