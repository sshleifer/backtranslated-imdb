This movie is fun to watch. If you liked "Dave" with Kevin Klein, you'll get a kick here. Think of "Dave" from South America when Dreyfus plays Jack Noah, an actor between the jobs selected by the head of the island state of Parador's secret police to replace the drunken shot of a dictator, Alfonse Simms, after he did so has a heart attack and died. Noah limps with the support of the ex-dictator's lover as they try to thwart Raul Julia's plans. Jonathan Winters also appears as a hearty American emigrant who turns out to be a CIA. Also with Polly Holiday and Fernando Rey. <br /> <br /> There are a few absurd moments, such as keeping the old dictator's body frozen for a year, and the last scene, in the Sonia Braga, of the bloody, bullet-ridden body of Dreyfus weighed moments is all in immaculate white, with no spot on it. But all in all, it's a great move.
