I just looked through a couple of old VHS tapes and found the television program John Denver & The Muppets A Christmas Together. That made me go to my computer and see if I could buy a DVD version of this show. I was disappointed not to be able to find it on DVD yet. The show was broadcast in 1979 and was a delightful show. I have the record and the CD, but I would like to buy a DVD version of this show. The band is old and the picture quality is pretty good, but the sound is not as good as on the CD. There are also some other songs that are not included on the CD. As a fan of John Denver and the Muppets, a DVD of this show would really be a good seller. If you do not have the CD, this is a wonderful collection of Chritmas songs from this show. The album is also good if you can find it and still have a turntable to play.
