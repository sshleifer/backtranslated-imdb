* SPOILERS * <br /> <br /> This is just the second pay-per-view where I have awarded a perfect 10. The first was the 1991 Royal Rumble. It was full of exciting games that would not be remembered but simply fun. And that's why I love it. <br /> <br /> The opening match between Razor and DiBiase and Ludvig Borga vs.. Marty Jannetty were the only low points. It was OK matches, but DiBiase earned more in his last pay-per-view match. Nowadays, a game like this would have an idea and a climax for Razor's first big baby face. And Jannetty, fresh from an Intercontinental title run, could have played better with Borga. But I do not think it really meant anything to anyone. All they needed was a Borga push on pay-per-view television. IRS and The Kid were great, as were Michaels and Perfect. I wish Perfect could win, but Michaels does not settle for anyone. Note that he left the WWF immediately afterwards so he does not have to apply to Razor. Bret Hart had two great fights with Doink (note how good everyone is against the hit man) and then Lawler. Her rivalry was a classic; That's why this year's "Feud of the Year" was a breeze. How often do you see two legends win Feud of the Year at the end of their careers? <br /> <br /> The Steiners-Heavenly Bodies match was one of the best of the year. Who would have thought that the Bodies could compete against one of the best teams of all time? Many say that Undertaker-Giant Gonzalez's match is a waste of time. But I loved it. Remember, what made the old WWF (like before, WWE) great was the mix of athleticism and freak show. Is there a soul out there that Akeem did not like? <br /> <br /> The main event was not bad, although it was close to the year's status. They put up Lex Luger well, but decided that yokozuna was holding the belt. He was the first heel since superstar Graham, who held the belt for more than two months. Heels are always masters nowadays. But from the beginning of the WWWF to the WWF of the 90s, if you blinked, you missed the rules for a heel title. <br /> <br /> As an old school wrestling fan, this and SummerSlam '88 are my favorites.
