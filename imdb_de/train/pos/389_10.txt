Yes exactly. Sammo Hung starred as early as 1983 "To Warrios from the Magic Mountain". Now, in 2001, he does it again with "To Warriors". But this time he finally gets it right. You rarely see him in Wuxia, more often in the classic Eastern or Crime Slapstick. But this role just suits him! The ancient Chinese legend of Berg is often not portrayed in films (as far as I know, films have been translated for the west). Although the legend contains many interesting stories and possibilities. Just said: you have not seen a story in a modern movie! And that makes it so great! And wow: All the colors and the enormously deep, heartfelt story let you instantly fall for this movie. The first time I saw it, I had to look at it again, and I did it. OK, I did not understand it all the first time. But that only makes it better! You know, you did not understand everything because it has so much spice in it! Therefore, it is a pleasure for yourself to watch it over and over again. And yes, it grows deeper in your heart the more you look at it. <br /> <br /> Summary: A love story, characters you cry with, and really: a movie you'll never forget! - Editor's note: Well, I think I have to look at it again: D
