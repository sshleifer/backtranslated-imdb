I think this is a great version, I came here earlier to help me which version I should use, and I went to Jane Eyre in 1983, read a comment from the users' comment and then helped this one To get version. I do not regret having chosen this version, nor do you. I tried to look at all the other versions and none of them fit together. There is nothing like the book, and TRUST ME when you read the book, if you want something that fits. If you're looking for something real and moving after reading the book, it's hard because you want something that suits you. I would say that God personally led me to this version. It shows true love for a person. I would say God's love is greater. If there is something better, I would like to see it. but so far it is not like that!
