I read so many comments that I also talked about remembering that movie and wanted him to see it again, but I did not know what the movie was called. Luckily, I read the comments left here because I did a search and found the title on this page. I realized that this was the movie I remembered. I then searched and found the movie and was so excited that I was able to watch it 40 years later. Thanks to this page and your comments, you helped me and I would like to thank you all. I would like to tell you how I could find this movie for anyone who also searched for a copy. It was on the VHS version of Wonderful World of Disney's "Call It Courage," which included two films, the second was "The Legend of the Boy and the Eagle." It touched me as much as it did 40 years ago, and now I have my own copy of it. I think it's only available on VHS. I found it on ebay and saw several copies of it. Enjoy it, I know that I did it! <br /> <br /> It's a wonderful story about the love of a boy and the eagle he cared for. When it was time to sacrifice the eagle, the boy released the eagle because he could not allow it to be killed. After the boy had to leave the tribe after the liberation of the eagle, the eagle also saved the boy's life and taught him how to survive. The closeness that the boy and the eagle had in the wilderness was so moving and the shooting was truly remarkable. What was that wonderful time. I have never seen anything near this movie!
