Remember, I'm a fan of the genre, but have recently seen this movie for the first time. As I have overlooked all this time, it is a miracle to me. For me, this is a better movie than the much-praised "High Noon". It's a great western with excellent acting and a great story. The DVD is in beautiful black and white with excellent cinematography. If you like Western or James Stewart, you can not miss this movie.
