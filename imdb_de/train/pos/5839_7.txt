The last (I think) of the films that The Boys did with Hal Roach is also the last really funny movie they made before they went to the fox of the 20th century, which made their talents so famous. While there are weak moments - the "lung tester" business, for example, is a bit, oh ... crowded (but worthwhile, just to see "Dr." Jimmy Finlayson) - but on the whole, this is one of those stripes good summary of what the guys brought to the screen. Richard Cramer (uncredited) starred in other L & H films and threatens him as convicted Nick Granger. The scene in which The Boys have to eat their own synthetic food ("Looks good, smells good and probably tastes good. Eat it.") Is one of my favorite moments in the overall work. Stan & Ollie will always be a pleasant companion in the lives of millions of enthusiastic fans.
