Rock 'n' Roll High School was one of the best movies ever made! I think the only reason it was so great was because of the Ramones! You could not have done the same movie and use something like Sex Pistols or The Clash instead of The Ramones, it just would not have been the same. Dey Young, Clint Howard, Vincent Van Patten, Mary Woronov, Paul Bartel and the salooners just added to the film. The whole movie is about the Ramones ... especially Joey! So everyone has shown Rock 'n' Roll High School if you're a big fan of real PUNK. Not the soft crap ... but the loud and fast style. The kind that only the Ramones could do. R.I.P (Rest In Peace) Joey Ramone 1951-2001. Dee Dee Ramone 1952-2002!
