Okay, there are a lot of reviews here, what can I add? <br /> <br /> I will try anyway. <br /> <br /> The reason this is my favorite Scrooge is due to EVERYTHING. The sets, outdoor venues, costumes are so beautiful and authentic. The music is cute. The side occupation is very well done. One of my favorites is the narrator and nephew, played by Roger Rees. His unobtrusive sincerity touches and his voice is the Christmas sound to me. David Warner is also an absolutely believable Bob Cratchit. His life is difficult, but he remains positive and dignified. <br /> <br /> The best of course is George C. Scott as Ebenezer Scrooge. Some have said his portrayal too roughly. I could not argue anymore. His exchange in the beginning, when he was cold or hard, was not of character. He is a terribly disappointed man whose heart has been hardened by the vicissitudes of life and his own greed for wealth. <br /> <br /> During the flashbacks, it's obvious he's not all rude. Here we see that there is hope for him. If he was completely gone, his partner Marley would not have come for him at all. And finally we have no hope anymore. I think that's a HUGE part of what Dickens tried to say. When Scrooge looks at his employer with Belle, you see him smiling regretfully as he tells Belle in the flashback that he'll go through life "with a grin on my face". As a director, Clive Donner was smart enough to make those moments film. Sometimes they stay on the floor of the editing room. <br /> <br /> And finally, his conversion is so utterly joyful that every time I see it, I bring tears of joy. His apology to his nephew Fred, so sincere and moving, is not only the spirit of Christmas, but of humanity as well. The joy he gives Fred to his wife is so obvious. And the line that brings me every time, "God forgive me the time I wasted". <br /> <br /> Bravi Tutti!
