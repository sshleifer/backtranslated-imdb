Ride with the Devil, like the later Brokeback Mountain by Ang Lee, is a film of aesthetic and historical significance. Film lovers should see it at least twice, as their artistic nuance is worth being understood. <br /> <br /> A perfect work of art, surprising depth of humanity. I really can not remember another war movie, it will capture you so, change your existing idea of ​​history and politics, restore your belief in humanity. After experiencing so many murders and so much suffering, you do not feel numb, but appreciate the connection between people more. The performances of the actors follow your heart, the music pushes you through. Some drives are not just images, they transcend themselves and become the soul's vision. That's the true feeling that film is a genre of art. <br /> <br /> A movie like this does not need long comments or criticisms, anything that it says on its own. Ovation to the performers, including Tobey Maguire, Jeffrey Wright and Jewel Kilcher, the cinematographer and composer of beautiful and lyrical music, what a performance!
