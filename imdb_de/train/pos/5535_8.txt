The very first picture of the film shows a ridge in the early morning fog and my thought was, "That's almost too good." And so it goes on: landscape and animal pictures that look like a series of romantic paintings that are perfect in every detail. Even the girl's room, her father's car - everything is nostalgic, romantic and beautiful. This may seem outdated and fleeting, but fits in with a story that is itself of quiet beauty and takes place at the border between life and fairy tale between Dian Fossey and Le Petit Prince. I enjoyed every minute. The extreme thriftiness of the film, with a simple, slow story, a single actor and few special effects, exerted a strong magic. I find it therefore regrettable that this thriftiness is given up in the last few minutes when suddenly two additional actors (the girl as an adult woman and her son) are introduced. Another drawback is the music, which is often obtrusive, Hollywood-like and sometimes inappropriate: I could not bring together an English pop song with French mountain scenery. I went to the movies with my two little daughters, but I also recommend them to adults as they appreciate this kind of movie. Obviously not everyone.
