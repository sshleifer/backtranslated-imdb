For my humanities quarter project for the school, I decided for human trafficking. After some research on the internet I found this DVD and ordered it. I just looked at it and still think about it. All I can say is "Wow". It's a fascinating story of a 12-year-old Vietnamese named Holly and an American named Patric trying to save her. The end leaves you out of breath, and though it's not a happy ending, it's very realistic. It's amazing and I recommend it to anyone! You really have a connection to Holly and Patric and your heart is breaking for her and for what's happening to her. I loved it so much and now I want to know what happens next!
