I have not written a review on IMDb for a long time, but I felt compelled to write this! While watching this movie, I found a specific review that urged people NOT to watch this movie. Do not pay attention to this ignorant person! NOTHING is a fantastic movie, full of laughter and above all ... fantasy! Are not you sick and tired of force-feeding the same old cycle of gum garbage films? Sometimes a movie like NOTHING comes along and gives you something you've never seen before. I do not care if you dislike (even hate) the movie, but nobody has the right to discredit the movie. IMDb has a huge impact on the reputation and no negative rating should discredit the movie. Just say, you hate it and why you hate it ... but do not try to tell people to not see it. We have our own mind and will be grateful for it. <br /> <br /> If I feel a good judgment, I would say that more people will enjoy this movie than those who hate it. <br /> <br /> Spoil your mind with a little eye candy! See nothing!
