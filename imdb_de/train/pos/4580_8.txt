Princess Tam Tam is without racism, as we think in the United States of racism, but there is (for the American viewer) more subtle statements about ethnic identity during that time. Look for Alwina's (Baker) placement within shots as approached by the other characters, the attitudes she portrays as a "wild" African woman, and wonder if Alwina has anything from agencies throughout the movie , I do not want to ruin anything, but in the end, care must be taken to ensure that the dichotomy between "Eastern" and "Western" culture is the least insulting, and such diction is thankfully rejected today. The French have an eventful past as imperial power in the areas depicted (see Chris Markers Les Statues Meurent Aussi-1953), paying attention to the places European travelers visit while in Africa, and what about their attitude reflects in the direction of the "other". I'm giving this movie a 7 because I'm averse to Baker. Much of what she has done in her professional career, like Princes Tam Tam, which is regressive, is certainly overshadowed by her efforts at integration, her work as a crazy spy Sultry, sorry.) However, the film fascinates me for its performance, aside that he is a remnant of past mentalities.
