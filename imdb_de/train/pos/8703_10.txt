I went into this movie after reading that it was a drama about a man with a supernatural gift turned into a monster by society. Suffice to say that I expected something different than myself. But it was a happy surprise. My friend and I both thought the movie was very romantic (the fact that the male lead is not bad has certainly helped), and there was plenty of plot, action and even humor (the fact that it was not until the 3. Part of the film, which now had the name of each other, had the whole movie theater laughing) to entertain and invest in the story. In short: not what I expected, but a very good surprise. I will definitely buy this movie if it appears on DVD.
