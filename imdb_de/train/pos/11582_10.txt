For someone who remembers Jane in the Daily Mirror Trick cartoon, watching this movie is an exercise in nostalgia. In this context, it's wonderful, but younger audiences would undoubtedly limp the comedy and miss the point that the actors are cartoon characters. The plot is also a bit limp for today's audience, but reflects the naivety of the 40s and 50s very well. You should remember, Jane was part of the fleeting fantasy of the war years that was created to strengthen the morale of the troops. She gave a double meaning to the "strip" in the strip cartoon. The story has something in common with the stories of Edgar Rice Burroughs and Rider Haggard. The subject would have been a familiar subject to readers at the time, a bunch of limping Nazis thwarted by some equally limping Englishmen and of course playing in the African jungle. For the rest of you a wet Squib. <br /> <br />
