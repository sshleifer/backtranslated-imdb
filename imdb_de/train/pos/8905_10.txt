Old horror films are interesting, many screams, many screams and a lot of humor. "The Blob" is a classic in his own work. Steve McQueen (1930-80) plays a teenager trying to be a hero in his city. Going out with your girl is typical for all teenagers. When the old man discovers the same falling object from the sky, he is the victim and Steve helps him as best he can. When it comes to teen power, this movie really does. I know that most adolescents have their needs when they behave, and when danger comes they must learn to forget the past and do something good to save humanity. As adults in the city learn the hard way "The Blob" runs amok, they have to learn to trust the teenagers and not allow their behavior to overcome them. The dripping juggernaut was pretty cute that day, and in my opinion it was JELL-O! If everyone gets involved to stop the threat, thanks to the good old cooperation, the city is safe again. I still eat Jello and keep watching this movie if you do not like Jello, TOUGH! RATING 5 STARS
