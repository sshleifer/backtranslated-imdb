Ah, Domino is actually a breath of fresh air, something new for the cinema world. I really enjoyed the movie because of the complicated storyline, the varied characters and the intense camera effects. I've seen some complaints about the camerawork, and indeed, in the view of the creators, the eye-catching and wild shots were the culmination of the mistakes made through time. All you saw was the desired effect. Maybe some complain because this has never been done before, even though that's what sets it apart. In a deeper aspect, you can see how Domino sees things through their eyes, think about them. <br /> <br /> When it comes to history, I do not see anything bad about it. Despite some "untidy" nature, some say it's just a quick form of storytelling. The plot is really not that hard to track if you really focus on what's going on. Maybe it's just me because I see films from many different aspects such as acting, action, etc. I'm not an "interpreter" or anything that takes movies apart, it just comes to me. I think this is a really excellent movie, even though it's a cult classic, blockbuster or whatever lies in the future. <br /> <br /> And the characters, there's no doubt how different the cast is. I am convinced that the cast is outstanding as they all do a good job of effectively portraying their characters. That makes a movie to ladies and gentlemen. The characters are all very unique and a plus is that you can experience a little bit of their life and put them further apart. Basically I loved the actors and characters. <br /> <br /> Anyone who hits and burns this movie might not see it like me, or just do not like it. Anyway, this is a great movie in itself, no, it's a great movie season.
