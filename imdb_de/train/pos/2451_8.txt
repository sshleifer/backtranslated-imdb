George Lopez is a funny man even without a sitcom. The first episodes I saw too often made jokes at the expense of his mother. When I saw this more, there was more and more variety. Nobody in the cast is really sure of his mind now. <br /> <br /> It seems to me, as this season progresses, that George always feels more comfortable with the role of the Sitcom Dad family. At first he was not, but he puts More & More in a groove. This makes both him and the shows funnier. They had added a few characters that George should play again this year. The father of his wife is involved more and more in the plot. <br /> <br /> His mother is still there, but not as central as in previous seasons. I think it's wise to say that George Lopez has a good feeling with George Comic's timing & ABC good sitcoms, a good chance to be here with ABC long after George W. Bush.
