I think this movie is absolutely beautiful. And I'm not just referring to the breathtaking landscape. It's about two unfortunate English housewives who decide to rent an Italian castle to take a break from their not so happy home. In the end, a total of four women rent the place together, all with different personalities and different reasons to be there. In this magical place they all find the peace they long for, and it is interesting that peace comes from inner reflections and decisions, more than from the outside. I also find it wonderful because of the relationships that are developed out of kindness and understanding. Acting is a pleasure to behold. I especially love the characters of Lottie (Josie Lawrence) and Lady Caroline (Polly Walker).
