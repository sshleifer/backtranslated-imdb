This is a CGI animated movie based on a French 2D animation series. The series briefly ran on Cartoon Network, but the run was so brief that the inclusion as one of the potential Oscar nominees for the best animated film for this year's most people I know, to "Huh?" This is the story of Lian-chu, the benevolent heart muscle, and Gwizdo, the brain of the operation, who, along with Hector, her fire-breathing dragon, is more like a dog. Travel the world and offer your services as a dragon hunter without being paid. In her life comes Zoe, the fairy-tale-loving niece of a king who becomes blind. It seems like the world is devoured by a giant monster, and all the knights the king has sent have never returned, or when they return, they come back as ashes. In desperation, the king hires the dragon hunters to stop the world eater. Zoe, of course, points along ... <br /> <br /> What else can I say, why is this movie hiding under a rock? This is a really good little movie that deviates completely from radar except as an unlikely Oscar candidate. It's a beautifully crafted, awesome-looking movie (the world it's in has floating lands and crazy creatures) that kept me running "Wow." The English Voice with Forrest Whitaker as Lian-Chu (one of the best vocal performances I've ever heard) and Rob Paulson as Gwizdo (think Steve Bucsemi) is first-rate. Equally great is the script, which does not talk to its audience and uses some real expressions that are not normally heard in animated films (not Disney or Pixar). It's all done really well. <br /> <br /> Is it perfect? No, some of the bits are too long, but at the same time it's damn entertaining. <br /> <br /> If you have the chance to see this. It is one of the better animated films of 2008 and is on my nice surprise list for 2009.
