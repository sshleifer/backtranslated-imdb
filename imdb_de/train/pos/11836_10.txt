This animated movie is a masterpiece! The narrative, music, animation and plot were all remarkable. My girlfriend and I have seen it a second time and we got more insight. We invited some friends to see Spirit with us and they really enjoyed it. When I asked them if they wanted to come, they thought it was a movie about horses, but later they realized it was more. I liked Esperanza, Spirit, Rain, and Lil 'Creek, which reminds me of Nathan Chasing Horse, who smiles a lot in dances with wolves. Spirit has deep symbolic meanings and metaphors that I find empowering and inspiring. <br /> <br /> I saw Spirit for the third time and would like to see him again. I really enjoyed "Spirit" because its depiction of Indians is realistic, dignified and not stereotypical, in contrast to the movie "The Road to El Dorado", which was a total farce because it portrayed Indians in a disrespectful and stereotypical way. But Dreamworks has redeemed itself by turning Spirit into a great movie that I thought was acceptable! I hope they continue to do more animated films like Spirit, and I would like to see continuations or spin-offs of Spirit if done respectfully and without stereotyping the Indians. <br /> <br /> I recommend it to others who have an openness to go and pay to see Spirit: Stallion of Cimarron.
