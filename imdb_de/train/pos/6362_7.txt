Granted, I had seen some "Speed ​​Racer", but I never really saw it, and I've seen other shows in which these characters were dressed as birds making a ship called Phoenix and another that was around a spaceship that looked like a huge ocean turned ship and it sometimes flew back for some reason and was really dark and hard to understand for someone who was maybe five years old. Although I have seen almost every episode and the amazing thing about this time was that this show had a certain resolution. It ended, in fact, unlike almost all American animated films where nothing really concludes, like the last episode of the first Transformers generation that ended up with Galvatron, and the new villain swore, the Autobots, Dungeons and never reach Dragons with the kids. Coming home with GI Joe and Cobra, who are still there to try again, and so on and so forth. This ended up with a pretty cool robot that got new weapons during the show. At first it was a bit boring, because he could not fly and had only a few really cool weapons. When it went on, he got a cool shooting fist like the Android 16, which was used in Dragonball Z against Cell. This weapon then developed into razors that were shot out. Then the big robot even got wings to fly, and more weapons were built into the wings. He would also get some allies in a female robot and a pretty funny one called Bobo in America. The bad guys did not just consist of Hell, but from a really strange person who was half a man and a flying-head type. Interesting show and it was kind of nice to see a conclusion.
