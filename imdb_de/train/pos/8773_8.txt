Errol Flynn is "Gentleman Jim" in this 1942 film about boxer Jim Corbett, known as the man who beat John L. Sullivan. The film was staged with a light hand by Flynn's good friend Raoul Walsh. Alexis Smith, Jack Carson, Alan Hale Senior, William Frawley and Ward Bond. Flynn plays an ambitious, selfish young man who has a natural boxing talent and is sponsored at the end of the 19th century by the exclusive Olympic Club in San Francisco. Although he is good-natured, the fact that he is a "shanty-Irishman" and a social climber is annoying among the members of the Olympic club. Most of them can not wait to lose a fight, and they're against him. Nevertheless, he became famous and even worked as an actor. Finally, he gets the chance he's been waiting for, a match with world champion John L. Sullivan (Ward Bond). Sullivan is requesting a $ 10,000 bail to ensure that Corbett appears to be fighting for the $ 25,000 exchange. Corbett and his manager (Frawley) are desperate to get the money. The help, however, comes in the form of a very unlikely individual. <br /> <br /> This is a very entertaining movie, and Jim Corbett is a great role for Flynn, himself a professional fighter. He has the necessary charm, good looks and sportiness for the role. Alexis Smith plays Victoria Ware, his romantic interest in insisting she hates him. In real life it does not seem to have existed; Corbett was married to Olive Lake Morris from 1886 to 1895. <br /> <br /> The focus of the film is on Corbett and his career and not on the history of boxing. Corbett used scientific techniques and innovations and is considered the man who has turned the price war into an art form. In the film, Corbett is fleet of foot and avoids being hit by his opponents; It is believed that he shut down John L. Sullivan this way. <br /> <br /> A good movie to catch Flynn at the height of his too short a superstar.
