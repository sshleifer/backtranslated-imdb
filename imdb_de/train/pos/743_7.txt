This work impresses with its accurate portrayal of teenage life at the time of its execution. Although this is a generalized generalization, the parents of that time were too selfish to be real parents, and those who were at home tended to be too distracted from the real problems affecting their children. <br /> <br /> This film shows us how to let go, even though it's painful, with a sweet, melancholic, but informed style in which Foster speaks philosophically about the feeling of the pain of life. I loved this scene. It was actually my favorite scene in the movie. <br /> <br /> The transition from funeral to marriage should show that life goes on and we have to. Baios skateboarding through a pack of thugs and overrunning them should show us that the troubled times will pass and we should get through them at better times. The whole metaphor of "going on" and the procession of life is present throughout the movie and gives us hope in the end. <br /> <br /> I like this movie, although I do not often watch it, as it tends to Make me melancholy. <br /> <br /> It should not be seen by young children, and probably only those who grew up in the 70s and 80s would like to do so from ... <br /> <br /> the Fiend.
