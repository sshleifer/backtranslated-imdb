I was fortunate to be an extra in this great movie and loved every minute of filming. Was in London for the premiere and had a great chat with Phil, Peter, Martin and Jon and my wife. Fantastic after-party. A few weeks later we had a visit to the cinema with members of our bike club. What a brilliant movie, it deserves to be there with all the great biker movies. Now we have the DVD. Sue my wife can not get enough of it, not even the kids. Get some stick from the club that seems like I'm a movie star now, well, you can only dream. I think they are just jealous. The only downside of the first part of the shoot was the weather, rain, rain and more rain, but we were in Wales. I hope there is a follow-up, so keep me updated, Jon.
