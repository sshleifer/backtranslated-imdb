This movie is great. Type of. It really says a lot or a lot, but it's a great movie to watch because it's so stupid. The high school is taken over by evil ms.togar, who hates the one thing that all students love, Rock & Roll. Riff Randle gets all the tickets for the Ramones Show, and this film reaches my riff Randle and the Ramones with the acquisition of the school. This movie has everything, a bad script, questionable director, bad actors (like Clint Howards & PJ soles), a fantastic soundtrack, extreme fighting. > <br /> Note - During live Ramones, keep in mind that the germ of the germs is in front of the crowd. neat-o.
