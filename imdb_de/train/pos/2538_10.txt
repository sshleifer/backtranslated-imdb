There are so many good things to say about this "B" movie. <br /> <br /> "B" may be in connections, but not in commission. This is about the best of his genre I've ever seen. A Grade A trial by Universal. The script is well done, resourceful and without errors. Authors: Howard Higgin Original History & Douglas Hodge's Story, John Colton (Screenplay). Director Lambert Hillyer mastered the complex story and story locations very well. No yielding to the burdens of extras and places. I loved Beulah Bondy (Jimmy Stewart's mother in "It's A Wonderful Life.") The female lead, Frances Drake, is a beauty and has handled her role with grace and pathos for her Karloff husband, and Lugosi was rightly undervalued That's the best Partly I remember seeing him, as I said, there were so many good things: the African discovery of radium "X", the melting of stone statues ((somewhat reminiscent of the ten small Indians) in and then there was no (Agatha) Christie) (the Barry Fitzgerald version)), the glow of Karlof in the dark, Karloff's mother, played by Violet Kemble Cooper, with elegance and because of all these virtues I believed in science, she portrayed a fine piece of art.
