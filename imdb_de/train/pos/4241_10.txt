I loved this movie !!! The characters were people you could feel for. The young man from the service who was still in love with the girl he had left behind. Tom Drake is always perfect in the romantic lead role and Donna Reed as the love of his life. The looks he gives her, as if he starved to see her, as well as her hesitation and confusion, as well as her feelings for him were played very well. The rest of the quirky characters in the store were perfect as they tried to bring them together. The most touching scene, however, was the young couple in his great-grandfather's house. I laughed in part, cried in some, and enjoyed watching this movie. In fact, I have seen it about five times. An absolute must for absolute romantics.
