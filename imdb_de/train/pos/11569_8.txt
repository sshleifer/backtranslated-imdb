Bob Clampett's "An Itch in Time" milks seven minutes of crazy action from a very small premise. Elmer Fudd tells his dog that if he's scratching again, he'll get a dreaded bath. Unfortunately for the dog, a relentless flea makes it almost impossible to stop the scratching. The cartoon alternates between the flea's progress in the dog's coat and the dog's desperate attempts to handle it. In a great sequence that really captures the frustration of a scratch that can not be scratched, the dog changes color from brown over blue to red and switches to polka-dot to check. It sounds ridiculously surreal, but it's a perfect reminder of the indescribable feeling of itching that only Clampett could. There are a few other elements that make 'An Itch in Time' pure Clampett. There is the grotesque concept itself that leads to some flea graphic scenes located on the dog's flesh. There is the unrestrained violence that raises its head in every scene the cat is in. There are mostly the dirty jokes, including a huge shot of the dog whistling the flea, and a hysterical sequence in which the dog tries to scratch itself by pulling its back across the floor. He breaks off briefly and addresses the audience: "Hey, I'll cut it out better, I might like it!" With a very limited concept, Clampett succeeds in making "An Itch in Time" a unique, minutia-based cartoon. Like an early episode of 'Seinfeld', 'An Itch in Time' is practically nothing but funny.
