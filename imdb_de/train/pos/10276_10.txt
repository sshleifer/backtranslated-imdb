The opening of the film with a Bach toccata is an acoustic indication of what should unfold in this intense drama. All of the compositional instruments that Bach perfected to make his listener (and the performer) fascinated and entertained apply to this film. There is no reciprocal tenderness between the two protagonists and the lead actress in the closing scene, who in my view is entitled to be raped even though her victim was certain that he was a cad. Mamet is keenly exploring the emotional gap and gender differences, but I believe he is unaware of how they actually complement each other in the face of a healthy sense of humor. If Mamet had ever developed a healthy, humorous interpretation of gender interaction, I wonder how this work would have ended. Since it exists, it is very dark and mean.
