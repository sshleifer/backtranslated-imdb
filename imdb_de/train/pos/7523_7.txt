I saw this movie at the 2006 Palm Springs International Film Festival, and it's a movie, not a movie, as it's obviously being filmed by HBO and being shown on the cable network sometime this year. This film features Page as bondage and discipline fetish pinup and B & D Stag movie actress, who had enough talent to become a real actress. Page was a little more than that and the movie touches on some of her other modeling roles, but not enough to make up for the 50-year pinup icon's career. This film is supposedly based on the book "The Real Bettie Page" by Richard Foster. For the nostalgia of the 50s, it is recorded in black and white. I have the book "Bettie Page - The Life of a Pinup Legend", which contains many great photos on the career of Page, and I have to say that this movie is released on film, with Gretchen Mol as Page, many of these famous photos exactly. Molly herself with the black wig Bettie Page and brown contact lenses is Bettie Page. She not only has the look of the Bettie Page, but also the smile and features of her personality that have come through the perfect camera. And her body is as close as possible to a replica of Page. Great casting. The story is thin and tabloidesque and could have been much better. But that's a pretty good TV movie. I would rate it on a scale of 10 to 7.0 and recommend watching it when it appears on TV.
