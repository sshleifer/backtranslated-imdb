Part of the acting was suspicious. I remember that walker Alexander Walker (Evening Standard critic, yes, he is dead now) was vocal about this film, it was a shame to portray NI Protestants as murderers. Relative to all NI Protestants, this film was loosely based on the Shankill Butchers (who were loyalists) who traveled in Belfast in the 1970s. Believe me, they were not called butchers for nothing. My biggest moan about this movie is that there's no ray of light or hope, it's all destiny and darkness, I mean, the little girl had to die in the end. Maybe that sounds trite, but it would have taken the time that not all prods & tiags are bad or just fine.
