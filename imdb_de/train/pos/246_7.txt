How could I miss the chance to see Orlando Bloom and Heath Ledger together? Well, I could not and so I rented this mess of a movie. <br /> <br /> I had never heard of Ned Kelly and was surprised at what I found out about the legend of this young man. I was also surprised at how mediocre this movie was. Maybe the fact that it was very, very late, and at the end of a 4-hour movie marathon, or maybe because it's really a bit slow, made this story hard to track. Not because the story is complicated, but because it is slow. Despite a slow history, Ledger and Bloom managed to create interesting, dimensional characters. <br /> <br /> Although I'm convinced with a flounder to recommend this as a must, it's a great story of Australian history (considering how young the country is, this is very rare and should be appreciated ) and the movie has some good action sequences. <br /> <br /> 6/10 see it for historical reasons ... (Yeah, right ... and that's the only reason to see it ...;))
