Red Eye, a movie I've been wanting to see for a long time ... Cillian Murphy poses with Jack Ripper (Jack the Ripper) as a pose for assassins and his killer plan to disable a high profile man and his family. <Br /> <br /> An everyday woman "Lisa" (I think) is a normal woman, goes to work, home ... worries ... hates to fly. <br /> <br /> The death of her grandmother sends her on a flight that is delayed several times. <br /> <br /> a flight where she meets Jack ... a normal, apparent guy, until he reveals his job and his plans, which they happen to include in her, she is the key to the death of the Keefes ( sp?). <br /> <br /> She managed to save her ... but almost the cost of her life is taken, Jack is beaten ... the Keefs are saved ... Oh, what a story * laughs * Just a joke, the movie is really good, the best of last year ... There are little things that you have to watch out for in the movie that will later have a GREAT meaning to the movie. .. (the Frankenstein pencil) I did it several times before getting all those little jokes and quirks ... <br /> <br /> A must-have for fans of thrillers No sexual, but there's a little hint ( the bathroom scene) (Jack) "Thanks for the quicky" and the (female companion) "Ohhh ... it will be ONE of these flights" (second female companion) "Hey, this is not a motel" You get the idea ... "
