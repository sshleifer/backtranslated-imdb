Certain DVDs own me until I just have to go out and buy it. This was one of those movies. Like many here, I remember that I saw it as a child and loved it. I never knew there were scenes and music numbers that were cut, so I was curious to see what they could be. I agree that the sequence "Portabellow Road" is now a bit long (like the football game), but apart from that, I did not find any concerns about the remaining scenes, which were put back in their respectful place. Maybe Disney should have had the original version (which is the restored version) on one side with the restored version on the other side, then people could choose what they wanted to see. All in all, it's still an entertaining movie that still regains some of my childhood memories.
