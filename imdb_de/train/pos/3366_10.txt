Ettore Scola, one of the most ingenious and great directors we world citizens have, is not yet available on DVD ...

Band ... it's a true gift. <br /> <br /> To avoid a criticism, but still try to prove a point: I took my reluctant younger brother to see this movie. He has never seen the movie before and "does not like those Italian oldies ..." Like everyone else in the theater, he was fascinated by this miracle. Even during the final titles, the theater remained completely silent. <br /> <br /> This SPECIAL DAY is really special. A miracle of refinement. And a big loss, if you have not (yet) seen it ...
