The film is fun from the beginning, Eddie seems to bring this uniqueness on stage and makes the most fundamental of an ice cream as a child to the long-standing tradition of the family. The film is very rare in this country, but uncertain whether it is available in other countries. I've searched many websites and it's still not luck. He called companies looking for rare videos, and there are waiting lists for the year. So the tips are very welcome. If someone likes Eddie Murphy as a comedian and sees that the video gets it, it's worth the money and can not go too much wrong.
