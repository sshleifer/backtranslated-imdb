"The Invisible Mouse" is a delightful and different comic from Tom & Jerry. It offers the usual cat / mouse chases and fights, but this time in a different way. Jerry accidentally falls into a bottle of invisible ink and is obviously very pleased with it because he realizes that he can make many "surprises" for Tom, scare him, torture and confuse him. <br /> <br /> As much as it's funny, it's also very cool and funny to see what we can not see: Jerry invisible. It's amusing to see things up in the air without seeing who does it (we know who, right?) - it's as if these things had a life of their own or were almost like ghosting. It's just as amusing to see Jerry eat some sweets and fruits while he's invisible. I like this instrumental music that plays when it is not visible. <br /> <br /> Some of the best jokes in this short series are when Tom sees Jerry's shadow and hits him, and even when Tom tries to beat him with a pan and Jerry writes "miss me". I also like it when Jerry drinks Tom's chocolate milk and becomes visible again and with a happy expression on his face. <br /> <br /> Overall, this short film has the basic ingredients for a classic cartoon: humor, entertainment, fun, and some fun pieces of art too.
