I will not go into the plot of this movie too much, as other reviewers have the same field. <br /> <br /> I just wanted to say that I really enjoyed the movie. The performance of Peter Falk alone is reason enough to watch the movie. <br /> <br /> A small road-road movie starring Falk & Paul Reiser in the state of New York in the fall sets the scene for most of the action in the movie. <br /> <br /> Well written for one adult target group. A lot of reality-based humor and a well-played drama make the film feel like it could be your own family. <br /> <br /> Actually, I can not say enough about this movie, unless it's a damn shame that a nice movie so you do not get more prominence while other garbage types are out there. <br /> <br /> It's great to see Falk back in the lead and make the most of it. It proves that his famous friend and writer / director John Casavettes was right in many of his landmark films of the '60s and' 70s with Falk Casting.
