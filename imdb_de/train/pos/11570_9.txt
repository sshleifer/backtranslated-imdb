Elmer Fudd laughs as he sits in his chair reading his comic. His dog sleeps comfortably in front of the fireplace. Everything is peaceful until a flea passes by. (The flea is wearing a peasant dress with a big sombrero and is carrying a bag called "A. Flea".) He takes out his telescope and discovers the dog. (We see a big shot of the dog's butt and the flea whistles with excitement and yells "T-Bone!") This builds up the story of this cute but disgusting flea that torments the poor dog he reacts to the flea. <br /> <br /> The drawings of his huge teeth chewing right next to the fleeing flea are clever, and the dog's dialogue made me laugh a few times. This could be the funniest dog The poor guy who threatens to take a bath does NOT respond when the stupid flea causes him pain, it's almost painful to watch how the flea picks, jackhammers, and the like for the Dog used, he puts firecrackers behind the dog, it's brutal!
