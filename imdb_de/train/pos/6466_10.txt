I really loved this movie, and also the audience with whom I saw it in Los Angeles. After the film, many people were crying and saying how much the movie influenced them. I can see why it was such a great success in his native Sweden. The film is masterfully staged and each character is brilliantly drawn so that in the end you really know and take care of these people. The music is very natural and the main song of the movie is heartbreaking but inspiring. Would definitely recommend this movie to anyone - even for people who usually do not go to subtitles. In any case, the Oscar nomination deserves due to the profound themes of the film, which are reflected without claim in a small town community with everyday people. It is a film that unites us in this divided world and shows us the potential of the human mind. SOMETHING YOU HAVE TO SEEN!
