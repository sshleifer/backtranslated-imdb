I was looking forward to seeing this since I first saw it in their work. I finally found it yesterday on February 13, 2002 in the Lifetime Movie Channel. <br /> <br /> Jim Larson's comments that it was a "sweet, funny tale of two people crossing paths" were dead. Authors probably should not get any bonuses, any other SROs that made the movie. <br /> <br /> Anyone who appreciates a romantic movie SHOULD SEE IT. <br /> <br /> Natascha's screen presence is so warm and warm Her smile is so electrifying, not to mention her beauty, that everything she carries is on my favorite list. Your TV and print interviews that I've seen are equally refreshing and worth looking for. <br /> <br /> God bless her, her family and her future endeavors. <br /> <br /> This movie does not seem to be available on DVD or video yet, but I would be the first to buy it and I think others would too.
