The magnetism radiated by Elvira, which draws its legions of devoted admirers, has an originality. With her long, well-trained figure, her big bust, her innocent mischievous attitude, and her bag-encyclopedia from the Generation Generation valley slang, Elvira's character has a universal and timeless appeal. As a rising folklorist and a person deeply interested in the structure of storytelling, it is obvious that the Elvira persona has certain archetypal elements that contribute to the character being more than the sum of her stupid monliners and big breasts. Based on the way the children of the city react to her, she represents the deep youthful imagination of an experienced woman who can connect with her on her level: a strange mixture of one-dimensional romantic longing, boyish sexual desire and that Desire for non threatening carefree fun. It symbolizes a perfect female ideal and a source of power for the girls of the city. The other adults have problems with her for the same reasons. In the end, however, her film can not move through its battling ingredients. The end result is that while Elvira is endlessly interesting, her film is limited to how weak a showcase is for his talents. Almost everything is tailored to a youthful mindset, and although it is an uncomplicated comedy, only those who can handle information with the mind of a young person can enjoy the nonsense. Fortunately, I have such a skill and found that the movie is a delightful charmer. <br /> <br /> Best quote: Bob Redding: How's your head? Elvira: I had no complaints.
