I've been looking for this movie for a long time and how awesome it would be to find it on DVD ... I saw this movie when I was about 6 years old the Netherlands. And I was very impressed. It was shown before Walt Disney's JUNGLE BOOK! <br /> <br /> What I remember about this movie is fragmented. I remember that an Indian boy was friends with an eagle. That impressed me very much. For some reason, he was kicked out of his village (he did not understand why). When other boys threw stones at him, he climbed a rock and jumped off. At that time he transformed himself into an eagle and flew away with his eagle friend. As an eagle, he still wore his turquoise necklace. <br /> <br /> CB
