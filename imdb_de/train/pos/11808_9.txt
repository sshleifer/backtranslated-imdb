In the late 1980s, Warren Beatty created in the literary epic Reds on the founding of the Soviet Union, as seen through the eyes of the radical iconoclasm John Reed. It was a profound movie that was both entertaining and with a message presented by an All Star Cast. At the end of the decade, Warren Beatty created a different kind of epic in Dick Tracy that did not seem to be anything other than entertainment with a whole bunch of the best actors who had only a big, old time under tons of make-up. <br /> That both Reds and Dick Tracy could have come from the same person speaks volumes about the man's reach as a player. In this film, Beatty has managed to get all the famous cartoon characters out of the filmstrip and put them together in an original script. <br /> <br /> The city's top gangster, Big Boy Caprice, is taking the step of really eliminating the competition. The film begins by rubbing out Lips Manlis' henchman in a Valentine Massacre-style shoot, then adjusting Lips himself for a cement coat. But Capric's moves make him a target for Tracy. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, a third, mysterious and faceless man tries to overthrow Caprice himself. Will our hero fix this thicket of crime? <br /> <br /> The fun of this movie is really contagious. When people like Al Pacino, Dustin Hoffman, Paul Sorvino, William Forsythe, RG Armstrong make an outrageous make-up to look like the comic book creations of strip artist Chester Gould, and then indulge in an exercise to carve the biggest piece Ham. You have to love this movie. <br /> <br /> Al Pacino has received a nomination for Best Supporting Actor but each of these guys could have it. Pacino as Big Boy Caprice has most of the time on screen. Only Beatty plays it completely straight, the others seem to play from him. Dick Tracy won Oscars for Best Art & Set Design, Best Song written by Stephen Sondheim and introduced by Madonna, Sooner Or Later. The fact that he was able to get someone like Sondheim to write a score for this film just shows that Sondheim wanted to get involved in the fun. As for Madonna, the Material Girl asserts herself with all these theatrical heavyweights as the club-torch singer Breathless Mahoney. <br /> <br /> Prior to this movie, Dick Tracy's films were included in the B-pictures and worse than the Saturday afternoon series. The only thing that rivals this all-star extravaganza is a radio broadcast sent to Armed Forces Radio during the Second World War. Can you believe a cast like Bing Crosby, Bob Hope, Frank Sinatra, Dinah Shore, Jimmy Durante, Judy Garland, Frank Morgan and the Andrews Sisters? Try and find a picture of this gemstone. <br /> <br /> Until then, the classic comic strip by Warren Beatty is suitable for the big screen.
