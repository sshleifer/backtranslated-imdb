This film seems to me to be one of the most successful attempts ever to give plausible answers to some of the nagging questions that have emerged in the New Testament in recent scholars concerning the reports on "Passion" (Suffering and Death of Christ). (What motivated Judas when it was not about money, what could make the Sanhedrin meet on a high holy day, why Pilate was gunned?) It is a film for the seriously thinking Christian: Fans of "The Passion of Christ" will undoubtedly be disappointed its from the bloody spectacle and the characteristic of the bow. I myself find the portrait painted here - of the willingness of ordinary people, carefree to sacrifice decency when it comes to their own interests - much more realistic and deeply disturbing. (The disinterested, "just doing my job" expression on the face of the man pushing the first nail in Christ's wrist is just as daunting as any moment in the movie.) The film does not claim "authenticity," but rather attitudes and Costumes always feel "right" than many highly praised efforts. It's a slow movie, but if you accept your self-imposed limits (after all, it's death - not life - "Christ"), it's ultimately a very rewarding one.
