If you have any idea of ​​Jane Austen's production, you will now repeat the same in each of her novels: marriage, marriage, and marriage! In my opinion, all the films in her novels are a bit boring, but I like Austen's characters because they all have a certain personality and typical sayings that they like to repeat, even in Emma. What makes Emma good is Gwyneth Paltrow, she is very good in her lead role. Also, the fact that every one of the characters in the movie can not seem to think otherwise than finding a good partner and getting married soon makes the movie hilarious.
