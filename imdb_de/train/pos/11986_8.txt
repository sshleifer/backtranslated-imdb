One evening I saw Easy Talk and thought it was ok, but I missed something. Perhaps Buster Keaton strangely cast me off, or the laborious delivery of a leading lady. However, the next day I kept thinking about the movie. I could not get Durante's song out of my head, I kept trying to better remember Thelma Todd's first scene, and thought that maybe Keaton was making some funny falls and physical comedy. The next night I saw a scene with Thelma Todd as a playful chorus girl who wanted to impress Buster and Jimmy with her sex appeal. A very funny scene, the actors outstanding, their faces, their eyes, their stupid facial expressions. So I saw another scene whose show opens on Broadway. Buster in his blissful innocence mocks every action. Again, I laughed aloud, appreciating Keaton's clowning and tumbling. The next evening I saw the whole movie again and this time I see it for the first time: It's Stupendous! It is sensational! It is great! Three great comedians! Todd is dancing! Durante is singing! Keaton speaks! Sure, it's not Poifect ... but there's a lot of laughter in this picture.
