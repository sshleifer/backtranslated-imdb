It's been almost 5 years since the release of this stylish action movie. I have watched this movie almost 10 times and it has been a great effort by Gautham. From my perspective, I find that this movie is virtually flawless. Surya as ACP Anbuchelvan-no doubt ... open.Jyothika played her role as Maya very well. The figure fits her very well. The figure that caught the attention of moviegoers was Pandia.Jeevan played the role of Pandia very well.Brutal and frightening .Jeevan rightly received the Best Villain Award at ITFA 2004. The side cast of Daniel Balaji, Devadharshini and others performed well. <br /> <br /> Racy script, perfectly matched dialogues and brilliant narration by Gautham. The soundtrack of Harris Jeyaraj are all charts, while the BGM suits the movie very well. The cinematography of RD Rajasekhar is rich. Peter Hein choreographed the stunts well. Antonius editing is precise. Above all, Kaakha Kaakha is a perfect cop movie filled with real cans of action and romance. <br /> <br /> Even some Hollywood movies can not compete with Kaakha Kaakha ... undoubtedly.
