Watched this movie on the IFF in Rotterdam. You may question some of the creator's choices - such as choosing a mockumentary form for such a sensitive and terrible subject - but this movie will definitely hit you in the gut. Especially the last scenes were almost painful to look at. Hope it gets the distribution it deserves.
