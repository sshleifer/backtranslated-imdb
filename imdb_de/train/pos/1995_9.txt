I have just seen this after almost forty years. That lasts well, especially the excellent songs of Lionel Bart. ("Who Will Buy" with its magical counterpoint, just one of many outstanding ones.) <br /> <br /> I do not agree with the other post who condemned his G-rating. The brand new rating system at the time did not mean that rating G (general) meant "completely conflict-free". <br /> <br /> Characterization as inappropriate for children reminds me of the description I've seen The Wizard of Oz: A girl arrives in a foreign land and kills the first person she encounters. She then makes a road trip with three male companions and kills again.
