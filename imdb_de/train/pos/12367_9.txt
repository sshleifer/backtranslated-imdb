Well, after much anticipation, having seen some clips on Bravo's The 100 Scariest Movie Moments, I had long expected to see this movie. The plot was simple, beautiful model Alison Parker (Cristina Raines) moves into an apartment building that is a gateway to hell. The Sentinel is a scary movie, even if it's a bit slow. It's a mix of The Omen and Rosemary's Baby. Acting is alright and there are some really disturbing pieces like the awkward orgy scene with the dead father and the dumpy woman in the middle of the orgy eating and laughing cakes. It's a very strange, martial fight, but in the end I really think a great movie! One of my favorites from the 70s, even if it's nothing special. It is crazy and extremely scary! Probably one of my favorites ever. 9.10
