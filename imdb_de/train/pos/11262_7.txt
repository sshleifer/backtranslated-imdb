THE DEVIL'S PLAYTHING is my second attempt on a Joseph Sarno production - and although I want to say that it's far more enjoyable than the achy and unexpressed Swedish WILDCATS, it's still a little slow and not explicit for my taste. <br /> <br /> The focus is on a group of vampire girls who live in a castle and want to revive their previously murdered "leader". To do this, the girls have to dance around naked, kiss and sing funny stuff - and of course drink some blood. If a doctor and her brother's car break down and have to stop them in the lock to find shelter, they are the ideal blood bank for the horny vampires ... but they may not be as helpless as they seem .. <br /> <br /> THE DEVIL'S PLAYTHING is a pretty good example of the exploit weakness of the early '70s. Plenty of nudity - including some frontal, sometimes lanky undertones - including incest and of course Lesbo-Bloodsucking ... but these scenes are still pretty tame by today's standards. Some pretty hot women in this case would have benefited from some more explicit sex, but I guess you can not have it all. I would also have benefited from heavier violence because it's a vampire movie, but I think the purpose of THE DEVIL'S PLAYTHING was more about depicting skin than blood. Still a bit slow - and the drama is for the most part absolutely made of wood - but that's something to expect from this time and budget. Worth a look to exploit fans - others may find it boring for their taste. 10.7
