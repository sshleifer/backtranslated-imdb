A nice Martino outing, this is a spirited and entertaining giallo with good performances by good looking performers and especially the two main actors George Hilton and Anita Strindberg so confused and confusing just sit back and try not to guess. Just when everything seems to have been solved, we will once again focus on a series of twists and turns. <br /> <br /> Sexy with a lot of bloody killings kills this movie with London, Athens and Greek coastal towns. A super finale on Aegean rocks brings things together and it was a lot of fun for everyone.
