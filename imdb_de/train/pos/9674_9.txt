I did not give this movie a perfect score, to be honest, compared to great classics like Citizen Kane and Seven Samaurai. However, this movie is so wonderful that it is a pity, as it does so poorly for the general IMDb voter. The IMDb voter, however, leans against the Geeky, and "Paulie" is not qualified for it. <br /> <br /> The only criticism I could suggest is that Hallie Kate Eisenberg is not the perfect stuttering child. I'm sorry, but asking a 6-year-old kid to outdo Dustin Hoffman as Rainman demands the impossible in filming. <br /> <br /> Passing this little complaint, the movie has The Best of Many Movies: Buddy Road Trip, Con Games, Hero as a Friendly Party Animal (Party Bird?), Disney-Like Humor for Young and Old, and More. What is not to like? Tony Shaloub wears his role like a comfortable pair of jeans. That seems to be normal for him. ("I'm Russian ... I like long stories.) I do not like mangoes, but it almost makes me want to buy one, look at the movie and that makes sense." Buddy Hackett and Cheech Marin are very fitting in the film: roles that go well with what we all know about them.I always thought Jay Mohr was a bit slimy, and his role on screen also fits in. The only surprise for me was, When I found out that Jay was also Paulie's voice, in the end, that works fine, so when Parrot and Anti-Parrot are put together as a team, they create their own magic. <br /> <br /> If you're trying to make a movie for Finding her and the kids who are neither offensive nor boring is "Paulie" a perfect candidate, but I admit that a happy moment is coloring my review of "Paulie" I was on a road trip during a big heatwave the car fell silent, the HÃ¤l The restaurant was completely chilled (as was our hotel) and I said: "Let's have a look at a movie where air conditioners work itioning. "So we did, so we were chilled, amused, and had a heartwarming experience for 100 minutes - when I recently saw it on VCR in less emotional circumstances, I realized how well this movie was made. <br /> <br /> It's a sleeper movie you will not regret.
