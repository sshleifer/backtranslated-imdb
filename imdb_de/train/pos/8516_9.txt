This movie is a hilarious and heartwarming story about an orphanage in financial distress. When the director goes on vacation, his father agrees to temporarily go into operation. <br /> <br /> This is the best job Leslie Nielson has ever done. His idea of ​​letting children is instantly innovative and his sales techniques will definitely make you laugh. The little girl in this movie is so cute and charming that I know I'll never forget her. Make sure you do not miss the first five minutes of the movie! <br /> <br /> This great family entertainment is so rare these days. If you decide on something trite with a happy ending, opt for this picture! I've been able to watch this over and over and do it often! My only complaint about this movie is that it's so hard to find a copy.
