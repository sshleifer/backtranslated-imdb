John Waters (Happy Birthday, John!) Did a little bit of the deliberately rough stuff he normally makes and made this parody of the celebrity / art world. Edward Furlong plays the title character, a working-class teenager in Baltimore who loves to take pictures. When a New York agent (Lili Taylor) discovers his work, she offers him his big break, which he accepts. But when he's big, he has to rethink everything. <br /> <br /> Basically, "Pecker" looks at how he loses his friends and his normal life as soon as he becomes a celebrity. The kind of things we could expect, sure, but with Waters' direction there are always a few things that shock us (you'll recognize them when you see them). I definitely recommend it. With Christina Ricci, Mink Stole and Patty Hearst.
