I had waited a few years for this movie to finally be released in England, but in many ways was very pleased when I finally saw it. There are many great things in the movie to start acting. It's not something that I need so much in a horror picture, but the people in this movie got it all right. This and the ever-gripping and interesting script with a nice Lovecraftian feel give the movie a real backbone. Add to that the doses of surreal nightmare pictures and occasionally cruel blood and the movies as winners. It also has my favorite style of Gore, supernatural and sparkling. Also, the characters of Marcus, the angry bodybuilding transsexual, and Daisy, his mentally retarded lover / toy, are sometimes really crazy and disturbing, and everything gives a sense of morbid adult craze, which works well with the frequent Freudian overtones. This is one of the most impressive current horror films that are far more shocking than the Hollywood products. My only criticism was that I wanted the ending to sound darker, but it still works, so I would really recommend it to serious horror fans.
