I work in a library and I expected to like this movie when it came out 5 years ago. Well, I really liked Parker Posey (she's a wonderful actress) and Omar Townsend was really cute as her boyfriend (he could not act, but if you look like him, who cares?), But the movie was bad. It was not funny or sweet or much of anything. Posey kept the movie afloat with her energy. But she learned the Dewey decimal system STAY HERE, and then puts back tons of books to the beat of the music. Come on! I also had a problem with what she looked like when she finally became a fully trained librarian - hair in a bun, glasses, no sense of humor - can we please let that clich√© go? Worth seeing for Posey and Townsend, but that's about it. The TV series was much better.
