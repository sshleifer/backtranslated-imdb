I remember that I stumbled across this particular channel surfing in 1965. I had never heard of Barbra before. When the show ended, I thought, "This is probably the best I'll ever see on TV." 42 years later that has come true. It's still nothing as amazing, as honestly amazing as the talent shown here. You can talk about all the superstars you want, that's the superlative of all! <br /> <br /> You call it, she can do it. Comedy, pathos, sultry seduction, ballads, Barbra is really a storyteller. Her ability to create everything she tries is legendary. But this special was made in the beginning and helped to create the legend that made it fast. Although she has risen so far in such a short time, she has fulfilled the promise and revealed more talents as she went on. But they are all there from the start. You will not be disappointed if you see this.
