Like "My Sassy Girl," this film is based on a true story from the Internet, but here ends the similarities. The story is generally about this rebellious guy named Ji-Hoon (Kwon Sang Woo), who's still trying to finish high school whose parents hire a teacher named Su-Wan (Kim Ha Neul), a woman which comes from a poor background. but he is the same age as he is. Add to that a few obstacles, martial arts (thugs are always after Ji-Hoon for revenge), a despised, reckless, lovesick girl who is after him, his inclination to drop his lesson, and the whole story in general can be guessed. Did I mention that it's a romantic comedy? This movie has some good fighting scenes, great visual humor and a lot of spunk, thanks to the good chemistry between Kim Ha Nuel and Kwon Sang Woo, which gives the story a lot of energy. For this reason, the romantic elements also work. And I have to say, I'd rather have a girlfriend like Kim Ha Nuel than this girl from "My Sassy Girl" (at least in terms of personality). She has some sperm, but it's more on the cute, sweet, good-natured way. Characters are usually very personable (so you could say that there were fewer hills than "My Sassy Girl" - an obstacle that contributed to this film in his honor), and the movie is pretty clever and interesting in most ways. However, the story sags about 2/3 of the way (where it ends up at known, usual fares where nothing really interesting happens), but in the end, it picks up again. Overall, a funny, sweet movie. 8.10
