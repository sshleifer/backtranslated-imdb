Japan 1918. The story of 16-year-old Ryu begins with the death of her father. As will become known later, both parents have died of tuberculosis. In this desperate situation, Ryu's aunt in Hawai has made a marriage with a Japanese person whom they only know from their picture. Upon arriving in Hawai, Ryu discovers that her new husband is much older than in the photo and he lives in very modest circumstances, next to a sugar cane plantation he's working on. Ryu was not used to the hard work on the plantation and desperate about her situation in her new home and remembers to run away. She soon discovers that she is not going anywhere. The friendship with Kana, one of her co-workers, gives her new hope and strength. This picture is based on real events between 1907 and the 1920s, when thousands of Asian women in America were married to men they only knew from their image. This not very well known picture is well written and implemented. The location is breathtaking. This film also features Mifune Toshiro in his very last appearance as Benshi (spokesman for the silent films). This film gives an insight into the Japanese culture here and across the ocean. Something you must have seen!
