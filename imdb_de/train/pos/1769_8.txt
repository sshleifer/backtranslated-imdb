I just came out of a preview of this movie. I had to laugh every 30 seconds. The end was so funny that tears ran down my face and I wished I had not bought that big coke. There are definitely some lulls, but overall very entertaining. The film gives Steve Carell a chance to shine after stealing the spotlight from both Jim Carrey in "Bruce Almighty" and Will Ferrell's "Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgendy" in their films. Paul Rudd is funny as always. I think it's great that he can be so funny in these broad comedies and continue to work in indie drama (like P.S.). I think Seth Rogen should get more work because he is so talented and committed. Leslie Mann also had incredibly funny moments. I highly recommend it for those who want to laugh like a madman. However, if you are slightly offended, you will not see this movie. If you're a rabid feminist, you will not see this movie. And no matter what, even if you think you're one of those "hip" parents, do not take your kids into this movie. Sure, you should let your teen see this movie, just do not watch. It would cause some unbelievably unpleasant moments.
