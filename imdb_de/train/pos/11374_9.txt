There are some great comments and observations about this movie. I was pleased with the comparisons with Fritz Lang's "M" (forget about the fifties failure remake with the easy David Wayne). The real villain is not the tortured murderer (Jeffery DeMunn's extraordinarily good performance) who shuts off his sexually frustrated anger over his victims - mostly children. He is the target. The real villain is the stifling bureaucratic Soviet system drowning in its own corrupt incompetence. The frustration of an uncompromisingly engaged man (Rea in his best role since "The Crying Game"), a lighthearted pragmatist willing to use the system to his advantage (Sutherland always succeeds in this role), a hesitant, frightened, but determined psychiatrist (the incomparable Max Sydow), a prosecutor's limping, angry bureaucrat (brilliant British actor John Wood), and the quiet, supportive wife of the driven investigator (delighted supporter Imelda Staunton). This is a damn good movie. His darkness and desolation are aided by the portrayal of a corrupt, incompetent system that works against success. It is not necessary to deal with the sensational Slice 'n-Dice sensation that has shaped many new films. Gore is present - it's a gruesome story - but it does contribute to the portrayal of a pathologically twisted person. The story's success is just that: these were actions done by a person, a person like you or me. If you and I decide to put off our frustration with reasonable resources, Chikatilo takes his anger over the most innocent and vulnerable of us, our children. The great premise of this story is manifested by an equally stellar cast of outstanding actors. - Unfortunately, I find that our Australian friend did not like the speech and would undoubtedly prefer to hear her speak in Australian dialect. Well, too stupid. This beautiful movie certainly worked for me and everyone else I talked to.
