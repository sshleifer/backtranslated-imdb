This first season episode is slightly controversial with the entire angle of sex. I can imagine that before the completion of the censors a considerable amount of processing has taken place. <br /> <br /> The story itself is original and well written and the direction is complemented by good acting. (Nicholas Lea does not release his X-Files debut as Agent Krycek, but as a victim named Michael). I liked the setup and the end myself. <br /> <br /> It's different, but enjoyable. Bad reviews you hear are bad. Watch it for yourself and make a judgment
