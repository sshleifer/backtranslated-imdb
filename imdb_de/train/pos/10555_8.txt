The premise of this movie has been fueling my imagination for some time. We have all heard or read in a kind of con-text. What would you do if you were alone in the world? What would you do if the whole world suddenly disappears before your eyes? In fact, the last part is actually what happens to Dave and Andrew, two roommates who live in a rundown house in the middle of a highway system. Andrew is a nervous wreck, to say the least, and Dave is considered one of the biggest losers in society. That alone is the main reason why these two guys get along so well because they just have to turn to each other when they need comfort. Only until ... <br /> <br /> There are many problems right at the beginning of the film. Both are involved in crime, Andrew suffers from paranoia and just does not dare to leave the house. Dave is unsuccessful at his job and his colleagues do not treat him well and with the respect he deserves. The number of problems they face increases until the day they face the inevitable and have to deal with it. This is just too much for them and they wish everything would just go away ... And that's exactly what happens, of course. <br /> <br /> The rest of the story puts Dave and Andrew in this world of nothingness. They are amazed and struggling to understand and deal with the characteristics of this crazy environment, but later they discover that they can do almost anything they want, for it seems they are the only ones left , <Br /> <br /> Nothing offers an incredibly small cast - in fact, apart from the first recordings of the movie, we only see Dave (David Hewlett) and Andrew (Andrew Miller) in the entire movie. It is obvious that the cast must be more than good enough for the task, because in a world where nothing exists, there is nothing that can distract the viewer in any way. Vincenzo has decided to use a reasonable amount of head shots up close to make it more interesting, and it actually works quite well. The director of photography, Derek Rogers, also has a nice way to annoy the audience by holding back visual information, especially when a character sees and responds, but we do not see it immediately. <br /> <br /> Of course this can not be an event driven movie and not. Much of the action takes place outside their home when they are in the void. And here are some of the funniest scenes, especially when Andrew discovers a chocolate bar. Now you might think, "What does not look like?" Well, it does not look like it. The whole world of nothing is white ... knows which direction you are looking. That's the weakness of this movie ... After an hour or less it gets extremely boring to watch, and there have to be events to make sure it's more interesting. Thank God there are some. For example, at times when the two guys can not really jump high due to the properties of nothing, as if nothing were ... tofu (as Andrew claims). It's fun to see how they can not exploit anything immediately to become gods of their own little company. <br /> <br /> One of the best parts of the film is the set ... The production designer Jasna Stefanovic made a film Nice work in this movie, the house where these two guys live is so unnaturally funny to watch yet it seems right that these two live in a place like this. All in all, the production design is undoubtedly one of the most powerful aspects of this film. It really makes the movie worth seeing ... <br /> <br /> However, the best part of the movie is the acting arts. Both David Hewlett and Andrew Miller really look like the professional actors they are both. The camera is there for every second of the movie, and as I said, there are almost no props in the movie, they are really on a bare stage. With a lot of character development and some decent one-line, clever dialogues (sometimes funny stupid), everything works for that purpose - and that really moves the movie from the low-budget area to handcrafted crafting. <Br /> <br /> Let's talk a bit about the visual effects, because they are definitely worth mentioning. Nothing is equipped with digital visual effects and prostheses that match a modern horror movie. There is a pretty dreadful dream sequence in the movie, and although The Drews has completely milked this scene, it's still fun to see them. One of the best visual effects in the movie comes to an end when Andrew and Dave suddenly discover their powers in this environment - they have the ability to wish for anything, what if they can do it the other way around and make things appear? <br /> <br /> "Nothing" is a bright and well-lit movie that really promotes the idea that they are probably dead (this is indeed one of their theories), but "Nothing" is a comedy and it is slowly destroying his own theory. We do not know where they are or what happened to them. We do not know if they'll ever come out because the movie ends before we see something like that. Incidentally, the end is not as good as it could have been. It's pretty easy to predict what's going to happen, yet the authors have come up with a few incidents that help make things a little more interesting, and in the end it's a pretty satisfying result. <br /> <br /> Take "Hollow" Man, "Kill Bill", "Cube", "Epoch" and many other movies and you have "Nothing." It's really a mix of different styles, nonetheless there There's no other movie (at least I know it) Nothing is really like ... The people who remember the Original Cube Production Commentary on their DVD may remember that Vincenzo Natali talked about inventing the story of Cube He says he and Andr√© Bijelic were at times roommates, and both were in this extremely boring room, with no hope that "Nothing" could be the scripted version of the origin of the Cube story for that purpose it is almost like one of the cube prequels. <br /> <br /> What can I say about that? I enjoyed "Nothing", it's a great movie and the different parts of the movie are extremely well done, with lots of smart ideas I feel like watching the movie something is missing and I'm having trouble figuring out exactly what it is ... If we have a "nothing 2", maybe I can answer that question. "Nothing" is a great movie, but not as good as I expected. <br /> <br /> Final rating: 7.5 / 10
