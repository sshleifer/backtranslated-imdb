Better than the typical TV movie, INVITATION TO HELL is blessed with an outstanding casting (Urich, Lucci, Cassidy, McCarthy, before Joe Brownbutbuty, before Brown's Regal by Murphy, Soleil Moon-Frye) and a comprehensive concept update for the well-known Faustian storyline. Urich is sympathetic as always and Lucci is particularly exaggerated and devilish in the mother of all Femme Fatale roles. As a kind of hybrid version of STEPFORD WIVES and THEY LIVE, the film is committed to its apocalyptic Miltonesque vision at an early stage, and horror fans will probably be dealing with many complaints after the humble, maudlin document. 10.7
