I saw this movie as a kid on TV (thanks to the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation) and had nightmares about it for years. <br /> <br /> Trnka was one of the mentors of Bratislav Pojar, one of Canada's best animators on the National Film Board. Pojar was again mentor and co-worker of the big Drouin. If you like Trnka, you should see "Night Angel". <br /> <br /> The symbolism is obvious but cleverly used. The contrasts of beauty and life (the plant) contrast with the anonymity of the gloved hand. The poor puppet hero is convicted despite missing political agenda. <br /> <br /> What I remembered most was the feeling of oppression in the decor. The small space in which the action takes place is the entire world of the figure. Invasion by the hand is a complete violation of this world. <br /> <br /> Beautiful and haunting movie. I found a copy of these and other wonderful Trnka shorts in the public library and showed them to my own children. Something you must have seen.
