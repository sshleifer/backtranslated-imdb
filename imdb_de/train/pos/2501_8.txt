I'm a fan of both actors / singers, especially Gackt. When I discover this movie for the first time and watch the trailer, I think this is a stupid movie. After a long wait I finally looked at him and here is my comment ... <br /> <br /> I think everyone knows the story and will not mention it. Instead, my first applause is put on acting, in general, that Japanese films are not brilliant and theatrical. Seeing everything in MoonChild's cast is just wonderful and exciting, especially Gackt reflects the emotions of his characters and changes pretty well. I like many of his scenes both dramatically and humorously. As far as HYDE is concerned, his acting is good, but he deliberately stays in the background as an actor. I do not like cinematography, especially the lighting and some colors, but due to the low budget, there are still brilliant moments, but the real jewel of the film is history. It has some cheesy moments, but it's OK for me and the friendship theme of the movie is really well developed and touching, sometimes the story shows a cruel world that does not guarantee life, and with some memorable death scenes, it reflects that theme for the visuals , Apart from an interesting note, this film has some similarities with the award-winning vampire on Interwiew with the Vampire, which is also played by the most beautiful (not handsome, beautiful) actors in American cinema. Actually, Moon Child is somehow seen as a brother with Interwiew, but original on its own I'm a bit slow, I'm a Japanese movie fan and I'm used to it, but it does not change. MoonChild has some useless scenes or characters. But all in all, this movie is really good and sometimes very emotional, as for the actor / singer duo I hope to see her other films in the future, and I recommend this to anyone who vampires action-science-fiction Movies and love movies 8/10 likes
