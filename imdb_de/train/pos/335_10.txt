I have been trying for a long time to find out about this series! Thank you, IMDb! I saw that as a kid and could never quite get it out of my head. As a six-year-old, of course, I was particularly impressed with the Cyclops episode, which was absolutely daunting (I talked so much about it that my older brother made me a cyclops out of a plastic caveman figure I remember Unusual from the beginning - mysterious, rigorous and extremely authentic - when I read the original many years later, I experienced the same feeling - it's very hard to grasp - and probably impossible in Hollywood - any "odyssey" I've seen since "This was a real masterpiece, but why is not it better known, and why is not it on VHS or DVD available? I would like to have the chance to see it again!
