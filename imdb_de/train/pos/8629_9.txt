In the beginning of the nineties, I read a small ad in a horror magazine about the love of the dead or something similar. This, of course, sparked my curiosity and I ordered Necromancy 1 & 2 and Deathking. The necromancy films are ok, even interesting and unique in their approach to Necrophilia (even though they are obviously horror opera entries and should not cause fear in the mind of the beholder, they are actually pretty funny.)> <br /> TODESKING is in my opinion one of the best movies ever made. It consists of a series of scenes depicting the many facets of death. Death as an enemy; Death as a helper, death as a very physical decomposition of the body. The film is a metaphor about life. It shows how fragile life is and how short our life is. It reduces its viewers to the children they really are. The fact that we can not really understand the nature of death, and thus dying, is the core message of the film. This is a very realistic movie. Buttgereit never tries to hide death behind white roses or whatever. Regardless of the moral standards you set, death is inevitable and, sooner or later, will not be fiction but your reality. This applies to you, dear reader, as well as to the viewers of the film. Some adolescent reviewers do not seem to realize that, which is completely excused because they will, of course, live forever. <br /> <br /> This is not a movie for exploitation. Why? Because death does not take advantage of us humans. It reaps us. We grow for seven days, then we are brought back into the Schopenhauerian state of preterm birth, that is death. Buttgereit gives us his version of the oldest stories. Whether you consider it "optimistic" or "pessimistic" is up to you. At first glance it may seem very dark. Remember, however, that something else has to die for something to live. "Who wants to live forever?" <br /> <br /> I believe that when Buttgereit shows a body that is consumed by maggots, it not only shows decomposition, but also the generation of a new life. Is not it better to die and give life to the maggots and then the birds, and finally become Earth, than to remain the living dead zombie who is one of the favorite animals of the genre? <br /> <br /> If you recognize this Deathking sees it in its right context. <br /> <br /> Seven days a week, seven times last hours. Seven are the days of the week (weak, mortal!), Seven times the last hour. <br /> <br /> Do not be afraid of the Reaper, says Buttgereit, because the Reaper only takes what is ripe. And apples that are not picked to eat will rot! <br /> <br /> Have a good life, other IMDB'er! <br /> <br /> (And watch this movie, which compares only to Ingemar Bergman's "The Seventh Seal" in terms of depth and universality)
