When I saw this movie years ago, I wanted to turn it off immediately. When I sat there for the next 10 minutes, I realized that the actor who played Navin had stolen the show. His facial expressions and his comic behavior make me shake his head why he was not in more comedies. He has this "Marty Feldman" thing for him, but MUCH, MUCH more talent ... takes nothing away from Marty. The movie really shocked me how close it was to the original Jerk, but on the other hand, it was MUCH MORE. I really think if this movie was released first and I saw the Steve Martin movie 2, I would think the second movie would be a cheap rip-off. I know, it sounds like a bold statement, but it's true. Actually, I really like Steve Martin, but his performance is second to the actor in The Jerk Too. I wish I could get a copy of it for my collection. I urge you to see it if you can find it.
