Of the three remakes of W. Somerset Maughan's novel, this is the best and not particularly what John Cromwell has brought into the film. The film is worth a look as Bette Davis, who has shown as Mildred Rogers to the film industry, that she is a star. After all, their battles with Jack Warner and his studio have paid off royally. <br /> <br /> The movie is dominated by Mildred right from the start. We recognize from the beginning that Mildred is not interested in Philip and never becomes. She does not hide her contempt for this friendly soul who has fallen in love with the wrong woman. He will be humiliated again by Mildred, and once again, since she has no idea what she really is. Poor Philip Carey is a weak man in addition to his disability. When he tries to cling to Mildred, she rejects him. When Mildred returns to him, when she is fragile and defeated, he faces up to this opportunity and overcomes his dependency on this terrible woman, who has stolen his will and manhood, a fantastic depiction of Mildred. This was one of her best roles and she ran away. Their disgust for the benevolent Philip is clear from the beginning of their relationship. When she tells him that she washes her mouth after kissing her, this is one of the most powerful moments in the movie. Leslie Howard infiltrated Philip and makes him seem even weaker than he is. Frances Dee, Reginald Denny, Alan Hale and Reginald Owen are in minor roles. <br /> <br /> This is Bette Davis Show, and do not forget it!
