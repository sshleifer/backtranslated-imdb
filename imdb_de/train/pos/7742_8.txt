Intense actors like Bruce Dern, Jason Patrick and Rachel Ward make this modern film Noir a winner. Of the three, I do not know who was the most interesting because they all offer good performances and fascinating characters. <br /> <br /> Patric plays the narrative in this Noir and plays an ex-boxer and a mental patient. Wow, that alone makes an interesting guy! He looks stupid, but it is not. Ward is the sloppy, attractive, cynical, intelligent and compassionate co-conspirator of a kidnapping plan that's going badly. Bruce Dern is also in the mix and Dern fascinated in any movie. <br /> <br /> The film can be considered a downer to the average viewer, but I found it intriguing ... and I do not like to depress movies normally. What I found was a kind of quirky thriller. See if you agree. This is a pretty unknown movie that should not have this status because it's just a good story and well done.
