This movie has everything, action, fighting, dancing, bull riding, music and pretty girls. This film is an authenic view of Central America. Believe me, I was there in 1980. Lots of oil money, lots of women and lots of honky tonks. Too bad they are all gone now. The movie is essentially just another boy meets a girl, a boy loses a girl, a boy gets a girl back, but it is redeemed by the actors and the music. There is absolutely no movie with better music than this movie, and that includes American Graffiti. It's a movie that I watch again and again and never get tired. Every time I see it, I'm young again, and it's time to make hopeful tonking. The only reason I only gave him a 9 is because you can not rate a movie with zero. I do not think you should rate a 10.
