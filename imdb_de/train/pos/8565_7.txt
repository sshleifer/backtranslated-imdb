If you like animal films, this movie will please. My wife loves animals and wildlife movies, especially the parrot in this movie. It's geared for kids, but I laughed the most about humor. The French fashion character made me laugh and gives the script more balance. It's a Disney movie with its juicy, happy family appeal, but I like to leave the theater with a positive feeling.
