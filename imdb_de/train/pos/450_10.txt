I tend to make a movie that draws a lush picture of Italy - in my opinion the most romantic country in the world. Unfortunately, the film was rather short, unusual for a historical play, and a little frugal in terms of cinematography. But the excellent story makes up for it. The four ladies are preparing for a much-needed relaxing holiday with problems. Throughout the film, they recognize their problems and begin to solve them. They believe that San Salvatore, the castle in which they live, has a charming effect on people. "It's a bucket of love," says Lottie Wilkins. They can observe their gradual change from dissatisfied to exuberant, while the Italian sea conjures up its magic on them. The actresses were great. The background music seemed very suitable for a romantic Italian eatery. All in all a 10/10 movie for me.
