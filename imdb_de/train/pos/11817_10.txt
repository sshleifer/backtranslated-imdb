I saw Dick Tracy when I was very young. I did not know who was one of the actors, and I did not know that the movie would look different than in the preview. I really loved it. <br /> <br /> Warren Beatty plays the role of Detective Dick Tracy in the 1930s, who is following the city's biggest mob bosses. This time Big Boy Caprice (Al Pacino) has killed a very powerful man and wants to take over the city with his singer Breathless Mahoney (Madonna), who has Tracy's eye on her. It gets even worse because a new criminal invades and the worst part is: this criminal has no face. He or she is very unknown. Also, the famous villians from the comic book collection are back. <br /> <br /> I thought that this movie is very colorful and creative. It was entertaining and fun, especially watching as a child. Warren Beaty, like James Bond in the 1930s, was the way he played Dick Tracy. An ensemble of the film includes: Charlie Korsmo, Glenn Headly, William Forsythe, Dustin Hoffman, James Caan and Ed O Ross, Tommy Lee Jones, Mandy Patinkin and Charles Durning. Plus more! <br /> <br /> Dick Tracy is a movie for all ages and a fun movie for a family to enjoy. Count on it.
