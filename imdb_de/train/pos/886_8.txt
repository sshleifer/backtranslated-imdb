This was one of the DVDs I recently bought in a set of six called "Frenchfilm" to freshen up our French before our planned holiday in beautiful Provence this year. So far, we have not only improved our French, but also significantly improved our appreciation for French cinema. What a great example for screenwriters, actors, directors and filmmakers. It was very inspiring to see two identifiable characters in the lead roles, without being glossy magazine cover artifacts. <br /> <br /> The other thing I liked about this movie was the slow character and conspiracy that made you guess how it would all end. Is there really something good in this selfish thug that constantly treats his seemingly naive benefactor with the kind of contempt that an ex-con would show? Will our sexually frustrated, small, half-deaf heroine turn out to be the answer to her dreams and the situation that fate has given her? The viewer is intrigued by these questions, and the performers slowly and convincingly resolve the answers as they encounter events that challenge and influence each other. <br /> <br /> If you've seen this movie, you want me to see it again. I still need to find out the director's psychological motive for the subplot in the role of the probation officer, and some of the subtle nuances of Camera work is worth a second look. The plot calls for some imagination when our hero gets the chance to assist our abused and overworked heroine in the office. You also need to be open-minded to believe in her brilliant lip-reading and how something of the plot collapses. However, if you do the thrilling ride with this example of French cinema, you will be more than satisfied. Four out of five stars for me.
