What is the best screen version of Quo Vadis? ever made. Well, yes, the plot is not as strong and obvious as in the book, sometimes it meanders and loses its tension between aesthetic subtleties. But the movie is really and beautifully "weird", has a mystery and style that other versions - with R. Taylor and the new from Poland - definitely miss. It has the appearance of a Roman decadence, the beauty of the decline of paganism and the Christianity of children. At least I believe that). Brandauer, Forrest and Syudov have brilliantly portrayed their characters. Forrest's Petronius seems to be the greatest success of the cast (let alone Brandauer, who is one of the greatest actors ever) and gathers the essence of this dying world (IMHO). That's it. So it happened, guys ...))) IMHO
