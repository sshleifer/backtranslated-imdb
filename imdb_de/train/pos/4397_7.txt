An unconventional historical drama with some nice fight scenes. Tobey Maguire performs excellently and is supported pretty well. The script is well-formed and highly original, and the film is mercifully freed from heroes. That is, it pulls a bit, and the last role is too much like a TV miniseries. Nevertheless, Frederick Elmes' camera work takes an interest in the boring parts (and now and again you see a shot reminding you that he has worked for David Lynch). Worth seeing.
