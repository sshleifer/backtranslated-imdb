Although this show has not been aired since 1973, I felt compelled to comment on a DVD set that I borrowed from our library. I can remember when it was the only color show on television in the 1960s, and sometimes there was a little "Sunday Night Party" with friends who saw this on NBC on one of the few color TVs. <br /> <br /> I really do not like the story so much about names and dates, but how it affects us today and how much it can be based on the most absurd acts of the time. A typical example: Virginia City, Nevada, which became one of the richest cities in the world because of silver, got its name from a figure called "Old Virginny," who stumbled out of a salon in the early days of the city. fell and broke his whiskey bottle. <br /> <br /> Old Virginny did not want to waste the opportunity as the precious liquid seeped into the dirt and he baptized the town "Virginia Town". The area was known as Comstock Lode because another character, Henry Comstock, had the reputation of surpassing the claims of all, and the area became known as Comstock Lode with these 2 subjects. Other episodes dealt with Mark Twain's literary advancement while he was a reporter for the Territorial Enterprise. <br /> <br /> It was a healthy (and often educational) family entertainment. As someone else noted, each episode would really be seen as a movie in its own right - rich scripts and characters. <br /> <br /> One thing that twisted the truth was its proximity to Virginia City and the Ponderosa. To ride from the Ponderosa (just to the north of Lake Tahoe) you would need to ride your horse about 1,000 meters down the Spooner Summit into the high desert (3,000 to 4,000 feet) of the Carson Valley and then another 30-40 miles Virginia City. <br /> <br /> Needless to say, the Cartwrights have some moving buttocks that do this regularly. But every writer should have some leeway with the truth. <br /> <br /> How I miss this show today.
