This film is about the Irish rebellion in the 1920s, and especially about the life of a man, after he has informed a friend about the heaviness and the consequences. When I saw the movie, I felt like you could do the script, and with a few minor updates, do it again, and unfortunately it would still fit into current events. But the remake would not be nearly as good. A great performance by Victor McLaglen (for whom he rightly won an Oscar) and a fine cast that most, if not all, of the actors are Hollywood starters. A very good movie worth seeing. Highly recommended.
