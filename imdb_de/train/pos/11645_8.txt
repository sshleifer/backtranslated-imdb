I was in France around the 5th of March and love to go to these film festivals. I knew about this Cinémas d'Amérique Latine of Toulouse, but I never got around to it. I decided to go and started Cero y van 4. <br /> <br /> The movie is amazing. It did not make an impression on me like the Mexican users because it was French subtitles, but it is still shocking. <br /> <br /> This film is a satire about urban violence, kidnapping and street crime in Mexico. It is a rough portrait of the city. A metropolis Secuestro Express, with a stunning Mia Maestro, who was also a satiric of kidnapping, almost, but with a more serious tone, and I think so, has some kind of connection to Cero y van 4. A kind of redemption story and how much too much? Man on Fire, which was surprisingly strong, was not satire, but a rough portrait of the streets of Mexico. Or it's like the brave one. A movie that shakes you and hits you hard in the stomach. This is like the usual suspects, it has some twists and turns, but that makes it even more believable. Conclusion: A film that shocks you and makes you believe that there is no more security on the streets. Stunning dialogue, impressive direction and amazing performances. Cero y van 4 is a movie that you will not forget so quickly. Lets you shiver and numb.
