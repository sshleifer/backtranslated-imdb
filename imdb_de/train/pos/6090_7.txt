Envy is not as funny as I thought it would be initially, but after some reviews I read, I found it a lot funnier than people gave it to props. But Ben Stiller and Jack Black work well together, and Christopher Walken is as gorgeous as ever, so it's about Jack Black's character, who invented a spray that makes dog poodles disappear. Ben does not want it, but if the product does it Jack Black Rich Ben Stiller starts to see envy, it's by no means great and both Ben Stiller and Jack Black have fun and better movies in their guts I've met a few times laughed his ass, as a big fan of Ben Stiller I have to say that this is a smaller Stiller, but still a lot of fun
