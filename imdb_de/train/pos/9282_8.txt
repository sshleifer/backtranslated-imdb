In Iran, women are not allowed to play football. It is official because they should be spared the vulgar language and behavior of the male audience. But of course it's about sexism. Women are lower forms of people. Some courageous girls resist this and try to get into the stadium with various tricks. They are caught by soldiers and hold themselves in a kind of cage until the police pick them up. <br /> <br /> Despite the crazy situation, this is a movie with a lot of humor. It is also heartening to see how people always find different ways to combat oppression. You are touched at the same time when you have a lot of laughs. Good work by director Jafar Panahi. This is in many ways a heroic comedy.
