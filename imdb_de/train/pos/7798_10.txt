I can not describe how great this movie is. Suffice to say, whenever I'm depressed, how unfair or in vain things appear, this is the movie I lend to put me in the right mood. The background music lets you see the ease of existence and how simplicity provides the greatest happiness. The Indian girl who sings is just one example of a character in this film who does not try hard and is happy as a result. Persifina, ruby's lingerie colleague (Ashley Judd), is another eye candy and a smile could make the day for the toughest person. I watch this movie and dream of better days or a good conversation with friends, and I realize that being alone - Ruby is often alone - is not the same as being lonely. Recommended for those who like a thoughtful movie break.
