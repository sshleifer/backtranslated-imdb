While the story is sweet and the dancing and singing in the main part of the movie is a pleasure, the uniqueness of the movie (and what makes it a masterpiece) is the dream sequence. It offers the combination of the highest form of true American music (Gershwin), the appealing beauty of French impressionist art, Kelly's enthralling choreography (including his enthusiastic "pas de deux d'amour", truly a separate genre), which represents a very particular genre of color palette that was ever developed for the set. Harmonizing the surging music and the visual explosion with these dances was a true work of a creative genius and a great artist.
