This short was nominated for an Oscar and I wish she had won! Basically a filmed jam session between some very talented musicians, including Lester Young and Joe Jones. The music is incredible! Hollywood has often opted for jazz (especially the animation, believe it or not), but this is a rare movie in the improvisation jam. This was rightly included in the list of film conservation. TCM regularly does this as a filler and runs it every March sometime to receive its "31 Days of Oscar" tribute. From the city center on Buzzer, the network was so good that the network hardly moved. Very solid and highly recommended !!!
