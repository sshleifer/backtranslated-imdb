I loved this movie! Chris Showerman did a great job! Not only is he an incredible actor, he is also fantastic and has a fantastic physique! He did a great job delivering his lines and turned George better than Fraser. A great achievement for his first big role! This movie is full of funny scenes that every kid will love. My children have watched this movie several times since buying the DVD. In addition to the movie, the extras on the DVD are just as funny. Two thumbs up on this! I highly recommend it to everyone!
