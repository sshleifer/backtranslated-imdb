"Mechenosets" is one of the most beautiful romantic movies I have ever seen. The name of the film can be translated in English as "sword-bearer". The main hero (Sasha) was born with an extraordinary ability: he can protect himself with the extremely sharp sword, which is under the skin in his hand. At first glance, he seems to be another stupid superhero from the pointless movie about unreal events and feelings. But it's not about Mechenosets. He can hardly be called an antihero. I think he's just a person who has lost the sense and trust in good, justice and love in their lives. In his life he has never met anyone who could understand and love him (except his mother). Every one of his steps is stained with blood; He takes revenge on everyone for his gift, which became a damnation for him. And suddenly he meets her. She does not need the idle conversations and explanations. She loves him for what he is. She does not care what he did. The fact that he is beside her is more important than anything else. But soon she discovers his secret: he kills two people (her ex-boyfriend and bodyguard) to protect her from her eyes. Even then, she could not escape her feelings. They try to run, but it's hard to hide. After all, they have a serious car accident. He is locked up; She is in a mental hospital. They do not know each other, but she thinks he will save her. He overcomes many obstacles and finally finds them. They walk again but are not invulnerable. She is wounded, she needs a break, but the police almost catch her. He does not know what to do, they drive into a corner and then his sword starts cutting trees, helicopters around them, but it's not necessary because she's already dead in his arms and he's the one again lonely person around the world.
