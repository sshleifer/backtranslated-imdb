What if Marylin Monroe, Albert Einstein, Joe Dimaggio, and Senator McCarthy got together on a varied evening of Relativity meetings? <br /> <br /> This delightful Roman clef never uses the actual names of the characters who are so thin. Veils and exterminations not only reveal themselves to the individuals they must have been, but also to what they have been through Had to represent time. If you are confused by allegory or your films are predigested and mushy, you will not like this movie. It is a sophisticated work that rewards the viewer with intelligence on many levels in order to appreciate it. <br /> <br /> For now, the strict avoidance of using the right names of the characters dropped, we see Einstein, who is currently holding a pacifist speech before a UN fanatic Marylin Monroe, having filmed the infamous Seven Year Itch scene Some say that she married Joe Dimaggio. They have a charming interplay in which Einstein stumbles with appropriate awkwardness about the innocence of perhaps the biggest sex symbol of the modern age. <br /> <br /> State Senator McCarthy, who thinks Einstein is a Red. He is determined to take Einstein's assurance that he will support the activities of the House Unamerican Activities Committee while providing the ultimate weapon in the name of peace. Joe, a surprisingly fragile and vulnerable person who may not be perfectly cast as Gary Busey, who hates Marylin's exhibitionism and believes that Einstein has become her lover, even though Marylin Einstein just wants to show she understands the special relativity theory. <br /> <br /> But there is more. <br /> <br /> Just like each of us, these characters have their deepest fears, which they reveal in vivid flashbacks. It is these weaknesses that ultimately endow humanity with figures we almost exclusively contrast with today. Finally, we see the shocking horror of Einstein's vision, and the message of the film becomes clear. It is a powerful and memorable moment. <br /> <br /> Insignificance is one of my five best films ever. It is absolutely amazing.
