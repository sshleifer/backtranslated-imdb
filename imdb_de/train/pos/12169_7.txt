On the night of his bachelor party, Paul Coleman (Jason Lee) meets the beautiful dancer Becky (Julia Stiles) in the bar, they drink a lot together and the next morning he wakes up with her on the bed. His future mother-in-law calls him and informs that his fianc√©e Karen (Selma Blair) might arrive at his apartment and he desperately asks Becky to leave his place in a hurry. Earlier, he realizes that she has crabs, and later, preparing for his wedding, he realizes that Becky is Karen's cousin. This is the beginning of a very funny comedy with funny situations. The first attraction of this film is certainly the central trio of actresses and actors. Julia Stiles and Selma Blair, who are outstanding actresses and extremely gorgeous, and Jason Lee, who is amazingly funny, have performed well. I have laughed a lot, but there are some scenes that are really funny. For example, when Paul finds Becky in his bed; when he finds her colors; his imagination in many situations; in the drugstore trying to buy and get explanations about the crab medicine; most scenes of his neighbor, the minister; when Karen calls the department store; or if the police find a suspect of attacking Paul. I could count many other scenes, but better borrow the reader or buy this movie and have a lot of fun. My voice is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Louco Por Elas" ("Crazy For Them")
