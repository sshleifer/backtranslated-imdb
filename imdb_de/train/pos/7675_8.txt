After seeing the movie last night, I had a sense of hopelessness faced by organizations trying to solve the problem of filming. The scale of prostitution seems to be so great that it is hard to see how it can be defeated without major changes to the government in Cambodia. Anyway, the review is a dark movie with an uncomfortable central relationship. This is a very compelling movie, and I would even say that it is fun. The film was well cut for the run and the performance of Thuy Nguyen was excellent. I also felt that Ron Livingston played a very difficult role. <br /> <br /> It would have been nice to know a little bit more about why Patrick thinks he needs to help Holly, but maybe the reason is simply Chris Penn's character. I will not explain it here - look at the movie. <br /> <br /> This is a good thought-provoking movie with obviously good intentions. I hope the release is so big that it reaches a large enough audience and gets more support for the K-11 project.
