Before Nicholas Cage was a big action star, he was a great actor. In this lesser-known movie, Cage shows one of his best performances. "Red Rock West" was an almost unknown low-budget movie, but is one of my favorite movies of all time. I spotted it walking through the video store and wanted to see Cage and Hopper (who's also great in the movie) together. Get this and I'm sure you will not be disappointed.
