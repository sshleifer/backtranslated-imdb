And not because I've had a crush on Melissa Joan Hart since her time on "Clarissa Explains It All," which was already in her 20s at the time this show was popular, but still could teenage roles. "Sabrina, the teenage witch" was Hart's next big jump after her "Clarissa" days. Based on the comic is Sabrina Spellman - you guessed it! - a juvenile witch trying to reconcile her witchcraft antics with the demands of everyday teenage life. Her two aunts and a clever black cat help her to go from high school to college and finally to her career in journalism. As usual, Hart is the show's heart soul. "Sabrina, the teenage witch" is very moving and very funny, and it's a shame I took so long to realize how great it was. I just wish there were some recent episodes we could all enjoy. <br /> <br /> 10/10
