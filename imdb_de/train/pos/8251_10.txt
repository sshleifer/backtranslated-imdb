And that someone is me. And not only me, as I can see here at IMDb or when leaving the theater. Why did people love it? It's obvious: Everyone knows zombies by now (at least the horror fans by heart and the others by the "Dawn of the Dead" invention or Resident Evil movies, etc.) all about zombies ... until this movie came out. And you will see zombies in a new light (maybe). This is not a horror movie, though it does contain some violent scenes, but rather a comedy. A satire, to be precise. And it's never steamed! That's why I rated it that high. The tempo is incredible, the acting is great and the script has no (obvious) mistakes. On the contrary, it's a gem and if you're only interested in zombies, you should see it! And even if you do not like them, look at it! Because it's a great (comedy) movie!
