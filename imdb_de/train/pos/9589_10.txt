I grew up in the club scene in NYC in the late '80s / early' 90s and can personally say that this is one of the major documentary films that filmed that place during that time. No Madonna did not come up with the idea of ​​Voguing, but here she came! Rather than perpetrating violence or bickering in bitchy cat fights, the modification allowed humans to "fight" within the bounds of anything that should not touch (which would justify automatic disqualification). Seeing this kind of exceptionally talented / well-orchestrated "dropping" in the clubs was spectacular and all the big names back then were here ... Pepper La Beija, Paris Duprée, Xtragavaganza, etc. All reminiscent of such epochs as Malcolm McLaren's song " Deep in Vogue "... it did not matter who you were or where you came from, because when you came through these doors into this" magical kingdom "you became part of something bigger than yourself / you were important / and most of all Creating your own movements and imagination ... and anyone from anywhere could become king (or queen), as it may have been. The words and the joke were as sharp as the movements on the floor. The excitement, excitement and magic of this very urban NYC energy is captured in this film. BRILLIANT!!! PLEASE RELEASE ON DVD, so that the world can see it !!! Thank you!
