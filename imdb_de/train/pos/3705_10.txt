I can not understand the low rating of 5.7 in this movie. It is a pleasure for people who like a strong voltage plot and dark atmospheres. The sound recalls midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil, down to the scene (Savannah). The acting is strong and I was amazed at the authenticity of the southern accent of Kenneth Branagh. Famke Jansen is great, Robert Duval is in a small part effective and Embeth Davitz is the BOMB. Big, naked scene too from her. <br /> <br /> The plot is fairly normal, but effective.
