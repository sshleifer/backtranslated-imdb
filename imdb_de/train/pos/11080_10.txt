When people hear 'GUY RITCHIE', they immediately think of SNATCH. Yes, Snatch was a good movie, but the problem is that everyone associates Guy Ritchie with Snatch. They do not expect to explore new frontiers. This movie REVOLVER is different from snatch; It is much darker and very complex. The reason why I gave a rating of 10 is that I had to look at Revolver 3 times to understand everything. So this movie is playing with your head. It is written very cleverly. <br /> <br /> This movie is different from Snatch. It's been wonderful, the cinematography is beautiful, and you can see Guy Ritchie's personal touch (directing) in it. <br /> <br /> What convinced me was the complexity of the protagonist and how we left more questions than answers.
