Dudley Moore is fantastic in this big, unknown classic. This movie is a very funny movie that relies heavily on the talent of the actors. Without Dudley Moore, John Gielgud, Liza Minnelli and a few others, this film could have been a disaster. It's not always good shot and sometimes it has some loud music trying to force a mood (the "psycho" -like music at the wedding fight), but acting overcomes them. The character Arthur is funny with his drunken comments. But he does develop well into a more mature, rounded character when he learns to live by himself. The end, however, is pretty hackneyed. I will not tell, but it could be improved. Worth seeing many times.
