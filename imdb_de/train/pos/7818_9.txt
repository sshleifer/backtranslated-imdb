I think the context of the story was covered by other posters. I just want to talk about the effects of this movie on me. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie for the first time in the year of its publication in 1987. My school organized a visit to the cinema for a RE project, I think. Of course we were all excited because we were on a school trip to the cinema! We did not know what we would experience. To this day, I still remember the feelings that awoke in me, and I remembered how I had cried most of my friends. I believe in the age we were in, we found it shocking and quiet, rightly outraged in our own youthful way. It influenced me so much that I joined the anti-apartheid movement the same year. In my case, it served its purpose.
