EARTH is a must for children and adults. My son was having fun watching all these funny birds and polar bears. We can learn a lot from this film and should be proud of our great treasure on earth. There are some animals in danger of disappearing. Exactly this problem should prevent all authorities of our planet. <br /> <br /> This documentary offers many extraordinary pictures that I have never seen before. Then it is well accompanied by a heavenly music. The director has done a great job here that enjoys great respect. Nothing can stop me and my family from giving EARTH the highest price. I hope so much that the stuff will make a sequel.
