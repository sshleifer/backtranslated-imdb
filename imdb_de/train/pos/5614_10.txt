It took me a long time to find the title in a special video store in Berlin, and I was lucky enough to find an English version with Dutch subtitles. I think it's one of the best horror movies of all time. It seems strange to me that some people call this movie black comedy. I have to admit, I could not laugh when I saw it for the first time (and it was the second time!). On the one hand Trelkovski seems to be so cute and even cute in his shy demeanor, but on the other hand he beats this boy on the playground and there is no explanation for it. But the strangest thing, of course, is his transformation into Simone Choule and the fact that he does not know who he really is. His hallucinations are the scariest in this movie. Of course, everything is in his head, but is it this apartment that brings this feminine side of him to light, or was it even before he moved in? I think that's an interesting question. His schizophrenic behavior is difficult to understand and it is terrible when his two sides or identities are fighting each other. The result is that he first cuts his hand and later jumps out of his window. But that terrible scream - does that mean that everyone will repeat over and over again ... that his soul is in a cage or something? And these Egyptian hieroglyphs and other Egyptian stuff? The fact that he / she looks like a mummy in the hospital - that is not an incident, but an indication of my point of view.
