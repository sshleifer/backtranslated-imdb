This indie film depicts the life of a group of people doing an adult swimming class in Connecticut. The plot is pretty thin. What drives the movie are the characters, which are played excellently by mostly unknown actors. Outstanding in the cast are Brewster as a high school teacher who has marital problems, and Weixler as a casino dealer who probes as a stripper. The two actresses give natural performances and work well together. This is an impressive feature film debut for the writer Schechter and the director Setton. The latter keeps the narrative moving in a quick clip. The movie title and the poster suggest something slippery, but this is a wonderful little comedy drama.
