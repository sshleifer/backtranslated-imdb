I am a parent of a child with special needs and I really liked the movie! It was lovely, warm and funny. I learned to see the humor in things a long time ago. I particularly liked how all the other characters were worried about Frankie and who would take care of him after his grandmother died. I participated in a focus screening of the film with other parents and siblings of special needs children before the film was cut. Everyone enjoyed the movie and it actually sparked wonderful discussions. We talked about how our kids make us laugh and we also talked about how we care about them. The scriptwriter spoke about how she has been working as a volunteer for several years with autistic children and other children with special needs. She referred the figure to a real person. Our family is blessed with a sense of humor that has guided us through some very stressful times. I give the movie two thumbs up!
