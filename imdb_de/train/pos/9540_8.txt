Most of the feedback I heard about Meatball Machine was pretty mixed. Some even say that they think "it's shit". Well, to the people I say, get some F @ ckin imagination and set yourself up. This was a very entertaining movie. <br /> <br /> The story begins with this mechanical flaw that attacks its hosts and somehow transforms them into those Gwar costumes, Deathbots called Necroborgs. Finally, you learn that these mechanical defects also adhere to you a small parasite that can then control your actions due to the hot wiring of your nervous system. Unfortunately, two love-seeking, lonely young adults cross with the mechanical beetle, and before you know that transformations take place, blood is spurted. Is there a way to stop the conversion? Maybe a way to stop this mechanical threat? Why are the Necroborgs fighting each other? Can the two desperate singles express their feelings for each other and do the evil? Only one way to find out. <br /> <br /> I was a bit suspicious when entering the Meatball Machine because of the mixed reactions, but it turned out to be a big surprise. A few unanswered questions, sometimes an average drama and a slightly confusing end are the only weak points I can imagine. From the anime vibe to the parasites who themselves become little characters, and even the low budgets, this movie hits far more than he misses. With a constantly evolving story that's interesting enough to ask yourself with the cool make-up effects and blood spatters, this is a movie that fans of Bizarro / Horror / Tetsuo / Splatter fans should absolutely try out. 8 out of 10
