This is the best and most original show in years. The more I look at it, the more I fall in love with it. The cast is excellent, the writing is great. I personally like every character. However, there is one favorite character for everyone, as there is a good mix of personalities and backgrounds, as in real life. I think ABC has done a disservice to the writers, actors and potential audiences of this show, to stop so fast and not to advertise enough to give any real chance to attract a fan base. There are so few shows that I look at more because most television is awful. This show was in my opinion top of the list with my favorites Gray's Anatomy and Brothers and Sisters. In fact, I think the same audience for brothers and sisters would love this show if they knew about it. Why is it always the loser show that gets so much extra time and the winner shows with great potential are always dumped immediately. I'm so tired of the reality shows that I do not see any of them. It was so refreshing to have a new idea for a show and then hire excellent actors, this show was so promising. The latest episode was the best ever, because everyone has started to get into the right role to make the show so real. Please watch this show in the ABC video and let ABC know that you want to have this show again. Please sign the online petition at ABC: http://www.PetitionOnline.com/gh1215/petition.html
