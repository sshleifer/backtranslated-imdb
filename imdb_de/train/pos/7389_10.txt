No award ceremony can please all people. If your favorite movies did not win, you'll say the show was not very good. That is understandable. <br /> <br /> However, the 74th Academy Awards will be remembered for a magical moment in Hollywood's history: Woody Allen's first appearance at the Academy Awards. <BR /> <br /> Allen has often avoided prizes as a self-glorifying and meaningless and never participated - though he has won several of the coveted prizes. When the 74th Academy Awards Ceremony took place The nation was still mourning the loss of life in the collapse of the World Trade Center in New York. When it was time to pay tribute to the city of New York, they decided to show a video of the city's great movie moments. Then the speaker simply said, "Ladies and Gentlemen, Oscar-winning director Woody Allen." <br /> <br /> The place broke out in an extremely long ovation. The entertainment industry finally got the Appman from New York, who usually shuns the Hollywood scene. As the applause subsided, Woody applied some of his legendary joke to the situation. <br /> <br /> SOME HIGHLIGHTS: <br /> <br /> "Thank you - that makes up for the streaking." <br /> <br /> "I thought they wanted their Oscars back," joked he. "I panicked because the pawnbroker has been out of business for ages and I had no way to get anything back." <br /> <br /> "But that was not it, I could not do it because my movie I was nominated for nothing this year, then it hit me - maybe they were calling to apologize." Allen did also known why he had missed his lifelong Oscar dislike for that one special night /> <br /> "I would do anything for New York City, so I put on my tuxedo and got down here," Allen said. <br /> <br /> "It's a great, great movie city, it has been a great, moving and exciting backdrop for movies and remains a great, great city." <br /> <br />
