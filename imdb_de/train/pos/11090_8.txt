Successful, self-made, married businessman Harry Mitchell (a great steely performance by Roy Scheider) has an adulteress with young sweet'n'sexy stripper Cini (the gorgeous Kelly Preston). Harry's blackmail by a trio of shabby, unfriendly hoods - the sloppy porn cinema manager Raimy (a gorgeous slimy John Glover), antsy strip co-owner Leo (well played by Robert Trebor) and the crazy pimp Bobby Shy (a terribly intense Clarence Williams III) - who recorded his affair with Cini on video. When Harry refuses to pay, the hoods kill Cini and make it look like Harry did it. This in turn engulfs a dangerous battle between wit and will between Harry and the hoods. Director John Frankenheimer, who took on a tough script based on Elmore Leonardo's brutal crime thriller, expertly demonstrates a steady, fast pace, delivering a thrilling tension and effectively creating a compelling shady atmosphere. The leads are uniquely honored, with outstanding supportive twists from Ann-Margret as Harry's bitterly neglected wife Barbara, Vanity as the brazen prostitute Doreen, and Lonny Chapman as Harry's loyal business partner Jim O'Boyle. The close 'notwisty plan keeps the viewer constantly on the go. The mischievous profane dialogue, the brilliant cinematography of Jost Vacano, the rousing score of Gary Chang, the harsh amoralism and the rousing conclusion are also on the money. As an added bonus, both Vanity and Preston take off. A very strong and satisfying little number worth checking.
