As others have commented, I checked this after Siskel and Ebert listed it as one of the top 10 movies of the year. What a gift. I went to buy it just so I could borrow it. <br /> <br /> Best quote? Dwight Yoakum stops his truck when he realizes that someone (Cage) is on his taxi. As Cage looks down, he apologizes. "I'm sorry if I scared you." Yoakum presses Cage's face with his pistol in the face: "looks like I'm scared?" Great humor after an exciting (and temporary) escape. <br /> <br /> That was really fun. The constant observation of the sign "Welcome to Red Rock" triggers a groan and a smiling shake of the head. The music produced a hunting, uncanny quality reminiscent of the movie Twin Peaks. Unlike Twin Peaks, however, it does not distort things by going too far into the outside world and having to move "up" on their own. <br /> <br /> I admit to see the loans 15 to 20 times. You see, they had Yoakum's "Thousand Miles from Nowhere" (perfectly chosen) play when a freight train drove down to the desert floor. , with snow-capped mountains in the distance. It was an incredible, flowing frame. I've never seen a better standardization of image and sound in the movie. It fits in the story totally.
