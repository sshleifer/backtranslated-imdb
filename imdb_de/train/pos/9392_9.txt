I came home late at night and turned on the TV to see Siskel and Ebert grouping their pick of the week. I have not heard anything about "Red Rock West" except two thumbs up and see before it went away. It would not be long in the cinemas because of the distributor's money problems and lack of advertising, but it was better earned. <br /> <br /> The next afternoon, I followed her advice. You were right, it was one of the biggest fun I ever had in the cinema. As some readers point out, there are some storylines, and the last 10 minutes never seem to end. But it's worth it for the fine craft that went into the first hour. It's the best role I've ever seen for Nicholas Cage, but almost everyone seems to be perfectly manned. Dennis Hopper almost goes over the edge, which becomes stupid, but how well everything else works. The sets and the music contribute to almost every scene. <br /> <br /> When I rented it for my family later, it did not work so well. The long scenes that built the tension in the theater were hard to appreciate and the distractions at home. It deserves your full attention. Turn off the phone, make sure that you are not disturbed. Look at each scene, especially at the beginning.
