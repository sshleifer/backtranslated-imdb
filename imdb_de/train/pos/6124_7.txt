This movie is stupid as hell! I think it was written as a serious movie, but when it was time to film, Michael Cooney said, "Hey, let's put in some humor and spice it up!" The characters are actually a bit developed. Oh, and the death sequences are the best. However, I hate the hair dryer weapons. What was it about?
