This little-loved movie is one of my favorites. I can see it over and over again. Dreyfus and Braga are masterful, but Raul Julia steals the show! A humorous Gomez Addams with funny humor and just the right tone for this irreverent parody of this often told story. <br /> <br /> Moon Over Parador is usually not popular and is not appreciated reality and make the fun on the screen. Two thumbs up!
