Ok, even if you can not stand Liz - this movie is really funny! The scenes with John Gielgud make Liza good again. One of the true romantic comedy classics of the 20th century. Dudley Moore makes drunk and irresponsibly cute and amusing and it's a hell of a lot of fun to look at her. The one-liners are the best.
