If it was a representation of the American serial killer, it seems to be very average. <br /> <br /> A journalist [Duchovny] travels through the country to California to document America's most famous killers - his white trailer garbage mate [Pitt] is himself a serial killer. Rather predictable, this has its moments of action and Pitt and Lewis show their roles well, but I would not care about it again
