This is an excellent movie that is suitable for everyone down to the smallest, though accessibility for younger people (at least in the pamphlet I saw) was adversely affected by an unfortunate English subtitle choice! For most of the film, it's almost impossible to guess at what time it will be set - no modern technology is shown, not even the ubiquitous Chinese bike, just a bleak, almost monochromatic everyday that faces the glare of the Sezuan. Opera and festive fireworks. Even if a group of soldiers refer to their imminent departure for a theater of war, this could still be the case in the last 150 years. <br /> <br /> But then we'll briefly see a car - late 30s, early 40s style - and we realize that we are watching a China facing big upheavals and that much of the world we see in which catastrophe of World War II and the communist revolution will disappear <br /> This makes the wish of the central figure, to keep old customs and customs, all the harder. <br /> <br /> But the film also raises questions that are still crucial today, both in China and in other countries, parts of the world: inequality between boys and girls, men and women; trade for various purposes with young children; Corruption in society; Injustice; the importance of friendship. <br /> <br /> Maybe I read too much in this movie. but I do not think so! I also think that it is a scandal that films of this caliber are often not shown in the UK, while slag is issued as quality material. <br /> <br /> But do not let me start. ,
