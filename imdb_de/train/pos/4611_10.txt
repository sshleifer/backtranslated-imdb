Version: Universal / Hong Kong Legends R4 DVD Release. Cantonese / English Subtitles <br /> <br /> Five years ago the world was obsessed with "The Matrix" and I was perhaps one of the few fifteen year olds who still believed in "Terminator". was better than "matrix". I was just a simple teenager in search of a good action movie, and then a TV station I'd never really seen seemed to have a light, a small station known as SBS. One night I noticed in the TV magazine that later a movie with Jackie Chan - "Police Story" would appear. I was fifteen and only saw Rumble in the Bronx and Rush Hour. I said ... "WOW AWESOME," sat down to look at it, and called "WOW AWESOME" all the way through the movie. Two weeks later, after SBS showed the "Police Story" trilogy, I knew I'd found my new favorite actor. Jackie plays Chan Ka Kui, a Hong Kong police officer who collapses a major drug agent, Chu (Yuen Choir). Chu's secretary Selina Fong (Brigitte Lin) is being held by police as a witness against Chu, and Chan is being assigned to protect her. Things get bad - Reaaaal bad - when Chu's case is turned down and he decides he wants to see Fong and Chan dead. <br /> <br /> 'Police Story' is one of the best action movies of all time and certainly one of my favorite Jackie Chan films. It starts off strong and ends with one of the most incredible action sequences ever made. Everything in between is great. However, some of the funny parts appear a bit tasteless for more than a few people ... <br /> <br /> As a story, this is still one of Jackie's better efforts. For an action movie, the story is pretty good, and Jackie is a much better actor in this film than in the theatrical and plot-intensive "New Police Story." This is not "miracle", but maybe that's a good thing. <br /> <br /> "Police Story" is one of Jackie's best works. It got me hooked on Jackie Chan movies and should give potential Jackie fans a good start. The bad news for anyone who sees this first is that Jackie Chan movies are not much better - 10/10
