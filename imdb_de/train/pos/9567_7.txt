I watched the DVD of this movie, which also contains an excellent commentary. In Cambodia it seems (in the English subtitles the character speaks Thai, but in the film it says in Cambodia.). He sends Pang to kill some people in China, and during the killings, a cop's partner is killed. Policeman Wai is a loose cannon worried about his father, who is also a police officer who was shot and comatose. Wais boss is his father's friend and worries about Wai's unpredictable behavior. He does not know that Wai was the one who caught his father in dealing with drug dealers and shot him and put him in a coma. Pang escapes and hides in a filthy dump where he meets a woman who has come to find her mother and repeats that her father does not let her go (Pang does not speak Chinese and does not understand it, but rescues her in front of her.) Father, apparently having sex with her, may be the reason for Cat III). Wai is becoming obsessed with Pang, but Pang is almost unstoppable. Even after Pang steals a boat and takes the woman to his house, where they are married and she becomes pregnant, Wai follows the evil man (who trains the boys) and closes a fight so he can get Pang. There is a big showdown between Wai and Pang. The terribly abused woman, the main victim, left Wai dead and Pang cut off his child from the dead mother just to die, and let him be the murderer of the next possible boy. This movie is beautifully photographed with an excellent soundtrack. There are many very brutal violent scenes. The woman had pulled a long nail from her foot. Knife on neck and torso. Pistols fired directly on the head. And some very heavy blows. It may be grim intense and run down, but it is definitely worth seeing.
