I enjoyed Albert Pyun's "Nemesis" for its cheesy action and semi-intricate writing. Many people complain about the "confusing" conspiracy of the first movie, which is why "Nemesis 2: Nebula" probably has such a stupid plush appearance with the same super action to enforce it. > This is the name of the movie's first hero, Alex, a cramped superwoman sent to the past to save the future. She is raised by a tribe in Africa. A good part of the film has only African-language dialogues without subtitles, which I liked because it seemed like it was a little bit authentic (how often do movies in the genre really try to do that?). It does not take long for the evil cyborgs to travel back in time to find them and try to kill them. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, this is a crap the first one was something great). There are subplots that include the political unrest in Africa, the treasure hunt and the fight against tribes. The picture is very small in the brain, so that none of these things gets a very good treatment. The picture is basically a lengthy fight with some car chases, referring to muscle babe vs. Refer to cyborg. It has its entertainment value, just do not expect any quality or something from the first movie.
