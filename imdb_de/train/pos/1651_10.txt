I watched the presentation on PBS in the US when it aired in 1988 (?). Assuming the miniseries were available on DVD, I bought the first editions of all three books last year. Since then, I have been looking for the series on Internet movie sites. Today I found this website. I will give up the search. <br /> <br /> I also want to buy this complete - 26 episodes - mini-series. After I bought the DVDs, I read each book and then looked at the consequences for this book. That's what I did with the Karla Trilogy by John LeCarre and the Ranger Trilogy by Larry McMurty in Texas. <br /> <br /> Does anyone have suggestions for great books or book series that have become very good TV mini-series - or film series? available on DVD?
