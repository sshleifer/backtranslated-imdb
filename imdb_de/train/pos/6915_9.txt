Textbook example of an underrated movie. <br /> <br /> Although you can watch this movie again and again and laugh everytime and still see something new in it, it is still considered another fun picture. And although the film has inspired many and added its quotes and images to the Pychee of all viewers, Moon Over Parador still has not received the recognition it should have. Even the brilliant cast of Academy Award winner Richard Dreyfuss and Raul Julia, to name just one, can not change that perception. If you refuse in a meat beater by reading him a good review of a part that he once played, he can only come to one conclusion: This stuff is timeless! In fifty years we will have the proof.
