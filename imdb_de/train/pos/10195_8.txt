Joe Don Baker is one of the few actors who are often better than his material and almost always undervalued. He was either heavy or heroic in a lot of films and has the kind of strong, solid presence Wallace Beery did half a century before him. Baker can provide material that would sound ridiculous to another actor, and that's what's so great about him. He really does seem to mean what he says, no matter how obvious or stupid stereotypes are, putting him in a league with Tommy Lee Jones, Oliver Reed and Don Stroud. That's what the WALKING TALL trilogy worked so well, and the same magic can be found in FINAL JUSTICE. This was a notable success in theaters and on video in the '80s and is much older than many of the perhaps better-known action films of that era. If you move the action from Texas to Europe, there is a truly timeless quality that will not distract you from the action on screen. To be honest, I have always enjoyed the films of Greydon Clark, who is a no-nonsense director in the same vein as the 1970s Clint Eastwood. FINAL JUSTICE is one of the lost gems of the late '80s, much like MAN ON FIRE in its true mildness and violence. I think if they do that again with The Rock, a whole new audience will love it as much as I do.
