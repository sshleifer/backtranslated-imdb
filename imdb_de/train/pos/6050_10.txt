Last but not least! A decent British comedy that is not about some bank robbers or a television series. John Ivay's film is a psychoactive discovery story in biker gear. The three protagonists are gentle fools with a propensity for failure and everyone at a turning point in their lives, resulting in a sensitive, emotional trio of negotiations to stitch together the seditious comedy. The chemistry between the three Amigos is palpable and provides a touching society with funny dialogues and some classic comedic moments. It feels part of Withnail and I, part of American Werewolf in London, and part of Quadraphenia (but only because of the bicycle gangs and Phil Daniels). In fact, the lovable villain of Phil Daniels reminds you of Danny, the dealer of Withnail and me, with his scientific approach and his scientific commitment to drugs. This is a great movie, especially for those who have dealt with psychoactive substances in the past and will refer to many moments in the movie. A personal favorite is the ingenious scene in the Welsh corner shop, which buys munchies as they stumble upon mushrooms. This gentle comedy warms the cockles of your heart and makes you laugh aloud. And you do not have to ride a bike or even like it to enjoy it. But it will help if you do it. Brilliant.
