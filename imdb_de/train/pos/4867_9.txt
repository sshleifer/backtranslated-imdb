Ignore the plot and enjoy Fred Astaire on a Foggy Day and some other dances, one with a hapless Joan Fontaine. Here we see how Astaire essentially performs "stage dances" in a purer form than in his films with Ginger Rogers and before he has learned to fully exploit the film's potential. Best of all, the fact that we saw Burns and Allen as husband and wife before their radio / TV comedy careers, doing the kind of dance they must have done in vaudeville, and in their Paramount College films 30s had no chance. (George used to be a tap dance teacher). Her two numbers with Fred are highlights of the movie and it's well worth the wait. The first soft-shoe trio is a warm-up for the exciting carnival number "Chin up", in which the three sing and dance through the rides and other attractions. It seems almost spontaneous. Fans of Fred Astaire and Burns & Allen will find it worth while claiming to be a "conspiracy". I've seen it four or five times and find the fast-forward button helpful.
