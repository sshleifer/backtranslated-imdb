For those who consider Lady May Witty as the kind, slightly batty old lady from Hitchcock's The Lady Vanishes, this movie requires an adaptation. Here she is anything but friendly or angry. Instead, her son George Macready is the craziest. Do not give him a knife, otherwise his eyes will shine and no furniture cushion in the house is safe. Now we know what he's up to for the trapped Nina Foch, if he can come out under Mother's domineering hand. <br /> <br /> Really tight, little woman-in-hazard movie that keeps the tension in the air. The script never deviates from Foch's dilemma. She was imprisoned in a large old gothic house on the edge of a furious sea. They will kill her, but why. Your situation does not make sense. The tension increases as she tries to escape after another, but strangers also seem to be against her. We begin to feel her helplessness and increasing paranoia as the world turns away from her. Director Joseph H. Lewis took this film a big step towards cult status and understandably. Then you will also see how Foch subtly walks through a series of emotions without even going beyond it. Funny as a really intimidating matriarch, who knows what she wants and how to get it when she can just keep her crazy son in line. My only reservation is the climax that seems too cumbersome given the timing of events. Still, it's a good, nerve-wracking way to spend a little over an hour in the Columbia studios.
