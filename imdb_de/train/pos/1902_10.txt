Let's start with the title song sung by Christopher Cross. The song is "When you get caught between the moon and New York City." It's a great topic and song, even after all these years, it never gets tiring. It's really a great song about New York City. Anyway, the big Dudley Moore CBE plays as a spoiled, drunken millionaire, who is engaged in the movie with Jill Eikenberry's character. Jill was later to play LA Law. In any case, he is served by his wonderful British butler, Sir John Gielgud OM, who won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. Arthur falls in love with Liza Minnelli's character, who is perfect in this film alongside her appearance in her Oscar-winning role in Cabaret. No, Liza is not allowed to sing. She plays a restaurant waitress. In any case, I love Geraldine Fitzgerald as a Bach matriarch of the family who decides on the family's assets. Anyway, she is fabulous and would have even received an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress. Barney Martin, known as Jerry's father on Seinfeld, plays Liza's father. He is great too. The film was well written, played and delivered to the audience who wanted more of it.
