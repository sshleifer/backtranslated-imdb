An excellent second part that is as good as the first one. <br /> <br /> Once again the casting is just wonderful. I like that the first and second episodes have nothing in common except wit and wisdom. <br /> <br /> The second episode is just very funny, very stupid and very enjoyable. It's the very first Christmas episode about a woman disguised as Santa by a serial killer after she has killed her own husband. Just as in the first episode; Karma. <br /> <br /> The most humorous scene is a connection between the murder of her husband and her phone call, initially faking her fear until she becomes reality.
