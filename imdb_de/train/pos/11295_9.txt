This film has always been a favorite of mine since it was first seen as a 12-year-old boy in 1962, when it was screened on Los Angeles television's "Late Show." The characters are intriguing right from the beginning, and it's too bad the film was never released for videotape or shown on television (apparently due to a ban on the legacy of Moss Hart, the playwright) / producer / director who wrote the story and presented them on the New York stage during World War II - the reason they were rejected is hard to fathom more than 50 years after they were written). I have not seen the movie in over 30 years, when someone who was actually a lead actor of the movie could get me a "bootlegged" copy on VHS (poor video quality but good audio). My memory was right: it was still a fascinating and fascinating film. An amazing aspect of this film is, like many of its stars who just started their career in 1944, either big movie stars or at least well-known and fully-employed actors (eg Judy Holliday) were Edmond O'Brien, Jeanne Crain, Barry Nelson Don Taylor, Karl Malden, Peter Lind Hayes, George "Superman" Reeves, Red Buttons, Lee J. Cobb, Kevin McCarthy and Gary Merrill). The scenes with the B-24 Liberators are terrific, especially the close-ups, in which the details of the huge (at that time) 4-piece bomber (then more than 18,000 made, now almost extinct) can be seen. Good insights into the different training levels that a pilot cadet had completed on his way to a bomber crew (of course, very gender specific, as was the trend of the day: only the MEN became pilots, the women only supported them in their roles - in hardly acceptable in today's world) I hope it will be released on video one day for a new generation to enjoy.
