Whenever I hear a movie being touted for having no sex, violence, bad language, special effects, etc., my b.s. Detector goes off. Usually, such a movie is a sentimental hogwash that insults people who do not want to surprise, but confirms how superior they are to us humans. When David Lynch's THE STRAIGHT STORY started receiving these reviews, I was worried, especially since I was not a fan of his other "uplifting" story, THE ELEPHANT MAN. With all the stunning imagery and good acting in this film, we seemed more interested than preaching rather than inspiring. <br /> <br /> I should not have worried. THE STRAIGHT STORY is an honest movie and not a sweetie. This is largely due to the fact that Lynch and the authors John Roach and Mary Sweeney say it for the most part clearly and simply. There are a few straight homilies I could have done without, and the crops of crops being harvested are repeated a bit too often, but these are just minor things. There is no hard message, no sentimental strings that arouse our emotions, and no condescension towards us and their characters. Instead, they rely on history to build their own power, and so it's the last scene we're really moved in. <br /> <br /> Of course, Richard Farnsworth's casting helps to make the part more realistic. He's really someone who looks like he's been through a lot, but he's still persistent, and apart from those sermons, the desire to be with his brother again does not seem too sentimental, because here you can feel that someone has lived long and seen too much to be driven by anger for a long time. And he knows that his time is running out, and he wants to create some peace not only with his brother, but also with his life. Sissy Spacek also does good, unmanned work as a straight daughter. And though I'm a city and suburban boy, the scenery of Iowa and Wisconsin has shot beautifully, which at least one day wants to visit me.
