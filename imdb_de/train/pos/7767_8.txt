Stack should have received the Academy Award for this performance. It's a crime he did not do. Amazing how humanized a rich, worthless character. <br /> <br /> Dorothy Malone has received a well deserved Oscar for her performance. In fact, all the acting in this film is excellent. <br /> <br /> The action begins with a taxi ride, then by plane and then on an emotional journey that will arouse your interest throughout. They are entertained! <br /> <br /> But this is just a blatant soap opera. One-dimensional, 100-percent Soaper. You could call it the Ultimate Soapier because the drama triumphs so thoroughly about the material. Excellent traded, purposeful, but rigorous within the soap genre. I would not even call it a melodrama (like "Mildred Pierce" or "Imitation of Life"). Although the great entertainment value of this film is not denied, you can only imagine what this talented cast and the director could have achieved with a larger content.
