This is without doubt the biggest movie ever made. It is almost incomprehensible, even if you look at it many times to find out what exactly happens. The film has been almost completely improvised and contains random music numbers, commercials, contests that can be emailed, and a host of other enhancements. By the way, what other films are there from Martin Luther King, Jr.? To decipher the movie, chase the director's book titled I Was Curious. Everything will be clear. It's a great and courageous experiment in improvised recursive filmmaking. A triumph. Now if only someone would output a version with subtitles in a color other than * white, the white subtitles tend to wash out and become invisible.
