I lived in this time, and I think the program has seized the heart of the era. I think it should have been more about the Afro-American issue, but I think there is a lot in the program. It was frightening to see the rebellions on T V and to hope that they would not go as far as the homes of their families and that it would not burn down. I thought Jerry O'Connell did a great job showing a veterinarian from the war. I went to school with boys who came back. Some had changed more than others, others not so much. It bothers me when someone comments that a problem has not been adequately addressed or that it has not been entertaining enough. Live through and then make comments. I thought the movie was great and that everyone involved did a remarkable job. Thank you for a journey (sad and good) into the past.
