I just completed the movie for the seventh or eighth time, watched it a blockbuster the night before and was totally thrilled, I've shown it to 4 people so far and they enjoyed it too. This independent film by Paul F. Ryan has avoided Hollywood glamor, special effects and the stress factor "shock factor" to get to the bottom of the aftermath of traumatic situations. The two characters Alicia (Busy Philipps) and Deanna (Erika Christensen) form an unusual connection after a high school shoot. Alicia, the girl with the stone heart, the Goth, who has a pessimistic attitude to life, helps Deanna overcome the problems of life and death and life in consequence. In the meantime, Deanna tries to help Alicia regain some softness and light in the world. It's not the shocking event of filming but the interpersonal relationships between the survivors that highlights the film. Despite its low budget and short shooting time, this film is anything but cheesy. Ryan pays attention to a situation he has never experienced before and tries to plunge into the human psyche. With an amazing, up-and-coming actress, Philip adds the necessary drama to the dialogue and overall feel for the film, and Christensen helps offset the "Doom and Troom" feeling in this film. All in all, I recommend this film and if you love the subject of school aggression and violence and want to know more, I also suggest the 2004 CBC's "It's a Girls World" documentary, which deals with social bullying. Comparison and comparison of two groups of girls in Montreal, Quebec and the other in Victoria, British Columbia, the group of friends and acquaintances of Dawn Marie Wellesley, a 14-year-old girl who committed brutal bullying.
