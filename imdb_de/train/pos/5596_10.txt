"The Tenant" is the biggest movie by Roman Polanski IMO. And I love "Chinatown", but this one is a lot more original and unconventional and downright scary. It's also a great black comedy. Some people I've shown that this movie was * disturbed * after that, be warned, it affects some people like this. Polanski does a great job playing and directing The Tenant.
