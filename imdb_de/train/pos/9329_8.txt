I have seen The Perfect Son about three times. I can not see how this movie is a gay movie, I'm not even gay, but I do not see it as a gay movie. It is a movie with a gay character. I can not understand why any movie with a gay character should be a pure movie about gays. I think the film is sympathetic to the study of death, the death of a person who is your relative. I think Theo turns his life around rehab relatively quickly because he wants to see his brother die before he dies, causing him to reevaluate his life. I found the dialogue in the scene when Theo tells Ryan that he will be a very moving father. Ryan says that he does not want to know what he will never see or share with anyone. Is not that terrible and sad? I highly recommend the movie.
