Harem Suare is the best movie I saw in 2000. Bravo Ferzan Ozpetek. Harem Suare, a sensually shot and amazingly illustrated movie, is a bold movie that tackles the interracial romance, one such taboo in Hollywood. Women of all sizes, shapes and colors populate the movie. Cut off from the outside world, the women talk by telling stories about intrigue, rivalry and jealousy within their ranks.
