This is a musical adaptation of Dicken "Oliver Twist". The original story was largely retained, although certain subplots (such as the summer he spent the rest of his life and his half-brother) were omitted from the flow of the film. The biggest difference in the movie and in the story is that Fagin is hung up at the end of the book - an ending that is very different from this musical film. <br /> <br /> This is a unique musical - one whose style and scope were not adjusted before or after. The songs are not only often singable and memorable, but also the choreography of the film is a sight. While in most musicals a few, or even a small group, are choreographed in a dance, it is often hundreds or perhaps more. It's really a sight I've seen, and I was lucky enough to have seen it in the theater when it debuted, and it's one of my earliest childhood memories. After seeing him again a few moments ago, I had to say that over time the movie got better and better. Great sets, wonderful drama and singing - this is a special treat that is hard to love. <br /> <br /> When I saw the movie again tonight, I was surprised how tall and female Mark Lester was singing for the movie. According to IMDb, his vocals were dubbed by a girl and this would definitely be responsible for his voice.
