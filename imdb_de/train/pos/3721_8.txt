This was one of the best war movies I've ever seen because it focuses more on the characters than the actual war. All actors do a great job, and since most of them are relatively unknown, everything seems more credible. The camera material is great, as well as the tempo and the editing. This movie will really appeal to you and cause the audience to take care of the characters.
