Miike makes an adventure movie for children, similar to the never ending story. It's actually one of the director's least favorite films. Even the worst Miike is better than a whole bunch of movies, and The Great Yokai War has a lot to recommend, which is recommended. It is at least as loud and disgusting as most American children's films. I think maybe children would enjoy it themselves (the DVD contains an English dub), but like all Miike films, it can be very slow moving. This means that you have a strange bump, where sometimes a loud action sequence occurs and the next scene moves forever when the characters are talking. The story itself is not very good either, and Miike's constant mistake of incoherence picks up his ugly head. Most of what I liked came from the technical side. This must be Miike's most expensive movie and looks awesome. "Yokai" are Japanese spirits, in different fantastic shapes. The costume designers, the special effects crew, and everyone else involved in the designs did a great job. I've seen the movie from 1968 on which this film is supposedly based (Yokai Monsters: Spook Warfare), and the cheesy monsters that can be found there have been transformed into more believable creatures with state-of-the-art makeup and specials. I especially liked the look of one of the bad guys (or girls in this case), Agi, who wears a dark eye shadow, a tight white outfit, a white hive hairstyle, and a whip. Incidentally, it was played by Chiaki Kuriyama, whom you may remember as Lucy Liu's teenage girl in Kill Bill: Vol. 1. The film's hero is played by Ryunosuke Kamiki, who cast votes for Miyazaki's Spirited Away and Howl's Moving Castle Provided.
