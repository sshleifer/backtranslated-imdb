Absolutely stunning, warmth for the head and the heart. This kind of western filmmaker is too hectic, too frenetic, to even be tempted. My kids looked at it and they loved it too. What real people - shows you that cultural differences (the Japanese background) are less important than the similarities between people. Look at it, whether you like to dance or not.
