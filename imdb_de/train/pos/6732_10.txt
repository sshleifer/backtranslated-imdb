This was the best documentary I have ever seen !! I just saw Lords of Dogtown and wanted to know more about Stacy Peralta. I was surprised and glad that this was also one of his films. Great job Stacy! I retired at work last week, was bored, and this movie came out. When I grew up in Orange County in the 1980s, I surfed on the local beaches and my dad surfed when he was a teenager. I grew up on the beach, my parents took me every weekend, I surfed, boogeyboardete and moved up from there. This movie just fascinated me. It was long before my time, but it was great to see what these guys went through ... TRUE PIONEERS! This movie is a collector's item.
