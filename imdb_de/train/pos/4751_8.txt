I have no idea why this streak of so many IMDb users got so bad (some say it's his "worst movie." What have you never seen before?) Cradle 2 The Grave? that the plot is totally stupid and just an excuse to hang all the action sequences. Moron! What do you expect from a Jet Li movie? Did you really believe that someone came up with the story and then charged it with action? Of course not! Black Mask is a great action that spans almost the entire runtime. It's also deliciously cruel and we get many severed limbs, beheadings, and creative ways to see the bad guys (and some innocent people too!) Slaughter them. Most of Li's other martial arts films are kindergarten when compared to Black Mask. There is no holding back on the unfounded acts of violence, bloodshed or actions! And that made me a happy camper. Again, if you go into a Jet Li movie and expect great dialogue and a mesmerizing storyline, you're going for the wrong reasons. Black Mask is probably my favorite of his films (beware of the dreadful dubbing).
