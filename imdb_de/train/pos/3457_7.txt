This is Columbo, led by Steven Spielberg early in his career. It's nothing exciting, but there are some little hints for Spielberg in this movie. The film is essentially in the same style as most of Spierlberg's films and TV work from the 1970s. So that means some characters are rather bizarre and no, I'm not just talking about the Columbo character alone. The kind of characters you might see best in the 1975 Spielberg movie "Jaws". But apart from a few small references to typical early Spielberg elements, this movie can not be described as the work of a rising director-star. That's not bad, of course not, but as I said, it's not too sensational either. <br /> <br /> This movie started off really well and very promising, but after the opening, as always, the murder was done, the movie slowed down and became boring. Boring, because it's mostly a Columbo movie after the book that does not have any memorable moments in it, not boring because it's a boring movie. <br /> <br /> The murder itself was pretty ingenious and the concept of having a crime writer who murdered his writing partner showed great and interesting potential. However, history has not exploited all possibilities. At least that's the feeling this movie left me. <br /> <br /> The film was still a good movie, thanks to the character of Jack Cassidy, who is cleverer than Columbo because of his secret / crime writing experience and tries to give him all sorts of clues that lead away from him. But Columbo knows better of course and he is his biggest suspect from the first moment, but he plays the game as usual. <br /> <br /> The film has a good overall style and uses some good camera editing. It's funny to see that most of it largely coincided with Spielberg's later work, especially with some camera angles. <br /> <br /> A fine and perfectly observable Columbo movie, but do not miss the name of Spielberg. So your expectations get too high. <br /> <br /> 7/10
