Have fun. I went with 8 friends to a preview of the movie. We came to see each other, but after 10 minutes we wondered what the hell we had in that time, the jokes became funny and they remained funny throughout the movie. In the first part, you keep asking yourself about this Malinski and Bellini stuff (there are many more examples of this language), and because they keep repeating the same jokes (with different twists), they become funnier and funnier. In search of this Malinski all main characters are introduced, the first is even crazier than the other. Half way through the movie, we did not even know what the movie was called because there was no opening credits and we went to this little insight, but we had a good time. The house was loaded (about 250 people) and I think half of them did not like it and the other half loved the movie. If you like weird funny movies with great dialogues, you will love them. Apart from Clooney This movie deserves a much better rating than the 5.6 IMDB rating I wrote at this time, but if more people have seen it, I'm sure it will go up. 7.0 is reasonable, I think I would give an 8 out of 10. (10 out of 10 after a few beers) <br /> <br />
