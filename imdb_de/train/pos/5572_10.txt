This movie was hysterical. I have not laughed so much for a long time. I mean, it's not "Good Will Hunting", but should it be? I actually went into the advanced screening, expected much less and was pleasantly surprised. The comedy hits hard and is pretty consistent. Amanda Peet is hot and horny. The entire audience with whom I introduced it seemed to enjoy the movie as much as I did.
