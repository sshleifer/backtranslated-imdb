I have to be honest and say that I have not seen many independent films, but I thought this movie was done very well. The direction and the cinematography worked without distraction. The angles, settings and lighting used successfully created the nightmarish world in which the main character was trapped. Many haunting and memorable images from the movie stay with you long after his mind (always a mark of a good director).
