Full House is a great family show. After watching a few episodes over and over again, I realized that they are incredibly boring and seem to protect themselves from the outside world. Yes, there is a lot of comedy, but sometimes it is unbelievably cheesy. It's not that I hate it, but do not keep watching because they're getting old fast. Probably the best season is the first. <br /> <br /> Full House is about widower Danny Tanner (Bob Saget) and his three daughters D.J. (Candace Cameron) Stephanie (Jodie Sweetin) and Michelle (Mary-Kate and Ashley). When Danny's wife dies, he needs help. So his best friend Joey (Dave Coulier) and Uncle Jesse (John Stamos) pull in the girls. If they live together, they can no longer live without each other. <br /> <br /> Full House reminds you how important family is and that you can always go back home.
