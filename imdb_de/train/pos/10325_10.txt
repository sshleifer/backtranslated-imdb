I was educated by Doc Savage and was petrified by the green death as a child, but even then, as now, I found it extremely entertaining Certainly, they usually think I'm strange, but there you are. "I do not know what the Doc but he always gets the girls "must be the ultimate line when looking at his sad group of men. This movie is a classic parody of the entire superhero genre and was long before it's time to take it seriously, to go over Austin Powers. Ron Ely is a god. It is unfortunate that this film was not released on DVD in the UK. I do not think it should be redone and bastardized, as I said, it's a classic, it can not be done without Ron (like the Italian job without Mini's and Michael Caine). I give 10/10.
