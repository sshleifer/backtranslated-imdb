A witty and insightful perspective of the dating world is portrayed in this off-beat comedy by first author and director Peter M. Cohen. The story unfolds as the four male protagonists meet weekly at the local diner to discuss their dating issues. We meet Brad: a good-looking Playboy on Wall Street, with a quick joke and a sharp tongue; Zeek: a cynical, sensitive writer; Jonathan: a sexually baffled nice guy with an affinity for hand creams and masturbation; and Eric: the married man who appreciates his weekly encounters with his single friends, hoping for some explanation about his boring and mundane married life. The trials and tribulations of New York men's individual life are amused, mirroring Sex in the City and HBO's new comedy, The Mind of Married Man, and blaming fraud. The story takes a turn when the three singletons hit Mia - wittily played by Amanda Peet - and all fall for them. She seduces her with her uncanny ability to adapt to the personalities that show her. When they realize that they all met the same woman and fell in love with her, they chose her through her friendship. Whipped is a realistic representation of the dating world that the critic did not recognize. In plain text, they missed the point. The protagonists are caricatures of real people. The hyperbole is hysterical, mingles satire and humility and should not be taken as seriously as the critic's demeanor suggests. Watch this movie, you will laugh from start to finish.
