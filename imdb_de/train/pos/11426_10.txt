I think this movie would be more enjoyable if everyone considered it as a picture of colonial Africa in the '50s and' 60s, rather than history. Because there is no real story here. Just a vignette on top of each other like small dots of light that do not mean much if you do not have enough to paint a picture. When I saw Chocolat for the first time, I did not really understand it until I thought about it for a couple of days. Then I realized that there were many things to "get" including the end of colonialism, but that was just around the corner, just no conspiracy. Anyway, it's one of my favorite movies of all time. The scene at the airport with the short shower and the beautiful music was pure poetry. If you like "exciting" movies, do not look at it - you'll be bored to tears. But for some of you, you can thank me later for recommending it to you.
