Spirit is a unique and original view of Western life from the perspective of a wild horse and Native American. The film focuses on the friendships and dangers that a wild horse, Spirit, encountered during his life and realism. <br /> <br /> The music is fantastic, with songs by Bryan Adams and music by Hans Zimmer, who was also responsible for the extremely popular music of the 1994 Disney hit, The Lion King. > <br /> The story is not very deep, but the fact that it is not as profound as some movies does not affect the movie as a whole. <br /> <br /> An excellent movie that I really enjoyed and that is suitable for the whole family. Not to be missed. (10/10)
