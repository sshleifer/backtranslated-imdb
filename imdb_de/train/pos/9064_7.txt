I was sitting with my kids when we saw this movie. We all found it very entertaining. <br /> <br /> When Billy goes to a new school, a fifth class bully starts with him and that causes worms to eat. <br /> <br /> A bet is made and Billy has just enough time to eat 10 worms or else. At this point, the tyrant and his friends are trying to find evil ways to cook, fry or bake the worms to try to make Billy ill and lose the bet. <br /> <br /> Billy stays strong and eats his way to become more popular, even from the bullies friends. <br /> <br /> I will not tell you if he wins the bet or not ... you just have to watch to find out but I think if you like good family movies you will like this one. <br /> <br /> PS I would like to add that this movie is not just for boys, I have all daughters and they really liked it a lot.
