Very good to the end, which was a big disappointment. <br /> <br /> The script was very good, as well as the acting. The visuals were often grainy, but this contributed to the film in some ways, as the snow-covered traits were in good spots, which helped create a mood for the movie. This affect was ruined by the incredibly incredible ending. <br /> <br /> I wanted to give this movie 8 out of 10 points, but the ending took him one point to 7 because he seemed to radically depart from the first 75 minutes of the movie and seemed pretty much forced into the film end so the filmmakers look smart. <br /> <br /> However, this movie was much better than movies with much bigger budgets and seemed to be filmed like a home movie with extra equipment. Not much on special effects like this, but it was very good for suspense.
