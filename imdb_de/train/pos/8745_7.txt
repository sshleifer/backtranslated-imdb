After graduation, the best friends Alice and Darlene decide to travel to Thailand. While they are there, they meet a charming Australian named Nick. After spending some time with Nick, he asks her if they want to take him on a weekend trip to Hong Kong. They agree. At the airport, however, they are detained for drug smuggling and then sentenced to 33 years in a Thai jail for something they allegedly did not do. Not really knowing what to do, ending up contacting Yankee Hank, an American lawyer who lives in Thailand with his wife. It means that if you have the money, he can help you. Things are starting well, but they still can not come out. <br /> <br /> The movie is really good because it does not reveal everything that is going to happen, and it's interesting all the time. I could not believe the end. It was one of those endings where you do not know the 100% truth, but you still know what really happened with Nick and the drug smuggling because it's "possession", etc. Danes and Kate Beckinsale are doing pretty well here good performance. The performance of Beckinsales, however, was a bit weak. The friendship between Danes and Beckinsales is good, but could seem stronger. Paul Walker even has a small role here, which is not in the credits. ;) <br /> <br /> I found Brokedown Palace anyway for a good movie and I give it 7/10.
