One of the more sensitive comedies for Hindi movie screens. A remake of Priyadarshan's 80s Malayalam hit Boeing Boeing, which in turn was a remake of the eponymous hollywoon hit of the 1960s, proving he's one of the best superstars in Hindi cinema to do comedy. He has a good relationship with the new play John Abraham. However, John still remains in Akshay's shadow and does not manage to take this opportunity. <br /> <br /> The new women are cute and live up to their roles. <br /> <br /> A must is the comedy. Leave your brain and laugh for 2 hours !!!! After all, laughter is the best medicine! Ask Priyadarshan and Akshay Kumar !!!!!
