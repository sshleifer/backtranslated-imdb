Fay Grim is a true example of a so-called puzzle movie. It has all the elements of acting, directing, acting and entertaining. They all fit together to create a masterpiece, Fay Grim. <br /> <br /> This film follows a single mother Fay Grim who tries to raise her son so as not to become her father, who fled the law and was missing. Soon, the CIA contacts Fay, desperately searching for 8 of her husband Henry's magazines. These magazines were full of confessions of his long history in the CIA and its involvement in countries and their governmental activities. Fay is sent to find these magazines to free her brother from prison, and he is sent on a cat and mouse hunt across Europe to retrieve these magazines and learn about the hidden secrets of their husbands, of whom she never knew. <br /> <br /> Parker Posey was already an actress I liked after seeing her in Ohio and Best in Show in Ohio. She brought liveliness to her two comedic roles, but Fay Grim played a different role than the other two films. Posey made me believe what was happening on the screen, I felt for her, I was rooting for her and wanted to know more. She grabs you while she's on screen, and when she's out, you can not stop thinking about what's happening to her. <br /> <br /> I have not seen any other previous works of writer / director Hal Hartley I think I'll look at some of his previous films when they're half as good as Fay Grim. <br /> <br /> Next time you decide to make an intelligent movie, if you decide to buy a movie or buy a DVD I would strongly recommend choosing Fay Grim. If you have common sense of what a movie should be, you will enjoy this movie very much.
