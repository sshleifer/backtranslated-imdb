I can not really condemn the movie because it works. There are enough Noir elements to consider it a Noir movie, but I think it's just in the category. <br /> <br /> There is nothing sinister in this piece, and here the Noir elements fail. Sure, the disease can be considered scary, but I find it hard to see. The film points to a darker side: Blackie could engage in human trafficking, the New Orleans police are only too willing to arrest a reporter, the ghost of the plague hangs over all the people in the movie ... but that's just the clues. <br /> <br /> There is no attempt to question Reed's motivation, as is the case with Marlowe or Spade, and there is no attempt to bring a human side to Blackie, which makes him even more contemptible would make if human trafficking was actually pitted. <br /> <br /> This lack of depth is what ultimately ends the movie. <br /> <br /> The story is decent, acting is good, writing and directing are well done ... but there's nothing that makes this film into a movie to return to again and again. It's worth taking a look, maybe twice, if you do not remember that years ago, and then throw it away.
