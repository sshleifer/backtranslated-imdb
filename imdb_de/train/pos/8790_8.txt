Hilarious movie. I watched this movie in 2002 at the Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras Film Festival in Sydney and laughed from start to finish. The acting was subtle, but very funny. I'm not sure about the influence of "The Real World", we do not get it here, but the movie can not stand for the show without understanding it. Heather B steals every scene she appears, especially when she plays with her rarely talkative red co-star. Highly recommended. I would very much like to see it released on video / DVD in the future.
