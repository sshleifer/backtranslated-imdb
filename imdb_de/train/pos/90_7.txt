Yes, the poster is a pretty awful piece. <br /> <br /> I thought the movie was alright ... nothing really outstanding ... I was just hoping it would be a hardcore drugstore and throw away all its garbage. <br /> <br /> Ahh, but that can not happen to rich kids right now, right? Not for the son of a wealthy businessman who organizes big ballroom parties and has a nice manicured lawn at the front of the mini-villa. <br /> <br /> No ... the child is too good to ruin his life completely. Who will drive the brand new SUV and who will attend the law school? <br /> <br /> Ah, the poor, small, rich kids ... in their quaint, pretty home, with their ivy-league schools, ultra-clean homes, and social parties ... what will the world be without them do? <br /> <br /> I hope everyone gets drug addicted, goes out of their lives and ends up in jail ... so maybe we can watch movies that are not all about the poor little rich boys and girls turning the surreal world.
