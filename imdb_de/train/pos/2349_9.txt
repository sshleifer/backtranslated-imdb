It's a pleasure to see this creativity back on TV. This show is poetic, artistic and fun. The characters relate well and the writing is not bad (I think it will improve if they get their legs). Definitely worth a look. <br /> <br /> The girls are stealing the series so far in this series. Chuck is adorable like Olive. The two aunts are a pleasure. I sincerely hope that they will be written in larger pieces as they are magical. Make yourself a big bowl of popcorn and enjoy some fun in an old-fashioned way. This is like Dr. Seuss for adults.
