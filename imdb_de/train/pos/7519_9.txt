THE NOTORIAL BETTIE PAGE (2006) *** 1/2 Gretchen Mol, Lilli Taylor, Chris Bauer, Jared Harris, Sarah Paulson, David Strathairn, Austin Pendleton, Norman Reedus and Dallas Roberts. <br /> <br /> Mol shines as a legendary pin-up queen Bettie Page in a fine biopic. <br /> <br /> Gretchen Mol is probably known to have been tense for some years as The Next-It-Girl. One time, when no one knew who she was, despite a notorious cover story by Vanity Fair among other media -Dubbings, but despite some supporting roles here and there, her predicted star seemed to flash less brightly so far. As the famous pin-up queen Bettie Page, Gretchen Mol is indeed a shining star on the rise. Bettie Page was born in Tennessee as a God-fearing and family-oriented girl who seemed to find herself the unwarranted object of lust and affection as she grew older. A gangback rape that is retrospective is neither graphed nor shown the subtle showing of her own father with less than decent designs for his own relatives. This is important to understand how page got out of a nightmarish life for a career An actress who was traveling to New York City in the fifties, though this was the right time to capture the lighting in a bottle. What Page did not know was that she was only that when she arrived. <br /> <br /> A beautiful raven haired sweetheart with a divine figure. Page is discovered by a black policeman on Coney Island on a summer's day Ask for a photo to pose in his basement, and finally to the studios of Irving Klaw (Bauer) and his sister Paula (Taylor), who serve their kitschi. but keep pornographic stills for a unique clientele: fetish types. <br /> <br /> Although Page is quite na√Øve, she is undeniably smart and knows that her body is not a sin and she can see the forest in front of the trees in the sense she is in control - or at least that Keep what she is offered to work because it is not indecent and she enjoys her increasingly less-dressed portraits - until a Congressional witch hunt seeks a few scapegoats to turn pornographic images into a crime. <br /> <br /> Talented filmmaker Mary Harron and her scriptwriter Guinevere Turner ("An American Psycho" and "I Shot Andy Warhol") streamline the biopics very neatly and perhaps a bit too hastily, who really is behind them was Bettie Page though they prove justice when it represents an era of obtrusiveness in the zenith. Many thanks to the gifted cinematographer Mott Hopfel for his boring black-and-white images and the sprayed color segments reminiscent of Douglas Sirk films of this era for their melodramatic cheering. Part of the feminist contract and part of the American dream filled the story with beautiful performances, including the weird peasant and Taylor as siblings in Smut and Harris, who had a field day as comrades with wine and gossip. It's amusing to see Strathairn in a stunt casting as a senator on a campaign for justice, after portraying the bulldog Edward R. Murrow in his recent "Good Night and Good Luck" as a counterpart to the table role. <Br /> <br /> But he has adopted the really fine talents of Mol as the unrestrained, but profound, and above all, intelligent Bettie Page, her childlike innocence through her bold nudity and now as a tame-and-funny borderline -Kitchy poses that have been inspiring men for decades and are still a bookmark for human sexuality in this country and perhaps the world at large. Mol is perfect and eerily resembles the theme of her portrait to her knowing-teasing smile. The real Bettie Page was allegedly not involved in the project, but revealed her blessing and continues to live a somewhat secluded life, which in the last moments alludes to having found Jesus and to escape her "infamous" image once and for all. A shame, since this film strangely encompasses the pervasive decency of its subject and appears visible to all in its naked splendor.
