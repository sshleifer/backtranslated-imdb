I have never seen this movie before. It was filmed on the backdrop of the Old Dark House and the Frankenstein and concerns a small Bavarian village where huge bats are said to suck the blood of the villagers and a cast that will not stop, Lionel Atwill, Dwight Frye, Faye Wray and Melvin Douglas who are playing a character called Brettschnieder, which is of interest to me, as this was my great-grandmother's maiden name. <br /> <br /> This is a carefully modulated movie with exciting and funny liners that is slowly building up for its short runtime. It was only when they discovered about ten minutes before the end that they realized they had limited time to pull it all together. From this point to the end, it is a straight path to the finish, with little of the fun that preceded it. <br /> <br /> Leonard Maltin and IMDb list a running time of 71 minutes and warn against shorter printouts. The problem is that IMDb and Maltin may be wrong, and in that case I think they've been a source I trust more that the full run time is 67 minutes (The Overlook Movie Encyclopedia) that are available to run 60-63 minutes, the amount of missing material is considerably lower when it is only 67 minutes long. Personally, I think it will not matter much as it will take no more than five minutes, and I very much doubt it will make or break the movie. Whatever the runtime is, if you like creaky old movies, take a look at this movie, it's a great dark and stormy night movie.
