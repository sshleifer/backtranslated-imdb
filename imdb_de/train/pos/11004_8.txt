In the near future, the common man will be hired over suspects from the suburb of Morgan Sullivan (Jeremy Northam) by Digicorp, a large corporation, to serve as a spy and seize the rivals Sunways' secrets. During his education, Morgan is brainwashed, takes on a new identity from Jack Thursby and travels to boring lectures. In one of them, the beautiful and mysterious Rita Foster (Lucy Liu) approaches him, telling him that nothing is as it seems. Morgan recognizes a new reality in which he does not know who to trust. <br /> <br /> The unknown "Cypher" was a big surprise for me. This movie was not released in Brazil, but the gripping and exciting story is quite complex, with many storylines and a great script, direction, and performance. In the very last turn I remembered Arnold Schwarzenegger's "Total Recall". This movie certainly deserves to be seen more than once, and I did not really like the last scene when the independent spy discarded the controversial disc in the ocean. The director Vicenzo Natali knows only the fantastic "Cube", and this second work that I see is also stunning. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): Not available
