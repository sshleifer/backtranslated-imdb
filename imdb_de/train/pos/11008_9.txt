You'll find that among the stars I gave to this GREAT movie, "... before you see it for the first time," is implied. I had never heard of this movie before and I just found it just because this week (and last) was a very slow rental experience (not great). I'm not sure how this movie passed me by - I love Lucy Liu and Jeremy Northam is great too. Nevertheless. <br /> <br /> This movie is a great example of what you can do if you do not have a big budget. It had just the right amount of plot and dialogue to make it very interesting and leave the viewer in the dark. just enough. The entire movie consists of you (the viewer) trying to figure out the many twists and turns. I would have given this movie with 10/10, but some shots were pretty wrong. I do not think so much against this movie, but I do not think he deserves a perfect score. <br /> <br /> Lucy Liu is (as always) beautiful and mysterious. I think she's pretty underestimated as a serious talent. Despite her beauty (which is difficult), she takes her roles really seriously and does not rest on her looks to drive her through scenes of refined emotion. And it can seem cold and even lifeless when needed. Jeremy Northam is really good, as a pretty geeky corporate rat ready to run through every maze to prove himself. But as he changes throughout the movie, it's like day and night. I know some fans of Clive Owen, Jude Law or other hopes of becoming the next James Bond will hate me for that, but Northam would / could / should fit that bill. He is polite and cultivated. He has a great bond attitude and voice. I think he too can be cold when the situation requires it, and more down to earth. <br /> <br /> Great movie and definitely this movie fan is recommended to see him at least once you like corporate espionage movies.
