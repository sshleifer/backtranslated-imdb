When DEATHTRAP was first released, the poster - pictured on the cover of this DVD - featured a graphic similar to Rubik's Cube. It's a fitting picture: Originally written for the stage by Ira Levin, who wrote such memorable works as ROSEMARY'S BABY and THE STEPFORD WIVES, the play was one of Broadway's most famous twisters, and directed by Sidney Lumet, it is very good for the screen. <br /> <br /> DEATHTRAP is one of those films that is very hard to discuss, because if you do that in detail, it will tell you exactly what it is famous for. But the opening premise is extremely clever: Sidney Bruhl (Michael Caine) is the famous author of mystery games, but these days he seems to have lost touch. After a particularly brutal opening night, an old student named Clifford Anderson (Christopher Reeve) sends him a script for a piece he wrote. It's called "Deathtrap" and Sidney recognizes it as a surefire hit. Just the kind of hit that would revive his career ... indeed, a hit to die for. And when Clifford discusses the game, the events suddenly turn unexpectedly. <br /> <br /> Like Anthony Shafer's equally curvy SLEUTH, DEATHTRAP is a story that is more on-stage on stage than on-screen. To achieve full performance requires the immediacy of live performance. However, under the expert guidance of director Sidney Lumet, it makes a more than respectable presentation on the screen. Much of this is due to the cast, which is remarkably good. Michael Caine is a truly brilliant performer, Dyan Cannon is funny and adorable as Sidney's relentlessly worried wife, and Christopher Reeve is perhaps the best performer of his unfortunate short acting career. If you can not see it in a first-class movie production, this will be more than the case until one comes. <br /> <br /> Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer
