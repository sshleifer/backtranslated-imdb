Although the film is clearly outdated, the audience in this timeless and hilarious underdog story can easily identify with the plight of the hapless Buster. Buster fights unfriendly contradictions in three different eras: the Stone Age, Roman times, and fashions. He plays almost the same character with just one scene change to identify the different "ages". In this film, we see one of the earliest comedic portrayals of the "caveman" stereotype that wins its love not through romance but through brute force, as well as a witty twist in Roman gladiatorial combat, two comedic sketches long before such spoofs stood Mel Brooks "History of the World: Part I". The underlying theme of the film is simple but convincing: even though times have changed, even in modern times we face the same struggles we fought in prehistoric times to "win the girl" (keep this in mind) is the theme of the America of 1923, a time when chauvinism was still in vogue. It is interesting to look at this film over eighty years later and see how dramatically things have changed from the "modern era" of this film to the present day.
