When I saw this movie for the first time, it was a tape copy and the title was / is Caged Terror. I still own the tape and I confess I've seen it more than once from beginning to end! The film is extremely cheap and the dialogue is often unintentionally amusing! I've got some of my friends to watch, and we've got some great laughs from the awful screenplay. The movie is about a couple (remember, this is like the early 70's, so they're just too hip!), On a weekend camping trip in the one that I believe is in the north of the state NY lies, goes. They have some fun dialogues after they have caught and eaten a fish, and the girl complains about the fish's death and that they ate it! The guy comes back with something stupid as he ate the fish and now he was part of them and he leaves; "And that's a beautiful man!" Hard man, really hard! LOL! Anyway, there are a few Vietnam veterinarians, one of whom plays the flute, I think. (In any case, they are musical guys!) The boys are clearly drawn to the girl, and if the couple proves to be rude, they are terrorized at night. The guy is locked up in a chicken coop and has to see his girlfriend being devastated by the two guys. In fact, she seems to be pretty pretty at the end of the night, and when the morning comes, the guys go and the girl and guy can go. Supposedly the guy has learned a lesson on how to treat people, and the girl has a smile on her face! Anyway, I would recommend this movie to anyone who is looking for a damn good laugh! I still enjoy having fun anyway! If I could find that on DVD and replace my old tape copy, I would actually buy it again, it's a classic store! You have to love this stuff!
