I liked this movie that somehow reminded me of my marriage. It is very clean, you can see it with the family. Well done. Songs are OK too. I think the writer's director is great. The film shows how marriages go through time. They have couples in different stages of life and relationships in their lives. The movie shows several parallel phases in the same story. Some of the dialogues are pretty good. The film does not show complex human emotions very well with excessive dramatization. Even shows perfect is not perfect. Shows beautifully the dynamics of the arranged marriage when it is new. The film is very well written and staged.
