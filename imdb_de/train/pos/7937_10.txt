I loved the movie "I Do They Do not". In the past I have seen Rob Estes on "Suddenly Susan" and "Melrose Place" and also Josie Bissett on "Melrose Place" and it was great to see them together again in "I Do They Do not". They have great chemistry together (I believe marrying in real life!) - in the film they are both widowed with children and careers, falling in love and trying to connect their already chaotic families without falling the ball to let. Of course, they stumble, but they hold it together, that's what working at and raising a family is all about. So many people have talked about this movie - all good! - and the movie let us want more. That would be a great series that appeals to many centuries! - It would be nice to see a real, down-to-earth family life that represents today's reality of today's life - instead of the so-called "reality TV" that overwhelms us all stations. Someone tells ABC Family people that this is the beginning of a new series!
