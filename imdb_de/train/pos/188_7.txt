I'm a big classic movie fan, but I just get into silent films. Many silent films do not catch my attention, but Show People is a notable exception. Marion Davies and William Haines are just wonderful in this picture. Davies, in particular, shows a wide choice as she transforms from a small, small town into a starlet that takes herself a little too seriously. Show People is a fast-paced movie featuring a fantastic selection of cameos by some of the biggest silent stars of the time. The movie immediately grabbed my attention and I actually forgot it was a silent movie. (I know, that does not make much sense, but that's what happened.) The actors are so skilled in their craft that only a few dialogue cards are required. It's a fast, interesting movie with two of the best stars of the silent time. Add in the satire of Hollywood and Show People should be on the "must see" list for all classic movie fans.
