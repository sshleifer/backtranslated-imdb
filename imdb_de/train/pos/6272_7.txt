<br /> <br /> I once saw Niemand's Land (1987) - IMDB link http://en.imdb.com/Title?0093638 - and thought it was alright. The film is about a man who steals only Porsches. It's 13 years later in Sixty Seconds and adds nothing. In fact, there are many scenes that are worthless. And the end is very, very bad. <br /> <br /> The Sphinx has a magnetic screen presence that should have been better used ...
