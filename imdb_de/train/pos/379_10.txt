1985 was a good year for movies - maybe great - but this year, when a gong was missed, fans were convinced that the old Oscar was more of a hood ornament for good party members. <br /> <br /> 11 nominations and not a single title: That was the contempt of the Academy for one of its greatest directors; and one who had to wait another eight years for the prejudice to prevent him from giving him the statue before allowing him to give him 7 for Schindler's list, which is probably not so good (and I'm half Polish). <Do not get me wrong, Schindler was a classic. And I do not knock on "Out of Africa" ​​(which won this year); But in my opinion, it was a class behind it: an epic tale of suffering and hope that moved me to tears - and I'm not a big manger. <br /> <br /> Maybe it was the music (superb) or the cinematography (lush), but rather simply the acting: Whoopi, who proved to us all that she was much more than just a comedian; Danny Glover, whom I had never heard of; and of course Oprah. <br /> <br /> The rest is history. but at the time: who knew?
