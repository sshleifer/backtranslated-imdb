"GOOD TIMES" is in my opinion an absolute CBS hit! Despite the fact that I have never seen every episode, I still like it. It's hard to say which one of my favorites is. I also love the theme song. If you ask me, though I like everyone, it would have been nice if everyone stayed on the show throughout the run. Everyone has always done well, the production design was spectacular, the costumes were well designed and the writing was always very strong. In summary, I can say, even if it can now be seen on TV Land. I urge you to catch it, just in case it's out of the blue forever.
