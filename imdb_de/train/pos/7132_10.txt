A heartwarming movie. The usual great spectacle of John Thaw, who died recently. A man who was always so unimpressive. He was certainly one of England's ten best actors from my time. <br /> <br /> He can be remembered for his famous role as Inspector Morse. As Jack Regan in the 70s he hit the TV series "Sweeney" and as a lawyer in Kavanah QC. A must for the whole family and a great DVD for my collection. The filming will bring back some memories of people remembering the British war year, and certainly those evacuated from London to escape the German bombing raids. The interaction between the two main characters. Tom and the boy William were really good and faithful to the book by Michelle Magorian.
