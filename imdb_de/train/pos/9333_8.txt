I lived all my life in Ontario, in the same town where Marlene Moore grew up. I heard stories from my parents, grandparents and family members. When I found out they were making a movie about them and the start was being filmed in my street, and their house was pretty close to mine, I was excited. If you read the book Rock a Bye Baby, which is about Marlene Moore, you get a very different picture of her as a person. She was considered unpleasantly beautiful by people who really had the chance to meet her except her own family, with the exception of one of her brothers. If you live in my area and are smart enough to listen to those who knew her from school, you would find that she was really wounded before she even went to an asylum, she was always defensive and what seems like one lack of willingness to learn in a school environment was actually embarrassing that she was unable to. Marlene did not deserve the life she had received, with the lack of help she desperately needed. It was the government and the people around her who further favored her death by not trying to understand her needs and why she did what she did. I'm still upset that she was jailed for self-defense by a man who wanted to rape her. When her brother once said, "They did not know what to do with her, so they locked her in and it killed her." I believe in it wholeheartedly. <br /> <br /> Rest in peace Marlene, you deserve it so much.
