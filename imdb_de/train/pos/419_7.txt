This Cecil B. DeMille epic of the Old West contains perhaps the best performance of Jean Arthur, as a hysterical, eccentric, incurably amoral but devoted Calamity Jane. She really did it! Gary Cooper is the most treacherous, but sometimes brings out striking slogans: "The plains are big, but the paths intersect ... sometimes." The story is a pastiche to finish all the pastiches. All the cowboy heroes of Western lore seem to be here, except for Jesse James. Even Abraham Lincoln opens the story personally (or DeMille believes it). There is no room for something as transient as subtlety, this is a fairy tale for the masses. Remarkable about this film, however, is that it is a very early frontal attack on what Eisenhower had finally called a "military industrial complex". It's not just a story about gunners, it's about getting someone ready for money, and this from the heart of Washington. But let's not go into politics, we'll leave that to DeMille, who is guaranteed superficial. The main interest in this film is all those years later that he uses the first film score composed by George Antheil, who has a lot to say about the job in his autobiography Bad Boy of Music. Part of it seems to be "the great sound" that has been adopted by all subsequent Westerns, singing the plains in the heavens with the voices and sounds of countless cowboys celebrating the open spaces and interweaving common melodies. That's why it does not sound unusual at all, because we've heard it a thousand times. But he seems to have been the first to compile the combined rustle of all the sages in this open-sky symphony, which has infiltrated American mythology, and given him a soundtrack that has never been varied since, but is undoubtedly appropriate. It's amusing to see Anthony Quinn in an early appearance as a Cheyenne Indian. Gabby Hayes is in there somewhere, but you miss him in the crowd. Gary Cooper overtakes them all and stands out - but when did he ever turn out to be small?
