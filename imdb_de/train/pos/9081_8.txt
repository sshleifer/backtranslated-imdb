If you like sci-fi, monsters and ancient legends, you will love this movie! <br /> <br /> The special effects are by far the best I've seen since Juarassic Park appeared on the big screen years ago. While acting was perhaps less than desirable, the plot and effects compensated appropriately. <br /> <br /> I wish I had seen this on a movie screen in the cinema instead of our 42 inch TV screen. <br /> <br /> If you love non-stop action, stunning visuals, and a taste for myth and history ... you'll have to watch this movie !!
