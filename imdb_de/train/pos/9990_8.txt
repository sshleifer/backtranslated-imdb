I saw the movie recently and enjoyed it very much. I surprised myself and cried. This film is in the same niche as "Away from Her" - or even "The Bucket List", but treats the entire aging theme with incredible authenticity. It's really hard to have the main character as unlikely as Hagar. The director does a masterful job with the challenge. Hagar is hard to understand. Her world has hard edges and she is not a warmhearted woman. <br /> <br /> The first scene conveys this uncompromisingly. Hagar (Ellen Burnstyn) is taken to a nursing home by her son and daughter-in-law. She finds it on the way and freaks out. Their edges are very hard. She is mean. She is condescending and selfish. She is a stone. I did not like her - not even a bit. <br /> <br /> In the course of the film we get insights. We find out why she does not like petunias, why she prefers one son over the other, how her losses shaped her character ... I started to see the angel ... and I started liking her. I especially liked her when she gave the boy in the hut her secrets. Ellen Burnstyn, you're a brilliant actor. Kudos Kudos Kudos What a scene! <br /> <br /> This is not a movie to feel good, but it is certainly a movie that brings the viewer to compassion. I understand more clearly that hard edges in a person's life are there for protection, they are there for a reason ... <br /> Hagar is not my mother - she is not even my mother's law or neighbor. .. but parts of her are present in many women (and men) in my life. These parts somehow make more sense to me since I saw The Stone Angel.
