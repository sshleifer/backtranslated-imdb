This movie has a special place in my heart because when I first caught it, I taught adult education. It sounded very appropriate to me and even to a great student I had at that time. There are scenes in which you can swallow with sudden emotions, and those that even put a smile on your face by the mere identification with the characters and their situation. <br /> <br /> Outstanding performances by Jane Fonda and Robert DeNiro, judged by their best works, a great twist on a young Martha Plimpton, an inspiring storyline and a haunting music score, make for a most enjoyable and rewarding experience.
