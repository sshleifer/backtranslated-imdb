I did not read this book, but throughout the movie I was stunned with a single thought in my mind: That's Vonnegut. I've never seen an author translate all the intelligence and life behind the works of a novel so well into the movie. This film had the same complexity found in Vonnegut's novels: the jokes were often meaningful and symbolic, and the dramatic events and symbols were often jokes too. Campbell was also one of von Nolte's superbly-drawn Vonnegut character. He had all the hallmarks of a Vonnegut "hero": lack of concern for political boundaries, ironic dark humor that gives way to silent inactivity in response to stress, and unwillingness to fight his surroundings with his fellow human beings. <BR>> Overall, I was always surprised and impressed to see this movie. It was the same feeling when I read "Cat's Cradle," my first Vonnegut novel, as if the strangest thing that could happen, he thought of DAS, and he made it real and important. Yes, he only has "White Christmas" albums. That is how it goes!
