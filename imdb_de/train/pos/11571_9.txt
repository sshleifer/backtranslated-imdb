"An Itch In Time" is one of many home runs that Bob Clampett met for WB in the early 1940s, including "Horton Hatches The Egg" and "Tortoise Wins By A Hare". Soaked in manic timing and exaggerated chaos, it's basically the story of a flea busy treading the ground for a new home and the dog whose bottom is being destroyed. Because Master Elmer will give him a dreaded flea bath when he is just scratching, the unfortunate canine must endure a rising spiral of torment as the domestic flea uses pickaxes and power tools to cleanse the land. Finally, the little monster ignites a small mountain of explosives that he has poured on the back of his victim! There is a huge explosion, and the unhappy puppy covers his eyes, while his rear end erupts in a blistering July celebration! It really has to hurt, and the dog flees, but soon he stops and says with a cheerful smile, "You guys do better, because I think I'm starting to like it!" This kinky confession has been censored for years, but the current prints have restored the clip so the viewer can now enjoy it in its original devilish splendor. Still cut, however, is the final gag, in which the cat blows her brain after complaining: "Now I have seen everything!" This was a general gag at WB, but has since been removed from this cartoon and a few others, including "Horton."
