I'm honest with you, I was a junior in high school when this sitcom aired for the first time on ABC. I did not think I would like that at all. But with John Ritter, I felt it had a little potential in it, and it was something else that I liked. The acting was great, not many terrible 2. rated comedy lines, John Ritter always brings his A-game when it comes to comedy. That was a great show, and I'll tell you why it was a great show. My dad, who does not watch any sitcoms at all, he just watches movies, sports and law and order, he actually sat down with my 3 brothers and 2 sisters, my mom and I and saw the series that I believe because John Ritter it was there. I honestly believe this show would still be going on if John Ritter God rested his soul. I wish he had not died.
