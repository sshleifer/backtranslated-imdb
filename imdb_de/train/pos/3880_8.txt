Well, for starters, this was actually the most elegant Clausen movie to date. <br /> <br /> The man always has a flair for characters with a touch of humor, but I think that in this film he adds a dimension that is second to none he has ever done. His work has been accepted - in very black and white words - by a broad but not so critical audience, and we have always appreciated his sense of humor and his ability to mix it with human problems and a special way to engage the audience Let know what he has to say. <br /> <br /> In "Villa Paranoia", however, he surprises for the first time with an invisible wisdom and a respect for the minorities. Not only the ethnic, but also the normal people tend to forget. Jutland - in "the country" - is about the everlasting problem of lack of love, but in a close and sometimes brutal way that keeps you looking and focusing. And even he manages to play off! A real b ***** d who wants the right thing, but has no idea how to get there, and people suffer from it. Bitter. <br /> <br /> I have to say it's one of the best movies I've seen this year and I'm really looking forward to its next one.
