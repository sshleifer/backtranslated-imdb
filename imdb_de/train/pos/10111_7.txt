The enchanted world of Edward D. Wood, Jr. is not a very good documentary. Aesthetically, it is a lackluster and cheap look, people go on tangents, which makes it very unfocused and self-contained, but that adds to its charm. I say that because it is a documentary about an unusual ball that made strange pictures and surrounded itself with other strange balls. Therefore, there is really no other way to document the life and career of the man and his crew of outsiders. There are some insights into the genius and inability of Wood, and the portrayal of both qualities is a merit of the authenticity of the documentary. Overall, it's an observation for the Wood fan and for the cinema in general, but do not expect any brilliance here. Expect a documentary from Wood's own heart.
