I did not see this movie in the theater. I confess to a Vinnie against Vinnie Barbarino. Who the hell was going to make John Travolta movies? I remember the Oscar broadcast that year, when Travolta was absolutely devastated when he did not win. How dare he when "real" actors were in the race? I'm sorry, John, you should have won. After recording this movie years ago on cable, I fell in love with the entire movie. Bud, Sissy, Uncle Bob, Wes, all wonderful. I also admit that I never miss it when surfing Surf. I have to stop and watch. Over the years, I've learned to do most of the dialogue, dancing at the waist with my thumbs and appreciating Travolta more. The only disappointing thing for me was the mistake of some Urban Cowboy music on the soundtrack. "In Search of Love" defines the movie, but Urban Cowboy was full of classics that did NOT make it to the soundtrack. It should have been a double CD ...
