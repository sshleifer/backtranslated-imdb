The early to mid-nineties, in my opinion, were a highlight of the historical drama. The last Mohican Braveheart and Rob Roy - all showed an unmistakable passion and intensity in their respective periods. <br /> <br /> Rob Roy was a unique and intriguing taste of a time and place rarely portrayed in the movie. It really has everything - interesting story, great spectacle, remarkable dialogues and breathtaking landscapes. I was particularly impressed by the seemingly real dialogue. I can imagine that this was how the people of the early 18th century talked and behaved. <br /> <br /> Another thing that surprised me was the vulgarity of the characters. I found it more repulsive and shocking, though often more subtle, than in most modern-day films. The film had a very racy and sexually charged advantage that was unique and most likely very realistic in the context of the era. <br /> <br /> The pace was very tight and there was hardly a boring moment. There were many intrigues and political subplots that made things a little more complicated, but did not affect the main story. <br /> <br /> The action was also very well done and enthralling. What I find remarkable is that there is no soundtrack during the highlight action piece in the movie. It's a very exciting, exciting sequence, as we have no musical clue about the direction and resolution of the scene. Rob Roy will always be at the top of my list of favorite movies. I would recommend it to everyone.
