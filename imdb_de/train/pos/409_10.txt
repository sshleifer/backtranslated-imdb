Legend of Zu is probably the most exciting movie I've seen in recent years. It exceeds all expectations and is truly a work of art. With unparalleled visual landscapes and stories of divine proportions, Legend of To flood his audience with his majesty. This movie has been wonderfully crafted using high-tech CGI videos that fans of the fantasy genre can use to bring their visions to life. Acting is perfect for this kind of movie. If you were an immortal man with supernatural powers, I would think you would keep more to yourself. <br /> <br /> Contrary to the comments of many, the plot is actually pretty EASY to follow while introducing a fast pace that makes sense of urgency. Anyone who can not track the different characters just does not have to be careful, as he or she is used to a level of refinement like the Titanic. The plot is appealing and overlaid with themes so epic that you'll gasp for breath. The legend of Zu is so great that many people are deterred by their size. Immerse yourself in his fantastic vision and love this movie.
