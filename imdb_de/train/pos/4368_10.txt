This is a very exciting and romantic movie. I've seen it several times and never get bored. Everything is realistic and it is a good story. The actors are outstanding Liam Neeson, Jessica Lange, Tim Roth and Brian Cox. <br /> <br /> I prefer this movie Braveheart because Braveheart contains so many historical mistakes. There are many exciting scenes - watch out for the Bridge Scen and the last fencing scene. These are really good and surprising scenes. <br /> <br /> The music is lovely ... it really fits the movie. The attitude is incredible.
