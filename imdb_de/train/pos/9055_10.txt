This is an amazing movie and all actors and actresses and very good! Although some of the actors and actresses were not very popular in show business, it seemed like they have been actors for a year! It was funny, disgusting and all in all a very good movie. In most areas, I simply did not know what would happen next! I thought, I think this will happen. Wait, I think that will happen. All ages will love this movie! In some places I could not stop laughing, it was so funny, but in some places I was totally crappy and could not believe what I saw! I will definitely see this movie again! It's one of those movies where it can not get boring. Every time you see it, it's so exciting. I definitely recommend this movie !!
