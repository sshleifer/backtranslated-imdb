As low as it may be, this movie is one of the best psychological thrillers I've ever seen. If you accept that the budget is low from the beginning, you can see how good a story is, how well the script was written, and how great the filmmaker was at producing so little with so little money. > <br /> All elements of a great movie are here. The visuals, although digitally shot, were beautiful in some places. The bizarre, dreamy feeling of the film is particularly well captured in the scene with the talking dog, this scene was just amazing. It's such a trippy piece of work, but not in an overbearing way, and that's why I have great respect for this film. It is highly recommended for anyone looking for something unique and fascinating and different from most repetitive films.
