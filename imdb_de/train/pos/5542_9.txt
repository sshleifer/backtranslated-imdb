Probably the best picture Producers Releasing Corp has made, this little horror piece is catching everyone's attention from the first to the last. Director Frank Wisbar obviously knows a good story when he writes one, and more importantly, he knows his full potential for shock on the screen. The plot is not only fascinating and the characters are drawn fascinatingly, but the scenery is absolutely out of this world! Almost all activities take place either at night or in the midst of an adherent, penetrating mist. This relaxed atmosphere is enhanced by Wisbar's ingenuity and convincing performance from all his players. The pretty Rosemary La Planche is an ideal heroine, beautiful, spirited and vulnerable. Robert Barrat delivers his usual, straightforward portrait of the local evil, though it's hard to believe that the personable, handsome man who plays his son is none other than the later dullsville writer / director Blake is Edwards
