Have you ever wondered how far a movie could go? <br /> <br /> With Harry Russo, Schizophreniac relentlessly explores the world of the extreme. <br /> <br /> Harry is an aggravated writer, murderer and drug addict, who stops at nothing to destroy those who are between him and madness. Driven by the demonic voices of his ventriloquist dummy, Harry begins his killing spree. <br /> <br /> From director Ron Atkins comes the first part of the worst story ever filmed. <br /> <br /> The only other movie I've seen is similar to the second part called Schizophreniac Necromaniac. <br /> <br /> This is a movie with a really low budget, not for everyone is appropriate, but if you are looking for something disturbing, different, and terrible, this would be a good choice /> DO NOT EXPECT LIKE MODERN TAGESHORROR (such as Scream). <br /> <br /> It is recommended that you choose the viewer
