Takashi Miike is one of my favorite directors, and I was worried that he would make a children's movie because I would not hate him if he diverges from the films I loved: Visitor Q, Gozu, Izo, the killer Ichi, and the Black Socioty Trilogy. Lately, he seems to be exploring new territory and I think he succeeds. Still, this was the first of his films to have taken that direction, so I was nervous. Roughly I bought it without having seen it, and was glad that I did that. <br /> <br /> Great Yokai War is a perfect children's movie and adults should like it too. The whole movie reminded me so much of the movies I loved as a kid: never-ending story, Labyrinth, Return to Oz, etc. I enjoyed these movies because they did not treat kids as stupid and they did not. The dark underlying customs are there, but it's as stupid as any kids movie should be. The CGI and the prosthetics did not bother me personally. I think they fit together well and do not think children will notice. <br /> <br /> If you're a diehard Takashi Miike fan, you may not like it. But I suggest trying it out. This shows that Miike is as versatile and talented as I suspected. He continues to do his typical Miike movies outside of this, which is very reassuring. <br /> <br /> For those who are new to Takashi Miike and want something light or dramatic like this, I suggest them to other Miike movies: "Zebraman" "The Luck of the Katakuris" "Sabu" and "The Bird People in China ". <br /> <br /> Good work Takashi Miike! 8/10 stars.
