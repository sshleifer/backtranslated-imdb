Let me first say that the director has some wonderful use of titles in his founding shots. I really enjoyed it. I really enjoyed this movie, but I said next to Pierce Brosnan that Greg Kinear is pretty lackluster. Brosnan fuses so well with this character that it's really hard to remember that this is the same guy who played Bond. It also shows his reach and depth as an actor. It's a bit of an indie movie and it was really nice to see, especially with all the mainstream movies that flood the movies this time of year. I found the characters well done. The twist in the middle that I felt was especially good. I also liked how the characters look realistic. So often in the movie we have these cartoons of people who are not real characters, but stereotypes when walking. I think sideways when I think about this movie, but I think that's better to see and overall a better movie ...
