A movie about Down syndrome. One mother has twins, one is very ill, the other is good, but he has downs. The mother does not think she can raise him, so she gives it to some people who have 15 children, who have 11 children! The mother does not like that and she thinks he should be with his family (I agree), so they bring it to court and the family is broken and the grandparents lose, it never really says if the mother and daughter are up makeup? I think the movie is good, but the plot is familiar, it's still good and has a few unwanted laughs!
