A true classic, ten out of ten! Every actor is perfect, the script is a haunting episode of thrilling scenes. Scenes in the car and scenes in the mountains are breathtaking. I wonder if this movie already comes out on DVD, because he is seen in the widescreen version. Saw this movie in the late fifties, maybe three or four times, and never forgot it since then. I remember it was one of the first Warner cinemas to handle features. Shelley Winters and Jack Palance have earned an Oscar for their performances. The only thing I could criticize is that someone like Nicholas Ray was not asked to increase the rhythm and tension.
