Since I saw this for the first time in the theater, it's my favorite. Since then I have seen it countless times and never get tired. The attitude has a lot to do with it (the Colorado, whom I know to be jealous of), but the plot is original and I liked how the small-town hill tribes were used as heroes. There is no film that I can compare too. John Lithgow plays a smart villain but I love that he is totally out of his element - he has to follow Tucker and that makes him interesting. This is an action movie at its best. I do not think I'll see another so entertaining. <br /> <br /> You do not need 50,000 shots to qualify as an action movie. It just has to keep you trapped, not shocked.
