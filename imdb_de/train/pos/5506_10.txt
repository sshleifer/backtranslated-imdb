I can not fully understand why one of the "reviewers" gave this documentary "0", except for political reasons. No, the film did not examine both "sides" of the story, but a film in favor of Chavez against the flood of propaganda against him should be seen as an attempt to balance the narrative altogether (especially with regard to A. the story) of the CIA engagement in Latin America during the civil unrest fermentation - google National Security Archives and B. the coverage of clearly fake scenes of Chavez supporters who shot down non-existent opponents in this country and elsewhere. The most amazing thing about this film is the fact that the filmmakers were in the presidential palace during the entire coup - certainly a first in the documentary - from a coup on both sides !!!
