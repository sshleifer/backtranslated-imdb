"The Mother" is a strange low-budget movie that touches on at least two uncomfortable topics that are not usually researched in the cinema: refusing to mother for her own son and daughter, and lust and passion in the third age. <br /> <br /> The characters are awful: May is a disgusting old lady, and I think it's impossible to feel pity or sadness for her. She admits she did not love her son and daughter. She cheated on her husband twice with an intellectual. She steals her daughter's beloved husband, not to protect her from a man without morality who does not love her, but only because she feels horny with him. She tries to organize her life in the worst possible way after the loss of her husband and to destroy her daughter's delusions. Paula, her daughter, is a fragile loser who accepts her life as it is. Her brother Bobby is a man who has lost his savings through his wife, who insists that her business is a terrible business. Darren is an amoral addicted idiot who does not like anyone, even himself. <br /> <br /> The acting and the direction are excellent: the actors have excellent performances and the direction is very precise. I liked this movie, but I know that it is recommended for a very specific audience. My voice is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Recome√ßar" ("Re-Start")
