Overall, I have to say that I liked the movie. Some of the fight scenes are really good. Especially the fight against Leung Ka-Yan. One point that really bothered me was the fact that they used an Asian to play a black man. I'm serious. Talk about bad taste. During a fight scene you can see one of the fighters laughing on the floor. Otherwise, Sammo copies Bruce Lee's fighting moves perfectly. 5 out of 10 stars.
