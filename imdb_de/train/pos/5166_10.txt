Indian summer! It was very nostalgic for me. I thought it was funny, heartwarming and totally thrilled! Anyone who went to camp as a child and wishes they could return to the "good Ole Days" for a short time, must see this! It begins when, 20 years later, a group of old campers returns to a "reunion". I will not comment on the plot because you have to see it for yourself. The actors were great and it contains an All Star cast. Everyone played a great role. They actually felt they were part of the movie that saw him. Alan Arkin was especially good at his role as Uncle Lou. He plays the guy everyone wishes he had his life on. This is for the most part a good family movie. I would suggest this to everyone in a heartbeat! Highly recommended!
