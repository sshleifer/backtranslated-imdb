This movie is one of those nostalgic things with me and I never really expect anyone else to "get it", but I'm happy to recommend it and someone likes it. My late father hated Arthur Askey, but this movie was one he really enjoyed, and his consistent enthusiasm for "The Ghost Train" and "Old Ted 'Olmes" turned me on as a kid. Years later, I keep looking and enjoying the familiarity. I always wonder if it will not be quite so, but I will never be disappointed. There is much to enjoy. The sequence on the train is really inspiring as Askey and Murdoch annoy the arrogant male passenger. Then the whole section in the station is amazing and there has to be so much going on. Yes, it's dated and full of wartime Britishness in accents and plot (based on the original piece by Arnold Ridley of Dad's Army Glory!), But full of wonderful character appearances - including Kathleen Harrison as dotty spinster. The atmosphere is really as scary as an Arthur Askey vehicle could be. This is cheap than chips available in the UK on DVD, so treat yourself. It's a perfect Saturday / Sunday morning or a light, fun afternoon. Thank you .... <br /> <br /> OLD FILMS MAY BE GOOD FILMS!
