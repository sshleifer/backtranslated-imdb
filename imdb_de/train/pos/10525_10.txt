I have no idea how a Texan (the director, Douglas McGrath) and American actress Gwyneth Paltrow ever did it, but if you look at it again, you'll be reminded of all the excitement around Ms. Paltrow ! I had not seen the woman for a long time and still feel rather bored in her Oscar-winning "Shakespeare In Love" performance, but she gets all the beats here - she's almost perfect as Emma Woodhouse. She may have won her Oscar for Shakespeare, but you should remember that. <br /> <br /> Of course, she's surrounded by a great cast like Toni Collette, Greta Scacchi, Juliette Stevenson and others. Jeremy Northam is very appealing as a love interest, even though the script in his love letter to Paltrow revels a little (and all Drain tension from their relationship); After a few years, Ewan's hair is a bit easier to take than in 1996, and personally I find that Alan Cumming is a bit poppy these days. But the standout is undoubtedly Sophie Thompson (sister of Emma Thompson, daughter of Phyllida Law) as Miss Bates; What this version needs is a scene in which Emma reconciles herself with Miss Bates, as she is the character whose fate we are drawn to. The film is (again) worthwhile for its performance alone. All in all, this movie is wonderfully aged with charm and more than enough subtlety to rearrange the British class system. It's worth renting (because it's unlikely Paltrow will ever be so good again - but we'll always have Emma).
