Blackadder 3 is probably the Blackadder series that people have heard least about - it basically has the same principles as the second and fourth and has nothing revolutionary about it. But it's still great - a fiery Duke of Wellington and a fat, stupid Dr Johnson (author of the first dictionary in England) make this series a must-expect. In this series, there are even funnier one-liners that express humor in a lesser known era - in historically accurate and entertaining episodes. Blackadder's third appearance is not the most famous and well-known of the game, but Rowan Atkinson's role as butler for a stupid prince is a witty and effective one. Very well! 9.10
