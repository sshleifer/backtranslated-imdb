The comic joke between William Powell and Jean Arthur is the culmination of this murder mystery, which has one of the most bizarre and unlikely conspiracies of all time. Powell is probably the most polite detective in the '30s, and Arthur has a unique voice that often sounds like a series of tiny bells. They are extremely fun to watch, so take the impertinence of the action with a grain of salt and just enjoy unfolding. Eric Blore also has some weird turns as Powell's butler. Powell's contract with MGM included a clause that allowed him to refuse the loan to another studio, but he wanted to work with Arthur again and liked the script, so he eagerly accepted the assignment. They collaborated on two 1929 Paramount films, the Canary Murder Case and the Greene Murder Case, both in the Philo Vance series.
