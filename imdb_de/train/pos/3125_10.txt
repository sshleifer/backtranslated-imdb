The Bourne Ultimatum (2007) Review: After an exciting set of 2 we get the last installment. Here's my take: <br /> <br /> The Bourne Ultimatum has it all. We have Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) on the coattails of those who know everything. He has been running too long. This time it ends. <br /> <br /> The Bourne Ultimatum offers a great storyline, fantastic writing, fantastic direction, excitement and some of the best actions of the summer. Matt Damon may deliver his best performance so far. He has the conviction and the swelling desire of the disturbed assassin. <br /> <br /> There is a smart sense of humor and excitement here. The reactions to certain events make you either laugh (in a good way) or cheer. (or both) I heard a lot of smart laughter in the theater and a lot of clapping. The audience was excited. <br /> <br /> The Bourne Ultimatum delivers everything in a pretty gift wrap. All goods and a few more. This is the best movie this summer, in my opinion. <br /> <br /> The Last Word: Excellent conclusion. The best of the trilogy. So summer movie thriller should be made. I love the Bourne trilogy.
