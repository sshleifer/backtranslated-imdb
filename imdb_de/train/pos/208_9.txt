The Sunshine Boys is a terrific comedy about two former Vaudevillians who reluctantly meet for a TV special, even though they despise each other. <br /> <br /> The comic genius of the two masters George Burns and Walter Matthau are stellar! Some of the best scenes are when the duo fights for the dumbest little things! The material is fast and funny and appeals to all ages. <br /> <br /> MELLOW SPOILER ALERT: Towards the end of the film, there are some mild sad moments that indirectly deal with the effects of aging that make up the film A gentle, sincere tenderness that shows this reviewer that what the couple really needs for success is mutual. <br /> <br /> If someone loves The Odd Couple, you will love this movie. An excellent movie!
