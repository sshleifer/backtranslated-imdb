This is a fantastic classic monster movie from the 50s! I like the look of the 50s in general like the cars and the music. Anyway, I love how the blob looks like. I love it when everyone makes a horror movie in the theater late at night and the blob comes in and the party falls. Another thing that I love about it is that it all happens in one night, just like Halloween II. <br /> <br /> When Steve and Jane go out, they see a meteor fall from space. In the meteor is the blob. Whenever the blob consumes a person, it gets bigger and bigger. They try to convince the inhabitants of the city of the bleating monster, but nobody believes them later. Can anything stop this blobby creature? I highly recommend THE BLOB !!!
