I'm watching the show again now, as it appears on DVD (yay!). It seems so fresh, as relevant and fascinating as when it was first aired. <br /> <br /> The central performances are thrilling, the scripts are layered. <br /> <br /> I'll keep my neck out and show it off as a show with The Prisoner, which will win new fans and will still be seen in 2035. <br /> <br /> I was asked to write a little more line (it seems like IMDb is coded as user-unfriendly and decently remanent as ever!) Pithy and to the point clearly is not the IMDb method.) American Gothic of IMDb believes that simplicity is everything. In 22 episodes, the show covers more character development than many shows in seven seasons. In addition, personal ethics and strength of character are called into question, challenging the viewer at every opportunity to ask himself what he would choose and what he would think in a particular situation. <br /> <br /> When the show first aired, I still mourned Twin Peaks and thought it was a cheap tee. Personally, I start to rate it higher and suspect it will withstand better over the years. It will not be more controversial than that!
