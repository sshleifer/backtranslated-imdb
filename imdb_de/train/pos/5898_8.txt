Penny Princess finds the American working girl Yolande Donlon the heir to a small kingdom that lies in the triangle where France, Italy and Switzerland meet, Lampidorra. It seems that the Lampidorrans owes bills across Europe and smuggles the main occupation of the country due to its geography. An American multi-millionaire buys the place, but dies before he can win the title. His next heir is Donlan. <br /> <br /> But of course the estate in America has to go through probate and what should the Lampidorrans do? Especially as Donlan, who has since become a princess, has forbidden smuggling. <br /> <br /> Enter Dirk Bogarde on a trip to Switzerland to learn about the cheese industry. It seems that the Lampidorrans have a kind of cheese, which they playfully refer to as Schmeeze. With a few bumps on the road, Schmeeze solves all financial, geopolitical and romantic problems between Donlan and Bogarde. <br /> <br /> How does Schmeeze work? But here is a hint. In Lover Come Back, Jack Kruschen had perhaps just learned the secret of Schmeeze when he was busy inventing VIP for Rock Hudson and his advertising agency. <br /> <br /> Anyway, Penny Princess is a delightful mix of British farce and romantic comedy. Yolande Donlon again plays a role in which Marilyn Monroe would have been cast if the film had been filmed on this side of the pond. Dirk Bogarde was well occupied in the part that was considered a romantic heartbeat early in his career, long before anyone else suspected he had the acting skills he had. This movie was sadly shown at three o'clock in the morning on the TCM. But at least I found a reason to be grateful for insomnia.
