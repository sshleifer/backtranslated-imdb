Bravo for the Czechs, their once mighty film industry seems to awaken from post-communist sleep. The Loners is a comedy that contains all the elements that you would expect in a modern "Hollywood production" the trash that seems to be tied to the genre in recent years. Excellent soundtrack, excellent visual editing, beautiful cityscape of Prague, just to name a few. <br /> <br /> The story is actually made up of several sub-stories that often intersect and overlap. This is essentially a collage of destinies. Destinies, desires ... It follows a group of urban youths through the mid-thirties through a variety of situations, ranging from daily life and leisure activities to careers and obsessions. And it is wonderful. There's actually a point in the movie where the entire theater I was in (about 100 people in a small art gallery) laughed 40 to 50 seconds without interruption. How often do you experience this with modern Hollywood productions? <br /> <br /> Even though the whole actor is excellent (in particular the up-and-coming Macedonian star Labina Mitevska in the role of an immigrant facing the all too well-known hardships) I have to point out Jiri Machacek for his incredibly believable portrayal of Jakub, a constantly stoned Bohemian, whose brain is heavily influenced by the stuff he smokes and ends up in a plethora of funny situations. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: do not miss this! It has a lot to offer.
