If I could go back, even as an adult, and relive the days of my summer camp ... I would be there so fast. The camps I visited were not even that great. They were in Texas, where the mosquitoes actually carry people, but we had horses and fishing. The movies were amazing, the characters funny and believable, especially Perkins, Pollack and Arkin. Sam Raimi's character and subantics were priceless. Who has always thought that this film is lame ... I have deep pity, because they can not stop their unbelief long enough to re-imagine camp life as an adult or as children they never left. The point was that these people had the opportunity to back off and become youthful again, and they did it on every occasion. I wish I could. It was funny, intelligent, beautifully scripted, brilliantly cast and the craftsmanship brings me back, so I would like to see it again and again only for the scenery. Sorta like Dances with Wolves and LadyHawk ... good movies, but the wild becomes as much a character as the actors. Rent it, see it, buy it and watch it over and over again ... never grow old. 0)
