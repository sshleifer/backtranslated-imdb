The movie can be great. I looked at it last night, but I can not be honest because I read the book first. The book is so much better than the movie that I was disappointed with the movie. If you want to see "Of Human Bondage," do not read the book first. On the other hand, the book is so good and contains so much more than the love affair that Phillip has with Mildred, you could still enjoy it after seeing the movie. I do not make that claim light-hearted. I read a book on average every four days and read such different authors as Danielle Steel, Ovid, Faulkner, Plato and Shakespeare. "Of Human Bondage" gets my vote as one of the ten best novels ever written.
