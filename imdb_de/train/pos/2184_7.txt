Although it is a pleasant musical, this movie left me with the unexpected comedic chemistry between Basil Rathbone as a former composer and Oscar Levant as an assistant. Rathbone plays a highly tense, distracted artistic type (far from his more familiar roles as a threatening villain or the cool, logical Sherlock Holmes) and looks like he could not get out of bed without help. And this help is Starbuck, played by Oscar Levant. After hiring Crosby's character as his ghost songwriter, Rathbone introduces him to Starbuck and says, "He's doing all my thinking for me," to which Levant replies, "Ah, it's just a part-time job." Of course, that's past Rathbone (or over), who's too busy wondering where his next hit will come from. Another reviewer said who knew Rathbone could be so funny! Too bad that he had no more opportunities to show his comedic talent.
