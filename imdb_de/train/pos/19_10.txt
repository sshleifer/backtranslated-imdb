I just read the comments from TomReynolds2004 and feel like I have to jump in here. I understand that he does not like the movie, but his reasons are not clear. My feeling about this film is that it is not afraid to travel the dark streets of loneliness, failure, disappointment and sadness. Each of these two people has many reasons to be bitter and angry, yet to find tenderness and consolation. Only good acting can do this job without becoming emotional mess, sentimental and juicy. I was really interested in these people because they were so overwhelming that they had such strong performances. I have every reason not to like Jane Fonda for her actions in the Vietnam era, but apart from her personal feelings, she is fabulous in this role. Robert DeNiro is superb as a man whose intelligence and kindness start to fail him in a world that does not take his abilities. This is the first time I have seen DeNiro, who used tenderness instead of tenacity to sell a character, and I really like it. This movie was a big surprise when I saw it for the first time and I'm looking forward to seeing it again.
