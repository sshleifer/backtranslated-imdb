In Iran, the Islamic Revolution has shaped all parts of life, including everyday things. But people still live their lives and in general only do the things they expect. For example, go to football matches to cheer on the national team because she is in the running to qualify for the World Cup. Only women are not allowed to go to the football stadium to watch the game. <br /> <br /> An often funny little movie follows the small group of women caught at the ball of foot in the stadium and the small group of bored soldiers assigned to guard them in a jar outside the stadium. The absurdity of the situation, the simple desire of these women to cheer on the team (there is nothing subversive), and little human touch on the lives of all together make up a pretty subtle remark about humankind's ideology br /> amateur drama, good script and Dialogue, a really entertaining movie. Bend It Like Beckham - a warm heart and a joy in the daily interests and pleasures of the people.
