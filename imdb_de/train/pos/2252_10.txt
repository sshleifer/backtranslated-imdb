Henry Hathaway was brave and enthusiastic for his love of the early days of US history. However, to criticize historical inaccuracies of his film about Brigham Young and the Mormons, it is not necessary or useful to comment on this film. In my opinion, Hathaway has given a great direction conveying what was a Mormon people in the early history of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in the time that began with the martyrdom of Joseph Smith until the date of the film's release. In often subtle film and dialogue films he treated Mormon philosophies and teachings in many segments and scenes. <br /> <br /> I remember watching this movie on many Saturday mornings during my youth in the early fifties. This was just over ten years after the release of the film and even before the completion of the Los Angeles Temple, where I watched the setup and was more curious about who Mormons were. I recently bought this movie and will enjoy the following messages that Hathaway interpreted in his movie. <br /> <br /> 1. Love for all people, regardless of their personal beliefs, 2. Charity for the needy or not, 3. Family is of great importance, 4. Listen respectfully and carefully, because even opposing messages have 5. Consider hard points, both individually and in the community. 6. Prepare yourself for future days of hardship and preserve them. 7. Hope is a binding link to a higher being and to ours daily life. 8. And there is a unique quality for all group and appreciate those that are considered beneficial.
