This film was highly recommended to me by Matt Groening. In fact, I've looked at both the Simpsons and Futurama and it's mentioned in both, so I thought "What the hell". The movie brings home a few "what ifs" that tell you how lucky we are today if we take simple things like soap and water for granted. Interestingly enough, in 2022 men are still shaving with a single razor! Nice that the responsible people have not overloaded the film with unnecessary special effects, blasting guns, etc. Some good-looking "furniture" once you find out what that means. Remember, "Tuesday is Soylent Green Day"
