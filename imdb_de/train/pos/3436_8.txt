Letters to no destination end up in another world, which is in the back rooms of the post office. Here, Alice manages to find a job, hoping to find her lost father. What she discovers is the tormented soul of her boss Frank. A quiet little Aussie movie that came and went in the cinema. Now you find it in the deep, dark corner of the video store, which is overshadowed by fifty copies of this dreaded GODZILLA movie. It's a shame, because it turned out to be a satisfying movie telling a brave story with strong simple imagery and effective performances by the two leads. This film is successful when Garry Marshall's other dead mail-order film DEAR GOD (1996 - USA) failed and the brilliance of the Kevin Costner turkey does not come close, but POSTMAN (1995 - China) by He Jianjun.
