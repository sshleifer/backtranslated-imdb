okay, but just stupid. Not bad for a horror / comedy movie. I've read how people changed with the Michael version, and I think that's a good trick, because some adults hate horror, and if they watch this movie, they'll be interested in horror movies like this or maybe (never before seen). the horror (possibly comedy) Uncle Sam, I have to see how I lend or buy the movie, but the second one is much better than this, but I bought it on VHS from Amazon and got it on November 21, the day before the Thanksgiving Festival. worth the four dollars, l.o.l. in this movie. <br /> <br /> 9/10
