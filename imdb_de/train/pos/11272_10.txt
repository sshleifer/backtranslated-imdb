BIRTHDAYS: Ralph Nader, Gloria Steinem, Alan Arkin, Richard Chamberlain. <br /> <br /> DOUG: After we were rather disappointed with the original 'Tarzan the Ape Man', we discovered among fellow users and historians that the second film was "Tarzan and his comrade" was the best in the series. This is true. I got a huge kick from this movie. Johnny Weismuller returns as Titular Vine-Swing, the wild superhero with animal battles, and Maureen O'Sullivan embodies her role as his absolutely fantastic Lady Love (wearing a two-piece outfit for the first and last time). In my review of "Ape Man," I came across Jane, who was pretty obsessed with her obsession with clothes and her incessant screaming, but she has worked for me here. Make no mistake: O'Sullivan is the star of this movie and Jane is the most capable character in the cast. She acts as an ambassador between Holt and Tarzan, she can work perfectly in the jungle and get on with the animals, and she knows how to hold off a furious lion's pride when she's out of bullets. She even has her own jungle scream now. The chemistry between Johnny and Maureen is irresistible. She totally trained him. Cheeta is also very charming and takes off Martin's cigarette. The plot is mostly an excuse for Tarzan to fight the most evil animals in the jungle, especially lions, crocodiles and rhinos. The effects are, though always visible, much more dynamic and cool and complement the action well. Oh, and you can not talk about this movie without talking about the bare swimming scene. I can only say yes, she is naked. Very exciting stuff. <br /> <br /> KEVIN: Wow. Just wow. When it comes to action and adventure, there's nothing that 'Tarzan and His Mate' offers a candle. The inevitable successor to Tarzan the Ape Man is an epic jungle, violent and daring. I doubt there will be another Tarzan film in the future that will not make prisoners this way. It would be hard for you to find a complete scene in this movie that has been Code Approved or Approved by Animal Rights. The cruel violence does not even wait for the happy couple to appear in the jungle before it even reaches the limits of today's adventure films. And after T & J has entered the picture, there is plenty of cuddling and naked afternoon swimming in the early morning. Convince yourself if you do not believe me. I love Maureen O'Sullivan especially in this movie. In the first film, Jane seemed to be a walking contradiction, as the authors did not know how to portray such a character. But here she is a great precursor to beat women of the later cinema. Although she still needs Tarzan's help to get her out of most jams, she does much more than wait for her to be saved. Her personality is absolutely believable for a woman who has been (relatively) comfortable in the jungle for one year. I looked at it with my mother and enjoyed watching how Jane Tarzan "trained" as Jeff Foxworthy put it. She has the monkey human at every opportunity. Although there are a lot of outdated optical effects throughout the movie, there is still a lot of hair-raising Tarzan vs. Predator battles that are (mostly) done for real. This and the monkey-clad men are much more convincing this time. ** SPOILER ** The movie reaches its climax as the jungle erupts with a shocking orgy of animal violence leaving Tarzan and Jane the only two humans left to breathe. Although the couple is riding back into the sunset and is victorious, I can not help but imagine what this story of the next safari will be like, which will be heard by the previous group of people who were looking for Tarzan and Jane, and of whom they are never heard again. ** END SPOILER ** One of the things that still bothers me is Johnny Weissmuller's sleek, hairless body and over-styling coif. Besides, this is an action adventure in front of the code that must be seen. <br /> <br /> Last movie: It Happened One Night (1934). Next movie: Twentieth Century (1934).
