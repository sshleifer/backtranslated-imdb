I just want to add my value of two cents and forgive myself if I repeat something that has already been published, but I think it's worth reminding people of the ubiquitous genius of Damon Runyon. Without the wonderful streets, the witty writings of Damon Runyon, this film would never have been made - even most of the other great classics dealing with players and the like before 1960. Damon Runyon worked as a newspaper man and was from Colorado, but he has dominated the street scene of the East Coast. If you're not an avid fan of old Hollywood comedies, I'd recommend a few other films from Damon Runyon's writings. "The Lemondrop Kid" and "Little Miss Marker" both show Bob Hope, who was always a funny man apart from his politics. (As a Liberal on the West Coast, I find his politics pretty funny too!) Damon Runyon lives !!!!
