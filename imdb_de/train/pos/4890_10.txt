Excellent cast, please more! <br /> <br /> If you can only catch something else from Plater (or those wonderful actors). For all those who do not know that Plater has a real sense of jazz, I recommend the "Beiderbecke" trilogy whenever you can. <br /> <br /> "There are three types of jazz: Hot, Cool and What time does the melody begin? '"
