If you're a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones or Action, this is a must. Directed by the Reputation Team of William Witney and John English and with Reed Hadley as Don Diego / Zorro, this series delivers! I will not bore you with the plot (who cares less talk less, fight more); What really matters is Hadley's superb interpretation of the characters and stunts of Dale van Sickel and Yakima Canutt. <br /> <br /> *** STUNT SPOILERS FOLLOW *** <br /> <br /> You can see what impact this movie had on Lucas and Spielberg - Zorro comes in the original version of Star Wars Waste Press in one Chapter, trapped on a suspension bridge in another Temple of Doom, performs a Raiders transfer from horse to bus and even flees through a tunnel as the villains overturn a huge water tank and flood the tunnel behind them, as does Mola Ram with Indy in Temple of Doom. In addition to all this, the whip action is great as Zorro disarms villains, gets himself out of harm's way with his reliable whip etc. Most of the work of the sword is quite lame, except in the first chapter, which features a grandiose swordplay in a sword / stunt legend Ralph Faulkner choreographed contains Cantina, which makes a rare appearance as a bad Rodriguez. This was the first series I saw on Matin√©e in Bijou when I was a kid, and I've loved it ever since. <br /> <br /> Zorro's Fighting Legion delivers "Z" merchandise!
