All the talents Mr. Sooraj Barjatya showed in his first three films were all a coincidence, as his fourth main ski Diwani Hoon was so bad. But I have to say that it was no coincidence. This guy is talented and the way he did Vivah is awesome. From the first scene it affects you. The sequences between Shahid and Amrita are great. The chemistry between these two actors gives insights between Srk and Kajol. As usual, Alok Nath is just as fantastic as the good and loving father, as is Anupam Kher. But it's a Shahid Amrita movie. Amrita looks good in most scenes, though Shahid looks a bit young to marry, but does a good job of being a shy but morally strong groom. This movie is especially loved by those who have experienced such beautiful moments in their lives. All in all a brilliant movie. Hats off to Mr. Sooraj Barjatya ...
