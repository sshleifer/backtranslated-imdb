First of all, I have to say that I'm Portuguese and it's not common for me to spend my time watching Portuguese films, probably one or the other every year ... And that Reason is the almost generalized notion between the Portuguese that the national images are awful, really close to the worst ever made! In the last decade, however, it surprised me when we recaptured the funny 40s, when "Leão da Estrela" and "Costa do Castelo" were among the best of their time, with films like "Pulsação Zero" or "Nula variety" by both Director Fernando Fragata as well as with some actors and common music. <br /> <br /> This one is good too, not the same kind, because he is not a real comedy; In fact, it's officially a drama, a women's drama that has unexpected funny parts because of funny characters or funny things that happen to them, like the hypothetical trip to the Caribbean, just to lie down. <br /> <br /> The storyline works and may surprise us a few times; the actors are doing well, the places regularly as a score; But the truth is that everything makes sense, then we can consider it as a nice effort for national cinema, which seems to start from the ashes as the phoenix. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch a Portuguese movie, surely you can choose a better option, but it is still one to be measured.
