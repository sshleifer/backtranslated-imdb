It was fabulous! Photography, editing, cinematography and music bring us to the dangerous side of a tourist destination. It was the enjoyment of "slumming" without running the risk. We have been there! The dream sequences and the end of the flashback sequence were fresh. It spoke to me. Keep it up! Another genre is the city of God. Also do not laugh! - the comedy, desperately looking for Susan. Beautiful ensembles with great performances of all. I'm sorry, I think Training Day fits this genre, with fantastic performances by an ensemble. I had to change the channel for some of the coarse-grained sequences, but all in all a great movie!
