The plot is really terrible, the atmosphere very depressing, unusual for such a low-budget production and at least for a German production. A bit of Indian spirituality, mystic thriller and Slasher movie mixed. The development of action and characters is great, the sets are very realistic, without studio atmosphere. It might be perfect, but unfortunately some things were a bit disappointing, which is not necessarily mandatory for low-budget films: <br /> <br /> 1.) The cast is sometimes no more than average. Almost every actor looks like a layman. Some of them do a good or very good job, but some act like actors in German court shows! But I was very, very disappointed by the acting of Mathieu Carri√®re! His acting (in many of his older films, his acting was fine) here was below average! But that could be the reason why he is taking part in crappy German soaps or TV shows on German channels today. <br /> <br /> 2.) The dialogues are sometimes at the soap opera level. <br /> <br /> 3.) The bad tone sometimes made it very hard to understand what the characters are saying. I saw it on DVD and was happy to be able to rewind and listen to it again. It is caused by the set (big rooms like in the hospital or in the esoteric group) and sometimes by the strange dialects of the actors! far beyond commercial films, which are often more terrifying.
