Anyone who has seen Mel Gibson's The Passion of Christ and was disturbed by the bloody violence wants to see this movie instead. Although it was not a success in the box office or TV ratings, the Fox Movie Channel still finds a really good motive to show this every year. I liked the way they trained Chris Sarandon and the men teaching his students in Hebrew. have sung. Although Sarandon did not have long hair, as did other Jesus in other films, his looks would be quite similar to that of a Jewish man. What surprised me or frightened me was the scene in which Caiaphas told Jesus of Pilate: "And do not forget that you are a Jew!" Although this may not have been a racist comment, Colin Blakely tried to make Chris Sarandon look like rubbish in the eyes of the celebrities of those days. Keith Michell's portrayal of Pilate was a hulking compared to his previous appearances in The Story of Jacob and Joseph and The Story of David. But if you compare his portrayal of Pilate with Telly Savalas or Hurd Hatfield, you can say that he painted the impression of a Roman procurator really well.
