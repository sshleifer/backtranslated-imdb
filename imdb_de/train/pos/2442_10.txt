By allowing the inhabitants of Fethard to be old enough to remember the events, the film is pretty accurate (though they insist that the filmmakers invented some of the more violent scenes just to cheer up the action). > <br /> The film was very unpopular in Ireland because it portrayed the Catholic Church in a bad light, but the simple fact is that representatives of the Catholic Church organized vetoes of minorities (before Protestants, it was the Jews). <br /> <br /> The film offers a fascinating insight into the whole topic of religion in Ireland
