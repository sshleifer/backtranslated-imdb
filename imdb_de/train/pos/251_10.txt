"If Ned Kelly had been born later, he would probably have won a Victoria Cross in Gallipolli." That was Ned's courage. <br /> <br /> In Australia and especially in Victoria, the name Ned Kelly can be said and recognized immediately. In Greta, he is still a hero, the blood of the city of Jerilderie depends on the tourism he has created. In Mansfield they still have not forgotten that the three policemen he "murdered" came from there. <br /> <Many of the buildings he visited in his life are still standing. From Old Melbourne Gaol, where he was hanged, to the post office, he stayed in Jerilderie. A cell in which he was once held in Greta can be seen in Benella, and the site of Ann Jones' Hotel, the train station and even the logs in which he was captured in Glenrowan can be visited. Evidence from All The events in the movie (with the exception of his love interest) are found all over Victoria, in police records, and even in the sash Ned was awarded for salvaging Dick Shelton. None of this is wrong and what was left out would further justify Neds's actions. The horse that "stole" Ned was stolen by Wild Wright (the man Ned ceded after leaving the prison). Ned was already in jail when the horse was reported stolen so he could not steal it. The Jerilderie letter is more than what was said before. It is not a justification in itself, it is Ned's biography, an overview of what he stood for and whom he protected. So read it, watch the movie and choose what Ned stood for.
