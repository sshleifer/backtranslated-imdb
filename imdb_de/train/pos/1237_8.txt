This was a very original decent movie and a courageous move for everyone involved. I do not care if it's not the best composed movie of all time, the fact that Eddie Murphy does something unformal and I do not know what's going to happen next makes him a favorite of mine. I wish more films would be as imaginative as these and not the same old formula for entertainment.
