Ok, that's a couple of weeks late, but it's here. Mostly this is due to statements of various negative nature. Starting with the technology. When Star Trek: TOS ran, the technology for special effects was extremely low and, in addition, the crew had little money to make the right models. In the 35 years when its TOS premiered, the crew of Star Trek has become experts in economics. Ultimately, they've rightly opted for me, the look of TOS and the reverse engineered TNG et al. What if they had decided not to make the transporter out of gold glitter or make the phase pistols look closer to those of Star Trek II? As for the Nissen who were selected through initial contact with the Klingon Empire, it was assumed, based on comments by Kirk and Riker, that the Earth did not hit the Klingons until 2200. Nothing was firmly anchored. <br /> <br /> Enterprise gives us the most promising location of exploration we have seen for some time. That's what Voyager COULD. No series can develop without a few inconsistencies, but be grateful that Star Trek has so few. So stop grabbing and enjoying.
