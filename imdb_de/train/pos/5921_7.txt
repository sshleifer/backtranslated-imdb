I was the production accountant in this movie, and I also had to do some voice-over work on it, so I'm not completely unbiased, but if it was terrible, I would say so. I thought it was an entertaining movie, not a critically acclaimed masterpiece, but there was a lot of laughter on the way. The Bible says that laughing acts like a medicine, so watching this movie could be beneficial to your health. <br /> <br /> So many of the performers in this picture had not reached their peak at the time we were recorded, this movie. Of course, Susan Sarandon is one that has since become much better known. Melanie Mayron was weekly seen as a photographer in the TV series "Thirty-Something". Robert Englund later became known as Freddie Krueger, who still pursues people's dreams. One of my personal favorite actors on this show was Dub Taylor, who played the sheriff. He was an outstanding comedic actor and a really nice, sincere person. We all had fun at the show and I think the fun comes through.
