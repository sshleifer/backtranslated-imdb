To celebrate Earth Day, Disney released the movie "Earth". We stay well behind any shrill message of darkness and destruction, and are treated to great images of animals in their habitats without being too ashamed. <br /> <br /> The stars of the show are a herd of elephants. a family of polar bears and a whale and his calf. The narrative begins at the North Pole and goes south until we reach the tropics, being introduced to the inhabitants of the different climate zones. <br /> <br /> Global warming is mentioned as we look at the migrations of the polar world Bear; It is pointed to the shrinking sea ice islands of recent years. We never see the bears catch seals, but the father's desperate search leads him to a dangerous solution. <br /> <br /> The aerial photos of caribou wandering through the tundra are one of the most spectacular wildlife pictures I've ever seen. it and another of migratory game birds are enough to reward the ticket price to see them on the big screen. <br /> <br /> One of the disappointments I felt was that otherwise awesome shots of White Sharks were filmed slow motion. You never get the impression of a quality of wild animals; her incredible speed. The idea of ​​slowing down the movie to give a great deal of speed, I believe, started with (or is it the first thing I remember) the TV show "Kung Fu" in the early 1970s. <br /> <br /> An Interesting Sidelight During the final credits, some demonstrations of the cinematographic techniques used are revealed. There are enough dramatic, humorous and educational moments in this film to make it a solid choice for nature lovers. Perhaps because of some selective editing (which, so to speak, spare us from the cruel end of a predator's moment) and the fact that this material was released in 2007 and is available on DVD, it's a solid movie. And you can take your children with you! <br /> <br /> Three stars.
