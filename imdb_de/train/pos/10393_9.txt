Let's make a long story short. I enjoyed every minute. A lavish fantasy in the true style of the Arabian Nights. There is a bad magician, a pretty princess, a jinn, and everyone lives happily ever after. The modern Hollywoond certainly has one or two things to learn from this classic. The only quibble: The special effects are quite outdated (loved Sabu with the foot of the djinn!)
