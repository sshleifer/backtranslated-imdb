I've been waiting for this movie for a long time. The promos gave a good idea about the content and when I finally saw it, I found it to be really good. Most of the traditional romantic films end with the final marriage of the lovers or the beginning of a happy life after marriage, but for this transition from an old life to a new relationship and a new life a great adaptation is required. This film is all about the time when a newlywed couple, Fardeen and Esha, marry through an arranged marriage and begin their honeymoon. Acting is literally literal, though I think Esha has stayed a bit quiet and she could have used a few lines for herself. The story was well knit and dialogues were more or less appropriate. The cut and the instructions were also good, Meghna Gulzar did a really good job here. In conclusion, I would say that it is a good drama with romance, a true combination of what Bollywood can offer a clean entertainer.
