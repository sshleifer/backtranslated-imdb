Throughout the country and especially in the political landscape, people with any political ambition should take their time to see this movie. The film is called "City Hall" and can be played with little imagination anywhere in America. It's just like opening in New York. Here is the story of a popular politician named mayor John Pappas (Al Pacino), who has enough knowledge to run a metropolis with little effort. His right-hand man is none other than Deputy Mayor Kevin Calhoun (John Cusack), an equally smart person whose ambitions are tied to his mentor and both were earmarked for higher office. Everything points in that direction until a police shooter initiates an investigation led by Marybeth Cogan (Bridget Fonda) that believes the blame points to the town hall and mayor. A six-year-old boy and a police officer are charged with the death of a career criminal whose questionable freedom leads to an apparent cover-up of political settlements and corruption in the city, involving union leaders such as Danny Aiello, played by Frank Anselmo, and corrupt judicial officials like Judge are Walter Stern. (Martin Landau) and mafia bosses like Paul Zapatti (Anthony Franciosa), who are deeply involved. Also involved are party officials such as Larry Schwartz (Richard Schiff), who works for the Probation Office of New York. But it is the connection between the mayor and his deputy who is questioned by the accidental shooting. A great vehicle for Cusack and a sure competitor that is becoming a classic. ****
