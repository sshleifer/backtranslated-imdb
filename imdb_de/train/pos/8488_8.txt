I just have to insert my two cents. Relax, it's a comedy. Yes, the characters are mostly widely written and acted. I can not think of many comedies where they are not. This is not a new version, it is video-released and cable-coded almost every week. Would I see it in a theater? Sure, I did it when it first came out. It's funny ... that should be enough. <br /> <br /> Even if I did not like it at all, I would still see it on the cable for Michael Keaton. He is an underrated and underrated actor. I can not imagine anyone else so capable in any genre. I also can not think of someone who is so successful. A comedic actor who is also an action star (short-lived but still) who also plays a romantic lead role and is also a dramatic actor. a villain and a hero. I can not imagine, at least not in Hollywood. Certainly not one who has been successful in all these genres. I mean, there's Tom Cruise, but for me he's better to become Tom Cruise than a character. However, this is not about Michael Keaton. Tom Cruise, so I'll go on. <br /> <br /> Gung Ho is worth renting, damn it, it's worth buying since you can probably find it at Wal-Mart for $ 10.00 or less in stores. It pays to look over cables (if you have cable or satellite). It's fun to watch movies. You can pause your brain and just relax and giggle. <br /> <br /> In my honest opinion, asking too much is asking too much.
