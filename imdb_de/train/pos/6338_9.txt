I really liked this movie. I've seen the original classic a few times, but I could barely remember details. I think this movie is way better than the cartoon, it's not as black and white as it is. I especially liked how they made Grinch such a complete character, why he was the way he was. The villain in this movie was not the real Grinch, but the major. Jim Carrey was perfect for the part, a great movie for kids and adults.
