Jim Carrey can do anything. I thought this would be a silly, childish movie, and that was not TOTALLY. It was so incredibly fun for ALL, adults and kids. I once saw it because it was almost out of cinemas and now it's FINALLY released on DVD on Tuesday and I'm too excited, as you can see. You should definitely see it if you have not done so, it was so great! <br /> <br /> Liz
