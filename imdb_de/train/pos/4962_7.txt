"The Brak Show" is good. Probably not on the same level as "Aqua Teen Hunger" or "Space Ghost Coast to Coast", but definitely there are many brilliant moments. Basically, the life of Zorak and Brak follows a normal life and you go to school and live in a neighborhood in the style of the 50s sitcoms. The humor and animation of this show are very similar to "Aqua Teen Hunger" (and in one episode you could see Meatwad) with bizarre situations and strange characters. But it's good, it has funny parts. Some of the songs are great, others not very, but I like this show. The funniest character is the father of Brak. (this is a human, nobody knows why)
