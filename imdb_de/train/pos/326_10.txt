"Jag är nyfiken Yellow" is a lot of fun. Like at least one other reviewer, I laughed a lot on numerous occasions. Yellow is energetic, playful, self-confident, explorative. Do not expect Bergman here. This film is about an adolescent between the beginning and the middle of the 60s in Sweden, and about the problems that were in this country and in the world, read * Contradictions *. Occasionally, Yellow appears to be a serious social-political documentary, with Lena as the lead character and others interviewing both ordinary people and politicians (eg, Olaf Palme at home). At other times, Yellow seems to parody this type of documentation. Meanwhile, Yellow acts as a personal documentary exploring Lena's life - her domestic life, her love, her political views and her view of herself. Is she a complete person? complex, flawed, contradictory, happy, sad, curious. And all of this is the wonderful added dimension of director Sjöman and his crew documenting themselves and documenting Lena. It's what yellow wings really give me. Not only do they appear suddenly in very funny times and witty ways, reminding the viewer that it is fiction and artistry, but their presence is itself another layer of the film; They film themselves. I remember a Bjork music video of the same quality. a music video about creating a music video, ad infinitum, where every iteration becomes stranger and cartoonier. I think Sjöman might have something similar in mind. While "Jag är nyfiken Yellow" may not be for everyone, it's definitely smart, funny, refreshing, alive and authentic.
