Uggh! I was really not impressed with this movie, though I have to admit it's technically good. For very high production values ​​it gets a 7, but for entertainment values ​​it is rather poor. I think this is one of the most overrated films of the 50s. It won the Oscar for Best Picture, but the film is sometimes boring with so much dancing and dancing and dancing. This is because, unlike some musicals that have a reasonable number of songs along with a strong history and acting (like MEET ME IN ST. LOUIS), this film almost exclusively sings and dances. In fact, this movie has about the longest song and dance number in history, and if you are not familiar with it, the movie will bore you quickly. Give me more history! As a result, with over-production and a weak history, this film is like a constant meringue diet - it simply can not satisfy in the long run. <br /> <br /> Thinking ... This is the movie that turned down "A Streetcar Named Desire" and "A Place in the Sun" for the best picture! And worse, "The African Queen" and "Ace in the Hole" were not even nominated in this category! Even more amazing to me is that "Ace in the Hole" was lost to Best Writing, a screenplay for this film - though "An American in Paris" had little to tell a story and was driven mainly by dance and song.
