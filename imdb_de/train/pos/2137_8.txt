This is far more than the charming story of a middle-aged man who discovers the pleasures of ballroom dancing (though it does). It is the story of a person who has learned to love life again, pushing the pressure of work and money to rejoice. The bonus in this film is a fascinating insight into the slowly changing attitudes of modern Japan towards anything from the ballroom to body contact. There are scenes that will make you laugh ... a few in which you want to do tango ... and many others where you just feel good. <br /> <br /> This is a great introduction to contemporary Japanese filmmaking for those who may feel that all Japanese films are "heavy" and inaccessible. <br /> <br />
