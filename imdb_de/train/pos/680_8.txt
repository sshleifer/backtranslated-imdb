"The Last Wave" is one of those films that rely heavily on the mind. The title refers to the theory of the Aboriginal Doomsday: There will be a final wave that obliterates everything. David Burton (Richard Chamberlain) is a Sydney lawyer who defends some of the Aboriginal homicidal assassins. At that time, there were unusually heavy rains in Australia. While defending the Aborigines, David learns the last wave theory and begins to wonder if it is just a mythology. The final sequence of the film is a metaphor for descending into the depths of one's own mind. Peter Weir has created a confusing but thought provoking film. Native American actor David Gulpilil (whom you may have seen in "Walkabout", "Crocodile Dundee" and "Rabbit Proof Fence") has an interesting minor role as one of the defendants. <br /> <br /> If it's a coincidence, check out the "Making of" feature on the DVD. Peter Weir explains some of the film's undertones, some of which are related to Richard Chamberlain's background.
