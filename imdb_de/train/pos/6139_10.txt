A great movie. Lansbury and Tomlinson are perfect, the songs are wonderful, the dances, with a special mention for the "Portobello Ballet", are beautiful. As far as the animated part is concerned, the game between animals has become a classic. the climax with the attack of the fittings is soothing and fascinating. I recommend the restored 134-minute version or at least the 112-minute video. Here in Italy we only have the 98-minute version, though the film was featured in its original release at 117 minutes. If possible, check out the German videotape: it was generated from the 98 minutes, but it lacks any reference to the Second World War and all scenes between Englishmen and their Nazi invaders!
