This movie is the best of Jackie. I still can not get enough of seeing some of his best stunts. I also like the bad guys in this movie (the old man looks like a Chinese version of John Howard). Unlike other works by Jackie, this movie also has a great story and I recommend it to all fans of Jackie.
