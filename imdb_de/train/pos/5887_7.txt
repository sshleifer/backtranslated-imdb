So Mary and Rhoda have aged - who is not? I was a teenager when Mary had premiere, and a "young adult" when he left the air. Yes, it was great to see Mary and Rho together, and yes, maybe the movie did not support the comedy series of the original series, but there were plenty of moments that recalled the spirit of the show to pay tribute to it. Example: The producer who hires Mary and then dictates the idea for a new series about "old people". Is not that typical of the mentality of today's Hollywood TV and "bean counter" movie? This may not be the best of THE MARY TYLER MOORE SHOW - but it's a damn good retrospective of one of the best shows we grew up with in the 70's.
