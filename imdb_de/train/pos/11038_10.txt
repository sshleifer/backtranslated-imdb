I was thrilled from beginning to end. A big horror comes from disturbing images and organic shocks that are not made to make you jump, but cause you to go "What the hell have I just seen?" All other commentators gave brief summaries of what the movie is about, so I will not repeat what has been said before. I told other people about this movie after I saw it, just because it was still haunting me. I even had a bad dream after seeing it and I'm a real horror fanatic who is not easily startled by trips like "The Grudge" or even "Silent Hill". What brought me the bad dreams was the discomfort of what I would do if I were in this cell with these guys. What would my personal horror be? My subconscious brought me there and it was not pleasant. That my friends are a good horror movie for you! The best part about this movie is that it is subtle. It's not about Bogeymen jumping on you, about foreign invasions or tons of blood. It is the opposite. The horror that you create in your mind. The irony of the four characters is that the horror does not emanate from an outside force that claims their power over them. The men just ask for what they desire, and they get it ... but not as they had imagined. On the one hand, they get what they want from an occult book, but in the end they wish they had not. Sometimes it is best to be locked up in a prison cell!
