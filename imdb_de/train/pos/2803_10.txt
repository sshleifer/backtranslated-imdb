As a former two-time Okinawan karate champion, I like movies about sports victims. But this movie is about much more. This movie is so good and so deep. I was recently plagued by very serious injuries and had a pretty catastrophic lack of passion. Almost light for me. And that stupid little movie has touched me so deeply that it reminds me asleep of what life is about. This is a movie about life. Live your life for you and respect for others. Authorization. God bless "Bend it like Beckham" I think it's a true gem.
