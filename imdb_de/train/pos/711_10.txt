"Rock 'n' Roll High School" will probably have to go down in history as the ultimate rebellious party movie. The entire movie is a mile a minute and features a number of high school students who use Ramones music as inspiration to rise up against their despotic patron (Mary Woronov, famed by "Eating Raoul"). It's basically a great excuse to have fun, and I'm sure you'll do it. Intimidated newbies? Check. A dorky music teacher (Paul Bartel, also from "Eating Raoul" *)? Check. Mice explode? Checkmate. Anyway, that makes life worth living. Even for someone like me who does not know the music of the Ramones, it's pure pleasure. How can we expect anything less with Roger Corman, who works as producer and Joe Dante co-director? Too bad that director Allan Arkush later degenerated at prices such as "Caddyshack II". <br /> <br /> Also with PJ Soles, Vincent Van Patten, Clint Howard, Dey Young and Dick Miller (who in each of ... Joe Dante's films and many of Roger Cormans), Don Steele and of course the Ramones. A real treat. <br /> <br /> * Bartel and Voronov seem to have always played. They also played in Joe Dante's "Hollywood Boulevard" and the Slasher strip "Chopping Mall" (also with Dick Miller) ... in which they played their roles of "Eating Raoul" again.
