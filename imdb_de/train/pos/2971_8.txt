I found this movie very funny, I loved how it developed from the politics of modern sport. This movie is not as fun as South Park, but pretty funny. And since I'm a sports fanatic, I've loved making fun of some of the more ridiculous things in sport. This movie is also great for non-sports lovers, probably even better for them, as they have to explore life and wonder why people get so close to the sport, when there are so many crazy rules and complications for sports, and that absolutely nothing means. I also found the actual game interesting, it's a kind of horse with bases and psyche-outs (for the person who shoots). Overall, I recommend you to watch this movie, and I believe that you will love this movie. If this style of comedy is not your favorite, you probably will not like it. (but that is with every comedy movie)
