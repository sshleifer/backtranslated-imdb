I fell in love with this quiet action drama. Kurt Russell and only Kurt Russell could have played that well. Todd (Kurt Russell) grew up from childhood and has learned nothing of war and struggle. He is being dumped on a planet after he was overtaken by genetically modified soldiers - SOLDIER. Not Rambo, not Schwarzenegger, not Bruce Willis, not Mel Gibson, not Jason Statham - Kurt Russell has that role and has made it his original, courageous and all-too-human role. I miss the fact that sequels were never made. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> my belief: http://www.angelfire.com/ny5/jbc33/
