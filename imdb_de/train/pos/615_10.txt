This is the epitome of fairy tales! The bad guys are totally evil and the heroes are refreshingly pure. Danes, Deniro and Pfieffer are just as wonderful as the new actor who plays the role of Tristan. Outstanding performances, delightful magic, witty and dramatic, and a perfect fairytale ending make this movie absolutely fantastic! I am not so sure that all content is suitable for younger children, but for an older audience there are many funny subtleties! The previews do not do justice to this film! My fianc√©e and I were quite skeptical, but were so excited that we had a chance at this film, that I can only hope that anyone who is on the fence about this film can try it!
