The League of Gentlemen is one of the funniest, strangest, darkest and most memorable comedies of our time. So it has pave the way for more comedies, many of which have copied the style, but have never succeeded. <br /> <br /> Unlike any other sketch, the characters of the League of Gentlemen are all loosely connected. First, they all live in the fictional town of Royston Vasey, behind the northern parts of England. <br /> <br /> The first characters to welcome newcomers are Tubbs and Edwrad, the pig-faced owners of a supposedly local shop that is so far away that most residents are unlikely to know of its existence. Other curiosities are: the Denton family with an obsession of hygiene, chastity and toads; Hillary Briss, who sells a special but thankfully unknown meat brand; Pauline, a recovery officer with a sharp tongue and even sharper pens; Mr. Chinnery, kind-hearted vet and threat to all four-legged friends; Geoff tips, a plastic vendor with mean humor, often with guns, electric hoses and. , , , , , , PLUM !!!!! <br /> <br /> Although comedy is a comedy, the League of Gentlemen often goes beyond genres without seeming to be faked or to rip off other people's material. There are several horror references such as the disappearance of a wanderer, two silent twins, an obsessed circus owner and a sudden burst of nosebleed. Even more striking are moments in which the series takes on a rather sour tone and the above named characters like Pauline and Geoff appear in a more likable, vulnerable light. The movie adaptation is the best demonstration of this, but some fans may opt for local. <br /> <br /> The equally undervalued third series also takes a different route, rather than sketches, each episode focuses on a single character An action that leads to a conclusion that includes a plastic bag and a runaway theater van includes. Although many fans do not like the structure of the movie or the third series as much as the first two, they are certainly a sign of how inventive The League of Gentlemen can be and how scary it is to explore new territories. <br /> <In short, The League of Gentlemen is definitely worth a look, as the welcome signs say: YOU WILL NEVER LEAVE!
