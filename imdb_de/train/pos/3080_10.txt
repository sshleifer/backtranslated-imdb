I complained to ABC about the cancellation of six degrees. If enough people do the same thing, it could be enough to bring this fabulous show back to life !! Just go to the official site and the rest is easy enough. I do not understand why this show was canceled. What a fantastic show, cast and characters. The whole concept is exciting! I am amazed that my favorite show is over after only one series. Why is this? Six degrees are phenomenal, it's better than so many other TV programs out there! Until I heard that they were holding it from a friend, I had not even remembered that this could happen.
