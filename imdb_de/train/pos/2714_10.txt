This was one of those wonderful, rare moments in TV that I wish I'd recorded on VHS forever. Will it never be air again? <br /> <br /> It was so creative and I remember it aired once a week and waiting for the next episode was agonizing. I want to see everything again. I want to buy it. I want what I can not have. Not even on EBAY. <br /> <br /> So, enough tired, it was by far one of the best series of the 80s. It should be considered a classic, but lost in space. At least this website and Wikipedia mention it. Sobbing. <br /> <br /> It was extremely appealing, funny, coquettish and original. Maybe not like Sherlock Holmes original, I think Quintin is much more attractive and has a better chance with his leading lady than the stiff and chalky Holmes ever.
