This movie was excellent. A sad truth about how culture collides with the sexes. This is just a big, warm, blurry movie. They have a master who has tradition and is kind in his own way. Doggie, although he is a girl to win his affection, and you crown it with a cute monkey with a thousand facial expressions. This is a great happy movie in the end. This film shows very well how traditional one can be. He is so mixed up that he is ready to die without sharing his secrets. They see pages of an unprecedented culture that supports the drama that unfolds at the end of the picture. The cinema photography is excellent, especially the opening parade with all the radio operators. For the best foreign film in Oscar competition.
