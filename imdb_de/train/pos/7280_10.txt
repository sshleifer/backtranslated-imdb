to see as a child. Although I think it's probably horrible now, it was kind of scary, since I was only seven years old. I also remember working on a Saturday afternoon puzzle while watching it. Since then, the scene with the rolling boulders has burned into my mind. I asked many people if they saw this streak, but to no avail. Twelve years ago, a person mentioned that he might have seen it, but he just thought it was a dream; an imaginative touch like wind. It's not a dream, my friend. Not dreaming now I have not seen it since then, but I can not wait to find a copy and stuff it into my VCR. Everything that can be anchored in my mind's eye for 23 years deserves a '10'.
