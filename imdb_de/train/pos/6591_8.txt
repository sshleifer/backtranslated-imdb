The invisible is a show everyone must love! It reminds me of the series of the old 80s (A-Team, Airwolf, Ritter). The special effects are small, but very effective. Most importantly, the fun with which they shot this series. It really shows! the whole cast fits perfectly in their roles and it looks like they can do what they want !! especially Paul Ben Victor and Vincent Ventresca. Ventresca really shines in this one! For me, it is unbelievable that an actor with so much sarcasm is his acting style. He gets no chance in a big movie (Mr. Tarantino, this was the show you should have directed! Instead of the big boring grave danger (csi)) show if you can. It is worth it !!!
