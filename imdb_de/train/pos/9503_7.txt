Somewhat slow and boring, the story of an old man and his wife living in a rundown building, smoking with a steady cast of characters like the postman, the brothers sitting on the porch, and the wealthy cigar. The photography of the river is wonderful, as well as the interior design. If you like the decoration of Banana Republic shops, this is a must.
