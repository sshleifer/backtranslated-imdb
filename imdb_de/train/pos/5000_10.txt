Creature Comforts in America should have been published on another network or at least had the chance to get its entire episode sequence. Unfortunately, this was not the case. Considering that the American public has (seemingly) the attention of a mosquito when it comes to humor that does not consist of profane diatribesia or deals with skatological functions (both sounds and smells), such shows will only be a few between. One of the main problems was that, brilliant as it was, it was made for a rude audience that knew what to expect, but was viewed by audiences and boardrooms who had no idea what they were seeing. Which is sad, but not unexpected. I would have liked to see at least three more seasons of this show, even though it was produced for direct DVD release. The material and the interactions between the creatures were full of subcontext and there were other conversations that were just waiting to be beneath the surface. Thanks to political correctness, however, such talks only take place in my head.
