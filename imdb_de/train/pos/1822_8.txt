An unforgettable masterpiece by the creator of The Secret of Nimh and The Land Before Time. This was a very touching, bittersweet cartoon. I remember my childhood very well, it was funny and sad and very nice. Well, it starts a bit dark, a dog that has fled the pound and is killed by an old friend, lands in the sky and comes back. But it gets sweet when he befriends an orphaned girl who can talk to animals. Some scenes were a bit scary, unlike other cartoons, like Charlie's dream sequence, but everything else was fine and the songs were fair. A memorable role from Burt Reynolds and Dom DeLuise. I love this guy, ahehehe. And Judith Barsi of Jaws The Revenge, may God rest her soul, poor girl, she did not deserve to die, but she is in heaven now, all good people are going to heaven. Overall, this is a very good animated film, a Don Bluth classic enough to embarrass anime and disney. Recommended for the whole family. And you know, if you have the original video of it, look for the movie, Dom DeLuise has a very important and special message, I have to love this guy, ahehehe.
