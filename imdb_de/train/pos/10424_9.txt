Since musicals have both gone out of fashion and are incredibly expensive without having all the talent necessary to win a studio, we will undoubtedly get a real story from Enrico Caruso. <br /> <br /> But if everything else was there, it was no coincidence that no Hollywood studio would do the job until Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer had Mario Lanza under contract. Nobody could have done it, I doubt it will ever be tried again. <br /> <br /> And why should it be so? I think Enrico Caruso himself would have been satisfied with how his singing was portrayed on screen. For his tenor voice was his life, his reason for being on earth. <br /> <br /> To say that liberties have been made with his life is modest. Caruso was like the man who portrayed him, a man of great appetite, although he had much more self-discipline. He had numerous relationships with several women and fathered two illegitimate sons who are not in this film. <br /> <br /> His contribution to the record industry is almost considered retroactive. He was shown in a recording studio once late in his life. In fact, he started recording at the turn of the century and together with Irish tenor John McCormack for RCA, Victor made the record industry what it became. <br /> <br /> When Caruso and McCormack were in high gear, you had to virtually inherit a ticket to see if any of them were performing live. But many Italian and Irish immigrant families had a phonograph and one or three of these men. Because of this, both became the legends that they are. <br /> <br /> What the film has to offer are some beautifully staged opera arias by Mario Lanza, a taste of what he might have become if he had been the discipline of a Caruso staying with the opera. The Great Caruso won an Academy Award for sound recordings and received nominations for costume and stage design. Mario himself contributed to the popularization of the film with an RCA Red Seal album from The Great Caruso. Unfortunately we could not get a cast album with Ann Blyth, Dorothy Kirsten and Jarmila Novotna because of contractual obligations. <br /> <br /> Although Blyth sang it in the movie, Lanza had a big hit recording of The Love's Night of the Year, which helps to popularize The Great Caruso. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a life of Enrico Caruso, this is not true. If you're looking for a great artist to sing at the height of his career, you should not miss The Great Caruso.
