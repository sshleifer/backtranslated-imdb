This movie is well done on so many levels that I'm impressed that the score is as low as it is (5.9 / 10 (576 votes) at the time of release). This movie has incredible special effects, a true epic storyline, complex great character interactions and breathtaking battles - they must be seen to be believed! The only complaint I have is the subtitles on the HK DVD version that I got (some lines were not translated - ???). <br /> <br /> I do not understand this when I read from different sources and I hear, "It has a confusing plot ...", "I could not follow the story ..." or "Characters came from nowhere ... ". The very first time I saw this movie, I understood, followed, knew why the characters were there, and I absolutely loved it! I have seen it about 8 times and it is a real pleasure every time. Oh, and that's not just my opinion, because I've shown this movie to many Americans (people who have never seen a HK movie) that are the same. None of them has not followed the plot and everyone has declared his love for this film. Oh man, why can not we get something like that from Hollywood? At least Lord of the Rings had a nice combination of special effects, character development and storyline. <br /> <br /> This does not come from an Asian movie lover. I have an extensive library of Asian films and I have to say that this movie is one of my biggest DVDs. If you see it, you'll be overwhelmed by the amazing special effects and epic feel of this movie. They are drawn into this fantasy world and do not want to go anymore! I have seen both the 1983 version and the 2001 version (both from Tsui Hark), and the 2001 version is much better compared to IMO. <br /> <br /> Besides the subtitles, I have another complaint about this movie: I did not want it to stop ... I implore you, Mr. Hark - can we have a sequel, please?
