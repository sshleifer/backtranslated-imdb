That was a good movie. It was not a typical war movie, but something else. This movie showed us recruits who trained before the war and did not really wage war. This movie is one of the more realistic views on war and army than most other films like this one. Colin Farrel did a great job in recruiting a soldier, and Clifton Collins Jr. and Matthew Davis contributed reasonably well. Seeing Colin Farrel transition from b-class to class in a few years, you never thought it would happen. I would also like to add that the makers of tigerland made a great movie in 2000 and made it look like 1970 was a good thing. It is good to see that talent is used wisely, and I hope that this talent can be seen again in the near future.
