This long episode is full of amazing surprises, thrillers, mysteries and concerns about a Sherlock joke against Charles Augustus Milverton, a blackmail master. This is an excellent run by Jeremy Brett-Holmes. The film features the usual Holmes guns as Inspector Lestrade and Mrs. Hudson, though not a Moriarty, but a major villain, Charles Augustus is exciting completion. This is a special Sherlock movie, but we find that Holmes falls in love with a servant, is kissed, cried, and even robbed. This time along with the episode "Scandal in Boheme" with Irene Adler, this is the only one that falls in love with Holmes. First-class board performance, he is next to Peter Cushing the best Sherlock television, while Basil Rathbone is in the cinema forever. Brett plays a determined, obstinate, impulsive wisdom. Here, Doctor Watson is not a comic nicknamed by Nigel Bruce, a thug and awkward friend, but an ingenious and sly partner well-embodied by Edward Hardwicke, a perfect counterpoint to Brett. Casting is honestly great, especially Robert Hardy mentions as perceptive evil. Hardy, now famous for his role as Cornelius Fudge in Harry Potter, is an accomplished actor with a forty-year career and multiple hits such as The 10th Kingdom and Winston Churchill. Secondary actors appear with grandiose performances, including Nickolas Grace, Sophie Gordon, Serena Gordon. The movie gets a colorful atmosphere, the London streets and the house of 221 Baker Street are well designed. The film is well directed by Peter Hammond, director of various episodes. It's a must for the Arthur Conan Doyle fans.
