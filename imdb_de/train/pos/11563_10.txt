I saw that many years after the TV series and initially did not care. Then, as my memory of the series faded over time, I looked again and thought it was weird. Based on Neil Simon's play, it has not opened much for the big screen, and that's one of his strengths. Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon are brilliant as Oscar and Felix, and the side cast is wonderful, especially John Fielder as "Vinnie". Certain moments can even bring me to tears of laughter - Felix interrupts the Oscar in the middle of a ball game with a dinner request, Oscar shatters and chases Felix in the apartment, the giggling 'Pigeon Sisters' knocked down by Felix's sobbing stories, and of course the legendary cafeteria scene (later ripped off by Nora Ephron's "When Harry Met Sally"). Crisp dialogue. When the boys think Felix overdosed, Oscar says, "They could be vitamins, he could be the healthiest in the room!" Fantastic!
