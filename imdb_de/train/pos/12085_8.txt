Shirley MacLaine in another tailor-made role. An aunt for a single mother in a Chicago working-class district in 1962, the veteran actress once again trains as a brave woman who does not let herself be beaten by setbacks. The children, a young girl and a young girl, are attracted to her spirited aunt Zoe, though the many magic tricks and practical jokes were learned from her and used on all the wrong occasions to eventually drive her out of school the Cuba crisis embedded with all social implications. Men built bomb shelters, people saw news broadcasts on what appeared to be the only television set, in a diner, and there was a general mist of unrest and fear in the air. When a "harmless" miracle is blown out of proportions, the viewer still feels comfortable with the climatic conclusion. Yes, Virginia, tomorrow the sun will rise! It is clearly a production on a small budget. This is still a sweet little movie filled with the magic that made the Sunday Matinees. With a few selected "oldies" thrown into an effective soundtrack, the whole family will surely enjoy it. ****
