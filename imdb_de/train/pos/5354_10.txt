Why did not Dynamo wear pants? Where did you go?? It was never explained. That's why this movie was so great. Plus Starsky gave his kids AIDS !!!! Great actors. Richard Dawson deserves the best supporting actor! A I D S My favorite line from the movie was "That was just right" A I D S. This movie was for the "birds". I tried to give this movie the "Stinkeye", but it kept going. What am I doing wrong???!!!! I thought the "HATEBOAT" would be lustignol;) I would like that for a show. Why did not Dynamo wear pants? I know that his arm was impaled, but ... What's up with those crazy future networks? Why did not this family feud Ray Combs get a net? He could have used one. AIDSSSSS
