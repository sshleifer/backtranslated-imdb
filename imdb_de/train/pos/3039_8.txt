Frank McCarthy, who produced the Oscar-winning award-winning biographic film Patton, haunts him with a strong tribute to another US combatant, Douglas MacArthur. Gregory Peck describes the man, his genius and his egoism strongly. With MacArthur you never knew exactly where one started and the other stopped, and too often they mingled. The whole story of Douglas MacArthur would be a six-hour movie or a TV miniseries. It would cover him from his days of marginal positions with his family until his time at West Point, where he still has the highest scholastic average a cadet has ever achieved. It would speak about his service in the Philippines as a young officer, his legend, who encouraged on the battlefields of the First World War in France. It would also have to tell him that he had fired on the veterans of the Bonus Marchers of World War 1 in 1932, which would probably have supported the final Kabosh on the chances that President Herbert Hoover had for reelection. In the last few years of MacArthur, he and Hoover had penthouse suites at the Waldorf Astoria in New York City. That must have been an issue that they avoided. <br /> <br /> This film focuses on the years 1941 to 1952 and is told in a retrospective. The film begins with MacArthur's address to the student body in 1962. When MacArthur speaks the words of the famous Duty Honor Country speech, he goes back to World War II and his desperate struggle against the aspiring Japanese on the island of Corregidor and the fields of Bataan on Luzon. The film takes him through his struggle for the reconquest of the Philippines, the occupation of Japan and the first 18 months culminating in his relief of the command by President Truman. MacArthur would be a movie that would not work if not the portrayals of Dan O'Herlihy and Ed Flanders as Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman. It was the part of the film that I enjoyed best when I saw MacArthur and his relationships with these two men. O'Herlihy's FDR captures the aristocratic squire and the exceptionally insidious man who was our 32nd president. Roosevelt was a man who taught his points with unusual sophistication and wisdom. Sometimes he liked it a bit too much for his own sake, but he was the politician of the last century. Note how he simultaneously deals with MacArthur as a battlefield commander and potential rival. <br /> <br /> Truman of Flanders, as people remember him, is a dumb spoken man of the people who disliked MacArthur's arrogance from the gitgo. Of course it is in the history books, as Truman MacArthur relieved in 1951 because of insubordination. MacArthur was undoubtedly indefinite. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, I could write a whole thesis about the relationship between Truman and MacArthur. There never had to be a crisis on the way. I always had the feeling that FDR would have handled it in a much better way if he had been president at the time. MacArthur was also great eloquent and Gregory Peck captures some of that eloquence the speeches that made him as legendary as victories on the battlefield. Listen to Peck at the Japanese surrender, MacArthur's farewell to the nation before the joint session of the congress, and of course his speech to the cadets in 1962. Watch the newsreels and see if you disagree.
