I just saw this movie and fell in love with it. There is something for everyone, and it is especially free for everyone when it comes to the romance between Lachlan and Lil. When they're on the beach, I almost cried ... there's the unspoken realization that time is the most precious asset, and most clearly, when they're together. This idea was looked at from different angles, from marriage to siblings, to finding love in the most unconventional places. The movie leaves you almost desperate for that kind of despair when you know that tomorrow could be your last. Crowe was especially wonderful in his role as Lachlan. I always had a weakness for the accent, but I almost melted with his portrayal of his character. The way this film was shot is also beautiful, with the music, the backdrop of the open fields and the outstanding acting. All in all, this is a wonderful movie that captures all human emotions.
