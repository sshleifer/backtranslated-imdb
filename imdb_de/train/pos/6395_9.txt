For me, this is one of the best movies I have ever seen. Overcome racism, fight through life and prove that he is no ordinary "biscuit". Carl Brashear is an amazing character that puts Cuba in his best light, best performance in his life. Niro, who is a living legend, gives the film THAT SOMETHING. Has his character in the movie, but he gives so much to this movie Spectacle, great performance. And the appearance of the beautiful Charlize was and is always a big plus for any movie. If you have not seen this movie yet, I recommend those who love the courage and grandeur that seek inspiration. You have to see this great drama. My vote 9/10.
