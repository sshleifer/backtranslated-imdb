"The Luzhin Defense" is in the foreground the story of an idiosyncratic chess game (Turturro), which is consumed by the game and in the background by flashbacks the life of his childhood and the forces that have created the man to whom he has become. When one includes good and evil in the forms of his love interest (Watson) and the former "mentor" (Wilson), one has a mournful drama mingled with poignant and tenderly humorous moments that blend with the scenic beauty of Italian Comer Lake and Lake Como mix intensity of high chess game. The author's euphemistic chess-playing metaphor for orgasmic enthusiasm is a great movie for time-lovers and an indication of the movie's subtle joke.
