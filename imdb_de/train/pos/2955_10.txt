There is a certain fascination that I have always found to discover the great (semi) unknown movie. These discoveries were almost always dramatic films - in my experience, unknown science fiction movies, action and horror are unknown for very good reasons. I found "High Tide" on video in a junk store, mixed with countless dozens of bands of varying quality. Of course that would be the only place I would find him, as he still is not on DVD. <br /> <br /> While watching Judy Davis (as Lillie) in the course of this movie, I was somehow safely watching a great, undiscovered performance. Yes, I had seen Davis in several small parts before - and a starring role in "A Passage to India." Although she was great in the above mentioned movie, "tide" is a completely different animal. Since I recently saw Gillian Armstrong's later movie "Charlotte Gray," I was very aware of the kind of actress that impressed her. Davis records much more than a passing resemblance to Cate Blanchett in terms of both style and sensitivity. Judy Davis's performance is stunning, I can not say enough good things about it. She has a great relationship with young Claudia Karvan (as Ally), the other great actress in the film. There is a lot of drama and quiet humanity that they share with each other, the details of which I do not want to reveal here (see for yourself!). There is too much in "High Tide" to report in a review. In fact, I would hardly care - the film speaks well enough for itself. Finally, I would like to praise scriptwriter Laura Jones for her stunning dialogue, director Gillian Armstrong for her understanding of actors, and great Russell Boyd for his brilliant, unobtrusive cinematography (see his work in "Tender Mercies").
