I reviewed the movie lists in my area on Yahoo and saw a movie that was not advertised. I looked more closely and noticed that Peter Falk and Paul Reiser were there. Once I saw "Mad about you", I was not a fan of Paul Reiser. But I'm a big fan of Peter Falk. So the spouse and I took a chance. We were both swept along in this story. The beautiful scenery, the heartfelt acting and the feeling of family and moral values ​​that are rare in movies and today's world. Not so juicy felt garbage, but real situations of real people. I even have to say Paul Reiser was excellent, although I still do not look at "Mad with you". I do not know where this movie went. I heard that it was released in a limited release. It should be shared with the world. It's one of the most beautiful movies I've ever seen. M.
