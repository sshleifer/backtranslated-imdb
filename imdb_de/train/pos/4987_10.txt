Although I like EE "Doc" Smith's books and David A. Kyle's Lensman books, the loose-based anime is a pretty fun and somewhat innovative show. <br /> <br /> Even though the story may be familiar to sci-fi / fantasy connoisseurs, such as a child on an isolated planet inheriting mystical powers and avenging the death of his family, it's still a fun one. In addition, Lensman was the first animated film to use hand-drawn and CG animation at once. Sure, it may look a bit dated now, but it's still an innovation. If it were not for Lensman, none of that would have happened (personally, I think computer graphics look better in animations than in live action.) Pity they only do it on DVD / VCD in a DVD few countries in the world have published (mostly in quite different and different formats). I only wish they would release the Lensman movie and TV series on DVD / VCD in EVERY part of the world, not just in certain parts. <br /> <br /> P.S. Vorzel Rules! I just think he is so great and looks good.
