I waited a while to release a review of this documentary, because when I saw it for the first time over 10 years ago, I wanted to think carefully about what I wanted to write. <br /> <br /> From a documentary point of view, I found out that this is damn good documentation. It did what it was about, showed me something I had no idea about and made me interested in the world it was exploring. I did not know about the drag world and found out and the "balls" were just spectacular for me. These people were just as talented with what they do and how they do it for the competition. The jerky people, the complainants (even I was angry when someone told the judge that the coat the drag queen wore was not a man's coat!), The Jealous, it's all there, like any other competition. HOW ALL OTHER COMPETITIONS LIKE. What I thought was a feeling was a point. <br /> <br /> They had the older drag queen talking about how the balls were "earlier" compared to the newer drag queens who've changed the balls and made more contest categories - and even those who saw knowing that the future of Balls would change even more when they were ready to run the runway. It was interesting to hear that some of the participants lived on the street two minutes before the ball, but came to the competition, it was so important to them! Then there were sad stories of which "house" and "housemother" produced the best and brightest in competition. It was interesting. <br /> <br /> Now that I've watched this movie for 10 years, I've gone through the so-called Madonna craze. I saw some familiar faces from this documentary that ended in their "Vogue" phase with Madonna, and rightly so. Without these people Madonna would not have had a "Vogue" phase, I know that now. Credit should be given if credit is DUE. I wonder if anyone else from mainstream America would see this documentary, he'll learn that he's not as "mainstream" as he thinks.
