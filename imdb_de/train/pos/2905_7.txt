This is a very funny movie, easy to see that almost always entertains you. The director's work is recognizable and the nature of humor is his trademark. The film is a typical police partner story like a deadly weapon, but the jokes and the comedy are in the Argentine way. The joke is that one of them is a psychologist played by Peretti, and has to join Detective Diaz (played by Luque) support his duties while also supporting him (Diaz is worried because his wife cheated on him). Some of the dialogues are funny worldwide: understandable and laughable everywhere. On the whole, it's very good, it would have earned an 8, but I rated 7 because it goes down a bit in the end. As for a personal comment I have to add, this is a "bravo" for Argentine filmmakers, considering that little good is coming of late.
