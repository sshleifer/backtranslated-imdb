Will Smith is one of the best actors ever. I do not know how he does that. I keep reading books, but if there's a movie with Will Smith, I'll watch it. He has a rare gift to drag you into the movie and hold you there. This movie is one of the best movies I have ever seen. I saw it on Saturday and still can not get it out of my head. Amazing and sad at the same time. Thanks again, Will. You need to watch this movie from beginning to end to understand every part of the movie. You can not miss anything. Make sure you have enough Kleenex and your husband / wife beside you for cuddling. WELL Worth the money you'll pay to look at it. Do not wait until it appears on TV.
