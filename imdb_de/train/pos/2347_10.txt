I am a fan of Pushing Daisies from the beginning. It's wonderfully thought out and Bryan Fuller has the most notable ideas for this show. <br /> <br /> It's unbelievable how much television a creative, original show like Pushing Daisies needs. It's a great relief to see a show that is different from the others, and compared to some of the more recent shows like Scrubs and House, you would see the similarities and it's getting boring. Watch the shows like that close to the identity. <br /> <br /> Pushing Daisies is by far one of the most notable shows in your TV, with a great cast, a wonderful script and a serenity in each episode.
