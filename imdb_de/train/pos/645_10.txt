I hate excessively long French movies, but my favorite movie of all time is the longest and most talkative French movie. I saw it twice in the mid-70s, and then it disappeared. But in 1999 I finally saw it again and fell in love again. Most notably, it feels as fresh today as it did 25 years ago. If you have not seen it yet, do not miss your chance!
