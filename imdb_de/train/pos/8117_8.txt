I saw this movie on New York television for the first time 40 years ago and I thought it was a depressing look into the future. Wells sees the restriction of private freedoms as a good thing. ("No Private Aircraft".) The film's more than thirty-year war was the reason why this film was not shown to the British war veterans who waged the war. The future stars are the true stars of the film: The best performing performance is that of Ralph Richardson Boss. A combination of Winston Churchill and Edina from the comedy series "Absolutely Fabulous" the wartime Churchill.
