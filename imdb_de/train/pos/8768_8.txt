I saw this movie in a cheap store. I vividly remembered seeing the ad and the trailer years ago. I thought, "What the hell" and bought it, basically because the plot sounded interesting and Claire Danes was always talent in my eyes (even before I became a big fan of Kate Beckinsale). <br /> <br / So it's about two girls who are sneaking on vacation in Bangkok, being detained for drug abuse (of which they are innocent), and then taken to a Thai jail. <br /> <br /> Both Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsale are doing great performances, and the plot of this movie ends up being unconventional and raises some interesting moral issues on solid good movie, but there could have been some improvements that could have taken longer would have helped to consolidate these characters, and more insight into the Thai justice system's policies would have helped. <br /> <br Nevertheless, it's a good movie with great performances. <br /> <br /> PS For All Pop culture junkies are looking for a two-minute role from Paul Walker. I did not even notice him when I saw the movie for the first time.
