The actual story (which took place in Kansas in 1959) of a murder (Perry and Dick, two former convicts who had broken into a remote house on a rainy night to steal and kill anyone they met). Richard Brooks directed the shivering and disturbing Capote book about the reasons that made these children commit a crime (are they natural Born Killers?). The crime scenes are very brutal and haunting, because what we have witnessed is lacking for reasons of reason. Stunning black and white feature films from Conrand Hall, outstanding country - road music by Quincy Jones, outstanding performances in two major roles by Robert Blake and Scott Wilson and, for the first time in a movie, a sad comment on the death penalty in the final moments before her death. Jones, Hall and Brooks (as director and scriptwriter) are Oscar nominees. Exciting, superbly directed and scary, one of the best films of this decade
