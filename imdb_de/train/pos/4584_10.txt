I have not seen every one of Chan's films, but that's the best I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The story inside of me is nothing special, so I will not win. I go deeper. What makes it special is the stunts, the fighting, the good acting, the warm sense of humor. The movie is at a frenzied pace and you are stunned when you see it. All the cool stunts (of course made by Jackie herself) make you want to be on the couch and scream. It's just great! Even my mother was impressed with this cool movie when she saw him. <br /> <br /> I know that this police story can be a bit hard to come by, at least she is here in Sweden. But I can assure you that it is worth a try.
