This movie was excellent. I did not expect it to live up to the hype, but it did. Like all Bourne movies, the action is fast, realistic and intense. If you liked the other two films in the trilogy, you will love them too. The plot of the film is straightforward and there are no too unrealistic twists. OK, Julia Stiles character, who appeared in the Italian vault, was quite far-fetched, especially after what happened in Supremacy, but it makes sense that she is the only character in "Treadstone" that Bourne knows about If he does not want to see him dead, he could possibly trust and be the only person who leads him in the right direction. The action is driven by characters and their reactions to what is happening around them. What I've always loved about the Bourne movies is that Bourne can kick his ass, but when he gets along with people as good as he is, the fights are fights and he suffers a lot of damage. They never treat the audience like idiots. <br /> <br /> All the actors were solid in their performances. I believe that Damon Bourne could play in his sleep, and he is well supported by Joan Allen, who reaffirmed her role as Supremacy, David Strathairn and Scott Glenn. I recommend this movie and the trilogy. I miss Franka Potente though.
