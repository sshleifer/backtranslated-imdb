PUT THE CAMERA ON ME is a deceptively sweet movie. It is actually a complex insight into the psychology of children and provides interesting insights into the development of adults and an artist. On the surface, this is a nostalgic look at some home videos made in the 80s by a group of upper-class neighbors. One of the film directors, Darren Stein, had access to a video camera and quickly took over the artistic direction of all the films. Sure, these are just a few nice kids having fun. That is also much more. This is a look at some of the moments in which children deal with a series of confusing subjects we all face in life - fear, sexual awakening, unrequited love, loneliness, and the attempt to make sense of the adult world explode around us. As we get older, we tend to forget how overwhelming the realities of life were when we were little. <br /> <br /> What makes this movie so special is the sight of a young Darren Stein, who turns into a little general of a filmmaker. It is clear that Darren directs this show and these little films are his vision, but all are informed by his friends, their problems, the interpersonal dynamics and the general confusion about the horrors of adult life. Many children make home videos, but I've never heard of children seeing or seeing "little" films about the Holocaust, homosexuality, nuclear war, and the inability to adapt and make friends. These kids are confronting heavy stuff! <br /> <br /> The power of this film is the way in which Stone and Shell connect scenes so closely together that they conduct interviews with the children - all adults now and all friends. This will add a new angle to the movie. How many of us have stayed in contact with our childhood friends? These guys have. And many of the problems they were dealing with still run between them two decades later. <br /> <br /> Among the conflicts - a swarm confession reveals a broken heart, a very normal childhood sexual experience is still a "sticky" issue between two men, some persistent resentment about the dynamics of relationships and there is still one member of this team that still has a lot of responsibility and focus! Which makes perfect sense if you develop these home movies over several years. Darren Stein is a director. There is no doubt about that. <br /> <br /> Stone and Shell alternate from time to time to imagine the unpleasant idea of ​​giving us an insight into the young lives of these people. This is particularly true for Stein, who has achieved great success as a film producer, writer and director in the entertainment industry. From the first moment of PUT THE CAMERA ON ME we can see the appearance of a gay little boy trying to find out everything. We also see sides of the artistic mind and personality that are not always "nice" or "caring" - and this is a bold move that any artist can share with an audience. <br /> <br /> There are so many enlightening moments, but the most disturbing and complex moments include a movie in which a Jewish concentration camp victim is tortured and killed by a Nazi. We learn through interviews and stories that the Nazi is played by a Jewish child and the role of the victim of a non-Jewish child. It is a painfully disturbing moment that provides an insight into the dark side of fear and the way children work through the horrors of the adult world that do not understand adulthood, much less than a child's. <br /> <br /> This is much more than some home videos. This documentary captures the pain, the beauty, the joy and the sadness of growing up. Powerful stuff - and worth seeing! <br /> <br />:
