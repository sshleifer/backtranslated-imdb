A wonder. One of the best musicals of all time. The three Busby Berkely numbers ending the movie are spectacular, but what makes this movie so wonderful is the incredible non-stop Patter and the natural demeanor of Cagney and Blondell. (Keeler is nice, too, though she was not a great actress). There is a freshness in the film that you do not see in flicks today, much less in the normally stilted movies of the 1930s, though the plot that involves setting up a filmologist is quite old.
