That was an excellent movie. I do not understand why so many people do not like it. There was so much to connect, so many beautiful pictures and so much compassion in things that were not said. I was thoroughly entertained and had a sense of joyful exuberance, just as I am when completing most of the Tom Robbins stories. Now I have not read this particular book by Robbin, so I can not say how it fits, but I can not imagine that this film could have been a very bad interpretation. The film has left a lot of you to define yourself, which is the best part of any novel by Tom Robbins and which dreams the details. <br /> <br /> For those who said that this was the worst film ever, I'm sorry that little of the dimming light is left in their hearts. Far from the worst that this movie ever did, it was glorious. Long live the screaming crane.
