Orson Welles's "The Lady From Shanghai" does not have the brilliant script of "Citizen Kane", eg. For example, Charles Lawton Jr.'s camera, the memorable set pieces (such as the scene in the aquarium, the sailor scene), a stunning blonde blonde singing Rita Hayworth's "Please Do not Love Me," and the truly amazing climax of the Hall of Mirrors.) and the wonderful cast (Everett Sloane in his best performance, Welles in a wonderfully underplayed role, Miss Hayworth - the then wife of Welles - at her best) makes for an unforgettable movie experience, the bizarre murder mystery plot is fun and mesmerizing The viewer is surprised by the twists, and Welle's line is an incomparable classic. "The Lady From Shanghai" receives four stars from this impartial umpire.
