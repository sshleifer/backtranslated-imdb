Without being one of my favorites, this is good for a change ... even if it only takes a few minutes. <br /> <br /> It all starts with a big fight between Tom, Jerry and Spike (who is renamed "Butch" here). They all beat each other, but suddenly Spike makes a heroic and admirable decision: He stops the fight and suggests that they should all be friends. So everyone signs a peace treaty and becomes friends. It will not be long. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, the three become tender, patient and friendly to each other. They even save themselves if one of them is life-threatening. The relationship only goes well until a huge steak appears and they all get greedy. The three are guilty of returning to their usual battles and rivalries. <br /> <br /> But still ... seeing Tom, Jerry and Spike as friends is really a wonderful and rewarding experience, if only for a while. Oh, by the way, as a curious fact, here in instrumental versions two songs from "The Wizard of Oz" are played: "We're on our way to see the Wizard" and "Somewhere over the Rainbow".
