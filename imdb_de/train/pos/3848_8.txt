Gerard is a writer with a bit of overactive imagination. He is also homosexual and Catholic prone to Catholic guilt and some psychics, it seems. On a journey to Flushing, he is "seduced" by Christine. When he discovers that Christine's new boyfriend is the rough-hewn trade he intends to remotely, he decides to stay here. After all, forced heterosexuality has their compensation. Then he realizes that Christine's three former husbands all forcibly died. Did Christine murder her and will he or her friend Herman be the fourth man? Verhoeven's overheated, over-excited melodrama is a delicious mix of Hitchcock and David Lynch, full of OTT eroticism and religious imagery and a dreadful amount of red. Mostly it looks and feels like a dream, and we can never be sure that What we see is real or is a fantasy of Gerard's imagination. The fun is finding out. Also, the fact that Christine is an infinitely more likeable character, meaning either the enigmatic Gerard or the bullish Herman, is that we barely roll over them for one of the men. In fact, one can say that Gerard's Comeuppance does not come soon enough. Great performances also from Jeroen Krabbe and Renee Soutendijk and slightly Verhoeven's best film to his wonderfully subversive piece of science fiction "Starship Troopers".
