Listening to the soundtrack for the moment, the images come back with a vivacity that makes my longing for a dry eye very strong (to be able to type this in). I've seen it twice so far, and I should be ashamed that I've seen it * only * twice. <br /> <br /> I have seen all the movies by Miyazaki & Studio Ghibli, and they are all nothing less than masterpieces (except maybe for Nausicaa, even in the uncut version compared to the nec-plus-ultra-manga was too early). Nevertheless, sometimes their strength becomes their weakness, as they tend to become too naive / positive (Chihiro) or, with some nuance, something too explicit / moralist (Mononoke). At least compared to the other Ghibli master Takahata (Tomb of the Fireflies / Only Yesterday / Raccoon Wars). But not this one here. <br /> <br /> In Laputa Miyazaki pours all the ingenious stories that narrators have collected and perfected stories over the centuries, combined with a little morality, but not only with a completely transcendent behavioral atmosphere, but also with humor and the entertainment of, for example, Totoro. Each individual protagonist is perfectly portrayed with their doubts and fears and qualities that help them overcome difficulties. The pace is so perfect that I know nothing except a black hole that could exert such an attraction on your entire being. The story begins as an action movie with implied mysteries, but when the girl falls unconscious from the sky and floats with the stone and uses the main theme, you can take a look at the great mystery that you will discover. History continues, however, over several carefully selected scenes of action and serene beauty form an unforgettable climax of melancholy, hope, beauty - as in the following days of gloomy darkness, and finally seeing the horizon on a clear morning I knew the path had gone, saw the distance forward, but smiled at the mere fact that he could catch a glimpse of it. <br /> <br /> It's like a white light exploding in your skull when going through the sky When the guy starts to roll, you keep your eyes dry and your mind stunned should you see a therapist , <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that, from a visual point of view, some of the newer Miyazakis may be more than overwhelming, this is too big. I remain his undisputed masterpiece. If you need a fraction of a second to realize that this was done in 1986, you can only conclude that Hayao Miyazaki is a genius like a star that occurs only once every 200 years. Of course, this has already been suggested before, but for me this is his only film that can illustrate this simple fact on its own. If you miss this during your lifetime, you will die with a big gap - which would be a pity, since the coffin costs the same.
