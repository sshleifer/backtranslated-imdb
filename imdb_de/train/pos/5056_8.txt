When I grew up in England in the 1930s, radio was not available 24 hours a day, seven days a week, so the Children Hour was a pleasure for us with batteries and a battery for the power supply. So the few programs I've heard made a big impact on my young thoughts, and the three I remember are Toytown, one about all the animals in the zoo, and Gray Owl over the animals that he knew he called his "brothers" speak. I've recently learned that Gray Owl is not a real "Indian," but the tribute paid by the Sioux boss makes a lot of sense to me: "A man becomes what he dreams." Could we all change and be useful as Archie Gray Owl Belaney as a world? Could a new gray owl bring the world leaders to clean the environment?
