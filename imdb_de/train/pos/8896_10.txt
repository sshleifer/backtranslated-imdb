Can anyone help find out the title and artist of the song, which was played at least halfway through the movie. I can not remember which scene was played. The words in the song are from a ballad. Some of the lyrics read, "It's the way to tell you something wrong." It's a kind of nature to tell it in a song. "It's kind of nature to forgive you. "Please help me with this question. Thanks a lot! I've searched the internet for days, I can not get that song out of my song Well, this will challenge me to find someone who could help in this matter. I would have paid attention to the scene as she played.
