If you like adult comedy cartoons like South Park, then this is almost a similar format to the little adventures of three teenage girls in Bromwell High. Keisha, Natella and Latrina have exploded candy and behaved like bitches. I think Keisha is a good leader. There are also little stories with the teachers of the school. There's the idiotic client, Mr. Bip, the nervous math teacher and many others. The cast is also fantastic: Lenny Henry's Gina Yashere, EastEnder's Chrissie Watts, Tracy-Ann Oberman, Dack Mackan by Smack The Pony, Mark Perry by Dead Ringers and Nina Conti by Blunder. I did not know that's from Canada, but it's very good. Very well!
