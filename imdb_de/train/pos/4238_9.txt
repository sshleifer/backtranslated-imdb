Superficially, this is an above-average romantic comedy of the post-war period. Under the veneer, it is the MGM performer who is most in favor of stunt casting. <br /> <br /> The leads are straightforward, but all secondaries are strongly against the guy. Margaret Hamilton (also known as Wicked Witch of the West), Edward Everett Horton (obsessive compulsive foot budget) and Sig Ruman (the enemy of the Marx brothers in Night In Casablanca_ and the ever-wonderful _Night At The Opera_) are intentionally committed gang trying Bringing the two leads together rather than distracting them as their "ordinary" characters would. <br /> <br /> It's also fun to have many romantic comedy conventions, which is another indication that this would be possible. Do not be so much a "straightforward" romantic comedy as it's an ironic broadcast of many romantic ones Comedies of the post-war period and their two-dimensional, serial characters is. <br /> <br /> I just saw it intermittently, so I can not be positive, but this movie might be one that worked better in the context of the time it was made, but it is less successful as viewers see through these secondary characters a very different lens. I assume that this is the case if I give it 9 stars. I found it hysterical.
