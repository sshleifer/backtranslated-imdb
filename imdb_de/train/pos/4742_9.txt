This film contains more action before the opening credits than in whole Hollywood movies of this kind. This film is produced by Tsui Hark and the stars Jet Li. This team has brought you many dignified Hong Kong movie productions, including the series "Once Upon a Time in China". The action was fast and furious with amazing wire work. I only saw the wires in two shots. Apart from the action, the story itself was strong and was not just used as a filler. To find other action films, look for a Hong Kong movie theater near you. They are really worth a visit and are usually never disappointed.
