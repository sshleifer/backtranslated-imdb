I saw this movie in an Avant premiere at the Imagina Festival in Monaco. <br /> <br /> I saw the first trailer four years ago, and from that moment on I waited for the final result. I was not disappointed. <br /> <br /> It's a full 3D movie with a high-contrast black and white rendering. Clearly inspired by some comic books, such as by F. Miller. In this look, it goes one step further than the excellent "Sin City" adaptation by R. Rodriguez. This time (almost) no gray or any medium color, but a graphic style that has never before been seen in a realistic animated film. Lots of life and credibility for the characters and we soon forget the technical aspect to focus on more classic elements like direction or action to focus. The direction remains sober and controlled despite the infinite possibilities of the medium, and that's a really good surprise. <br /> <br /> The futuristic story (Paris 2053) makes it a classic sci-fi movie that keeps viewers interested to the very end. Despite a classic baseline plot (an investigation far beyond the original expectations), the atmosphere and some interesting recurring themes (genetics, absolute power of certain companies ...) give this film a great deal of interest. <br /> <br /> It's an animated movie, this one is obviously not made for kids. You will not find a funny pet or any stupid family moral, just the cold reality. It's a lot closer to a good movie Noir. <br /> <br /> I found that the setting is one of the best aspects of the film: we still feel the well-known Paris, but it is transformed by a subtle touch of futurism. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, I regret some mistakes. The montage is sometimes a bit flat, one or two very clich√©-like slow-motion effects and some bad dialogues. Although the technical level is excellent, it shows its limits in some romantic sequences (a bit like "Final Fantasy"). These little things make it a 7/10. All in all, it is a successful artistic challenge that you have to look at if you can. Director Christian Volckman knows how not to fall into potential pitfalls (luckily they did not ask John Woo to get the job done!). Finally, it's a movie with fascinating visuals. a smart story and a wonderful art direction. Take a look at it, if you can! <br /> <br /> Please excuse me for the spelling mistakes.
