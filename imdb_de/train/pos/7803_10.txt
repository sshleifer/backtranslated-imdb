I have just seen this movie in my GCSE history lesson. it was exciting and gave a brilliant insight into what Steve Biko actually did during the apartheid law. As everyone can tell, this film was the most boring or boring two and a half hours of their life, I do not know because I was thrilled from beginning to end. It was great how Denzel Washington portrayed him and how he fought the apartheid law and got equal rights for black people. In one part Steve Biko tells a policeman that we are as weak and human as you are. This is to show them that he and all other blacks in South Africa did not differ from the whites. Donald Woods inspired me because he was committed to what he believed and did not believe in apartheid. He and Steve Biko formed a very strong friendship that shook South Africa and awakened the world. I really enjoyed this movie and I highly recommend it. It helped me realize that racism is not right and that everyone is the same. Your destiny should not be determined by the skin color of a human being. n
