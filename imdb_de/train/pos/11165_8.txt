Four words explain why this movie was made - "She Done Him Wrong". The enormous commercial success of this Mae West vehicle convinced the studio brass that gay's' 90s melodramas were a viable step. Here we are rewarded with a fast-moving, well-written game that neatly addresses the personalities of its stars. <br /> <br /> Wallace Beery and George Raft are great as friendly rivals. It's a bit harder to take Jackie Cooper, but Fay Wray steals the movie with her distressed trading company. With a strong director - as Walsh proves - Wray could endure a lot of punch, and she's absolutely believable, as an object of Raft and Beery's affection. <br /> <br /> Lots of atmosphere, beautifully designed, This is a forgotten movie that deserves to be revived.
