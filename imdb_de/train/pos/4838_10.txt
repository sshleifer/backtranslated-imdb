This movie reminded me that some old Black & White movies are definitely worth a look. <br /> <br /> At the beginning I had some reservations, but from the beginning of the film to the end I was fascinated. I was very impressed by the mix of drama, suspense and comedy. <br /> <br /> Arthur Askey (Tommy Gander) is HILARIOUS and had me in stitches all the time. <br /> <br /> Definitely film to your movie night for some relief from the sometimes depressing and "too" strong or "funny" movies of today.
