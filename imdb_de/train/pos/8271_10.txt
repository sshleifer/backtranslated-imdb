Brown of Harvard, one of the greatest hits of 1926, is an exciting comedy / drama of regatta and football scenes that gave William Haines the role he needed to become a star. It's Haines patented through and through: the chic smart Aleck, who takes nothing seriously until he is rejected and rejected by all, becomes a man / hero and the girl wins. Nobody worked this formula like Haines. A terrific comic actor (Little Annie Rooney with Mary Pickford, Show People with Marion Davies), Haines was able to switch to tragedy with a change of facial expression from comedy. He is a total delight in this film when he was in Tell It to the Marines (with Lon Chaney) and West Point (with Joan Crawford) where he repeats the formula. Mary Brian is good as a girl, Jack Pickford is very good as a sick roommate, Ralph Bushman is the rival. Edward Connelly, Mary Alden, David Torrence, Guinn Williams and Grady Sutton co-star. This film is now known for its homoerotic relationship between Haines and Pickford, and for John Wayne's film debut as a Yale footballer (but I've never seen him). Haines was a top five box office star who started with this image until 1932. Too bad that he was largely forgotten and most of his films seem to be lost. He was one of the most attractive and talented actors of his time.
