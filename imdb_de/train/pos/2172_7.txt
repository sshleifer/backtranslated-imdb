"Mad Dog" Earle is back, along with his sad bagmate Marie and that fickle clubfoot Velma. The same goes for Babe and Red, Doc and Big Mac and even for the landscaping mutt Pard. The only thing missing is a good reason to recreate Raoul Walsh's High Sierra 14 years later, without reconsidering a line or a frame, and do it with a talent that noticeably scores one or two rungs from the leader in the original is removed. (Instead of Walsh we get Stuart Heisler, for Humphrey Bogart we get Jack Palance, for Ida Lupino Shelley Winters etc.). The only change is that this time it's in black and white in Warnercolor; Unfortunately, there are those who would call this improvement. <br /> <br /> I died a thousand times may be unnecessary? and inferior ?? but at least it is not a travesty; The story still works on its own terms. Earle (Palance), fresh off the peninsula near Chicago, heads west to master a great job, dominated by offending kingpin Lon Chaney, Jr. upset a post-mountain resort. Along the way, he almost collides with a family of Oakies when he's in love with her granddaughter; even if he discovers that she is lame. When he arrives in the cabins where the rest of the gang holes in, he finds amateur heads on the other's throats, as well as Winters, who (like the doggie) throws himself at him. In the meantime, until called by her hotel insider, Palance offers (to Winter's anger) to pay for an operation to cure the girl's deformity, a backfiring gesture. Then the surgical strike against the resort becomes a bloodbath. In the hallway, Palance goes higher into the cold sierras ... <br /> <br /> It's an enthralling story, expertly executed, of the distinctiveness of Walsh and his cast in 1941, the year Bogie's added has failed. With this role and that of Sam Spade in the Maltese Falcon he became a star. And another heretical comment: These mountains look beautiful in color. <br /> <br />
