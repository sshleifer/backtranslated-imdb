Hollywood North is a satirical look at the time of Canadian film history when the Canadian government offered huge tax breaks for films made in Canada. Mostly it was considered a tax shelter or a cheap way for American films. For example, Porky came out. Anyway, Matthew Modine plays a beginner who wants to make an adaptation of a popular Canadian novel. But to get the money, he needs an American star. He gets a loose cannon and learns that he has to make a compromise where the film is no longer similar to the book he was originally based on. It works well in Canada, but can not be understood outside the Great White North. The Americans will think we mock ourselves, but do not miss the point where we actually saturate them. For the Canadians 8/10 for the rest of the world 5/10.
