Some comments here on IMDb have compared Dog Bite Dog with the classic Cat III movies of the 90s, but while this is undoubtedly brutal, violent and very downbeat, this movie by Pou-Soi Cheang is not really sloppy, lurid or sensational enough Earn comparison. However, it is still a punch worth seeing, especially if hard-nosed action is your thing. Edison Chen plays Pang, a Cambodian who travels to Hong Kong murdering the wife of a judge; Sam Lee is Wai, the ruthless cop who's determined to track him down, regardless of the cost. Wai approaches his destination, and Pang stops at nothing to ensure his escape until he meets Yue, a fairly illegal immigrant who needs his help to escape their abuse. <br /> <br /> An inexorable hardship drama with great cinematography, impressive sound design, haunting film music and solid performances by Chen and Lee (as well as newcomer Pei Pei as Pang's love interest), Dog Bite Dog is one of the hard hit fans Asian hyper-violence (think (in the sense of Chan-Wook Park's Vengeance trilogy).) Stings, shootings, merciless beatings: Everyone happens in this movie on a regular basis and are relentlessly caught by director Cheang. <br /> <br /> Of course this is Kind of story that will have an unfortunate ending for everyone involved - and certainly pretty much everyone in this movie dies (pretty nasty deaths.) Unfortunately, there is a fine line between tragedy and (unwanted) comedy, and in its final moments it transcends Dog Bite Dog the Border: In a ridiculously dramatic final scene, Pang and Wai are in action while a pregnant Yue watches After all three severe stab wounds were sustained during the fight, a wounded Pang performs a DIY-Ceasarean on Yue (now deceased) and brings his baby moments before he dies himself. <br /> <br /> While this movie might be It's not a classic piece of Hong Kong excesses, with its provocative OTT action and stylish visuals it's still worth a search.
