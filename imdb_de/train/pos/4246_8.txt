In this movie, JUST made when the production code was enforced, Jean Harlow is Eadie, and Patsy Kelly is the elusive, man-loving buddy "Kitty." The girl from Missouri starts with the girls getting on a train, and Eadie makes a promise to make money while looking for a millionaire and sticking to it. It does not take long for her to meet with Frank Cousins ​​(Lewis Stone, friendly doctor at the Grand Hotel and Judge Hardy in the "Andy Hardy" movies.). But everything is not what it seems. The censors must have LOVED Harlow's line "A girl can not accept such a gift from a gentleman if she is not engaged." Later, someone says, "You know we've never been alone," and Eadie replies, "Yes, and we will not be!" Lionel Barrymore is T.R. Paige, another rich upper crust who comes to their rescue when trouble searches for Eadie. At one point, Paige explains, "You should delete me from your list - I'm not a wifeslayer" ... I wonder what that line would have been just a few years earlier, before the Hayes code came into town. What did he really say? Carol Tevis seems to be the high baby talker listed in the IMDb credits. Looks like she was only in showbiz from 1931 to 1939, with "Munchkin" in Wizard of Oz being the last role she played. Fun, clean cut while the girls hunt men all over the country. Look for Nat Pendleton as a lifeguard, who became an Olympic wrestler (silver medalist) in 1920 and became a movie star (he was in many of the Dr. Kildares and would emerge in four of Harlow's films.) Young Franchot Tone, love stories, even Jean Harlow in a swimsuit in "Palm Beach", although the exterior shots of the city center act as a backdrop.
