A vow to Cherish is a wonderful movie. It is based on a novel of the same name, which was equally good, but different from the film. They really made you think about how you would react if you were to play the role of the characters. Recommended for anyone who has ever loved a parent, spouse or family member - in other words, ALL! <br /> <br /> Although the production is not quite Hollywood-quality - no big special effects - still. The values ​​and ideals more than make up for it. And the cast has done a wonderful job of capturing the emotional connections between family members and the devastation that comes when one of them gets sick. <br /> <br /> You do not want to miss this!
