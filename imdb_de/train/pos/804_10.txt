No, there is another one! <br /> <br /> Because every Star Wars fan had to have an opinion on I, II, and III, and because that opinion was biased, since we've missed so much the atmosphere and characters of the original trilogy I'm getting the good points from "The Return of the Jedi" and some corresponding bad points of the prequel. Of course I loved the music, the special effects and the two droids, but this has been much debated elsewhere. <br /> <br /> What we get in the original trilogy and in this movie: - A strong environmental concern - Antimilitarist positions - Fascinating insights into the Jedi Order and Power - Cute creatures - Harrison Ford's smile - A killer scene: Near the end, when Vader turns over his son and the Emperor. The bolt of deadly bolts reflected on his black helmet. And when he grabs his master and betrays him to save Luke and risk his own life! Oh boy! <br /> <br /> What's wrong with the prequel INMHO: - The whole "human factor" element that could drive the original cast is somehow missing - The Force seems to be more of superpowers than to wisdom - too many Jedis at once and too many lightsabers on the screen - too few experiences with a few actors often threaten the coherence of the plot Enjoy the theory of power as explained by Obi Web (I mean it) and Yoda. Then you should read a few books on Buddhism and the forms that he adopted in ancient Japan. Star Wars, IMHO is mainly in the ongoing spiritual heritage, from master to apprentice, from father to son, albeit with difficulties , "De monâme à ton âme" (from my soul to yours), as Bejard would write to the late Zen master T. Deshimaru.
