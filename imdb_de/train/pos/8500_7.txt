Surprised the relatively low score for this film. I saw this movie for the first time in 10 years and was reminded why I like it. <br /> <br /> Come back with me, kids, at a time when Michael Keaton was a pure comedy guy, and maybe you'll find some joy in this movie. It's a gentle comedy - the way Ron Howard has specialized - but if that's your thing, you should check it out. Keaton's inconspicuous charm is just right for this project. <br /> <br /> "Gung Ho" is a bit dated because it was in the final phase of the pre-global economy, when it meant something else. The country where a company was located was located. That is, it provides both laughter and a lesson on how people can learn from each other, and to a great advantage. <br /> <br /> You can watch and enjoy this movie without remembering one scene you liked a lot, but that's because the whole movie delivers a slow but steady laugh stream. It's like an I.V. drops. And I mean that well.
