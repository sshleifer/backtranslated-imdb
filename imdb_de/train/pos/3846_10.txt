Basically, I like Verhoeven movie because in my movie I enjoy a genius psychosexual story that I've seen in Basic Instinct before. It's really a wonderful thriller that I really enjoyed watching a movie. <br /> <br /> Well, it's his previous direction before his blockbuster hit "Basic Instinct," and I was very curious to watch this movie, and yes, the movie has met my hopes and expectations. <br /> <br /> this movie "The Fourth Man" is a brilliant pscychee drama that is a bit complex for some viewers. The story of this film is about a gay writer named "Reve" (Crab), an alcoholic who lives by his own moral values ​​and sees many visions that can warn him of a future accident Imagine a seductive woman named " Christine ", who has a mysterious past that she does not want to reveal. They make sex with her in her house because she is a boy. The next morning he looks at her sexy macho picture on her desk, the person he met at the train station. He is curious to meet him and tell Christine to invite him to her house. <br /> <br /> that's it. I do not want to tell the whole story because it's a Verhoeven movie and the end of the movie is really amazing. <br /> <br /> I especially like the character "Reve" who is brilliantly played by "Krabbe". I really like his acting because I am identified as a gay person purely with his character and yes, I like his charming face. <br /> <br /> I want to thank Mr.Verhoeven for making such a black comedy. <br /> I rate this movie: 10 out of 10.
