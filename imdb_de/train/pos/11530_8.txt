A group of friends decide to take a camping trip into the desert - and are persecuted and murdered by a mysterious murderer in a black truck. "Mirage" is obviously inspired by Spielberg's "Duel" and Craven's "The Hills Have Eyes." Nevertheless, this slasher yarn offers a lot of vicious power and gore, culminating in a sequence where a man puts his arm and leg against a tree chained and then his limbs disassembled when pulling the chain off a truck is also a bit exciting and some exciting stalk-and-slash sequences.The acting is pretty lame and the script is pretty weak but the movie is fast-paced The scammers who play the villain are pretty threatening Desert locations make for a bit of a breeze and the wind is pretty strong All in all, if you like low budget horror movies, give it a look - 8 out of 10.
