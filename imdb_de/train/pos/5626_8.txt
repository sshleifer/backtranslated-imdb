Marjorie, a young woman who works in a museum and lives with two housemates, Pat and Terry. One night she gets into her car and is attacked by a masked man with a knife. His plan is to rape her, but she manages to escape. The man has her purse. The police can not help her because the rape did not happen. One day, when Marjorie's roommates are at work, their attacker comes. His name is Joe. A long fight begins This man. But then she manages to spray his eyes and mouth with insect repellent, things that will kill him if he does not get help soon. It binds him and makes Joe the same subject as physical and mental attacks The Extremities (1986) is headed by Robert M. Young. It is based on the controversial 1982 Off-Broadway play by William Mastrosimone. Farrah Fawcett, who lost her fight against cancer last year, is convinced of Marjorie grandios. James Russo, who also played the attacker in the game Joe.Alfre Woodard and Dia na Scarwid are great as Pat and Terry. James Avery is considered a guardian. She received a Golden Globe nomination. This is not a movie that should entertain you. It raises a question that justifies revenge. This is not a perfect movie but I recommend it.
