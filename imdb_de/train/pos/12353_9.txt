A tragically wonderful movie ... takes us to a Japan that does not exist anymore. Despite the technical know-how of Hollywood, I have not yet seen a movie (Hollywood) that matches the authenticity of the atmosphere in this small town on the river near the sea ... The last Samurai by Tom Cruise saw in the last issue of the Lord of The rings while trying to capture the rural old Japan. <br /> <br /> If you like quiet but intense stories, this is a must-have movie. It will be a break from hollow, eye-catching movies, much like the last 1000 blockbusters you've seen. I think that's one of Kurosawa's better stories. <br /> <br /> Even though it's a movie about geishas and brothels and the complicated rules that govern life in such environments, it did not become a skin rash. The characters are very deep and work with a lot of intensity.
