Well, I have to say that this was a damn funny movie. Despite the fact that the dubbing was rather cheesy and there were some weird moments when the movie seemed dark blue for no apparent reason, I was not disappointed. The story was actually quite interesting: the last member of the Poison Clan must find the other five members and find out who uses their evil skills and who uses them for the better. The catch was that the entire clan was masked during training and has since disguised returned to society and changed their name. The clan has a different fighting style: toad (my favorite), snake, scorpion, lizard and centipede. In the fight scenes, the actors jump everywhere, and luckily the camera stays in the camera and uses a sufficiently large shot so that you can clearly see the whole action. <br /> <br /> The only drawback of the movie is that The story tends to make a difference in the first half to the first fight sequence. But stick with it and you will not be disappointed!
