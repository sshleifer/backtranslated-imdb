I saw this movie recently. 2 hours later, my head still ached from laughing. The plot was so horrible, the jokes were so bad, but what I did not expect were: 1. The 2 scenes before and after the movie that Pat and Jay posed (which is more than caused enough laughter) <br /> <br /> 2. The kick through the windshield that beheaded the culprit. <br /> <br /> This movie is about 20 times better than the Rush Hour series, and my copy even came with a disc-maker, who said that if he did not like the movie, send a certificate to HBO. While I was thinking about it, the date you had to send it in was January 1991 (which also led to a craze).
