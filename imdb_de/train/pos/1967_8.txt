I do not understand why the reviews on this movie are so bad in general, unless I'm just from my rocker. I found it sick, brilliant, twisted and psychologically demanding. In a Hollywood movie, you will not think of a criminal psychopath any more than this one. It has layers within layers, nuanced by Stone, and an action that lets you guess even after the end. People have to overcome the fact that Sharon Stone is 48 years old and that Michael Douglas is not here. I predict that this movie on DVD will be a big hit once people see it for themselves and stop paying attention to annoying professional reviewers. Try it, maybe you're glad you did!
