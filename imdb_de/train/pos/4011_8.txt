After the SuperFriends and Scooby Doo left the Saturday morning airwaves in the fall of 1986, I stopped watching the cartoons on Saturday morning, as those two were the only ones who voted me. I was very promising for myself, I was "withdrawn" and fell asleep on Saturday morning. I only returned to Saturday morning television for a single animated show in 1988. <br /> <br /> A new animated Superman show was something I would not miss. I was 17 at the time and in high school, but what's up? I loved this show. As far as I can remember, this series was a gift to the fans that I accepted on the occasion of Superman's 50th birthday this year. The theme music and style recalled John Williams film music from the Richard Donner / Christopher Reeve Superman films. I really felt that Ruby Spears' animation style was reminiscent of Hanna Barbera's Super Powers Team: Galactic Guardians series a few years ago. Unfortunately, Danny Dark did not return as Superman, but I felt that Beau Weaver did a very impressive job as the voice of Superman and his Clark Kent was nerdig like the Chris Reeve version. After his hearing as Reed Richards / Mr. Fantastic in the 90s Fantastic Four, I still could see this version of Superman in my mind. Ginny McSwain as Lois Lane. LOL! What a rhyme. She was the voice actress for Hanna Barbera and Ruby Spears and I think she has made it her mission to make Lois. Memories of the super friends remained in this series when it came to the voice over cast. Jimmy Olsen is Mark Taylor, who was on the SuperFriends earlier Firestorm. Perry White is none other than Batman TV's former TV writer, Stanley Ralph Ross, who starred on SuperFriends Gorilla Grodd and Brainiac in the Super Powers shows. And Lex Luthor, now a wise billionaire, is none other than SuperFriends alumni Michael Bell, whom I know best as Zan and the Riddler as well as many other characters from many other series. <br /> <br /> I felt that this series was a combination of the movie Superman and John Byrne in Superman's postwar concept, living with Lex Luthor as a billionaire tycoon, Jonathan and Martha Kent, to Clark as Superman to see. The Bruce Timm series and Lois and Clark would do the same. Unfortunately we have never seen Brainiac, Bizarro, Toyman, Metallo or Darkseid. Except for Luthor we only saw the Prankster and saw General Zod. I especially enjoyed this one episode with Wonder Woman voiced by BJ Ward, who also played her on the Super Powers team. <br /> <br /> The episodes were overwhelming and I also enjoyed Clark's growth and development stories from childhood through childhood to adolescence, and one adult moved into Metropolis in the short, small segment, Superman's Family Album. <br /> <br /> The only two things I did not like. It only lasted one season. And after Wonder Way's guest spot, I had hoped that Batman would be voiced by Adam West (I still think of the Super Powers Team episodes). I also hoped for that, because in the Prankster episode, the baseball team Metropolis had to compete against the Gotham Goliaths. <br /> <br /> Every popular superhero has a very rare comic series. For SpiderMan, I think it was the 1981 solo series that aired at the same time as Amazing Friends. For the Incredible Hulk it's the 1982 cartoon. For the Fantastic Four it's the 1978 series with HERBIE the Robot. For Batman it is the New Adventures of Batman 1977 by Filmation with BatMite. But for Superman this is the rarest series. <br /> <br /> Superman books and documentaries never treat or mention them. This is another series that WB should consider for DVD release. All in all, this 1988 version of Superman is good .... Great !!
