I enjoyed watching this movie on TCM and seeing a very young William Powell (Philo Vance) playing detective, just as he did with Myrna Loy in the "Thin Man Series". In the 1930s, William Powell starred in the Philo Vance series. In this picture, the famous actress Mary Astor (Hilda Lake) becomes one of the suspects in a murder / suicide case, in which a man named Archer Coe (Robert Barrot) is found dead and Archer found himself in a room bolted from the inside. Ralph Morgan (Raymond Wrede / Archer's Secretary) gave a great supporting role and was the brother of Frank Morgan, who appeared in 1939 "In the Wizard of Oz". Eugene Palette (Detective Sgt. Heath) appeared in several of these Philo Vance films and also gave an outstanding performance in "Robin Hood" with Errol Flynn. Always remember, the most likely actor could be the killer. Enjoy a great classic from the past.
