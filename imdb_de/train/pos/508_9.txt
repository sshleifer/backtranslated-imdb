In 2151, Broken Bow, Oklahoma, a farmer shoots Klingon Klaang with his plasma rifle after a methane camp exploded in his farm, and the Klingon is sent to Starfleet Hospital. The volcanic ambassador Soval proposes to separate the life support system and bring the body of Klaang with honor to his warrior empire on the planet Kronos. However, Captain Jonathan Archer suggests accompanying the Enterprise on their first voyage and bringing Klaang back to his home planet alive. Jonathan invites Ensign Hoshi Sato and dr. Phlox, who treats Klaang, is about to complete his crew, and Vulcan Subcommander T'Pol is assigned to take part in Enterprise's dangerous first mission. When the spacecraft's equipment is decommissioned, Klaang is abducted after a shoot-out at the Suliban hospital. After the autopsy of Suliban killed in the shootout, Captain Archer of Dr. Phlox informs that the alien was indeed a mutant altered in a sophisticated genetic engineering process. T'Pol modifies the sensors of the Enterprise to track the Suliban probe until it reaches the planet Riger X. They investigate and reveal that Klaang was a courier, and brought to the leaders of the Klingons an important message about the temporal Cold War of the Suliban Sarin in Kronos. <br /> <br /> Although I'm a big fan of Star Trek, I did not watch the episodes of "Enterprise" on cable TV. I decided to buy the first season DVD box and that first episode surprised me. The Adventures of the First Enterprise, Captain Jonathan Archer, the beautiful T'Pol, Reed, Mayweather, dr. Phlox, Hoshi and Trip is excellent at least in this pilot project. I've noticed in IMDb that this episode is actually divided into two parts, but on DVD they are only one part, so my review is valid for both. I did not like the theme of the music score, which I found very annoying, but this was an exception in this great show. My voice is nine. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Broken Bow"
