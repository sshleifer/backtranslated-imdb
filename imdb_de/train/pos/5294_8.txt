"Pecker" proves that Waters does not intend to change his sticky nature as he gets older. Since Waters started making films in the 1960s, a lot has changed, but 40 years later, he still does what he wants. Over the years, Waters' budget has grown significantly. This is one of his latest productions, but I was amazed to see that Waters still has the "Trailer Park" stop. Edward Furlong plays Pecker, a child obsessed with photography. He lives a quiet life in Baltimore, MD, with his friends and family. But Pecker caught the eye of a New York art agent (the ever observable Lili Taylor), and his life is changing for the worst. Again Waters enjoys art, fame and heterosexuality. It's not one of his best films, but there are some big laughs ("Memama" has the best lines in the movie!). It's all smart and witty and has the very "queer" sensibility I've found in Warter's films.
