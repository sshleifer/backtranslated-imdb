My wife and I took our 13-year-old son to see this movie and absolutely loved the movie's winning fun. Boys and men who remember their childhood have a special charm, but even women like the movie and especially Hallie Kate Eisenberg's refrain: "Boys are so funny". It's refreshing to see a movie that clearly shows that boys and girls really differ in their emotional and social makeup. Boys do such strange things and usually survive to tell the story and stupidly frighten their mothers! We enjoyed the movie so much that my son and 11-year-old friend, myself and my 23-year-old daughters visited the movie the next day for a movie. The second time we had even more fun and everyone raved about it. It's clean and enjoyable when it comes to a pre-teen cast reminiscent of the TV classic "Freaks and Geeks". We all believe it will be a sleeper hit, not unlike the "Freaks & Geeks" who did not survive their first season, but sold out their DVD release. Take a special look when you have boys, and you'll find that it's fun and safe entertainment! Girls will love it because of the opportunity to say, "Boys are so funny!" Do not miss it ...
