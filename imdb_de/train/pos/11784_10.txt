As documented in previous posters, Rockstar's real stars are: INXS - and indeed Rockstar: Supernova - the sequel - Paul Mirkovich, Rafael Moreira, Jim McGorman, Nate Morton and Sasha Krivtsov. Do not Know Who They Are They are the great, tight, rocking House band whose musical talent and talent have made this show something more than a sad American Idol clone. <br /> <br /> Remember the "string" night? That was musical precision and perfection, if I've ever seen it. Suzie McNeil's epic rendition of Queen's' Bohemian Rhapsody ', Ty Taylor's memorable cover of the Stones'' You can not always ... ', JD Fortune sings "Suspicious Minds". The common denominator here is the great house band. <br /> <br /> As good as INXS was in its prime, they are unfortunately a shadow of their former selves, though JD's live performance brings some new life to their music. This show is all about the HB. <br /> <br /> Memo to the producers: Season 3 (if we're blessed enough to make it happen) should be Rockstar: House Band. Get these guys a good singer and they go places.
