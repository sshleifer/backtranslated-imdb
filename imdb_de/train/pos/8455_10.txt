While I was an impressive youth when I first saw the Gundam Wing series, watching the show again I have confirmed my conviction that this series is not just beautifully animated, but the plot, the Gundam design, the Character design and the depth of character are masterfully executed. Although the stylish appeal of the characters initially seems like a boy band, it can sometimes be attributed only to the great art, with individual personalities creating clear and loveable differences between the characters. Consequently, it is very easy to draw to a certain character. I personally liked Heero because of his stoic personality. While I may be biased with a sentimental commitment to this show to my childhood, I can objectively say that Gundam Wing addresses the deeper issues of war and life in general (how can we find peace?) While performing action-packed battles in large robotic suits provides what is, to say the least, excellent.
