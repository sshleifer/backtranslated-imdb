** Possible Spoiler *** Adam Sandler is usually written in comedy, but in "Reign" there is a deeply moving performance. While there are people who showed courage after September 11, 2001, Sandler plays Fineman, a lonely widower and "lost in his own world." Johnson (Cheadle), a practicing dentist, meets his old college buddy (Sandler) and wants to make up for "Old Times." We see, as in Rain Man (Dustin Hoffman), Fineman also becomes emotional and withdrawn in stressful situations. Oldies music seems to be a comfort and a "psychological" crutch that he can rely on. <br /> <br /> Johnson seeks out in Fineman that certain joy and ease are lacking His family. He also feels unhappy and dissatisfied in his job. In the same case, he also wants to make sure that his friend does not fall through the social "cracks". I have distanced myself from this film, with a different attitude and sympathetic pity for grieving families.
