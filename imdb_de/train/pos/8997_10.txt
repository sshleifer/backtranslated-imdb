I have seen this movie several times. I think it's one of the funniest things you can see, just watching the reactions of the different types of people they see. <br /> <br /> Type 1: OLD PEOPLE. Many old Japanese men and women visit this film because they believe it is a samurai film that is honest and includes many sword fights and medieval Japanese dialogues. Once the two protagonists begin to debate horror movies as they almost randomly place their goals in their sentences, the old folks usually go out in disgust. <br /> <br /> Type 2: FILM SNOBS. These people think that just because a movie has the label "Independent", it will automatically be a load of hard to follow, overmotional crap that may or may not appear in English. However, they only see it anyway to sing praise later so people think they are intelligent and cultivated. You will be really surprised when you see this movie. As soon as the blood begins to spew exaggeratedly on anime-inspired sword fights or the cocky villain casually lays the dog during a phone conversation with his crossbow, these people will be so upset that they go out. A few will stay just to see "how bad it is going to be" and later they will rave about what a terrible movie it was for their friends. <br /> <br /> Type 3: PEOPLE THAT EXPERIENCE LIVE ACTION ANIME OR MATRIX-LIKE SPECIAL EFFECTS. Sorry folks, the martial arts are pretty solid in the movie, but director Yamasato really does not have the budget for something like that. <br /> <br /> Type 4: PEOPLE WITHOUT EXPECTATIONS. These are the people who really enjoy the movie. Whether they just heard of Blood of the Samurai, randomly picked them, or stumbled into the wrong theater in a false haze, these are the people who laugh at all the jokes and appreciate the movie for what it is: ENTERTAINMENT. This film was not made to enlighten or provoke deep spiritual thoughts, it should (if I could borrow a line of dialogue from the movie) "really kick your ass". And that's what it does. <br /> <br /> Depending on the type of person you are, you may not be able to enjoy this movie; But if you appreciate the film for what it is, and enjoy an abundance of blood and drama, then visit this movie and bring your friends with you.
