Thelma Ritter stole the picture. I just finished it again. I could not help feeling emotional in her last scene. She did not get the Oscar. That's why you should not trust Oscars too much. Richard Widmark never had a better part and was a perfect casting as a flawed 3D human. Jean Peters was great as a streetwise, tough girl in her best role ever. And Richard Kiley must have been very good; Why else would I have hated him like this? Yes, the patriotism was cumbersome; but without her there is not much film. Watch their faces! The three best stars did not need much script. I would have liked to see how they made this film without dialogue. If you've ever seen Ray Milland and Rita Gam in "The Thief," you might know what I mean. When I was a child on my first trip to NYC in 1956, I was taken by my uncle from Bronx to the foot of South Street and looking for # 66. That's when I knew that Hollywood can not be trusted. But I found the river. <br /> <br /> I do not tell much of the story because I hate it when I know what happens before I see it for myself. If you have seen it, no explanation is needed. Maybe someone reading these comments did not see "Pickup On South Street". You will like it; Just do not go looking for 66 South Street in NYC.
