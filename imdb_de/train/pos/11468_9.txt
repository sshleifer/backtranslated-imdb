To be honest, I'm surprised how little was done about the Columbine massacre in the movie. There is no big documentary, very confusing. Fortunately, we have the talent of Ben Coccio, director of ZERO DAY, and Gus Van Sant, who made the equally fine ELEPHANT. Two different aspects of the event that share the idea that the real cause of the massacre will always be a mystery, that ultimately there is something confusing and unknown in the motives of the two killers and what actually drove them to carry it on in terrible reality. ZERO DAY, which allegedly consists of videotapes of the shooters and was found after the event, is absolutely fascinating. Even if you know where to go, you still hope that it will NOT "get there" ... and the tension in the final minutes of the movie is agonizing. The film is fantastic from top to bottom, from director to screenplay (not much improvised, although it seems very spontaneous), both for the two main actors as well as for the minor players. There is only one aspect of ZERO DAY that worries me. Okay, we can not understand why the shooters are doing what they did, but one of the contributors was certainly their anger. These guys do not seem to be really angry. They may say some things that indicate they are, but in fact they did not convince me that they had something in them that forced them to kill innocent people. But I still have the feeling why? that director Coccio wants me to have. Borrow or buy this movie, it will sneak up on you and stay with you for a long time. The people of BLAIR WITCH could only wish for the success of these guys in making a dummy documentary.
