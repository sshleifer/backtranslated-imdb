I absolutely loved this movie! It was so good! This movie is told by the parrot, Paulie's point of view. Paulie is given to the little girl Marie. Paulie helps Marie to talk and they become best friends. When Paulie asks Marie to fly, she falls and the bird is sent away. Then the adventure begins. Paulie goes through so much to get back to Marie. This movie is so cute, funny, touching, sad and more. When I saw this movie for the first time, it made me cry. The courage of the birds and the urge to find his Marie for the whole time was so touching. I have to say that the end is so sweet and sad, but you have to watch it to find out how it works. In the end, the janitor, after hearing his story, tries to help him. Will he find his long-lost Marie or not? Find out if you're watching this sweet, heartwarming movie. It will touch your heart.
