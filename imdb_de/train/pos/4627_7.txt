If you perform a play within the prison walls, why not choose the best playwright William Shakespeare? And if you pick your cast from a variety of criminals serving lengthy jail sentences for the most horrendous crimes, you can be sure you have plenty of time to rehearse. In a detention center in Kentucky, a bold project like this one has been undertaken with amazing results. This film shows how everything was done: the casting, the rehearsals, the set and the costumes and the closing presentation of Shakespeare's play "The Tempest". It had not occurred to me before, but there is an analogy between the attitude of the game and the prison prison. In the play the shipwrecked are confined to an island without contact to the outside world. Life in prison is very similar. <br /> <br /> With a simple painted back of a surrounding seascape, the characters appear intentionally, but with good heart and true sincerity, in an extremely appealing array of costumes in front of a licensing audience. <br /> <br /> More interesting than the play itself, the little cameos of each man were behind his character. One inmate regarded the play as a lesson in forgiveness, another as salvation of his sins. It was very moving to see the men wiping a tear as they talked about murder, shooting and strangling. Everyone felt like they would like to turn back the clock and reconsider their brutal actions. However, the past was (as someone said) a past, and the present was the beginning of a new future. At least, the play was temporarily relieved of the depressing thoughts of past events. The prison authorities should be applauded for allowing the play to take place. Such an event would put Kentucky on the map and hopefully other prisons could follow their good example. It seems to me that everyone can benefit, not just the Kentucky prison, but the prisoners themselves, who will find new self-confidence and self-esteem and prepare for the day they will be paroled.
