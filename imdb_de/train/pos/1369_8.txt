I loved this movie, and I'm one of the older people who should not enjoy it, or so it seems. No, this movie is not deep - who cares? This type of film never exists. But strangely, there is a message in it. It's like we all have the potential to be what we want to be. Parker Posey is great in this movie. I've always thought she's a bit like Katharine Hepburn. It's great to see that both Hepburn and Posey have made films about librarians (Hepburn is The Desk Set). All librarians, especially those with a sense of humor, should see Party Girl. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie an 8. It is by no means a great film based on cinematic standards, although there are some nice shots in there. But it is incredibly charming and entertaining.
