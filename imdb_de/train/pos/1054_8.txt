If you want mindless action, hot girls and a post-apocalyptic view of Seattle, this is the show for you! <br /> <br /> The concept of Dark Angel is nothing new (in fact there is controversy about it) whether James Cameron stole the idea from a book), but I spend the whole hour with it, every Tuesday from the beginning to watch until the end. Jessica Alba smokes and Max's friends (Original Cindy, Kendra) are just a shot. <br /> <br /> The battle scenes are getting better, but the dialogue between Original Cindy and Max has to be a little better (the slang sounds forced and it sounds like someone in the suburbs wrote that). In my opinion, Dark Angel is a great guilty pleasure, filled with everything an action fan could wish for. But if you're looking for a tough, award-winning drama, check out The West Wing for something.
