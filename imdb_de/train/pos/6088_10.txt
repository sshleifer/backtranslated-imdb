Was the script more appropriate for a 30-minute sitcom? Yes, but it works anyway! I thought the actors did a fantastic job with an otherwise bland script, especially Jack Black and Christopher Walken. Most people on the blackboard really seem to hate this movie. Personally, I do not see how that could be, but Envy is just one of the films you either love or hate. Similar to Napoleon Dynamite and every Leslie Neilsen movie ever made. They either think that it's one of the worst movies ever made, or one of the funniest. Avoid this movie because of the reviews. Look at it and see if you are one of those who really like it! If you do, I guarantee it's worth your money. If you do not like it ... well, you know it.
