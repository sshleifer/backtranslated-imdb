The problem with representing a real individual is that the performance can be good but does not work if the audience does not believe that the actor represents the person. That's the main problem with "Young Mr. Lincoln:" Henry Fonda does a great job, but I could not believe that Abraham Lincoln was spoken as softly as Fonda does. <br /> <br /> This is essentially a drama in the courtroom with a young Abraham Licoln at the helm. Whether this was a true story or not, I do not know, but if not, why talk to Lincoln as a central character? That does not matter. In the film, Lincoln defends two young men charged with murder. <br /> <br /> The film is really not very big and therefore seems to be pretty empty. I wanted more story and character development. The movie is 100 minutes long, but he does not feel like it. There are a few small scenes with Lincoln and the thriving relationship with Mary Todd, but they seem superficial. <br /> <br /> The acting is good everywhere, but as I said, Fonda's performance looks like a character, but not Abraham Lincoln I just do not think the real Lincoln was so quiet. He has a big voice when he has to, for example, when he persuades a drunken lynch mob to let the accused go to trial, but Fonda also portrays Lincoln too humble. The other achievements are solid, especially Alice Brady as Abigail Clay, the mother of the accused. She is a nice lady for whom we can really feel. Simple and uneducated, but very sweet; We can see why Lincoln wanted to help her. <br /> <br /> John Ford seems to find this film epic, and at the time of its release he was likely to. But even then, there just is not enough material to present it as such. <br /> <br /> It's a nice watch, but not a classic.
