This movie was really insightful. I have seen this movie several times. First when I was four and I actually remembered it and then when I was twelve. The whole message conveyed by the director is that everyone wakes up and does not make the mistake of letting God out of our everyday lives or just going an extra mile to insult him. <br /> <br /> A great movie for non-believers and believers!
