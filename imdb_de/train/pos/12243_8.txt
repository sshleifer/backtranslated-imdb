Kate Beckinsale is as good in this movie as Gwyneth Paltrow is like Emma, ​​although Gwyneth Paltrow really liked the other Emma version. They are both good in different ways. Kate Beckinsale as Emma, ​​however, seems almost more interesting. And I liked the woman Harriet Smith played in this movie better ... she was more believably sweeter and sentimental. However, there are a few things that I like better about the Gwyneth Paltrow version, like the humorous side.
