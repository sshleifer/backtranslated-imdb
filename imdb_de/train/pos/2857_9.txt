As part of our vocabulary of the late fifties, we knew Ponderosa, Little Joe, Hoss, Ben Cartwright, and so on in this great show, Bonanza. <br /> <br /> It was Saturday night and everyone was stuck to the TV. This was a real show that reflected family values. There may have been a weekly crisis, but it was the strong family atmosphere that brought everyone together. Lorne Greene dominated as patriarch of the family. His words showed wisdom. We often wondered why Ben Cartwright, a widower, must have been the best husband of his deceased poor wife. He raised wonderful sons. <br /> <br /> Of course we all wondered why Pernell Roberts left the show. The show was a gold mine and Roberts handed over a lot of money on his departure. His career never started because he was a Cartwright son. He should have tried to get back into the series. He certainly lost a bonanza when he failed.
