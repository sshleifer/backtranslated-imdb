I wanted to see this movie with my brother and girlfriend. The hotel was quite crowded and we all laughed so hard that it was easy to miss rows. I knew it looked good, as if it was good, but it was much funnier than I thought. I liked both Edward Furlong and Christina Ricci. They seemed really funny, just like normal people, if that makes sense. I'm sick of showing movies that show teenagers are like cookie cutters like "jock," "geek," or "cheerleading" ... etc. Both characters were unique, yet very human and normal enough to be on it to be able to relate. I will recommend this movie to all my friends and wait a lot for it to be released on DVD. Watch this movie with your friends who can laugh at the funniest parts of life! I intend to see it again in the theater, and I do not go to sightseeing more than once.
