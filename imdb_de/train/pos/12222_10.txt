I thought that this movie was wonderfully planned. He puzzled me and my cousin who was watching him. To tell the truth, I think the younger Kevin Dillon was hot the cop and that was wrong, what he had said to him before his death "I was in you". I think that's what she does for what she did to him, and how will he tell her she's too young, if he does not care how old the other girls were? I do not think I could ever trust a policeman like that. But to tell the truth, it was pretty obvious that he was, even if he wanted to become a cop, I would still be suspicious of him or something. and that was funny when she splashed his eyes on him in the shop.hahahahaha. She was still stupid because she had gone back to the warehouse herself, and so was the policeman who died HELLO !! This is called back-up. Sometimes these films drive me crazy when people are stupid and do stupid things. But that's what I think, a thought about the movie.
