This neo-noir thriller is an excellent interpretation of the novel by Jim Thompson. It contains all the necessary elements-the fallen ex-boxer, the alcoholic widow with uncanny wishes, the ex-cops transformed from little crooks, and a doomed kidnapping plan. However, the film never goes to the clich√© country, but remains fresh and fascinating. The performances are all outstanding, especially the role of Bruce Dern as a wicked sleazeball, Uncle Bud. There is a tense uncertainty in the movement of the film that deliberately or not contributes to the gritty process. Highly recommended.
