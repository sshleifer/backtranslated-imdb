The multi-layered novel by Rohinton Mistry did not seem to adapt to the screen, but the resulting film is full of passion, emotion, humor and pathos. The story is a bit slow, but there is always something on the screen to captivate the audience. The film captures a specific time and place perfectly. All actors are Indians - few, if not "Western" spectators - but they are a pleasure to see, especially the little girl who acts very convincingly. Do not be put off by the title and plot summary - this is a movie that can be seen on the big screen. We have much to learn from it.
