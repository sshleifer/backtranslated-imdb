There is no way to confront 'Zabriskie Point' from a rational point of view, or to try to describe it with words and conventions that you would use for other films. This is because it is not a movie. It's an idea and a feeling that the filmmakers have somehow become an object as banal as a movie. What we are seeing is not the unfolding of an action, but rather a sequence of events that we do not see in films every day, but just imagine that this is the background we will give ourselves when we hear of a tragic event in the news of or hear from friends. We see, is our idea of ​​people who are abstractions for us - nobody we know, but we have undoubtedly heard in a book, on television or somewhere. So what do we see? Events. We see people quarreling, driving and inevitably fleeing. Only the escape is of something unbelievable - it is the collective situation and cruelty that the mass of a civilization was allowed to exist through laziness or ... human nature. In Los Angeles in the 1960s, our players play against the self-inflicted misery of modern existence. These creatures are virtually empty tablets that can show every feature we can imagine if we wish. Although the measures taken can be considered criminal or irresponsible, the characters themselves are not criminals. They are people who are looking for a return to a familiar, non-established existence that goes beyond the normality they experience every day. Not that they are always happy or sad, but they achieve a kind of self-realization when they move away from the suicide of modern life. They only reach the true life in the natural world, even if this is the next victim of modern existence. In the end, 'Zabriski Point' is an eulogy of the attachment of the humanities to nature. As even the most abandoned parts of the earth succumb to our ideas of progress, we lose our soul to death on the path of the human mind.
