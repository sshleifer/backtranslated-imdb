One question that must be asked immediately would be: Would this movie have been made if the women had not been the aunt and cousin of Jacqueline Lee Bouvier Kennedy Onassis? The answer is probably not. <BR> <br /> But luckily they are (or were) the cousin and aunt of Jackie. <br /> <br /> This documentation of the Maysles brothers about existence (one could hardly call it a life) by Edith B. Beale, Jr., and her daughter Edith Bouvier Beale (Edie) have the same appeal as one Train accident - you do not want to look, but you have to. Big Edith and Little Edie live in a once-magnificent villa in East Hampton, New York, which is slowly decaying around them. The once beautiful gardens are now a jungle. <br /> <br /> Gorgeous oil painting leans against the wall (with cat droppings on the floor behind) and beautiful portraits of them, while young women on the walls next to the walls fight for space Covers of old magazines. <br /> <br /> Living alone for many years has torn down many barriers between the two women but has set others apart. <br /> <br /> Clothes seem to be optional. Edie's favorite costume is a pair of shorts with tights pulled up, and the torso and head are wrapped in patches of cloth and pinned. As Edith says, "Edie is still beautiful at 56." And in fact it is. There are times when she is almost luminous, and both women show the beauty that once was there. There is a constant undercurrent of sexual tension. <br /> <br /> Your eating habits are (until polite) strange. Spread on crackers. A dinner party on Edith's birthday of Wonder Bread sandwiches served on fine porcelain with plastic utensils. <br /> <br /> Time is irrelevant in their world; as Edie says, "I have no clocks." <br /> <br /> Your relationships with men are oh so strange. Edie feels as if Edith thwarted her attempts at luck. She says, "If you can not get a man to suggest you, you might as well be dead." To the Edith answers: "I take a dog with me every day." <br /> <br /> It's obvious that Edith does not see her role in Edie's lack of male camaraderie. At the beginning of the film, she says, "France has fallen, but Edie is not. <br /> <br /> Sometimes it's hard to hear exactly what is being said, both women talking at the same time and constantly contradicting each other. <Br /> < br /> There is a strange relationship with animals throughout the movie: Edie feeds the raccoons in the loft with Wonder Bread and cat food, and the cats (and there are plenty of them) are everywhere. <br /> <br At one point, Edie explains "The aristocracy's trademark is responsibility." But they do not seem to be able to take responsibility for themselves. <br /> <br /> This is a difficult movie to watch, but worth the effort yourself.
