My super ex girlfriend is no less a fun movie. <br /> <br /> The story is pretty simple. Matt Saunders (Luke Wilson) meets Jenny (Uma Thurman) in the subway and joins her. At the beginning of their relationship, everything seems fine, but then Matt learns that she's G-Girl. At first Matt seems really cool, but it turns out that G-Girl is very jealous and needy. So he decides to break up with her and meet with his colleague Hannah (Anna Faris). This makes G-Girl very angry and she takes revenge on her former friend. <br /> <br /> What I liked best in the movie are the scenes in which G-Girl avenges Matt. It was also nice to see Anna Faris in a different role than her character from the Scary Movie saga. <br /> <br /> I give this movie 7 out of 10 points and recommend it to anyone who likes a nice comedy.
