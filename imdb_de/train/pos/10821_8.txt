I also saw this when it was released in '56 and have since been impressed with its final scene. If this is an answer to "High Noon," then it's a fitting and appropriate answer. The notion that this string "The City Comes Together" is a much stronger message than the lonely personal heroism of "High Noon". In this theme, "Concho" is a phenomenal precursor to one of my other favorites of all time, "The Magnificent Seven." Both Sinatra and Conrad give impressive and convincing performances, especially Sinatra's transformation from a bullying brother to a liberated city rescuer. I can only hope that at some point all the friends and family members to whom I have devoted my affection for this film over the years will have the opportunity to experience them myself.
