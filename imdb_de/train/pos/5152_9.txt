"Hitler, the rise of evil" is clearly caused by people emotionally relieved by the horrors of World War II. This makes watching a refreshing experience. <br /> <br /> I think his greatest value lies in his crystal-clear revelation of the Nazi mechanism. Of the completely corrupt ways that Hitler had made to the top. Once there, this film ends. <br /> <br /> The "leader" (= leader) led his Germany into the biggest and most devastating war in human history. Six years later, the defeat of Germany ended. As a result, Germany lost its eastern provinces (= about 35% of its pre-war territory) and had to accept a division of the remaining area of ​​44 years. Both West and East Germany had to be rebuilt from scrap metal. Their reputation was severely damaged by racist-inspired Nazi atrocities. <br /> <br /> As I said, "Hitler, the rise of evil" is a good clock. In an acceptable 30s environment with (more than) competent action. In particular, Peter O'Toole's role as the old president of Hindenburg stands out and even adds an extra dimension. <br /> <br /> My issue of "Hitler, The Rise of Evil" also features a second DVD with two good documentary films. One deals with Hitler's personality, the second deals with the falsification of Hitler's diaries. In 1983, this fake in England and Germany caused a hilarious scandal that damaged the reputation of various historians and journalists.
