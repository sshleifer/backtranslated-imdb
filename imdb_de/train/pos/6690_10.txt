Mystery Men is one of those movies that gets funnier with time. There is a naive innocence and "friendliness" of the characters. It has become part of our family culture and we often quote the characters. It's my favorite movie of the last two years. My kids are 13 and 11 years old and we all love this movie. Great drama and comedy. We love Galaxy Quest and Monty Python Flicks. Okay, we're not talking about intellectuals here, just about family bonding!
