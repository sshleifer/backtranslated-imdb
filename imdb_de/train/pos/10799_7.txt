Ah, the 70s. A time when it should be a swinger. To be honest, today is also a good time to be a swinger, but it just felt more daring. <br /> <br /> Joe Sarno offers a pretty good softcore movie. In fact, some actors like today are famous hardcore actors. Unlike today, these people were good actors, and these films had an action and character development. <br /> <br /> It's pretty much what you would expect from a swingers movie. Two couples with open relationships spark the wanderlust of one of the women who came to visit, from the MILF. Not much more. <br /> <br /> If the MILF is Jennifer Welles, then of course it's a different story. Not too many 40-year-olds look as delicious as Miss Welles. It's worth the price if Ms. Welles sees herself in the mirror as if she were Aphrodite. She is not a "Stifler's Mom". She is much sexier. <br /> <br /> I also dug Chris Jordan's Anna. Jordan looks and sounds like Elaine Joyce, thinking that she could be her twin brother or even Elaine. Anna always eats, but has to have an incredible metabolism. <br /> <br /> Unlike the softcore porn of the 1990s, the '70s softie porn kept the realism of hardcore film (something that the 2000s softcore core occasionally brought with it instead of the' 90s) and music Canned orgasms) and it is here in full force. It's not real, but it feels real. <br /> <br /> For those who enjoyed the Quebec-produced "Deux Femmes En Or", you will enjoy it. Another classic movie, available only on drive-in classics, the best $ 2.50 per month you can spend.
