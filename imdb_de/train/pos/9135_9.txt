I do not care how many bad reviews purple rain gets, this movie rocks! Excellent movie, has everything, great music (Prince of Grob!), Romance and drama. <br /> <br /> This is really a very sad movie, very moving. I do not want to say too much, I do not understand the plot, but I say that - the film is very realistic, there are so many romantic relationships going through these issues, so many families are similar to those in the movie. I think that's very realistic and so real that the movie gets a lot more moving. My generation loved this movie as an adult, so many of us loved Prince, and there's a lot for every teenager who has had similar problems I can recommend it to all ages. And it's not all that dark, the movie features great music, band scenes and sexy fun scenes between Prince and Appelonia.
