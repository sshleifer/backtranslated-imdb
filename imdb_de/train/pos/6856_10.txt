This is an exciting, exciting masterpiece by Brian De Palmaw. It's extremely exciting and often scary and the score is fantastic, and all the characters were fantastic. Yes, it does give psycho a lot, but it is still a brilliant horror / thriller with a fantastic opening and a shocking and unpredictable finale! This is undoubtedly one of the best horror / thriller I've ever seen, and the elevator scene is one of the most memorable scenes ever. Besides, Michael Caine is just amazing! The end is excellent, and the hospital scene at the end is absolutely scary, and the final twist has shocked me to hell! It stole me over and over, and the stalk sequences are absolutely brilliant, and Nancy Allen and Keith Gordon have fantastic chemistry together! This is an exciting, exciting masterpiece by Brian De Palma, with amazing achievements all around! The direction is incredible! Brian De Palma does an incredible job here: amazing camera work, incredible angles, fantastic use of color, great zoom-ins and great POV shots, keeping the movie at a very fast pace! There is a little blood. We get bloody knife cuts, knife stabs, bloody gunshot wounds and 2 bloody slit-guts. The Acting is incredible! Michael Caine is amazing, he is amazing in the acting department, weird, very personable, secretive and has really done a great job. (Caine rules!). Angie Dickinson gives a memorable performance here, was pretty nice and had good chemistry with Caine. Nancy Allen is STUNNINGLY GORGEOUS! And is fantastic here, she is extremely likeable as a whore, had excellent chemistry with Keith Gordon and did a great show! Keith Gordon is very good as a kid, he had an excellent chemistry with Nancy Allen and was very personable! Dennis Franz is good as a detective. All in all, this is undoubtedly one of the best horror movies ever made, and I say what you do right away, and look at that! ***** of 5
