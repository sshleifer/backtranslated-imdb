I just saw it at the Toronto Film Festival and I hope it will be released because I want to see it again! It's a character-driven movie, and Andrew and David are more than up to the task. Any discussion of the plot could be considered a spoiler, so I just say that the plot is smart, the drama is outstanding, and the effects are amazing. Well filmed and in a good mood. One of the best movies I have ever seen, and very refreshing this summer from dreary <br /> <br /> movies. The audience laughed the whole time. See it if you can. (I especially liked the scene "Candy Bar! Candy Bar!")
