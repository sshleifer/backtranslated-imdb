I had never played badger for Richard Thomas. I was not sure if I would like him that way. And I was not sure he could do it. But that baffled me. He shook my back and let me take a closer look at the street people. The movie is captivating and fast. Bruce Davison is convincing, but he really can only play a nice guy. The real talent here is Thomas. The end was a bit awkward, but maybe real people would resist it ... If you're a Thomas fan, you MUST see him here at his best when he's so bad!
