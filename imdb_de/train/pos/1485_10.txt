This film contains personalities who play so well, I love the finale, when no one knows what they will do in their lives, but it is absolutely great to see and realize that the priest is right, what are the others doing there? The film embraces you to a new life, to experiences, to be able to dream with the other person and to achieve those dreams. Show you life as hard as it is. However, you have the opportunity to choose what you want and what you really need. I hope this comment works for you. The movie worked well for me. Incidentally, I bought the movie;) Take care.
