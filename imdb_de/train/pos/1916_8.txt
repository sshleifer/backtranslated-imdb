"8 SIMPLE RULES ... FOR THE FILE MYAGE DAUGHTER", in my opinion, is an absolute ABC classic! I'm not sure I did not see every episode, but I enjoyed it anyway. It's hard to say which episode was my favorite. However, I think it was always funny when a mishap occurred. I always laughed about it. Despite the fact that James Garner and David Spade were good, I liked the show more than John Ritter was the leading man. If you ask me, his sudden death was very tragic. Everyone has always done well, the production design was spectacular, the costumes were well designed and the writing was always very strong. Finally, I hope that a network brings it back to the fans of the show.
