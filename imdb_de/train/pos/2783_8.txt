None of your harder stories, and that's a real strength of this movie. There are at least two relationships where less self-confident writers would have added an all too predictable romantic tension. This not only saves the public that, but also raises surprises. There are a few Disney moments, especially at the end, but they are manageable. Overall it was well worth the rent and it was good, relaxed. By the way, when you get the DVD, look at the segment where the director teaches you how to make aloo gobi. We followed their instructions and it was BRILLIANT! Next time we'll do it the day before the plan to eat it, because this is a dish that will definitely get better if you have a full night in the fridge to let the spices out!
