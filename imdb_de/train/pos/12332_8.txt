I have seen the short time in horror film marathons several times and believe that this is a humorous parody that leads to the actual reference point of their reference. It is by no means a grueling waste of time. <br /> <br /> Although a student film does not excuse, he proves that he's carefully crafted with a budget of little to no dough. <br /> As noted by another reviewer, it's less than ten minutes, which is plenty of time to cleanse the palate with a toast of joy, sit back and run idly through the movie I think This short bread of a movie should be enjoyed as an aperitif for the title reference and the viewer should relax and roll with him.
