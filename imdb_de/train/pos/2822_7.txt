The movie Torrent was the first and last one for Greta Garbo. It was her first American-produced film at MGM, the only studio in the US she would ever work in. It was also the last time that someone else was charged in the credits about them, namely that Ricardo Cortez is their leading man. Torrent is based on Vicente Blasco Ibanez's popular Spanish writer Entre Naranjos. It's a pair of mismatched lovers, Garbo and Cortez, who can not quite get together, mainly because of the machinations of Cortez's mother Marta Mattox. <br /> <br /> Mattox is a nasty woman who has some idea who her son should marry. Remember that this is Spain, and such arranged marriages were still pretty neat at the time. Mattox has Gertrude Olmstead as her daughter-in-law in mind, she is the descendant of Mack Swain, a man rich in pigs. Swain takes care of the piglets for a few moments before turning them into big old pigs to be slaughtered. Blasco Ibanez had previously filmed the novels The Four Horseman Of The Apocalypse and Blood And Sand with Rudolph Valentino in the lead role. It might have been interesting if Valentino had done this with Garbo, but he might have gone beyond filming when that was done. In any case, Ricardo Cortez, a Valentino wannabe, comes in with the male lead role. <br /> <br /> One reason Valentino could not have wanted this film is that Garbo's Garbo's main character is clearly different from the other two aforementioned works. Dismissed by Cortez, who does what Mattox and her "advisor" banker Tully Marshall say, she leaves Spain and moves to France, where she becomes a major opera star. And leads a pretty scandalous life there. <br /> <br /> When she returns to Spain and tries to rekindle things, Mattox is even more outraged. She has a political career for her son. Cortez is now running for the Spanish parliament, which is strangely called Cortes. <br /> <br /> The title refers to a flood and a dam failure that causes all kinds of devastation in the countryside. Cortez actually defies the torrent in a rowboat trying to rescue Garbo from the danger zone. When they come together, they have a brutally open discussion, the brutality comes from Garbo. <br /> <br /> The special effects here, primitive, though they seem now, are quite remarkable for their time. They look very much like the 1939 recordings of The Century The Rains Came by 20th Century Fox, which received an Oscar for special effects. Unfortunately it came out for Torrent a year before the Oscar debut. <br /> <br /> I'm not going to end it, so you'll have to watch the movie to find out if Cortez and Garbo are finally coming together. Garbo rightly won rave reviews for her performance, and in a time when exaggerated gestures were the norm in silent film, she was remarkably subtle in her role. So she would be the rest of her career, she had a remarkable face for close-ups. <br /> <br /> Although Greta Garbo would do far better work than torrent, this movie is still a fitting debut for her on the American big screen, and she does well for today's audience.
