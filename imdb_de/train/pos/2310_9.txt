I was so surprised how great The Man In The Moon really was. I mean, I had initially expected a cheesy and predictable movie, but I decided to put it aside while watching (especially in tears) how big the movie "The Man in the Moon" was. This movie is so entertaining and aware of the sound, and it's just a fabulous movie was so cute and adorable) and everyone else. There was nothing that really bothered me, I felt the end somehow predictable, but very well done. Also, I felt that some things were simple or as if it had been done before, but still a great movie. Overall, I have to say that I do not want to say too much about this movie, not that it was bad, it's just a movie you either like or dislike. However, I would recommend it to anyone and everyone, even if you do not like this kind of movies, it is still a fun movie. <br /> <br /> 8.7 out of 10 stars
