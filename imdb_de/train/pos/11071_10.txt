I give ten out of ten, it's one of the best movies ever. Absolutely smashed, stunned and dazed by the whole picture, wonderful play by Jason Statham, Ray Liotta and the whole crew, amazing conspiracy ... Just look in and grab that you have to admit it touches your soul because it is strange. But there are all the answers you've been looking for ... The best, mr. Ritchie! The very best. Those who are looking for a simple fight and fight, keep shouting that they are disappointed. But nowadays there are many flat films in Hollywood, you can not remember what the next day was when you saw them. On the contrary, Revolver is unique, I could hardly have expected that it would be possible to present such a clear and ingenious picture of myself, of anyone who should see it. Absolutely unsurpassed, amazing, dazzling ... You can get a glimpse, if I observe that, I have no doubt about that. In fact, no words can express my admiration ... I still wonder how it was possible to shoot such a movie after years of giddy Hollywood nonsense. Thank you from the bottom of my heart, it's just the best.
