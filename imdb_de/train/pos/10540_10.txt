I can only agree with the taximeter that this is a fantastic movie and should be seen by a wide audience. The imagination, the visual interpretation of the script, the humor is always surprising. The two leads are great and really carry the movie. My advice would be to not even look at a trailer, just rent the movie and watch without any expectations. I've rented it from Blockbuster, so it's easily available in Brisbane, not everyone will enjoy it, but I think most people will have an opinion, and that's always good, unless it's just "that was stupid ". I loved this movie, you just do not see such gems every day. This should become a cult favorite. Try it, maybe you feel the same as me.
