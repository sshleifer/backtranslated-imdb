Another powerful chick movie. This time it's all about Diana Gusman, who always gets into a fight at school. Instead of being expelled, she takes her trouble elsewhere in the boxing ring. She trains as a boxer, meets featherweight Adrian and begins to fall in love with him. This film has the powerful message to take your dreams with you and go with them, even if someone does not believe in you (in this case, their father does not believe in them). That alone makes the movie worth the price. Enjoy
