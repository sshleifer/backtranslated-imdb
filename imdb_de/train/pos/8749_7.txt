I loved the movie, but as everyone said, there were some parts that were not developed enough. Personally, I thought the girls were very vapid before they ended up in jail. Sure, they should be innocent Americans, but still ... I felt they did not have the band that the best of friends should have. For example, the way they viewed each other for the photo looked very awkward in the montage they see in. <br /> <br /> Then there are some parts that were very ambiguous. I think it's pretty clear that the character of Danes did not do it, but I can see that can be confusing. Why did the camera linger on Manat with a very sombre look on his face after putting the suitcases in their trunk? I thought it was something, but it turned out to be nothing. <br /> <br /> Besides, the movie was great. I cried as Claire Danes took the blame; She is a great actress. <br /> <br /> Also, I wanted to see the thai inmate get kicked. Talk about the lack of closure ...
