Who would have thought - Hal Hartley creates a cinematic deduction for Syriana while maintaining his distinctive, idiosyncratic style. The merger is very entertaining. <br /> <br /> After not seeing a Hal Hartley movie for about a decade, I approached it with some caution. His brilliant productions of the nineties had impressed critics and audiences with their unique style and dialogue. In the director's earlier films, colorful characters were portraying life, often in the Long Island, New York or New York City region, at close range and revealing. <br /> <br /> My first caution comes from the description of this movie as a "spy thriller". To my pleasant surprise, Hartley manages to combine his established style and focus to produce a highly original drama of international intrigue. It works more than you can imagine. Hartley's film retains the dialogue and character that are its hallmarks, as well as a unique cinematographic style. Moreover, given the current situation in the world and the state of war promoted by it, it is very appropriately dark elements on all sides. Hartley has put all his skills into something new - a political film that deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as Syriana. Truly, he comes to his own. The performers understand well how to interpret Hartley's vision and style. Parker Posey fans will see them here in full bloom, still with us and more mature and gorgeous than before.
