************** Possible Spoiler ********** There is only one reason why I saw this movie and that was because I have a massive crush on Richard Belzer , (I do not know as much about humor.) There were parts that were funny, like Barbie and Ken Spoof and the dealer and the Pr√§sidentenskit. However, that is sometimes indecent (Dare, I say roughly?) It was sometimes funny, but it could have been better. Probably, if they spent more time with humor and less time to strip women, the movie would have been funnier. Some skits just leave only choke and contract, other sketches make you laugh and think strangely after. Unfortunately, this movie is outdated. If you are madly in love with Richard Belzer (It's worth it), it is worthwhile to see it out and chase chevy.
