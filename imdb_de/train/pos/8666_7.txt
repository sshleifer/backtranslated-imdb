Frankie Dio (Lee VanCleef) is a senior gangster who devotes himself to police or illegal gambling (for reasons I do not believe). Tony (Tony Lo Bianco) is a vicious thug who visits a pool hall and envies Frankie in his free time. If he is in the right place at the right time, Tony will be arrested with Frankie and sent to jail ... where they make a connection that, while not a friendship, is enough for the moment. <br /> <br /> This film came to me under the title "Frank and Tony", which is disappointing because I see an alternate name, "Mean Frank and Crazy Tony", which would have helped sell the movie more effectively , I suppose that's a tribute to "Dirty Mary, Crazy Larry," but what do I know? I saw it shortly after another violent crime novel "Violent Professionals" and I have to say that the two complement each other very well. <br /> <br /> Italians have always been behind the Americans in their budgets and production values, a real shame with this movie. It is considered a "Grindhouse" movie that wrongly classifies it into a B-movie (or worse). With a cleaner tone and image, this could be a Hollywood hit, I suspect. I found the story very interesting, the characters (and actors) above average, and unlike "Violent Professionals," the plot is pretty clear - not too many minor characters. <br /> <br /> If you like mafia movies or crime movies you should try out here. A movie about the mob that actually comes from Italy (how much more authentic do you want?) Is as much as you can ask. Sure, it's not "The Godfather," but it's not supposed to be. This is not a drama, it's a light comedy, a heavy action punk movie ... like "The Hard With a Vengeance" from the point of view of the bad guys. Well, okay, not really. <br /> <br /> If nothing else, this movie made me watch other films by the director and the lead actor. Films alongside "Escape From New York" (where VanCleef plays "Hauk") and the usual cult movies. What's more fun than discovering a lost classic?
