The movie has a great written genre story. It contains all the usual ingredients of Columbo. The way Lt. Columbo approaches and binds to his suspect, the way in which the mystery unfolds for him, the dog of Columbo, the cat and mouse game, which is great in this game and, thankfully, a little mitigating humor, mostly with the Columbo character. It's all written, though it does not even have a really original concept. Columbo had chased a detective / murder novelist and had been created more than once in a Columbo movie. <br /> <br /> It's also an extremely well-run film by James Frawley, who directed 5 more Columbo films in the 70s and 80s. He provided the movie with style and some really great and memorable sequences. <br /> <br /> It's one of the slower Columbo movies, though it does not run too long. This style and approach does not always work well for a Columbo movie, but this is the case in this film, perhaps thanks to the drama performances of the movie. <br /> <br /> Most Columbo film played a big known star or star from the beginning of filmmaking when the movie was his killer. In this movie, the little-known 81-year-old Ruth Gordon plays. She has not played in a lot of films throughout her career, but she is still known to some, mostly because of her role in "Rosemary's Baby," which also earned her an Oscar. She had a realistic and somewhat unusual acting style that some people might not like. She received her 4 other Oscar nominations throughout her career before winning in 1969 for Rosemary's Baby. She also has some great interactions with Peter Falk in her sequences. <br /> <br /> The film also stars a still young GD Spradlin. I say young, because I know him only from his latest productions of his career, even though he was already 57 at the time of this Columbo production. He is still alive but has not worked in acting since 1999. <br /> <br /> An even better entry in Columbo as a movie. <br /> <br /> 8/10
