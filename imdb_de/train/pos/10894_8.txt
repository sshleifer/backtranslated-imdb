I had some reservations about this movie, I figured that would be the usual bill - a formula film about Christmas. Since we were in the middle of a heatwave at the end of June, we decided to try anyway, maybe we would see snow. <br /> <br /> This movie turned out to be a laugh after another. Ben Affleck believed in his character, but the real star of this character is James Gandofini. He delivered his lines with a real joke about him and made a great "father". <br /> <br /> If you want to have some nice hours, have a look at them.
