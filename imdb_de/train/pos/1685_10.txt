I saw this movie for the first time around 1990 and died absolutely laughing. It became a cult favorite among my circle of friends, and we quoted it in a jiffy ("I'm going home in a bag!"). Needless to say, the humor is still there 15 years later. At Halloween time, it has become a tradition to introduce many of my new friends in this movie (well, you can still buy it on Ebay!). I've found that Halloween sweets taste much better when your tongue is planted firmly in your cheek This movie has it all - pathos, excitement, unrequited love, nobility and the list goes on. Royal Dano as Old Man Wrenchmuller offers an amazing, warm performance. I remember seeing him as a villain in "The 7 Faces of Dr. Lao" that ended badly. Here you really feel for the old from the beginning. <br /> <br /> If you are not careful, you will miss some of the humor levels of this movie. The creators have become subtly subtle in many ways with subtle commentary, subtle costumes on other sci-fi films, and even a scene torn from the pages of Wile E. Coyote. <br /> <br /> Do not Give It Up Many thought processes when trying to analyze a movie, people - it's fun without having to rely on the jumps, and should not offend anyone (well, maybe stupid people, but they do not know that they make fun of it.). <br /> <br /> - If you'll excuse me now, I'll get a 'Zag-Nut' bar ... <br /> <br /> -Ramsay "RC" Cowlishaw, karaoke DJ / entertainer
