Anyone unfamiliar with Takashi Miike's incredibly productive oeuvre may want to think twice about whether to turn this amazing film into his first experience with this truly extraordinary director. In keeping with Miike's practice of taking on any work that comes to mind, and then incorporating his own feelings into the script, this is basically a pretty simple yakuza thriller, in which a morally ambiguous cop chases after a gang, in his brother is advised by his lawyer. However, what brings the film out of the same old age is the utterly relentless attitude that is one of the worst and most terrible acts of violence in today's cinema. And that's not a nice, cool, clean violence that's so popular in US cinema - this stuff is uncomfortable, painful and HURTS! The pace is breakneck, the characters are uncommon without being burdened with eccentric floors. Miike's sense of humor reveals itself and the most unexpected moments, and his camera is never quite where you expect it to be, which makes it hard. Look away from the screen, whatever it shows you! There is not the end of "Dead Or Alive," "Ohmigod," but if you're not prissy, it's time to go aboard the Miike car before going on the "New John Woo" shopping list Hollywood studios ends up ...
