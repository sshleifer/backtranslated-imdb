When I saw this show for the first time, I found it interesting. I saw it, saw Sarah turn around, as if the character was seeing the world ... spinning around her. I understood, but I did not laugh much. <br /> <br /> On the stage and in her show she is racist, rude, insensitive and extremely selfish. At first I did not get it and took everything at face value. Then I saw her movie, Jesus is magic. I think that served me as a Sarah Silverman primer and told me what "language" she is talking about. She's like Marilyn Manson, who works so hard to give us a face full of terrible ideas and pictures, but you finally realize that it's not an attack but a statement. And once you understand that, you're glad someone finally gives it to you. <br /> <br /> I do not want to suggest that only smart people will understand this or that it is to prove that show hate your idiocy Although I like many "smart" shows, I still do not see the humor of Curb Your Enthusiasm. I have the impression that it is good, but I just do not understand it. Many people will never get the Sarah Silverman program, but I'm glad I came at some point. <br /> <br /> The creators of this show work hard, every episode is not just dialogue and action, but songs or dream sequences, production numbers. These people do not put together something to fill a window and delight the advertisers. They seem to be on a mission to make the best show they can put together. If I predict the future of this show, I would say that this is going to be the way of Arrested Development and Freaks & Geeks. It's canceled before it's time, live in the hearts of fans and on DVD. But take your heart, SSP creator, your audience is out and we'll watch as long as they let you do the show.
