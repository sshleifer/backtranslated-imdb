This was probably one of the best-made films of the 1940s - Warner Bros. at the height of their style. The photography of Sol Polito is probably his best performance - beautiful compositions and lighting with delicate shadow effects. Max Steiner contributes one of his most complex and beautiful scores - the epitome of his classic leitmotif method. The music adds great emotion to the plot and is exquisite and memorable. It's interesting to know that the same production team that made this film made "Now, Voyager" later that year - a good movie that won honors and awards and went down as a historic favorite because it played Bette Davis. In my opinion "The Gay Sisters" is a much better movie - better done in all departments and more interesting, complex and entertaining. An extremely unusual film that entertains those who consider him what he is rather than project his own modern creative sensibilities or their advanced and demanding standards of supercritical perfection. Every thing must be judged in its own time reference and for what it tries to achieve under its own conditions. Most of the complaints that I read in these reviews are so childish and miss the point completely. If you are hungry for a perfect filet mignon, do not go to the bakery and start moaning and complaining about the fluff pastry. The art of film criticism is really lost in a large part of the population. I'm sorry, folks - if this movie had a Rolling Stones score and a hundred intricate and soul-searching undergrounds, you would all be pleased. I take an old movie without modern intellectual demands on a weekday!
