Cinderella .... <br /> <br /> I had not seen this movie for the last time in about five years. The magic is preserved. There's something that definitely includes that storybook feel, that entertains songs, and that the secondary characters like everything. The bad guys in the form of step-sisters are totally evil and mean. Then there's the most magical Disney, the mice making the dress, and you know the rest. In conclusion, the four Disney Princesses movies are great, but this is a magical magical experience, seeing and enjoying. Oh, and of course Cinderella is wonderful as the main character of the movie. <br /> <br /> If you think about it, Disney movies can really lose their charm. With Elene Wood and others, the film has such a feeling, you just can not help but smile. You say the moral of this story is that dreams come true. Of course, some believe in the real world, others are hoper. In this movie, it's all the more magical when her rainbow comes to smile. <br /> <br /> And the rest is natural ... Cinderella
