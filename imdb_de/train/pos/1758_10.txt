I was really surprised by this movie. I went to the sneak preview and did not know anything about the movie except the trailer I had seen. I thought it would be some kind of manure party. I expect bad sex jokes and fart and a miserable main character, which will end up in the end, because that's the way films work. Instead, I got a smart, surprisingly original movie about a decent, average guy who just never had sex. Yeah, the movie is full of sex jokes and vulgarity and occasional back-and-forth nipples! But it's a lot in the spirit of Bad Santa and not Sorority Boys. All characters are people you probably know in real life, redeemable friends who are just trying to bring a brother together and live their lives. <br /> <br /> I thought this movie would be totally crap and I was very surprised. Yes, it's pretty over the top (come on, it's a movie about a 40-year-old maiden!), But it's very clever. <br /> <br /> In the end, you're really pulling for this guy, which says a lot about the movie, because frankly, was it really important to you if Ashton Kutcher found his car or not?
