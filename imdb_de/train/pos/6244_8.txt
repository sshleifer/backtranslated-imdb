Every country that has a working film industry has a reasonable (and maybe crazy) artist making films that you can only understand if you're part of that country. I think Dog Days is such a movie. <br /> <br /> You see the lowest level of Austrian society, dirty, disturbed, weird, hateful. But they still have enough money to afford tuned cars and big houses. And they definitely do a lot of weird things that seem "normal" to them because they do it all their lives. From a normal human point of view, you can now follow the movie easily and feel disgusted or fascinated and see a fine piece of Austrian art films. <br /> <br /> But if you live here and you know the people in which you see the characters dog days as a tumor of society. A society that gets more insane every day and sets its own rules that nobody can understand breaks the social system from the inside out. And you see the people. They are sitting in the park, standing on the opposite street corner and standing in the same row. Maybe you meet them in a bar or disco that you can visit. Maybe you even work with them professionally or they live next to your house. They begin to hate them without knowing exactly why. You will try to get away - but that will not work. Maybe you will end up like her. But it seems to be "normal" to you because you are doing it all your life now. <br /> <br /> Life is not so good, even though Austria is one of the richest countries in the world. It has beautiful people ... but some are also ugly. There are many hard-working people who do their best ... but others also ride on their backs and destroy everything the people of Austria have built up so far. <br /> <br /> Very pessimistic movie.
