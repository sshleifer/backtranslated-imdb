<br /> <br /> "Bleak House" is undoubtedly the finest adaptation of a Charles Dickens novel ever to be screened. Despite my favorite novels, I was extremely pleased with this Television Mini Series. The late, great Denholm Elliot was perfectly cast as the nobleman John Jardyce and Diana Rigg absolute perfection as the condemned Ladty Dedlock. The film captures the essence of the Dickens era and is extremely faithful to the book. He makes only minor action clippings that do not affect the story. Overall, a brilliant, moving and atmospheric film.
