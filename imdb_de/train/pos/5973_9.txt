This is a great, ridiculous horror movie that captures the essence of mid- to late-80's obsession with the supposedly evil metal music. I remember being freaked out by metal teenagers as a kid. It does not help that at age ten I found a desecrated grave in my hometown cemetery. It turned out that this weird metal child had dug up some old bodies and used their bones for a weird sacrifice for Satan. Maybe things have kept me from metal for a while, but I love it now as a 24-year-old. <br /> <br /> I bought this DVD for $ 6 and expected it to suck because of the lame cover. But to my surprise it reigned. It's about the extreme demonic power of metal. And you have to love a scene where a guitar shoots Lazer and headbanger evaporates in the crowd. This movie is great, if you love 80's metal and bad movies, this movie is for you. 9/10!
