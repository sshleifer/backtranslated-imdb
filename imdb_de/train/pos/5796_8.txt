Moonwalker is a fantasy music film staring at Michael Jackson with different segments. I will evaluate each segment individually. <br /> <br /> Segment 1 opens the movie with a music video. The music video is a concert by Michael Jackson, who plays the song "Man in the Mirror". The music video also features montages of historical figures such as Gandhi, Martin Luther King JR, John Lennon and more. The first segment was a good choice to open the film. I liked the song and the montage of historical figures was thrilled. I even loved the message in the song. I give the first segment a 9/10. <br /> <br /> Segment 2 shows a montage of Michael Jackson's takeoff from the Jackson Five to his solo career. The montage that I thought was well done, I liked the animation they put in them, and I also loved their selection of songs like "I want you back, beat it, thriller, can you feel it and you like me feel. " The only thing I wish they could have done a bit better in one of the montage songs is "We are the world". They only see raindrops. There are pictures of Michael Jackson and celebrity refrain in these drops, but it's a bit difficult to see the chorus. Apart from that, the segment is still good. I give him a 9/10 <br /> <br /> Segment 3 is the song bath. You probably think it's Michael Jackson's music video of bad, well and no. This segment is the music video, but it was redone by Kids. The segment was cute, but it was not as good as the other segments. I give him a 6/10 <br /> <br /> Segment 4 is a short Claymation Music movie that runs after the kid's version of Bad called "Speed ​​Demon". In short, Michael Jackson is pursued by his beloved fans and the press, and he disguises himself as a hare and rides a motorcycle to free himself from them. The Claymation in the chase sequence was great, but in some parts of the movie, the Claymation characters looked a bit spotty when interacting with real humans. Even at the end of the clip out of nowhere, the Michael Jackson rabbit costume comes to life and he dances with it. I liked dancing, but it was out of nothing. I give it a 8/10 <br /> <br /> Segment 5 is Michael Jackson's Grammy-winning music video "Leave me alone." The music video is about the media that are staring at Michael Jackson's private life, and Michael Jackson believes that they will not leave him alone, no matter how innocent he is. The music video really sounds (but remember that this happened before the child was molested, just about the rumors about him in the 80's.) But I do not feel like this video should be in this movie, because it's a kiddie movie and I do not think children will understand what he's singing about. I'm giving this music video 8/10 <br /> <br /> Segment 6 leads us to the main story of the entire movie called "Smooth Criminal". Michael Jackson plays a gangster who uses his powers of a wish star as a criminal figure to protect children (including John Lennon's son Sean Lennon) from a bad mobster named Mr. Bigg (played by Joe Pesci). The section that I thought he had brought out of the movie, especially as he danced and sang the song "Smooth Criminal" with a bunch of criminals. I also liked the special effects. The weird thing about this segment is why kids hang out with an adult guy and never explained why. Joe Pesci also talks about drugs and what he intends to do with them. Why should you talk about drugs in a children's film? Otherwise it was good. My rating for this segment is 8/10. <br /> <br /> Segment 7 is the last segment of the entire movie. The film ends with Michael Jackson singing a cover version of the Beatle song "Come Together", and then we see Michael Jackson singing with Ladysmith Black Mambazo. Michael did a good cover of "Come Together" and I think it was a good idea to record a group of good singers with a talented musician like him. My rating is 9/10 <br /> <br /> This movie is a good movie by Michael Jackson. I think he really brings out the imagination of the kids. The movie is almost as imaginative as the Beatles animated film "Yellow Submarine". If you like Michael Jackson and you're planning a movie with lots of creativity, this is the movie. My overall rating for this movie is 8/10
