I can not understand what fans of this genre did not like about this movie. It was really fun. The special effects were wonderful. I generally agree with the ratings and voters of the IMDB, but not this time. I waited until there was a home video, which, in my opinion, was another reason why I could not enjoy the movie. I think Special Effects movies are on the big screen, but again, that was not the case. For me, the film is a comparison with two films that were released at the same time. Blair-witch and the mom Both films, which I thought was terrible. Blair was probably the most overrated horror movie of all time. The mummy made money and it was just rubbish. People liked it because of its special effects. Films like Mummy and The Haunting are not rich in character development, they are more like Funhouse rides. Well, by that analogy, the Mummy was a B-ticket to the Haunting E-ticket.
