I saw this movie when it was released in 1989. I enjoyed it then and I still do it. What I now realize, though, is that this is pretty "grown-up" for a G-rated movie, especially the idea of ​​dying and going to heaven. Burt Reynolds and Dom DeLuise work beautifully together, and Reynolds' voice is suitable for a junkyard dog. There are some good songs ranging from "Upbeat" ("Let's Make Music Together") to "Emotional" ("Home to My Heart"). I thought the plot was good, although it touches once or twice. The last scene of the film with Charlie and Anne-Marie is one of the saddest I've ever seen in the animation. An eventful movie.
