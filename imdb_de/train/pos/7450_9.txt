This is the best of Shelley Duvall's high quality "Faerie Tale Theater" series. The ugly stepsisters are Broadway-quality comedy and Eve Arden is the personification of the evil stepmother. Jennifer Beals does an excellent job of smooth Cinderella, especially in the garden scene with Matthew Broderick's Prince Charming. Jean Stapleton plays the good fairy well, although I'm not sure if I liked the characteristic "southern lady" on some lines. Steve Martins comedic relief as a Royal Orchestra Conductor is a quintessence of Martin, which, however, was moved a little in the course of the show. from 15 years). With a few minor bumps, the show flows well and they live happily ever after. Children under the age of 8 will still see it after their parents are fed up - I found 3 times a day a bit too much.
