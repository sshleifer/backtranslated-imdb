This is a small movie, few characters, theatrical. And yet it says something about Ireland that you will not find anywhere else. This movie IS IRELAND. It's all rudeness, sadness, self-delusion. The boys, Master Doyle, SP O'Donell, The Cannon, Senator Doogan's daughter, Gar, and especially Madge kneeling to pray with them. They are our sad story and they are our present.
