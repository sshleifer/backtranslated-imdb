Wow, this movie had a big impact on me, it moved me. It's an amazing story about a girl in Cambodia being sold in the sex trade. I can not stop thinking about the fate of the little girl named Holly. The backdrop of the film is realistic. The film was an eye-opener. I can not imagine anyone going away without wanting to change that terrible problem. The movie was very moving. It was one of the best movies I've seen this year. The <br /> girl Holly plays does a fantastic job with her character. Ron Livinston gives a fantastic performance. The movie moved me to tears. He tells an important message that needs to be heard worldwide. Everyone should see this movie. I think this movie will make a difference, I loved it!
