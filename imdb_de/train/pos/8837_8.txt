My personal feeling is that you can not separate this film from its political / historical backgrounds, as is the case with many (American) reviewers. It's not about growing up in Main Street in the US. It's about growing up in Yugoslavia at a time when it was torn between East and West. As the guys get torn between Esther and everyone else and Esther gets torn between the "Tovarish Joe" and the boys. In certain situations, a shame is lost on an audience that has never lived under Tito. I think the movie is undervalued and it's too bad we lost the director. Films like these make freedom appear more important. It's not just "another East European coming-of-age movie," but a sympathetic portrayal of teenagers walking on a narrow line that could eventually lead them to freedom.
