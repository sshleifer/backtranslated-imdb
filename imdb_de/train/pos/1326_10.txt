I saw this movie at a college film festival in the 1970s - I was waiting for FOREVER to see it on video (it's finally over). It was made in Brazil, so I assumed it had not come to the video yet. I've been looking through video stores for the past 15 years, waiting for this outstanding movie to come out! It's one of my favorites of all time - but be warned, it's funny, like Werner Herzog's weird - his comedy is based on his superrealism. <br /> <br /> The film is based on a real incident Several centuries ago, in pre-colonial times, when Europeans first came across tribes in the Amazon. A white man is mistaken as a foe by a wild tribe of cannibals, so they intend to kill him. But before they send him off, they make him part of their tribe (their habit). The entire film is like a documentary by National Geographic when it becomes an accepted member of their tribe. That's it. Cosmic action? No. Intensive insights into the diversity of human life? In any case. <br /> <br /> Oh yeah ... be warned ... this movie definitely has nudity - this is not a Hollywood movie about noble savages ... this movie says it was like it (again read) would be above: National Geographic, Superrealism) <br /> <br />
