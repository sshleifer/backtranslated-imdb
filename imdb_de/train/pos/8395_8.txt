*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** This is undoubtedly the best movie Rainer Werner Fassbinder has ever made, and even with the wonderful script, the film is enhanced by a great performance by Hanna Schygulla. The film begins when Maria (Schygulla) and Hermann Braun (Klaus Lowitsch) marry just as the bombs continue to fall and Hermann is shipped off into the fading days of the war. Now Mary and her mother and sister have to sneak past to survive. Maria decides to get a job as a dancer / prostitute in a club geared towards American GIs, and she meets a black army soldier named Bill (Greg Eagles), and they see each other constantly. Maria hears that her husband Hermann died in the war and therefore gets very serious with Bill. But one day, when he became familiar with Bill, they see Hermann at the door. He did not die and when he enters the room, it comes to a run and Maria breaks a bottle over Bill's head and he dies. Hermann is guilty and he is sentenced to a long prison term. Maria tells him that she will achieve something and get him out. The war is over and Germany needs to be rebuilt. One day Maria meets Karl Oswald (Ivan Desny), a successful textile merchant, and she uses her charms to get a job. Determined to do well, Maria steps up the career ladder and becomes Charlemagne's lover. She tells him that she will never marry him, but he loves her. Hermann comes out of prison, but goes to Canada to overcome all that Mary has done since he was imprisoned. <br /> <br /> ***** SPOILER ALERT ***** <br /> <br /> One day Karl dies and leaves Maria pretty much in his will, and Maria buys her own house. Then Hermann finally comes home to his wife and both are ready to marry, although they have been married for some time. Maria lets the gas on the stove and the house explodes, and both are still there. <br /> <br /> There are so many interesting things in this film that it is one of those films that can be studied and discussed to great lengths. As in all Fassbinder films, the use of color is used in a very interesting way. At the beginning of the film, the tones are brown and gray to represent the war-torn Germany, but when Maria becomes successful, they change into bright, saturated colors like red and white. The reconstruction of Germany with all the building noise serves only as a backdrop and the film remains aligned to the achievements of Mary. Fassbinder wanted the sounds of the reconstruction to remind us of what was going on in Germany at the time. Hanna Schygulla has never been better and her performance is the key to the success of this film. With a smaller actress this would have been just another interesting movie, but Schygulla is so strong that her performance elevates this movie to an elite status. Schygulla shows Mary as very determined and wise, but at the same time she uses her beauty and femininity to get what she wants. She is not ashamed, nor does she feel guilty, and Fassbinder wanted to show Maria as a woman who practically sells her soul to survive. Schygulla was not nominated for an Oscar, but she has done a great job outlasting time. Fassbinder himself appears in the movie as a peddler, and his own mother Lilo Pempeit plays Ms. Ehmke. I have heard a lot about the end of the movie and it has to do with whether Maria deliberately gave gas. Later in the bath she runs with water over her wrist and she seems sad. This is just a speculation and if you think I'm wrong, please email me. I think she was overly excited by Hermann, who was home, and left it by chance (remember that she put on a dress for no reason?). When the will is read out, she learns that Hermann and Karl have made friends without their knowledge, and I think she felt that everything she had done was in vain. That's the reason for the bathroom scene. So when the house explodes, it's random. But I think the reason for Fassbinder is an end because he shows that anyone who would sell his soul has no business life. Fassbinder was fascinated by the survivors, but he was also incredibly passionate. In his view, Mary can not have both. A fascinating movie.
