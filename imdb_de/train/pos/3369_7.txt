Regardless of what the title implies, "Pigs Is Pigs" is not Porky Pig. It shows more of a young pig with an appetite more insatiable than John Belushi's character in "Animal House". His mother scolds him again and again, but it's no use. So much so that he goes into another house where a confused scientist force-feeds him, more than any mere mortal, as a placeholder among the really great cartoons (Daffy Duck made his debut three months after they came out). But do not make mistakes, they are doing some nice things here. The whole force-feeding sequence seems to be more relevant today, given the obesity epidemic that is catching up with our country.
