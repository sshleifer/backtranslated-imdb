This is a true story of an Australian couple being charged with murder when their toddler disappears. Meryl Streep, as always, is excellent and manages to keep our interest, even if she plays a character who is not very personable. <br /> <br /> The media frenzy that surrounds this case in Australia is reminiscent of Sam Sheppard's Ohio homicide in the 1950s. These real situations show that the media can actually influence the handling of criminal proceedings. I still remember the Cleveland Plain dealer who made a huge headline saying, "Why is not Sam Sheppard in jail?" The prosecutor eventually succumbed to this relentless pressure, and Sheppard was tried and convicted. Only after years in prison was he relieved. <br /> <br /> I love films that tell a true story, make it interesting and represent an important point in the process. This is one of those movies. Other good films that tell the story of innocent people charged with crimes are Hurricane, The Thin Blue Line and Breaker Morant. The latter is especially another Australian movie, which is highly recommended. <br /> <br /> 8/10
