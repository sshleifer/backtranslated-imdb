But how can you handle a baseball team that can not win? It's not easy for George Knox. While the movie begins, Roger Beaumont (Joseph-Gordon-Levitt) and his best friend J.P (Milton Davis Jr.) ride their motorcycles around the Angel's Stadium. Upon her return to her foster mother's home, Roger is surprised to receive a visit from his father (Dermot Mulroney). His mother is dead! And when he asks his father when they want to become a family again, the father jokes: "I say, when the angels win the division championship". Later, Roger and J.P hide in a tree to see the angels playing baseball. As the crib George Knox (Danny Glover) takes out his thrower, the launcher goes crazy and gets into an argument with him, and soon the Angels team gets into the fight, in which Knox is thrown out of the game. That night, Roger makes a prayer, because the angles win the championship. When his foster mother Maggie Nelson (Brenda Ficker) agrees that Roger and JP go to baseball, Roger sees real angles coming on the field and helps the left fielder (Matthew McConaughey) make a catch that leaves the crib and the pitch -Spielmann (Jay, O Sanders) How did he do that? Roger learns from Head Angel (Christopher Lloyd) that only he can see the angles because he was the only one who prayed for help. <br /> <br /> 10/10
