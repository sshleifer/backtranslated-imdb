A French movie that Ester Williams would love. Synchronized swimming, however, was just a catch on the story of three girls in a Parisian exurbia who found themselves. No question where Sciammas sympathies, as all boys are depicted as "animaux", but actually only the three girls are in focus and all the time, with the few adults and the other teenagers mostly in the background. Marie is a girl's staff, unattractive but determined. She wants to become a swimmer and forces herself on Floriane (one Renascence quality beauty per reviewer). She is also a convenience friend to Anna: not unattractive, but for her the time of perfection of her body was short and now she is a teenager in a female body. What follows is a journey to self-fulfillment without a roadmap, but there is an oppression about the three that is not natural: where is the gaiety and thoughtless chatter of youth? While the Dénouement was breathtaking, with a beautiful depiction of Florian's self-portrayal and the equally beautiful union of Marie and Anne, everything looked abstract, Sciammâ € ™ s puppets.
