When I was a kid, I totally loved both Bill and Ted Movies. A few days ago, Bogus Journey was in progress, and since I had not seen it for at least 5 years, I decided to vote. This movie is still funny after all these years. 'Excellent Adventure' is better, but this rocks as well. Sure, some of the performances are a bit cheesy, but hey, the whole movie is cheesy in a cool way. It also offers the coolest personality of death in a movie! Conclusion: Total like a not-false movie type! Way excellent! RAILWAY STATION!!!
