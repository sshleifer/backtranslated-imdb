I really liked the movie. I remember reading it several times as a kid, and was glad a movie was made about the book. I sat for a boy and a girl at the age of 11 and 8 years and had to do it. Talk to the girl to see the movie. But in the end, she was glad she had seen it and even said that she wanted to buy it on DVD as soon as it came out. <br /> <br /> There were some great moments to laugh The movie was not as "gross" as I expected ... it was quite high on the gross meter ... <br /> < The only thing I can not figure out That 's why they had to have the "thick" line that Woody made in relation to his private part ... that was the only shock moment for me (and you could see the adults in the Audience audibly gasp for breath in the movie) ... I have no idea why this was included in the film; it did not add anything to the actual movie except for that shock / poppy factor ... besides, a pretty good movie. Nice to see that the "Pepsi" girl has grown up.
