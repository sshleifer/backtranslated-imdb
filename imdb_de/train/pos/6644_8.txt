After too many years of waiting, the 1979 book "The House Next Door" by Anne Rivers Siddons was finally filmed. The result differs slightly from the novel, which is understandable, especially in the first story of the trilogy, though unsatisfactory because it is a television film whose total intake is very good and really is very good, just not as good as the Book of Stephen King's darlings and one of mine. <br /> <br /> With more maturity and less restrictions than theatrical release would have all the wealth inherent in the original three-part history of the ominous ultra modern house, Especially the climatic disclosure can be explored promoted near the end. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, the whole cast is good in this thoughtful story of mindless malice. There are a few unnecessary cheap shocks, but the growing atmosphere of fear is well developed. It is in fact in one of the most disturbing scenes to an abstract painting of the house by a neighbor next door is working as an amateur artist who tries to visualize his bribery on canvas. <br /> <br /> Be sure to read the great novel.
