I saw the German version of the movie on German TV and was really excited. I generally like documentaries, but I can not remember watching a movie that is better than "Earth." I knew some scenes from Youtube videos that I found by random browsing. I also remember that I saw parts of the movie in multimedia stores running on the HDTVs shown. After watching the movie, I realize why the material is so popular with YouTube users and multimedia retail managers: it's so amazing and spectacular that you can not help but stare at the screen, no matter Whether you are generally interested in nature documentaries or not. <br /> <br /> Without hesitating 10 out of 10. Of course, there are more exciting films, but in terms of documentary films, 'Earth' is definitely one of the best in its genre.
