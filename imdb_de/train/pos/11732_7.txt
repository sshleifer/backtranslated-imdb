OK, I saw that in the movie theaters when it came out, and I do not know why. I have not seen it since then, but I landed on this site because I was thinking about this movie - again I do not know why. But the fact that I remember speaks volumes. <br /> <br /> Comedy is tough - harder than any drama. If you do it right, it seems easy, but if you do it wrong ... is there anything worse than a bad comedy? Steve Martin, pay attention, you fall back into this category for some reason. <br /> Elvira Mistress Of The Dark must have done it right, that I lovingly remember this movie. Quick, with a wink and with the knowledge that it is not the Philedelphia story, but from beginning to end. Brain Donors is another one that fits into this category (without the most unfounded jokes). <br /> <br /> One issue - the end. It seems the writers / directors have no idea how to complete a comedy. The end is trying to be a love story that undermines the quirky, quick dialogue up to that point. Then there is the "tassel" scene. While this must be seen (male opinion), it is so over the top and wrong, it's like a shock. Another revision for the end was needed. <br /> <br /> This is not a genius comedy genius like Spinal Tap or The Producers or The Holy Grail. But if you do not try to dissect it, and let the puns and juicy fun come to you, you'll laugh, I guarantee it.
