It's been 16 years since it originally started, I was hoping that a "marketing wizard" would have promoted a live cast version of this classic, or at least re-release the original 65 episodes. I can not understand why the sci-fi or cartoon network did not catch that. Galaxy Rangers actually had well thought-out plans and even better scripts. The animation was above average for their time and outstanding in comparison to the Japanese animated films of today's slideshow. It was older than the heavy toy tie on the market. This could also have sealed his fate. I would like to spend money on a GR DVD, if available.
