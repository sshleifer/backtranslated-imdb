George Lopez never got me interested in his stand-up comedy, and he still does not. But this show is a work of art. It's not always shown where the jokes make you laugh every time you remember (and jokes that remind you). This show just looks upbeat and the characters range from an old, short drunk to a dyslexic teenager. I do not know who writes this show, but that person does a good job. If they had just continued the series, I'm sure they would get a positive response from the critics of this great country. If you're looking for a good, traditional comedy, then George Lopez is the show for you! The only bad thing is the title. George Lopez? "Really?" Imagine that the Prince of Bel-Air is "Will Smith". Come on dude! But otherwise this show is awesome! 10/10
