It's kind of crazy, but I've both recorded from TCM, both from the German version of MGM's "Anna Christie" and the English ... but I first saw this because I'd heard that many people thought better as the English version. <br /> <br /> I can not compare them without seeing the other, but still this is an excellent early talk with a straightforward Garbo performance. She looks very beautiful in this movie, her face shines consistently, especially when cameraman William Daniels gets these great close-ups of her. <br /> <br /> The atmosphere of the film seems to be different than the normal MGM stuff. In this era it looks very similar to the French or German expressionist films from the 1930s. Well, it was directed by a great French director, Monsieur Jacques Feyder, who staged Garbo in 1929 in The Kiss. <br /> <br /> Theo Shall is excellent and offers an absolutely credible performance as Anna's lover, the hard-nosed, tough sailor who's just a kid in a man's body. Even Hans Junkermann does a very good job, as does Anna's alcoholic and Salka Viertel as a good-natured old cheap swimmer. <br /> <br /> An experience in every sense, because it's the only movie you can hear talking to Garbo in a foreign language ... 'all the other films she made either in Sweden or in Germany, were during the Silent Era. <br /> <br /> Serious Flick.
