Kurt Russell is so credible and the action so uninterrupted that you have to think about it later, to realize that it's about honest good to discuss important issues, friendship, etc.] can get into the story. This is so rare for a "guy action movie" that even I (who thinks A / A is violent) liked the movie and recommended it to anyone I know. Actually, it should be one of the biggest action-adventure games Be it kinokassen hits - it has something to offer everyone, without burdening the frivolity or losing almost uninterrupted action moments. I'm afraid the answer to not becoming a hit is that adults did not want to visit them. Anyone under the age of 20 has probably not only seen more violent action in their video games, but either would not capture or take care of the multi-faceted, multi-layered beauty. This movie could transform anyone avoiding A / A as mindless violence. If a man takes his lady (or rents her, or sees it in a cable directory) to see this movie, he'll much rather make her go to other action movies with him.
