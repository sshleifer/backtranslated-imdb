Wow, that was a great Italian "ZOMBIE" movie by Luci Fulci ("ZOMBIE") and Bruno Mattie ("HELL OF THE LIVING DEAD"). Lucio started this movie and was sick Surprisingly better than I expected it to turn out. So, if you saw Bruno Mattie's "HELL OF THE LIVING DEAD" and if you saw "ZOMBIE" by Lucio Fulci and you liked both or one of the topics, this is a movie that you absolutely need. Look, it has a great one "ZOMBIE" Make-up that looks the same "ZOMBIES" has a funny "ZOMBIE" flying head! And "ZOMBIE" birds that spit acid and turn you into a "ZOMBIE" people), but they are mainly just the great venomous "ZOMBIES" as in Bruno Mattie's "HELL OF THE LIVING DEAD". So if you like Italian "ZOMBIE" movies or just "ZOMBIE" movies then this is a great Italian "ZOMBIE" movie!
