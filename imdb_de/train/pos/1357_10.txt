Wow, what an episode! After watching Mellisa making cameos over the friendship between Annie and Brandi last week, I almost had to puke. But that was nothing until he saw Mellisa's tirade after being fired. Watching her whirl around on her cast and spit out obscenities and scream at someone picking up her purse was absolutely the hilarious thing ever on reality TV. She kept shouting for people to drop off to get her clothes "all" as if someone else were wearing one of their hideous outfits. Mellisa, are you 40 years old and still throw tantrums? Then Joan calls Annie and Brandie to name each one in the book, gets up and ends the show! Both rivers are pampered brats who have stayed on the show for just so long to maintain the ratings. Mellisa cries and refuses to conduct an exit interview. She proves America what everyone thought you were a spoiled baby. WAH WAH I can not get through! I love how Annie told the cameras that she could manipulate Mellisa to think in her direction, and then did just that. Mellisa is by far the smartest candidate and clearly deserves to win the whole game.
