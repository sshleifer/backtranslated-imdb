I cried my heart and saw this movie. I have never suffered from an eating disorder, but I think that this must be a very true picture. Alison Lohman is excellent! She expresses these feelings amazingly well. My teenage years came back to me so alive. Anyone who has had difficult times as a child or teenager can refer to this film. I recommend you all to see it! <br /> <br /> The music is great too - I have now discovered Diana Lorden. <br /> <br /> I'm also pleased to see Alison Lohman in White Ol√©ander, because I'm sure she's perfect for the role of Agnes.
