Emily Watson's Natalia is absolutely the loveliest and most romantic lead character I've ever seen on a screen. She is the queen of this movie without a doubt. Or is she turned king? The internal weaving of the chess games and the struggles of the families for control, power and victory are astonishing. Just like the chess masters in the movie, the director plays many simultaneous games simultaneously with our minds, but they are all interwoven into either large or small patterns. The epoch, the costumes and portraits of the Italian seaside district of the early 20th century are magnificently captured. No space is wasted. <br /> <br /> There are so many brilliant scenes that I can not tell all of them. I recommend leaving enough time for budgeting to watch this movie twice or even a week, as you may not be able to capture all the poetry in a 64-square multidimensional frame. <br /> <br /> I have not read Nabakov's book, but to try an analogy of myself, what I'm reading reminds me of another romantically successful poetry-as-feature, Barry Levinson's The Natural. This completely overruled the vicious end of Bernard Malamud's fatalist book in favor of a romantic impressionism that was uniquely American. Well, the director has done better by seamlessly integrating the customs and customs of Russia and Italy as the background of the Enlightenment. The real story here is that games are zero sum; There is a winner and a loser unless both participants draw. But in life, and especially in the context of our immortal souls, we are limited only by these limitations and life conventions to the extent that we let others break our minds. <br /> <br /> Pure love, embodied by Emily Watson's Natalia, can transcend and allow everyone to enrich themselves through their gifts. Only the barriers created by our fears can cut us off. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie (10/10).
