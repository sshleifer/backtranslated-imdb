Well, I'm from Bulgaria, where it's almost impossible to have a tornado, but my imagination tells me to be "very, very anxious" !!! This guy (Devon Sawa) has done a great job with this movie! I do not know exactly how old he was, but he did not behave like a child (WELL DONE)! Now to the tornado - it was not very realistic, but scares you! If you want to have a good time watching TV - that's the movie!
