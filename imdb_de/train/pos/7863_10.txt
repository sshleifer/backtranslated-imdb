This film is an eye-opener for those who only master the glamorous lifestyles of the stars. It tells you how people who want to do good can not do this. In addition, the bomb blast scene is very real. <br /> <br /> What you read and learn, just does not happen !!! <br /> <br /> Can increase your blood pressure by 10% <br /> <br /> All actors played their role very well. <br /> <br /> Some scenes could / could be avoided to involve teenagers. <br /> <br /> This movie is quite adult in nature. <br /> <br /> No movie that can be seen with the family. <br /> <br /> Casting is great !!!
