This is easily a 9. Michel Serrault, known for his comic roles in the first half of his acting career, does a formidable, even disturbing job. Petiot, a legendary French serial killer. <br /> <br /> He's just so believable in the movie at all times that the actor disappears completely behind the character - only the best that's ever been achieved, and when they do, it's only in a handful on best. <Br /> <br /> The whole story (a real story that happened in France in the 20th century) is so powerful, so scary - it's a very powerful movie to remember long and long.
