I found it quite interesting that my social teacher / language teacher was the police chief who held the microphone on the water barrel Station Commercial It's nice to see him on TV. He was also hating Chris at all, except he always gets the small part. Why do we have to correct 10 lines that are so stupid? not done what is that a joke? why do we have to go all the way to line ten ... what's the point of that? !! I'll just say the right random words for now -_- Maple Story is fun, I love my friends
