I loved this series when she was at Kids WB. I did not think there was a Batman spin because the original show ended in 1995 and this show came in 1997. First of all, I loved the idea that Robin left Batman to solve crime himself. It was an interesting perspective for their relationship. I also liked the addition of Tim Drake to the series, and like his predecessor, this show had great stories, great animations (better than the original), fantastic language work and, of course, brilliant writing. The only thing I did not like was that there were often episodes in a 15-minute storyline in the US. I just wish some episodes could be longer. My favorite episode of all Batman cartoons comes in this series, and it's called "Over the Edge," in my opinion as good, if not better, than "Heart of Ice" and "Robin's Billing." All in all a nice sequel, together with Superman this show made my childhood very happy.
