It's a difficult movie to classify "10 items or less". In general, I do not care about the definition of the genre, but there is something to this film, which means that you want to place him in a certain category to convey even a single word about his feelings. I can recommend this movie to anyone. If you really enjoy the cinema and love life, you want to do the same once you're done with the movie. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie and call it beautiful and enjoyable that it is not perfect, but does not do anything wrong. I do not want to sound as if I would disagree with me, but I believe that the writer / director Brad Silberling knew exactly what he was doing when he had completed this inspiring script. I'm sure he wanted to create a product that has nothing to do with perfection: a product that is as simple, responsive and uncompromising as its title. Well, he did it. <br /> <br /> Silberling, director of long, complex, dramatic films such as "City of Angels" and "Moonlight Mile", proves with "10 Items or Less", who with only 70 minutes has inherited the passion for his Work and also the faith that he has in it. An actor (Morgan Freeman) in front of a woman (Paz Vega) to put in a grocery store and bring exactly where the normal life she would carry you what suggests Silberling here. <br /> <br /> I can not tell you anymore, because in the apparent simplicity is a thought-provoking background, which should not be underestimated. Because here everyone is exposed: The camera focuses on the two main characters, leading to a drive endless conversations with stops that are not only endless, because life is life. And let me express how well Silberling deals with the situation by saying that in less time (not just the duration of the film, but the day the film develops its events) and in a smaller one Place the kind of reached connection between two characters that Sofia Coppola has generated in "Lost In Translation". <br /> <br /> In this movie, which takes place in Tokyo, he met an actor and a woman. They also talked about the moments in which they lived their lives. In the talks we feel the consistently "10 Items or Less" production is, and how in Coppola's film, the naturalness never goes any situation lost, and the images with all music and no words seem to be not enforced or included in the picture "Time to buy". <br /> <br /> In this context, the collaboration of Silberling and his photo director Phedon Papamichael. The man who shot the beautiful landscapes in "Sideways" and focused on every emotion in "Patch Adams" delights us with visual passages of true natural beauty. <br /> <br /> However, the ultimate beauty of "10 Items or Less" is found in its cast (by Avy Kaufman) and its two protagonists. They convey the feeling I mentioned at the beginning, and I can not state it; We feel their connection and can say that they have fun and maybe even improvise. Oscar winner Morgan Freeman, also an executive producer on the film, just stands there and confirmed its current status in the film industry, and it is well deserved: a quiet man, full of wisdom that can take you easily cry can make you laugh And the beautiful Paz Vega (well, I said she was great at "Spanglish")? Here she proves that she is the right thing, and Hollywood is not small for her.
