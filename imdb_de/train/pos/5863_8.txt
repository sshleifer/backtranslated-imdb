Even 15 years after the end of the Vietnam War, "Jacknife" was not too late or was even superfluous. It is one of the few who are trying to cope with the second sad side of the war: the time after. Unlike movies like "Taxi Driver" or "Rambo," which present their main characters as broken heroes in a poor post-war environment, this film allows audiences to see a different view of Vietnamese veterinarians. Their development is very accurate before and especially after the war. The problems are obvious, but in all this tragedy there is always a feeling of hope based on love and friendship. "Jacknife" is perhaps the quietest Vietnam film of all time, but after almost 15 years this is really plausible and therefore justified. Besides, it can make us believe that the war is not over yet. at least for some of us. <br /> <br /> The three main characters are amazing. De Niro did one of his best jobs, but Ed Harris is the star of the movie. Maybe this was his best performance so far.
