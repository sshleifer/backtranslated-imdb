Rated NR (would rate R for Pervasive Strong Language and Crude Sexual Humor). Quebec rating: 16+ (should be 13+) Canadian Home Video rating: 18A <br /> <br /> Eddie Murphy Delirious is Eddie's first stand-up comedy routine. This came out in 1983. After that he starred in the film 48 hrs and Trading Places and he was live on Saturday night. Eddie made two stand-up comedy films. Delirious and Raw. I preferred Raw because I just found that the theme is more humorous and childhood make fun of celebrities like Mr.T and singers like Michael Jackson. Any fan of stand-up comedy films should see Eddie Murphy's Delirious.
