Bette Midler shows her talents and beauty in "Diva Las Vegas". I am thrilled that I have recorded it and can see whenever I want. She has what it takes to keep an audience in captivity. Your voice is as beautiful as ever and will really impress you. The highlight of the show was her song "Stay With Me" from her 1979 film "The Rose". You can feel the emotion in the song and get goose bumps. The show makes you feel the urge to either borrow a movie from Bette Midler or visit the nearest music store to buy an album by Bette Midler.
