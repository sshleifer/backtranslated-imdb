I think it was Ebert who gave Stella four out of four stars, but apart from that, I've never read a positive review of this sadly misunderstood drama about class divisions, love and sacrifice (three themes that include the most romantic stories or movies in it) have frequent). <br /> <br /> Here is the main topic of the classification. Stella is a story from the Depression in America. That said, it was then transmitted to the screen in a memorable way that this remake (if you ask one or two Stanwyck fans) was not accurately estimated. Fans of the original never gave him a chance. In addition, this version of Stella was made in the 1990s, which was not a time of great financial difficulties in America (as depression was). Now is the time to remove the rosy glasses In the midst of a new era of recession and poverty in America, and see this powerful story still true, in its updated format, it's as relevant and relevant as never before , <br /> <br /> Yes, the divide is the main issue here. Stella belongs to the working poor, single, with big dreams, but little hope to realize these dreams. She works in a bar, does not have much money and lives in a shabby apartment. You get the drift. She does not really want to get up in the morning. On her wall she immortalizes images of movie stars. <br /> <br /> A man sees her dancing at the bar. He is wealthy and educated in one of these upper-class families that has nothing to do with Stellas. His main concern is what Ivy League College should attend, it's how you pay the rent and how to be "happy." You have an affair. They like each other. Stella is pregnant. Stella tells the guy the news. His answer? "How about an abortion?" She replies, "I just wanted a room full of balloons." He delivers the balloons and the suggestion, but she sees that his heart is not in it, and has too much pride to accept. She sends him packing. <br /> <br /> At some point, her daughter will be torn between the two lifestyles - the love she has for her mother and the benefits and happiness and love her wealthy father brings her. Stella, alone and unloved, and does not want her daughter to become as unhappy as she is one day, and bring the ultimate sacrifice. She gives up the only love and happiness that she has ever known, securing her daughter's happiness and perhaps living vicariously and living with hope when she knows that her daughter has at least found something to live for can. Now for the movie. Everything is right. Beautiful score, artful cinematography, great scenery (contrast between the two lifestyles, the chaotic apartment and the decorated villas), wonderful and warm performances of the entire cast, especially Bette Midler, Oscar-worthy. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that is much more important and well done than you thought.
