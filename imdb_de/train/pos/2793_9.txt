It's a shame that this movie is avoided because of its title by people who hate football. Bend it Like Beckham is much more than a cheesy sports movie. The plot is touching and intelligent, without being grumpy, the jokes were laughed loud and funny and the characters are well played. Parminder Nagra and Keira Knightley, as teenagers, are brilliant at Jess and Jules and perform well on and off the field. Anupam Kher is wonderful as Jess' worried father, and Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, who was so incredibly angry in "Ride with the Devil", comes as well as the cute guy who takes full advantage of his Irish accent! Even if you do not like football, watch this movie. If anything, it will make you smile.
