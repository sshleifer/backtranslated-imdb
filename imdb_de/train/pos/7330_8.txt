This film is based on the art of the legendary fantasy illustrator Frank Frazetta. Some of the characters are directly from his paintings (the Death Dealer is the best example). Surprisingly, the animation succeeds in preserving the feeling of the original art. Bakshi is known for his intensive use of the rotoscope (the technique of tracking a live action sequence), and this movie is no exception. However, since the theme of the movie is pretty realistic (all characters are human), it works pretty well. <br /> <br /> But what I really like is the plot: Once we have a story with interesting characters and nice action sequences, a really vile villain and a beautiful baby. This movie has the feel of the best Conan comics, since Roy Thomas is the author of the Marvel series of our favorite Cimmerian! This is a far cry from the crappy live-action Conan, not to mention the whole B-movie of the genre. <br /> <br /> Definitely recommended!
