Many of the reviews and comments I've read about this movie say that this is a pretty old movie and a performance by Clara Bow. Although the story was more typical of Clara's later Silents, I still find her a bit heartrending and incredibly funny. Clara plays a happy Hawaiian, who stops at nothing to win the man she loves. Does not matter that this man is married! Clara's lack of modesty was shocking at first, but I believe that this serves the sweetness and general fun of the movie. Although definitely not a brilliant story (actually quite typical), this film is a fine example of Clara's ability to make the audience laugh.
