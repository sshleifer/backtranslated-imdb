I liked the movie. Some of the action scenes were very interesting, tense and well done. I particularly liked the opening scene in which there was a semi-truck. A very tight action scene that was well done. <br /> <br /> Some of the transitional scenes were filmed in interesting ways, such as time lapse photography, unusual colors or interesting angles. The movie is also funny and consists of several parts. I also liked how the bad guy was portrayed. I would give the movie 8 out of 10 points.
