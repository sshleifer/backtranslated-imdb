"Vanilla Sky" was a wonderfully thought-out movie. Or rather "Abre Los Ojos" was well thought out. I saw this movie late at night and was curious what would happen. I was not disappointed. At the end of the movie, I was impressed. I could not get it out of my head. The whole idea of ​​it just blew me away. The end was more of a surprise than Shyamalan could ever do. The plot also made me thoroughly interesting. The cast, great. It was an all around wonderful movie. The kind of movie that you can watch again and again and always find something new. I have seen it four or five times and always find something new. It's a movie to interest you forever.
