If you like action, this is your movie. It is at no time to predict what will happen next. Nothing is as it seems or ends, as you believe. The characters are all somber and captivating. Cage is at its best. Dennis Hopper shows his wonderfully uncanny side again. JT Walsh is perfect in his last performance. Laura Boyle is sizzling. Dwight Yoakum makes a movie debut in a cameo. I categorize this movie as "I have a really bad day". No slow minute in this movie. A real sleeper This movie is underrated and unfortunately overlooked.
