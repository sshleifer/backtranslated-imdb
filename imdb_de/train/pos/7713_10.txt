Today's sci-fi thrillers are more like rambo in space with monster special effects (often ridiculous like explosion sounds in the vacuum of space). The current special effects of "Forbidden Planet" were tame for today's standards, but quite striking for their time. They are still plausible today. The best part of the movie, however, may be the reason why radio thrillers are still attractive. Much of what was going on was left to the imagination of the audience. (What did the Krell creatures look like?) Since much of the frame of the story was never or only at the end revealed, kept tension and tension throughout the film. The ending was also very thoughtful and satisfying. In my opinion, this is still one of the best (if not the best) science fiction movies ever made.
