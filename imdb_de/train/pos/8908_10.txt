At first, I had not seen "The Blob" since I was 7 or 8 years old, and it was an incredible experience to see it as an adult. About his influence on horror movies could be written today pages. And even more could be written in the 50s "fear of teenagers" on his social subtext. But this simple little tale of interplanetary horror is still a damn good scary movie if you let it. <br /> <br /> Sure, it looks cheesy as everyone comes out in our modern world. But "The Blob" packs some really scary moments, while a group of kids track down the unstoppable creature if adults do not believe them then. In the candy-colored world, there are even pretty gloomy moments. And Steve McQueen does so much more than the paper-based story that we're really getting the viewers right now and believing in him. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: If you can remove your postmodern irony filter, there is much more to love than you can see at first glance.
