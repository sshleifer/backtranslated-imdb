A saying about "The Game Is The Most Important" or something like that is attributed to the ancient bard of Avon, even William Shakewspeare. If it was not Old Will, maybe it was our own film director, Mr. Raoul Walsh. There are a large number of his films that support this hypothesis. No one is more appropriate than GENTLEMAN JIM (Warner Brothers, 1942). <br /> <br /> The Film also honors another award called Errol Flynn's favorite of its own Star vehicles. There is clearly evidence on the screen that could easily cause viewers to sit in the darkened theater or watch their home TV or their DVD to conclude the same. <br /> <br /> To be sure, the story is a semi-serious biopic that takes some of the factual material and blends it with a liberal dose of the old imagination to give us a very satisfying, if somewhat fictional (which biopic is not?) Incident is excellent because it uses well the natural athleticism of our leader, Mr. Errol Flynn. Although this GENTLEMAN JIM is not a swashbuckler, not a western or a warrior image, it may be the starring role most suited to the robust Australian. Errol was a member of the Australian Olympic Boxing Team in 1928 or 1932. His training and his skills in "sweet science" have been played throughout the film and especially in the "Big Fight" for the heavyweight world championship with the great John L. Sullivan himself in expert mode) Obviously from Ward Bond) The cast reads like a roster of Warner Brothers residents supporting the players. Here is Alan Hale as Jim Corbet's father, a Livery Wagon Operator *, to see. His two brothers are Harry and George (Pat Flaherty and James Flavin), the two workers in the family whose professions are referred to as "Longshormen". <br /> <br /> The big Jack Carson does his usual masterful serio-comic performance as support for Jim Corbett's friend and fellow bankers. The rest of those we can both recognize and remember are: John Loder, William Frawley, Madeleine LeBeau, Minor Watson, Rhys Williams, Arthur Shields, and Dorothy Vaughn, to name just a few pro wrestlers in various boxer roles , So we have Ed "Strangler" Lewis and an unknown Grappler * as the 2 Waterfront Pug in the opening scenes. Others were Sammy Stein, Mike Mazurki (ever heard of him?) And "Wee Willie" Davis. These guys had a powerful, but not polished look that the old Pier 9 Brawlers would have owned. <br /> <br /> We did not forget Leading Lady, Alexis Smith. She is powerful in her characterization of an "independent" woman, but in many scenes she has enough true skills as a comic strip player. In her role as a poor, little, rich girl, Victoria Lodge, she shows a whole bunch. <br /> <br /> With all these ingredients, the trick is to mix the ingredients in the right proportions to give them the right mix. Director Walsh does this with a ruthless task. Because he is looking for a great movie. His treatment shows all the skills he has refined to fine-tune, starting with his time as a player at D.W. Griffith Mr. Walsh seems to have a special predilection for this time, the 1890s. *** Mr. Walsh's direction moves through the script in a fairly quick clip, breaking the exposure scenes with a humorous punchline, "the Corbett says again, so he is able to make a story that is too dull and serious In addition, in an almost unnoticed element, Brother Walsh gives the authentic impression of a San Francisco of the 1890s, and as another example of his penchant for that time, he creates far-reaching A dynamic, joyful mood is conveyed in these boxing scenes, and as the culmination of this great, perhaps underrated, film, director Walsh glanced at the picture as if it were an illustration from The Police Gazette that contained such events in those "Old days" treated. <br /> <br /> But there's only one thing you should consider before looking at it. If it's your first time or if you see it again: <br /> <br /> "THE BASKETS ARE AGAIN !!" <br /> <br /> * In my humble opinion as a historian From film and pro wrestling it looks like Tor Johnson, who years later was a favorite of director Ed Woods. <br /> <br /> ** "Livery" is a somewhat archaic term for a vehicle that can be rented for local vehicles city traffic. <br /> <br /> *** It's true. Mr. Raoul Walsh was a Griffith veteran. He was the actor who portrayed John Wilkes Booth in THE BIRTH OF A NATION (1915). When he was born in 1887, Raoul Walsh was old enough to have his own memories of the 1890s of the Sullivan-Corbett Championship Bout and what it meant for the sporting life of America then.
