"House of Games" is a flawlessly engineered movie, and one of the few films I've seen has amazed me over the canvas about how clever and unexpected it ends. I first saw it on video several years ago after reading Roger Ebert's review, which was declared the best movie of 1987. Boy, I had a surprise. This was one of the smartest, well written movies I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> The script is not just about the plot (which turns and turns and turns) if you think you've found out everything, but also about character development. On my second sight, I realized that Mamet's screenplay is not just a clever suspense movie, but that each plot development helps to better understand the characters and their motivations. The highlight of the movie is especially effective because it is absolutely inevitable. Of course, it comes from what we know about the characters, so it's much more than just an arbitrary twist end. The performances of Lindsay Crouse and Joe Mantegna also contribute significantly to the film. I can not imagine any actor other than Mantegna playing the role of Mike, and Crouse plays her role with the right amount of restraint to point out a suppressed criminal mindset. Her work, together with Mamet's extraordinary script, together make up one of the greatest films of the eighties. It is really a must.
