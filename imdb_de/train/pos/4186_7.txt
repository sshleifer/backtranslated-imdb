I saw this movie yesterday and I have to say that it's the best horror movie made for $ 36,000 I've ever seen (Sorry Steckler). This movie stinks of soul and atmosphere. Some of the zombies' shots are the best ever filmed. VERY creepy-looking, dusty, networked bodies shuffling slowly to their screaming victims. Brrrrrrr. <br /> <br /> Hot, flabby Canadian women with sexy accents will occupy you before the HORROR sets up his body with the corpse of the undead corpse. This film talked from beginning to end. I could not ask for more. My only complaint is that it was too short.
