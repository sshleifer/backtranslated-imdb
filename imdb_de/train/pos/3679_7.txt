I watched the movie two days ago and was full of anticipation. Paris is my second favorite city in Europe and I spent there in the 80's very romantic 18 months. I was a bit disappointed that most of these vignettes, although original and artistically executed, do not capture the "light" and beauty of the city very well. Not enough of the romance! We did not see any of the tree-lined boulevards ... It was too much darkness, not just literal, but figurative. Some of the acts manipulated the viewer as it seemed, leaving him "flat" (the Marais sequence, the Coiffure vendor sequence, to give two examples). The uplifting, good ones: the mime sequence, the cemetery, the Montmartre (though he made the viewer understand too much), the "Cowboy" vignette and the Sacre Coeur - it seemed to be little, and I would have done it He would have loved to see such a wonderful actor as Orlando Bloom in something that would have brought his originality more to bear.
