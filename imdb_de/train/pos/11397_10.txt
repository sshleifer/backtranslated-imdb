Timeless musical gem, with Gene Kelly in top shape, stylish lead by Vincente Minnelli and wonderful music numbers. It's a great entertainment from beginning to end, one of the films that people see with a smile and say, "They do not make them the way they used to be!" But they never did. The 25-minute musical sequence without dialogue is one of the finest in film history. Filmmagie, clearly derived from the heart and soul of all involved. Something you must have seen!
