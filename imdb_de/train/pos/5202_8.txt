I have just seen this version of "Samhain", and although I still like her, she is not the "rough cut" version I have. If you look through the message board, you will see an apology from the director for this reduced version (79 minutes). He says he has nothing to do with this pulled-down r-rated version, with a completely new twisted ending. Christian really does not need to distance himself so much, because the basic elements of the Gore are still upright, even if they are greatly lowered. That's a damn shame, because it had the potential to be one of the greediest and best films of recent years. It still has the pornstars and inbreeding, and some of the extreme bleeding can be seen, at least in part. I'm just glad that I have this "rough cut", because for me it's a gem for every Gorehounds library. Christian Viel definitely has the ability and vision to deliver the goods, and hopefully his next project will be better produced. The idiots had an almost classic classic in their hands that had screwed up for everyone. "Samhain" is one of the most controversial and most abused horror films, and too bad Gorehounds could not see what the director was up to. <br /> <br /> *********** ******************************* ******************************************************** work print "by SAMHAIN. <br /> <br /> The movie is just over 90 minutes long and has no chapter stops, there is absolutely NO music soundtrack, and some of the scenes have no sound in dialogue because I think they are However, most of the movie has audio with sound effects, and when an effect or scene is missing, a message appears as an insertion note when the movie finishes, just as it is called a "rough." Cut ", BUT the only uncut version of" Samhain "you'll ever see, cause the Gore is extremely graphic, much more than even an NC-17 would allow. Yes, there are a few pornstars, but they are just there to kill them and add some sugar and spices - the story is pretty normal - American tourists go on holiday in Ireland and woh at the end of a house in the middle of the forest. An area that houses folklore, the ancient druids and the celebration of Samhain, or what we call Halloween. (creepy) <br /> <br /> The film starts with a GIANT dose of Gore when a camping couple is attacked by one of the local inbreeding mutants. This is a great scene in which the guy hangs his girl on a cliff and screams for help. All he sees is her head, arms and shoulders hanging in front of him, and when he pulls her up, she has been cut in half. This is what I would call EXTREME GORE, with bowels, blood and severed limbs everywhere. We're here in the Herschell Gordon Lewis area, folks, except that the effects are much more realistic. I'll just skip the story as this is your default strategy for Stalk and Kill. <br /> <br /> The next scene is special, as the friend of the first murder is taken to a cave-like place (TCM-2 stuff) and tied to a table. This geek then cuts off all of its limbs (from the camera, with a hint to insert a scene), and then we see its torso on a grill pit and slowly turn over a fire, and the torso has a tough look (if you do can do that). Yes, very bad taste, disgusting, cruel, you will find the right word and it will probably fit too. Then Jenna Jameson, her beautiful body and everything, is cut from neck to crotch, and all her guts are pulled out in graphic delight and her blood flows into a pot. Tasty, a real turnaround, right? <br /> <br /> But the best Gore scene happens in the house, and I have to admit, this is one of the best Gore scenes I've ever seen. This guy (no matter who) is caught by a geek from behind and cut at the asshole. The geek then reaches into his hands and tears all the guts, guts and whatever the hell else there, right out of his asshole. This goes on forever as the guy screams and more and more innards are pulled across the floor of the bathroom. It's so extreme, so exaggerated, that I had to laugh totally to hell. Of course, you will NEVER see this scene on a real DVD, IMO, along with most of the other extremely extreme Gore scenes. <br /> <br /> What do you think? Well, most of all, although I doubt this movie will ever be released in this completely uncut presentation, this "rough cut" is a rare gem for Gorehounds. Yes, it's a bit difficult at first, with no soundtrack, a few scenes to add, and credits that lack names everywhere. But that makes it so unique, and I would not trade it for something now. Extreme blood, yes, extreme extreme. This makes "Haute Tension" look like a Disney movie.
