This movie is sooooo funny !!! The acting is WONDERFUL, the Ramones are sexy, the jokes are subtle and the action is exactly what every high school wants to do to their school. I absolutely loved the soundtrack and the carefully placed cynicism. If you like monty python you will love this movie. This movie is a bit "fat" Esk (without all the annoying songs). The songs sung are sympathetic; You may even find that you sing these songs as soon as the movie is finished. This musical is in second place for me (next to the blues brothers). But please, do not think that it's musical. Since the songs are so sympathetic, it's hard to say that a carefully choreographed scene is taking place. I think this movie is more of a comedy with romantic undertones. They are reminded of what it was like to be a rebellious teenager. It is needless to say that you will remember your old high school days after watching this movie. Highly recommended for both families (as it is very young, but also for adults, as there are many jokes that are funnier with age and experience.
