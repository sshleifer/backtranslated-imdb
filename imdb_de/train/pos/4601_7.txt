Police Story is a breathtaking series of standards that Jackie Chan shows to showcase his unique talents and courage. Some of the stunts here are among Jackie's best and most dangerous ones. The entire finale of the mall fights is probably the biggest single fight episode of Jackie. She is more brutal and less funny and says the end of the fight Project A or Drunken Master. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the rest of the movie does not stand up to this quality, as it is a rather formulaic cop thriller with some comedy elements. I always prefer JC in films like Project A, where his natural comic talents show through. It just does not work for me in the serious limitations of some elements of Police Story. This is still there with Jackie's best movies for the incredible stunt games and incredible spectacle. <br /> <br /> As usual with Hong Kong movies, avoid the English language DVD version as the subtitles are really terrible. <br /> <br /> Great stunts, OK film a good starting point if you have not yet seen a JC movie and for every movie fan 7/10 is worth a look
