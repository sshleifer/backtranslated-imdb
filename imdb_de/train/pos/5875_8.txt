This is one of the movies that requires no mind or reasoning. It's a very funny time that you have forgotten in the next hour or so. I was really surprised with John Abraham's acting that he normally plays the gangster-like character with the unemotional face, that is, to play the complete opposite and do it successfully, by maneuvering among comic geniuses like Paresh Rawal and Akshaye Kumar shine. I was also quite surprised with the Akshaye's 3 girls because roles do not require much talent there, but mostly moaning about Akshaye's disappearance (to the other girls), I was surprised when they managed to establish an actual persona, and one could distinguish between them One good thing, most of the songs are good, it's colorful and fun, on a boring sunday evening this will certainly lighten your mood.
