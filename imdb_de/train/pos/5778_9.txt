Despite its limited budget, this is a great movie that proves that effort and imagination can overcome the lack of money. The opening, in which cave paintings seem to show how some dinosaurs have survived, at least to humans, is a beautiful red herring. Then a meteor enters a lake and causes heat, which in turn causes a frozen dinosaur egg to hatch. When the prehistoric animal appears, it is a well-animated plesiosaur that soon disappears in the environment. Okay, so it's not Jurassic Park, but it's still real entertainment for fans of monster movies.
