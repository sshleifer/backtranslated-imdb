I thought before that this movie was the lame of the Muppet movies. I would like to withdraw this statement now. In my opinion, the tastiest MUppet movie was the TV movie "IT'S A VERY MERRY MUPPET CHRISTMAS", "IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE RIPPLE", that was really awful. MUPPETS TAKE MANHATTAN is nothing special, but miles more pleasant than MERRY MUPPET Christmas. <br /> <br /> The best songs are the songs "You Can Not No An An Answer", which the Muppet Babies sing and the songs for the grand finale. Loving the Muppet Babies TV series, I loved the Muppet Babies sequence here (I was told that it inspired the Muppet Babies Show) Muppets from Sesame Street even appeared for the wedding. As Kermit puts it in his last line, "What could be a better way?" But I wish that what was between the beginning and the end was a little more entertaining. There are cute cameos by Brooke Shields and Gregory Hines and a great dance sequence by Rizzo and the rats (choreographed by the late, great Jim Henson himself), and the movie certainly entertains. However, I have to say that MUPPET MOVIE, GREAT MUPPET CAPER and MUPPET Christmas CAROL are the three definitive MUppet films.
