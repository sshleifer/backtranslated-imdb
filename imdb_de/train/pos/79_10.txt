I loved The Real Mc Coys (1957-1963). It is too bad that Lydia Reed has decided to be forgotten and not to appear. She was excellent on the show. Of course, Walter Brennan was as good as Tony Mart√≠nez. I loved it when he called Amos Senor Grampa. I bought Season I on DVD and can not wait to buy Seasons 2-6. This show appeared briefly in the summer of 1999, but then disappeared. God bless all deceased members of the cast and please, Llydia Reed, make yourself known to the public again. You are loved and respected. The Real Mc Coys will live forever.
