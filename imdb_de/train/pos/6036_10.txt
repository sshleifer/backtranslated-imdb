I am clearly not in the target group for this film. I'm almost a 50 year old man who has recently found the world of independent film. This happened by chance when a movie called Clerks was discovered late at night. The first two things I noticed about this movie were that it was written technically amateurish and brilliant. When I read an interview with the director in the local newspaper and he said that one of his influences was Clerks, I became interesting. When he said that his main influence was The Station Agent, a movie I saw on DVD a week ago, I decided I had to go and see it. The result could be described in the same way as employees, although the two films are not similar in content. Both films suffer from technical gaffes that are overcome by amazing writing. While office workers are a day in the life of a man who has absolutely nothing in his life and is afraid to ask hard questions about himself and his situation, Less Like Me is a man who seems to be compelled to be constantly busy to be in one way or another, to fill his life with little things so that he never has to deal with the big ones. The themes and ideas of this film are powerful and moving. I can say that not much has changed since I grew up. Young men still have the same problems they always have. The writer disguises these problems and issues in the modern vernacular, he makes wonderfully honest characters and lets them do completely credible things. As far as indie cinema is concerned, this may not be technically perfect, but very close from an artistic point of view.
