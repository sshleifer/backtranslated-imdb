This movie is better earned. It's great fun, has some wonderful jokes and sight gag, some stuff for the "geeks" among us (and we know who we are), and the effects are indeed effective. Watching Paul Reuben's fart in the face of an Oscar winner is worth the price of the recording alone. I never read the comic series before I saw the movie, but since then. As good as they are, I recommend MM the movie anyway. (Although the blazing carrot as a character would have played a role as well, that would have been cool.) Greg Kinnear is ... amazing like Captain Amazing, and NO ONE ELSE could be The Shoveller, except William H. Macy. My favorite line in the movie? "We have a blind date with Destiny and it looks like she ordered the lobster." Watch this movie. BUY this movie! It's only $ 5 and some change at your local Wal-Mart. You will thank me. Really you will. Oh, and Mrs Garafolo is in it. That makes it alone
