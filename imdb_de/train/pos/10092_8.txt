The dazzling Elizabeth Taylor plays a role in this lesser-known classic as a young girl from London, who falls in love with a tea plantation owner from British Ceylon (now Sri Lanka). Upon arrival, she immediately feels out of place and is forced to adapt to the new culture and constantly be aware of the angry herd of elephants. William Dieterle, who was also director of The Life Of Emile Zola and Portrait Of Jennie, does a masterly job of giving this romance a somewhat dark and almost sinister undertone, and the setting is one of the most beautiful I've seen with the black and white theme villa and the beautiful island landscape.
