John Boorman's "Liberation" concerns four suburban Atlanta residents taking a ride through the fast waters of Cahulawassee. The river is about to disappear for a dam construction and the flooding of the last untouched lands. <br /> <br /> The four friends emphasize different characters: a male athlete who has never been insured in his life because there is no particular risk (Burt Reynolds); a passionate family man and a guitarist (Ronny Cox); an overweight bachelor insurance clerk (Ned Beatty); and a quiet, thoughtful, married man with a son who likes to smoke his pipe (Jon Voight). What follows is the nightmarish investigation of men against the hostile force of nature? It is also an ideal code of a moral principle about civilized men who fall prey to the dark laws of the wilderness? <br /> <br /> Magnificently shot, this exciting adult adventure certainly includes some really gripping scenes.
