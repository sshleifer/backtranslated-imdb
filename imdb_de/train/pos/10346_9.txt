What was around 1939 that produced so many great Hollywood movies? Well, whatever it was, the magic can also be found in this Columbia image. It's a long-forgotten screwball comedy Turner Classic Movies has begun to show. (Maltin's movie book does not include it.) Amazing Mr. Williams is a gem in almost every department. <br /> <br /> It's the story of a first-class cop who can never find the time to marry his wife. When the wedding bells ring, he is called to the scene. The lady in question must learn how difficult it is not to persecute criminals but to belong to the police. There is a lot of laughter here. Melvyn Douglas has once again proven that he has few peers in the light comedy. Joan Blondell was at the peak of her career and is a pleasure. Edward Brophy and Donald McBride are hilarious. <br /> <br /> The movie takes a bit too long, but who cares? The screwball comedies are always able to entertain, and this movie is one of the best.
