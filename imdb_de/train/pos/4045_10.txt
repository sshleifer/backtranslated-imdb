I'm so glad I saw this rare little gem of a movie. I saw it at an independent film festival. So do not expect it will come to your city soon. During the movie, I noticed that about 10 people got up and went out. Too bad for them (down here in the south, people may not have to read subtitles). The movie starts slowly but is so rich in dialogue that I never got bored. When the action finally arrives, I glued myself to the screen like on a roller coaster. <br /> <br /> I also got a big kick from the chapter titles that appear before the chapters, especially those that introduce the characters as they appear on the screen. It reminded me of Zelda (Ocarina of Time) as you face level bosses. <br /> <br /> If this is the future of "video game / comic books", then I welcome it.
