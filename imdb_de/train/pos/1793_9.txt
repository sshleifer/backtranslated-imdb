I saw this movie on Sunday afternoon. I absolutely loved this movie. I loved everything from the luscious moments of mothers and daughters to the scenes in which Mamie Gummer (Lila) cries because of her bad decision to marry a man for her parents, not because she is truly in love. I loved those moments because they were so real. At first I was seriously afraid because I had hoped that it would not end like Bobby, which was a great cast, but a poorly written movie with no real flesh. But in the middle of the movie, I felt completely different. You will laugh and you will cry, but in the end you want to see evening again. Trust me when I say GO SEE IT IT!
