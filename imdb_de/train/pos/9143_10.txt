It seemed like 1984 was anything but the Orwellian nightmare that George Orwell's sci-fi novel should be! 1984 proved to be one of the happiest times in American history !! The upswing of the economy and a resurgence of American fundamental values ​​cultivated an idealistic aura of resumed innocence, considered by the Americans with a very favorable disposition !! In the past there have been many replacement translations of classic films, but the originals are almost always considered superior !! "Purple Rain" is such a movie in this category !! "Purple Rain" was produced in 1984 and offered a dog of the eighties, a cheerful quality music, which they incorporated into the creation of this outstanding film !! Certain artefacts that point to the eighties are indeed classics !! Screwball comedies, neon clothes and of course the music !! Eighties music is considered by experts to be the best decade for music in American history !! "Purple Rain" in Minneapolis accommodated the use of naive conversation with the changing times of the city. When I was a little kid, I lived in Minneapolis for about eight months. At that time the non-white population was below 3% !! By 1984, the African Americans had built some streets in Minneapolis, and thus they also established a firmly established culture. The movie "Purple Rain" is reminiscent of clothes in the style of the eighties and a music ensemble, which captivated the film audience effortlessly !! I loved the music for "Purple Rain", and the innovative approach that makes this movie the success of the confrontation is indeed brilliant !! Watch this movie if you have not seen it yet !! Prince became an icon of the 80's with this masterpiece !! For a short time he was with Kim Bassinger, he had to do something right !! "Purple Rain" puts Prince on the map !! This film receives my emphatically assertive verdict from THUMBS UP !!!!
