I chose this after seeing the fun and linguistically challenging "Clueless" (1995), perhaps Alicia Silverstone's best-known accomplishment from her early film career. "True Crime" has Kevin Dillon, who should be helpful in improving most movie projects. In fact, everyone in the cast does a good job. The only disappointment I feel for the film is to me an awkward "feeling" for some of the scenes that result from the need to execute a fairly uncompromising, adult theme as part of what begins in tone as a schoolgirl adventure <br /> Alicia Silverstone is pretty good in this case. She carries the naive enthusiasm and growing unease Mary Giordano draws to the truth behind the serial murders. I think their characterization of MG also has a few miles in it. The conclusion of the story is that she continues a career in law enforcement. For an older Silverstone it could be really interesting to revisit Giordano in times of crisis later in the officer's life. Just a thought! <br /> <br /> "True Crime" shows his director in a good light. Pat Verducci also has written recognition. I do not know any other film work that PV did. I can only wonder what happened after such a promising start. <br /> <br /> Like most productions, this one has a largely unknown cast, although Bill Nunn (Detective Jerry Guinn) can barely. For the past ten years, he seemed to be able to secure an impressive number of appearances on screen. I remember seeing him recently in "Carriers" (1998), a military-themed presentation designed for television. Bill Nunn played "Captain Arends". Fans of the classic US TV comedy show "Who's the Boss" may also have an interest in "carriers" because Judith Light is at the head of the lead role many remember from their long-standing involvement with affection. <br /> <br /> "True Crime" could not have worked, but OK. I think it's a fun story that's worth seeing.
