When I saw the dentist, I found it very cool. But this movie is not for everyone, especially people who do not like bloody scenes, as the dentist has many bloody scenes. That's why it has the rating R18. It's about a Beverly Hills dentist. Alan Feinstone, who finds out that his wife Brooke is cheating on him with the poolman. It is best to go to your dentist before you see this. However, if you do not feel like going to the dentist, you should not watch it because you may not opt ​​for your life. The dentist has the best bloody revenge I have ever seen. Who has ever seen a movie in which a dentist (spoiler) pulls out all the teeth of his cheating wife and cuts out his tongue without anesthetization? Overall a great movie, but not for everyone.
