In this Chinese film, I have so many similarities with members of a culture that I do not belong to, and I am far from that. In an almost Buddhist approach, the film helps to refer to each character and to the happiness of doing the simple routine things. All actors are brilliant, and Xu Hzu exudes friendliness and wisdom out of vulnerable and mean. He Min, the backward brother, shows us that intelligence and wisdom are not equal and that wisdom comes to the most diverse people in this universe. Another China, that is far from Chinese realism, but it has a lot of humanity and another realism. <br /> <br /> Get it. You will not be disappointed.
