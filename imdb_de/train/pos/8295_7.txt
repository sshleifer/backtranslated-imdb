Robert Urich was a good actor, and he makes this TV movie believable. I remember watching this movie when I was 15, and when I saw it for the second time, my opinion remains the same. People lose who they were when they entered this exclusive club in a computer-rich California city. Urich tries to figure out what's going on with his family, and I love the idea of ​​a Halloween space suit, awesome. This movie is about the struggle of the mind. TV quality that exceeds the big budget, Gangs of New York. I wonder if Robert Urich was the compassionate man he portrayed in many of his films? Hopefully! 6 or 7 out of 10.
