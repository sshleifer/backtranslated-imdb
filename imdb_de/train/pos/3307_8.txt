Let's start by saying that the English title "The Power of Kangwon Province" is an absolute misnomer in this film. In Hong Sang Soo's film, there are no real shots of wars, conflicts and conflicts. A province is neither suitable nor valid in connection with this film. If we judge this film by its Korean-language title, "Kangwon-do ui him" appears as a cryptic statement about the emotional unrest of its young protagonists whose heads have not come to rest. Sang Sango has also led a very productive document about unpredictable decisions of people in their lives. The Affected Persons are a few young girls who are constantly showing their moods, moods and emotions. Fantasies If a film can be made out of nothing than the meritorious virtue of a filmmaker, Hong Sang Soo must be welcomed as a brave filmmaker whose Films speak volumes about the omnipresent Nothingness of human relationships, feelings and life. Whether you want it or not, this is the only fair conclusion that can be derived from this film.
