I liked this TV show because it's a separate thing that a girl on her sixteenth birthday finds out she's a witch and that she lives in the house with her aunt, and both are also witches. Well, it took her a few weeks to get used to it. When she used her powers for the first time, it was so funny because she turned her enemy into a pineapple. She had to turn back time and repeat a day. This series is really cool and it's a typical teen series, but she got thin when she moved out of her house and into an apartment with her college friends. Then it got boring and I stopped looking. I loved their aunts, they were so funny and the other one was really bleak. I loved Valerie and I hated Sabrina's enemy Libby, she was ugly.
