This movie definitely has a thumbs up from me. These are funny jokes and even occasionally stereotypical and derogatory views about Eastern Europeans had left me most of the movie down. The plot is clever and 100% original and lets you guess the entire movie. The person who impressed me most in this movie was Hilary Duff. It's easy and easy to see that she took a leap of her faith when she stepped out of the "chick-flick" genre she's used to. Her accent is superb and her acting performance was surprisingly crisp and well executed. It's the best performance I've ever seen of Hilary, and I've seen most of her films. Her character, Yonica Babyyeah, is described as "The Britney Spears of Eastern Europe". This is shown in some of her behaviors and in the song "I want to blow you ... ... ...". She also takes pity on her because her performance really captivates you, Yonica is a very complex and confused character. With Joan Cusack I had to laugh the whole movie with her sometimes slapstick humor, but also with her facial expressions and so on. John Cusack's witty dialogue will probably make you giggle through and through. I highly recommend this movie.
