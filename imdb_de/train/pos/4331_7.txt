Murder in Mesopotamia, I have always thought about one of the better Poirot books, because it is very scary and has a brilliant ending. There is no doubt that the TV adaptation is visually striking, with some beautiful photographs and a very haunting music score. As always, David Suchet, like Hercule Poirot, is impeccable. The comedic climax of the episode is Poirot's fight with a mosquito in the middle of the night, and Hugh Fraser is well suited as a rather naive Captain Hastings. The rest of the cast is in decent performances, but be careful not to overshadow the two leads, which is a danger in some Christie adaptations. Part of the episode was pretty scary, a juxtaposition of an episode as tragic as Five Little Pigs, an episode I enjoyed much more than this one. What made it particularly scary to put the music aside was when Louise Leidner saw the ghostly face through the window. The book was pretty faithful to the editing, but I want to say that there were three things I did not like. The main problem was the tempo, it's pretty slow and there are some scenes where very little happens. I did not like the fact that they made Joseph Mercado a murderer. In the book, I see him as a rather nervous character, but intervening the idea of ​​making him a murderer, and developing it too little, made him a less appealing character, though I'm glad he does not have his drug addiction missed. (I also noted that the authors have omitted the fact that Ms. Mercado is in hysteria in the book if she believes she is the killer's next victim.) The other thing that was not so impressive was that I was Feeling that it might have been more If Amy Leatheran's adaptation was like the book, Amy somehow seemed less sensitive to the adaptation. On the whole, I liked murder in Mesopotamia despite some misjudgements on behalf of the writers. Bethany Cox.
