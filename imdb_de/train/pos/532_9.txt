Adorable, romantic, innovative and funny. The vision of this extraordinary film is almost unparalleled and surpasses better known "Death Romances" like Ghost. While we intuitively know that Peter and June will find the ultimate happiness at the end of these long stairs, the joy lies in the journey. Of course, the moral of the story is timeless: love defeats everything. However, the fight for victory is played in a heavenly arena with far-reaching vision and gripping grandeur. With more than 500 suitably dressed extras representing different ages and cultures, the director's vision of the sky remains memorable six decades later, well into the CGI era. An Essential Truth: The Best Story Is Told on the Smallest Level. The wonderfully determined, romantic aspect of "Stairway" is captured with ultimate simplicity: June's tear, preserved on a rose petal. <br /> <br /> This movie is like the story and the set itself for all time.
