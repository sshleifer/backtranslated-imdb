<br /> <br /> Shortly after the war, this story was made to highlight Anglo-American relations after the war. In the end he received the honor of being the first royal premiere after the Second World War. Remarkably, the film features the Royal Air Force, Sigmund Freud Psychology, the founding fathers of America, and various other entangled the long stairs (special effects in childhood) and beyond the heavenly gates, without sacrificing integrity to lose. <br /> <br /> Although it sounds absurd, this clever script guides and dances the beholder with the skill of a mountain goat between heaven and earth and offers a charming lightness that has rarely been seen in the cinema since. <br /> <br /> Be prepared to warm your heart with this sweet, innocent and charming love story. Roger Livesey looks like a man who has to steal the show !!!! <br /> <br /> British cinema should cry when it remembers how good it was in those early post-war years. <br /> <br />
