I was 15 years old when this movie premiered on television. I grew up in Texas and understood the boredom and monotony of teenage life there. This movie has touched my impressive teenage heart and I have lovingly remembered it for the last 12 years. I have recently seen it for the second, third and fourth time thanks to the LOVE channel. I still cry because the movie touches and touches my confused teenager.
