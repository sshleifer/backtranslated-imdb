Of course, this movie will only appeal to a specific audience; namely Stoner and like-minded people. <br /> <br /> If you count among these people, this movie is a MUST. In fact, I think it's imperative for headshops to sell a copy to anyone who buys their first bong. What Monty Python's Holy Grail for Geeks and Nerds is, this movie is also for Potheads. I saw this movie for the first time about ten years ago and I'm totally broken every time I look at it. The jokes gloss over the lifestyle of the hit part perfectly, far better than the last attempt to try half-baked. <br /> <br /> There is, so to speak, no conspiracy; the film is more of a collection of different sketches; while the movies wander around Los Angeles in their legendary haze. Nevertheless, the film has an excellent speed and does not hurt at all. Many people cite Up In Smoke as the best work by C & C, but I would say Next Movie is superior. <br /> <br /> So if you're in the mood for an hour and a half, the lights laugh, tune in and let your mind float =) <br /> <br /> Oh, and FREE TOMMY CHONG!
