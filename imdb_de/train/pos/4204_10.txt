and who sees this movie will agree. This movie was about a time when the storyline, credibility, and theme of the character really mattered. Jean Peters, Widmark and Thelma Ritter were the focus of interest. Ritter is in top form as a spy "Moe". She survives in New York's Bowery district and serves as a pigeon for the NYC police. <br /> <br /> The only other movie I saw in Peter's is "Niagara," and she certainly proves her acting ability with a Brooklyn accent. Widmark is appropriately threatening, as the anti-hero, who despite his need for money has to recognize what is right. <br /> <br /> The photography is brilliant. The Neon, the subway station (though it looks cleaner than the real thing!), The Shack where Widmark lives as a transient traveler. With "Lightning Louie" in Chinatown the city is used outstanding. Here are the many flavors and the appetite of the city addressed. The political climate of the time is a haunting backdrop. 10/10.
