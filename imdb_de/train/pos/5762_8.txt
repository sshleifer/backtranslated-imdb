I have to admit to enjoy bad movies. I love her, I watch her all. Horror especially. My friends and I gather after a hard school and work week borrowing crazy cassettes, ordering a pizza and having a great time. This one had a great box, so I expected less than usual. <br /> <br /> The story is about a housing project being built over a nuclear facility where the above-ground layers have been cleared. Subsoil layers are simply obscured. The residents of this neighborhood find the covert facility when some children fall into a hole in a cave. This wakes up some zombies. <br /> <br /> From this point on, it's the lump city. The gore effects and the action never stop until the credits roll. <br /> <br /> OK, it's not a great art, but it was our favorite of the evening with its joking dialogue and overbearing garb. Actually, it was one of the best "party tapes" I have ever seen. And you realized that there was no money, with some crazy people. There are hundreds of zombies and the director looks like Brendan Frazer (he has a cameo) and it's just a wild journey.
