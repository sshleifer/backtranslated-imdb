I probably doubled my knowledge of Iran when I saw Secret Ballot (2001). Now I know about four times as much (I doubt I've learned much from Not Without My Daughter (1991)). Offside is a great Iranian comedy about a group of girls (working individually) to participate in a pivotal football game for their country's place in the World Cup. Women are not allowed to participate in football matches. As a result, the nation's armed forces have been mobilized to rescue women who are trying to break in on themselves. Some (teenage?) Girls try to overthrow the party by dressing up as boys, but get caught. The film usually plays in this prison, where the girls are arrested by soldiers, and awaits an unspecified punishment (although the girl who disguised herself as a soldier claims she is an Insignia from execution!) Film examines the absurdity of the situation. The idea that women are being played at football matches is due to the fact that it is too good a taste for the fairer sex - a philosophy that was not unknown in the West less than 100 years ago. This farce is felt when a girl needs to go to the bathroom. A soldier accompanying her requires her to cover her eyes so she can not see the graffiti. The conflict is not just about the fight between the sexes: at a certain point in time, there is friction between a rural soldier and the girls who live in the city. Fortunately, this movie was not too culturally esoteric that this is the case comedy was lost on this neighbor and cultural cousin of the Great Satan. You have to be in the mood for it, but nobody should avoid this movie because he thinks he does not understand it.
