You might think that you expect serious sightseeing when the premise of the film is mainly between two characters who travel about 3,000 miles from France to Saudi Arabia and through most of Europe - Italy, Bulgaria, Croatia, Slovenia - travel to Turkey the arrival in the Middle East. However, this is not a tour, and there are no stops to explore the sights. <br /> <br /> Reda's father is in his twilight years and wants to make the Haj. Since the walking and taking of the mule is out of the question, he decides to travel by car to Mecca. He can not drive and therefore asks Reda for help to bring his son's protest in his broken vehicle there. <br /> <br /> But Reda does not see any point in letting him ride when his father decided to take the plane. He is annoyed at the idea of ​​having set aside his personal life for this pilgrimage that he could not understand. And that's why we embarked on this arduous journey with father and son, who were not the best friends. <br /> <br /> The beauty of this film is to witness the evolution of the father and son couple and the challenges faced, the strange people they encounter, they need to slow down in different weather conditions, and, in turn, rest areas between motels and sleep in the car. We see an obvious gap between the generations trying to communicate with each other, the father trying to impose his son, and the son trying to assert himself as an adult, but the circumstances we recognize show that Reda is out of the water is fish. Due to the many encounters, they have really teamed up despite their differences. <br /> <br /> It may be quite fitting that this movie was released here last week to coincide with Hari Raya Haji, and has the opportunity to watch our protagonists Come along with the other pilgrims in their Haj. The final scene in Mecca really is an impressive sight, and you too would feel the claustrophobia and the fear as Reda tries to find his father among the thousands of people gathering. The sights of Europe may not have been deliberately looked at to boost the anticipation of the final destination and to focus on the final destination. <br /> <br /> It was certainly the idea to tell loved ones how much you value them for who they are. Do not miss that and yes, book early - I was pleasantly surprised that the meeting of this evening was still a full house.
