When I saw this animation for the first time (maybe I was 15), I was really impressed! It has a completely different style than Japanese animation and I like it a bit more. The whole impression of the film is more sinister and darker ... The colors are not so ... colorful. The characters do not speak much, there are no long and boring conversations of this and that (as in Ghost in the Shell). With its dark images, views of strange animals, and the sense of magic, it looks like one of those ancient Norse stories full of violence and cruel creators, enchanted forests and deep caves inhabited by dragons, throngs, orcs ... and a mysterious hero to stop the evil ...
