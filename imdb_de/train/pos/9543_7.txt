The Japanese cyber punk movies have never really done much for me, but of the handful I've seen, most were at least visually interesting and at least mostly entertaining. MEATBALL MACHINE is no exception. <br /> <br /> The plot is about a parasite species that takes over the human hosts, takes control of their bodies, turns them into "Nekroborgs" and makes them deal with the only purpose of eating each other - apparently as a "game" for the enjoyment of these parasites. The film is mainly about a shy guy and a girl who fall in love with each other but whose love affair is interrupted by the parasite infection and is forced to fight. It becomes a test of human will against the parasite's control of its physical body ... MEATBALL MACHINE will invariably be compared to TETSUO (like most cyber punk movies), and with good reason. There are definitely some thematic parallels, though the films are definitely different. MEATBALL MACHINE has a lot of fun, sparkling moments, and the creature / borg FX is definitely the highlight - a mix of TETSUO-meets-GWAR that are both thoughtful and resourceful. Depending on your taste for these types of films, MEATBALL MACHINE may or may not be your thing. If you enjoy hyperkinetic cyberpunk movies with a healthy dose of splatter, this is for you ... 7/10
