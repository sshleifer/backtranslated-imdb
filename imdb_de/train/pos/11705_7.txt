Obviously, there was not a big budget for this film, which definitely hampered production. But the story and the ending were so brutal that they made up for a lot of things. I mean, brutal on the level of Ju Dou and other (great) Chinese films. When I was 14, I saw it for the first time, I ran home and asked God to forgive me everything ...
