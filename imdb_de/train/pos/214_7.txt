An old variety team from Willy Clark (Walter Matthau) and Al Lewis (George Burns) was one of the best known, but they hate each other. Over 20 years later, they agree to meet for a TV special ... but they still hate each other. Willy's nephew / agent (Richard Benjamin) tries to get them to work together. <br /> <br /> A great success of his time and George Burns won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. I liked it (something). It was written by Neil Simon, his non-stop one-liners. Some things were funny, but jokes about Willy's and Al's senility was NOT. I also never liked Matthau. I never thought he was a good actor. His character is so corrosive that you get fed up quickly. It was all fun. Burns is just great at dropping one-liners effortlessly, and even Matthau was good for him. Her verbal struggles are the best sequences in the movie. Benjamin is also very good as Willy's nephew, who tries to get them to work together. For me it is only worth seeing for Burns. This jump started his career and two years later he had another hit with "Oh God". That's good. Simply good - not great. Matthaus character makes it really hard to love. I give a 7.
