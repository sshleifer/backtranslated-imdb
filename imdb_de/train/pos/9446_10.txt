James Dickey is a wonderfully descriptive author. If you read "liberation", you will immediately be transported to the lush backwoods of the deep South. If you look at John Boorman's film version of the book, you can see how he captures the essence of the book. The camera is as descriptive as the narrative. The characters are fully realized and the depictions are fantastic. I first saw this movie in 1992, after my first year of study. I was in a phase where I saw films that were all published within a few years of my birth in 1973. all fine films. This was easily the class of the group. That says a lot.
