The story would never win prizes, but that's not it ... the script was entertaining and exciting enough to make room for the incredibly choreographed fight scenes. Who needs a story with such a fight? Really, it's worth it for that reason. IF you can cope with the wound of which there is a lot ... none of it is realistic enough to be hard to look at. I gave it a 7.
