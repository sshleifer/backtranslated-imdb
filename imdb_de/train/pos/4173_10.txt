A kind of road movie in old-fashioned trains in the Slovenian late summer province. At the beginning you see someone in underwear who sews pants in black fabric, and when the same young man in his black pants leaves the house with two suitcases, you can see that the trouser part is missing on a mourning flag (apparently his father has done this) died). On the train, he meets a young lady and almost without words, but with many little gestures, begins a wonderful love story. It's kind of surreal, very poetic and a bit bizarre movie with a lot of weird characters and weird incidents. Beautiful pictures with love for beautiful details.
