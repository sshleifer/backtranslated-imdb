<br /> <br /> A movie dominated by the raven-haired Barbara Steele. He became when I was seven or eight years old and created lasting images of pale vampiric men and women who were in a castle looking for blood. Steele is an icon for horror movies and otherworldly beauty, and the views of the walking dead before the death of Romero's NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD shamblers connect them in my mind. <br /> <br /> I do not see that connection between this movie and THE HAUNTING, which is smart but ambiguous about the forces present. LA DANZA MACABRE is a no-claims B-movie that makes you fall in love with Barbara Steele and suffer the consequences. For HAUNTING's overwhelmed Claire Bloom, there is no such draw. The comparisons to the HAUNTING are superficial. <br /> <br /> And no, this movie does NOT need to be recreated. Not only is it a product of the sixties, but the large percentage of talentless cretins in Hollywood can not understand MACABRE's terrorist formula. This formula is based on a parent factor: GOOD WRITING. Simple classics such as CASTLE and Corman's Poe films with R. Matheson and touring artists OUT OF THE PAST have one thing in common: strong writing. It's easy. Get a real writer like Richard Matheson or Steve McQuarrie and let them plunge into today's cinema chaos. Also, let Hollywood try original material for a change and stop using the obvious superior product of the past.
