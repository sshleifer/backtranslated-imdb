Eric Valette is obviously a talented filmmaker, as are the two who wrote the script. Therefore, Mal√©fique is a great movie made with a few bucks, but also a lot of imagination. Well, I'm exaggerating a bit, but still sincere. So, if you like dark, bloody movies, look at them. It's really worth it.
