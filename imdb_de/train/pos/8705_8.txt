Despite the title The Sword Bearer and the DVD cover (Action / Heriok poses of The Sword Bearer), this is not a superhero movie. <br /> <br /> (Minor Spoilers) It follows the story of Sasha, The Swordtailer, who is cursed with a retractable sword in his forearm. Cool, you say, but no, that's real life. If you had this power as a child, you could control it, for example, if you faced a madman or if your mother's boyfriend beat her. And if you do not control it, how do you cope with being a two-time killer at the age of 12? <br /> <br /> This is essentially the place where Sasha is when we meet him. Wander aimlessly after another murder (similar to A Bout de Souffl√©). Then he meets with Katya, and the two instantly fall in love with each other, giving Sasha a reason to live and try and change his ways. However, his past still haunts him in the form of two police officers. <br /> <br /> This is essentially the story, and there is virtually no action on the canvas, albeit much, if proposed. <br /> <br /> I really like this movie. Unlike many Hollywood superhero films, we get very little background story. There is no villain (unless you count the swordman himself) and there is a lot of heart and good character. <br /> <br /> It's worth checking to see if you can find it.
