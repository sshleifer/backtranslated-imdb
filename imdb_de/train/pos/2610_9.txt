In the ten years since Wildside aired, nothing has come close to its quality in local production. These include the two series of the pleasing but overvalued Underbelly, which brought events to life in the recent crime story of Sydney and Melbourne. The miniseries Blue Murder (which also played Tony Martin but as someone on the other side of the law) might be the exception. <br /> <br /> Wildside is currently being repeated in the ABC late at night. I have not seen the show for a long time and am still impressed by the uncompromising storylines and the very human characters. The cast is excellent: Tony Martin as a detective follows the disappearance of his son, Rachael Blake (who later met Martin in real life) as a community worker struggling with alcoholism, and Alex Dimitriades as a young cop whose vice is gambling. Aaron Pederson, Jessica Napier, Mary Coustas (yes, Effie herself) and a young Abbie Cornish provided equally good supporting roles. The ABC inexplicably published only the first three episodes on DVD years ago. The logic of this type of marketing is not for me, but I suspect it has something to do with licensing conflicts with the original manufacturers. A great series that has aged remarkably well. We hope the DVD department of ABC works together. <br /> <br /> (According to a moderator on an ABC message board, another DVD release is due in December 2009).
