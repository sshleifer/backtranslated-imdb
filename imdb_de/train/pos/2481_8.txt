I admit I've only seen three of Shakespeare's plays (Romeo & Juliet, Macbeth and, of course, Hamlet), one I liked, the other I found (Macbeth) and Hamlet I just found a masterpiece. I am pleased to announce that this adjustment is as good as the intense and dramatic game. Acting is extremely strong (with a cast of Kenneth Branagh, Robin Williams and Billy Crystal, how can you lose?) And the change in the period (looks like the 17s and 1800s), is wonderful when the Characters move and tell their notorious lines directly from the script itself, which will make any fan of Shakespeare's game shiver. If you're interested in this popular drama, I urge you to watch this powerful 1996 adaptation of Shakespeare worshiper Kenneth Branagh.
