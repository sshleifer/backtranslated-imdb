I have to agree to most of the other posts. Was it a comedy? a drama? For me it was a bit too much in the direction of the comedy. I could have been a great movie without the comedy, and that was terribly nice. Jamie runs into the Julio again and again and his name. How often in New York do you encounter someone you know in downtown Cleveland? Again a comedy or a drama? But it was still especially entertaining for a Sunday morning. I enjoyed Kimberly Elise's performance, she is certainly a beautiful actress and seems to take her craft seriously. She is a younger actress who will be viable.
