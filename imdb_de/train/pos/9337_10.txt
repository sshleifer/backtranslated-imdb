This series is "something different". Sometimes European series are less accurate than those in the US, but this time the authors have hit the right target and created a mix that works smoothly. Edel & Starck is awesome, it has everything: great action, smart, funny, always well laid out lines, an amazing theatrical timing that is shown by all the stars, and nice shots of Berlin, one of the most interesting cities in the world. It is entertaining to see how things in the justice sector work in countries other than the United States, and they once "feel" the old European way of dealing with life. Kudos to all actors and crew for a successful comedy, which will be a must in the coming years. To see the series in German is great.
