It started slowly after an excellent animated intro as the director had to develop a series of characters and school situations. Once the bet is complete, the movie picks up the pace as it is a race against time to see if a certain number of worms can be eaten around 7pm. We had a good opportunity on the way home to discuss some things with our son: bullying, helping others, thinking, if you do not want to do anything. <br /> <br /> Particularly noteworthy is the girl who played Erica (Erk): Hallie Kate Eisenberg. The director somehow sneaks to her unexpectedly, and when she's on screen, she's intriguing. She's one of those "Hey, she looks familiar" faces, and then I remembered that she was the little girl who showed Pepsi about 8 years ago. She was also in "Paulie," the movie about the parrot trying to find its way home. <br /> <br /> Ms. Eisenberg made many television and film appearances in '99 -00, but was not seen much in the years to come. She is now 14 and grows up to a beautiful woman. Her smile really warms the screen. If she can get more good roles, could she have a good career (or better?) Than Haley Joel Osment, three more who are called child actors, but hopefully without some problems Osment has had lately. <br /> <Anywhozitz, after my 8-year-old son, who had just read the story, did not seem to follow the movie so well, but was entertaining anyway. The end of the movie seemed to be a great setup for some sequels (what does that mean?), Which may not be that bad. It was nice to bring the family to a movie and not have to worry about language, violence or sex scenes. <br /> <br /> Another good aspect of the film was the respect / fear that the director, Mr Burdock, had caused (Boilerplate). Films today tend to depict adult authority figures as buffoons. While he has a certain stupid scene, he ruled the school with a firm hand. It was also nice to see how Andrea Martin got work.
