Big Rock Candy Mountain is incredible. I saw it when I was little and do it today (senior in high school). If I could imagine the sky, it would look like this. I wish I could live in big Rock Candy mountains, where sweets grow on trees. Zach Hyman is a professional and my best friend. Little Bunny Foo Foo is the man. it's so blurry and colorful that I dream about it at night. In fact, my friend, who is 18 years old, has seen it for the first time and absolutely loved it. I recommend that people of all ages see this movie. I have a big party this weekend with all my friends to watch this incredible movie. We'll order pizza and watch the teddy bears giggle. I keep watching clouds and wish I was the little girl who came to visit. Many Thanks. Bye.
