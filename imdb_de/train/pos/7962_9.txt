Only a few so-called "remakes" can be as good as the originals. This crosses this border with flying colors. Just a remake, I do not think so! I saw it theatrically at the age of nine and was totally excited and excited about the movie. <br /> <br /> The film certainly offers comparisons to its 1963 counterpart. The earlier film is also a fun and entertaining film that feels more like a nature documentary than a movie. This update is more epic and cinematic. Nevertheless, I recommend both films without restriction. <br /> <br /> This movie is definitely a must for an animal lover. We have the wise old Golden Retriever, Shadow; the sharp, sarcastic Himalayan cat Sassy; and the young, fun-loving American Bulldog opportunity. The animals are brilliantly voiced by Don Ameche, Sally Field and Michael J. Fox. <br /> <br /> There is virtually nothing insulting in the movie. There is a bit of skatological humor, but nothing extreme. No hard force, except a few tense scenes in which a rushing waterfall, an angry porcupine and a dark railroad shaft are linked together. Film has won no awards, none. Still, I have to say that this is as good as some of today's Best Picture nominees.
