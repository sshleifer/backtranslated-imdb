This movie exceeded my expectations. I thought and heard that it would be trash, so I did not expect much. However, I was pleasantly surprised. At first, I did not deal well with the head girl and did not really care if she lived or died. After a while, she definitely grew on me and became a sympathetic character. It's not just some Slasher movie where people die for no reason. There is a backstory that lasts only a few seconds of the movie, but much explains. I would recommend this movie to anyone. If you are not sure, look at it anyway, it's only an hour and a half of your life. You will live 80 years anyway.
