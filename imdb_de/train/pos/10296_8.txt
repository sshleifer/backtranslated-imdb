Pretty jolly Jim Carrey vehicle that has him as a news reporter who temporarily gains the power of God and wreaks havoc. Carrey is back in familiar surroundings and seems to have a good time, and Jennifer Aniston as his girlfriend is charming and appealing. The story is predictable to the uttermost, but the cast (including Morgan Freeman as "God") is great and makes the movie worth a visit. NOTE B
