Outstanding political thriller played much quieter and slower than other high-level films in this genre. When people talk about Pacino and Cusack, how do they manage to skip these amazing career stops? A story of friendships, father-son relationships, corruption and fraud. The two actors are remarkably well connected and the supporters of Aiello and Fonda are equally impressive, although Aiello is brilliant, especially when the papers are pending. Instead of focusing on an overly complex corruption scandal, he creates wonderful characters that show the political side of failure a political bribe. The final scenes with each of the main characters are wonderfully written and played.
