As someone else commented, this is a feel-good movie. It has a beautiful landscape and the wonderful voice of Luciano! I saw this movie many times and saw it again this afternoon. I forgot how much I miss Pavarotti's vocals from Nessun Dorma and I have to get the CD out! It's a great movie just to spend the afternoon having fun and reverie. Eddie Albert is great as an agent and a bit over the top, but all the agents are just that anyway. The Italian countryside is beautiful, but nothing beats the balloon ride for the perfect view. If you are looking for Olivier Proportion, this movie is not for you. If you just feel like some fancy and wonderful music, watch this movie. Just enjoy it!
