a movie about the cruelty of this world. I found it liberating, as only the truth can be. It also contains some very funny parts. Part of the acting is extraordinary, see for example Maria Hofstätter. The director has tried to make life as realistic as possible. In summary, the sex scenes are unique and no more fakes than those of a hardcore movie. Although I barely understood a sentence, I found the vision of the film in the original language with subtitles much more rewarding, since with the synchronization half of the great work of the actors is lost. The voice of the figure played by Maria Hofstätter is particularly difficult to duplicate by a dubber. <br /> <br /> My favorite movie
