Some people think sniper is not good because the action part was not good enough. If you think of it as an action movie, this position might be correct, as the action section of this movie is not really exciting. However, I think that this is more of a psychological drama than an action drama. <br /> <br /> The film mainly told us about the inside of two snipers who definitely had different personalities and different experiences. Tomas Beccket, a veteran who had confirmed 74 kills, looked as if he was cold-hearted. However, after showing his day dream of Montana, we can clearly see his softness. It was the cruel war and sacrifice of his partners that made Beccket cold-hearted. Millar, on the other hand, was a freshman, a green hand, and was not even a qualified sniper. Billy Zane has shown the hesitation and fear of the Millar when he tried to "put a bullet in the heart" (as Beccket said). What he thought about the actual suicide mission was that it was easy to do and then he could safely come back to receive the award. <br /> <br /> These two guys were pretty different in their personality and I think that the movie had successfully shown the difference and impact they had because of the different personalities. These two snipers argued, suspected each other, and finally got along through the communication and what they had done to save the other one. Sniper is not a good action movie, but a good psychological action movie.
