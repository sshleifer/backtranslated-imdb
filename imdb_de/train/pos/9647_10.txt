Deeply emotional It can not leave you neutral. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's a love story between 2 18-year-old boys. But it's just the body of this movie. And it was removed. They only feel what happened to these guys. You feel the soul of the movie. Of course with some action, some sex, but that's not pornography, too many feelings. It was just a "summer story", and it was almost to death, the most important time of her life, to hate for love. I loved it, so will you, whatever your feelings are.
