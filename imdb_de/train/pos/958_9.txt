Impressive! I've seen so many bad low budget movies lately, but this one is great. The very realistic depiction of police life in a city on the East German coast is a stark contrast to other thrillers or series. I loved the main actress and the absolute rejection of a widespread clich√© about the police. This movie is as realistic as a documentary and as entertaining as a drama. A perfect compromise!
