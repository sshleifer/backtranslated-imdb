Just like wine, "Johnny Dangerously" gets better every day. This clever, funny, well-rehearsed movie could stand alone - but as a spoof of the gangster genre it's really outstanding. In fact, it's obviously the best movie of its kind ... the funniest parody of mob films and even the particular period - though that position is likely to be easier to achieve when its main competitors are such primitive, vulgar, and dull pseudo-comedies as "Jane Austen's Mafia ".
