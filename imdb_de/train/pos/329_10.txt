Of all the versions of the Odyssey (or any Greek mythological story in this regard), in my opinion, this is the best of them all. Almost true to the original - with some minor differences and omissions, eg. The absence of Scylla & Charybdis and the fact that Eumaeus, the swineherd, discovers Odysseus disguised in his hut - realistic plays, authentic scenery and costumes make this masterpiece an unforgettable experience and not some Hollywood swords and b-shirts. strips. Despite the fact that the dialogue and the subtitles are all in Italian, if you are familiar with the story, you can still make heads and tails about what's going on and what the actors are saying (assuming you have a useful text the Odyssey.) available). At least that's what I did and that inspired me to learn the Italian language to appreciate the movie even better.
