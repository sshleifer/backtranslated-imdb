For those of you who do not make that reference, clubberin was 4 fists beating a corpse ... <br /> <br /> Anyway, on the rating. <br /> <br /> I miss WCW Saturday Night. On this stage some of my favorite wrestling moments took place. I remember seeing Steve Austin, Rick Rude, Brian Pillman, Cactus Jack, Dustin Rhodes, Johnny B. Badd, and DDP in his jobber days while listing everyone. Point is WCW had a great squad in the pre-Hogan days and produced entertaining television. Dusty Rhodes on the comment in his later years gave me a whole new reason to watch when I started smoking as a teenager ... I really wish Vince would put him on the microphone for a show or two, maybe the next Great American bash? You CLUBBERIN! Here comes DA PLUNDA! He was great. <br /> <br /> stirrer
