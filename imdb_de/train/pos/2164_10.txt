I saw this last night and loved the heartfelt plot, the outstanding character development, and the good karmic atmosphere that comes from acting and the movie as a whole. <br /> <br /> Without giving away too much of the plot It starts with an ordinary Joe who commutes everyday to his office job and gets inspired to dance lessons. Along the way, the protagonist and the various characters he encounters on his dance floor learn lessons about others and about himself. <br /> <br /> The story has a prologue about what symbolizes dancing in sociological terms, therefore it's not that easy to dance in Japan, like here in the US <br /> The movie is carefree; You will laugh out loud at some of the sight gauges. But it is also worthy of a hard-to-describe way. All the characters of the movie are taken seriously and they are not diminished due to their "imperfections". <br /> <br /> I've been thinking about attending social dance classes with some friends. It was just that a friend taught me the video for dancing. Is that synchronous or what? I think so, because now I am really geeked to try it out. <br /> <br /> Take a look at this wonderful family movie (little kids might not get it, but the teens would certainly do) and smile at the genuine care you keep seeing you make a remake of Shall We do Dance is a mystery, because it is the way it is.
