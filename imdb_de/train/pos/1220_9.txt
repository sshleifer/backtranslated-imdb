Origins of the Care Bears and their cousins. If you have seen the original movie, you will notice a discrepancy. The cousins ​​are raised with the Care Bears instead of meeting later. However, I have no problem handling the movies as separate interpretations. The babies are adorable and they enjoy watching them play and grow. My favorite is Swift Heart Rabbit. The villain is a wonderfully threatening figure-shifter. I could put myself in the three children, because I was never good at sports. Cree Summer is excellent like Christy. The songs are cute and memorable. If you have an open heart, love toys or enjoyed the original, you can not miss it. 9.10
