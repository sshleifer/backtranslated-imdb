A man faces life alone after 45 years of marriage. He also has to solve the problem of the family milk cow Tulip, which can not be milked. Until that is, he visualizes his wife, who used to milk Tulip. Tulip is based on a true story told in Griffith's family about the generation of their grandparents. The film is a nostalgic glimpse into a vanishing lifestyle in which people still feel themselves in the lush green landscape of Victoria (the Australian state, not the era). Griffith's author and director evidently has more ambitions in both areas, and these multiple times Award-winning, 15-minute short-time work is a good start for her role.
