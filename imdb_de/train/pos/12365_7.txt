I am surprised that no one has ever mentioned that there are two versions of this film. The lion's share of the footage in both is identical, but here they are different: in one version (the version I've seen most on television), the group of clerics guarding the Gateway is the "Brotherhood of Protectors." a (fictitious) faction of priests and brothers "excommunicated" by the church. In the other version, which I have seen only once on television, the clerics who guard the gate are portrayed as priests of the official church, that is, the Archdiocese of New York (or perhaps Brooklyn). In the previous version, clerics are referred to as "brothers" in most relevant scenes (and in some scenes you can see where the lips say "father," but the synchronized tone says ") Brother." So and so " In the latter version, I believe everyone is referred to as a "father." <br /> <br /> In any case, it seems that one of these two versions is more or less partial re-shooting the other, with all the scenes from " Brotherhood of the Protector "as" archdiocese "scenes or vice versa (one kind reminds me of the scenes of Raymond Burr in" Godzilla "). I have both recorded on TV versions of television, so no, I can not imagine that Can anyone shed some light on the story behind these two versions of the movie?
