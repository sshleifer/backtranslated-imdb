Michael Kallio gives a strong and compelling performance as Eric Seaver, a disturbed young man who was terribly abused by his monstrous, abusive, alcoholic stepfather Barry (a really terrifying portrayal of Gunnar Hansen) as a young boy. Eric has a compassionate fianc√© (sweetly played by the pretty Tracee Newberry) and a job that copies autopsy reports at a local morgue. Tormented by his bleak past, driven by the bald-headed, radiant Jack the Demon (a really scary Michael Robert Brandon) who was sent over the edge by his mother's recent death, Eric leaves the brutal killing spree. Directed by Kallio (who also wrote the strict, sharp script), with an equally good acting direction by a sound-no-name actor (Jeff Steiger is particularly well suited as Eric's would-be helpful guardian angel Michael), rather crude, but overall polished Cinematography by George Lieber, credible, realistic characters, jolting bursts of raw, shocking and relentless cruel violence, a moody, scary score by Dan Kolton, an uncompromising downbeat ending, grubby locations in Detroit, Michigan, a grim, serious tone, and a gripping narrative Staying on a consistent path throughout ensures a highly powerful and persistent psychological horror thriller that often involves viewing and recording things. A real sleeper
