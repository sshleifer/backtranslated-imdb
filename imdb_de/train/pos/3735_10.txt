Really touching story of a recruiting camp in America where young men are being prepared for the Vietnam War. The study of man has always appealed to me when it comes to war films, because it translates personal, subjective opinions into war, rejects war films in which actions and technical data are analyzed under the prejudice of the human factor. <br /> <br /> The film manages to revise an already old theme and distance itself from the usual war movies, especially by focusing on an antihero from the standpoint of the traditional standard. The film focuses on the tragic character of Bozz, who cleverly avoids being sucked in by the dehumanizing war machine, and refuses to give up control of his fate and fight for something he does not believe he'll be sent overseas Both for himself and for his comrades, and ironically, he finds his own reason to finally go to war. Perfect irony. <br /> <br /> Acting is truly extraordinary, and documentary-style filming almost makes you look like a movie. The film will also give food for thought to those exhilarated by the action in war films or war game enthusiasts, and hopefully awaken some heads of a generation that has fortunately escaped the terror horror.
