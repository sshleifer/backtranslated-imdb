I love this movie and have seen it several times over the years. With every consideration it gets better. I agree with all the positive reviews here. Yes, it is hard and brutally realistic, as it was then in the prairie. As I watched him, I made comments. Someone here said Rip Torn was a failure. I could not argue anymore. He's brilliant like the grumpy, avaricious Clyde Stewart, who says little and works like a slave / workhorse. Conchatta Farrell is fantastic as the widowed Elinor, who hires Clyde (along with her 7-year-old daughter) as housekeeper / cook. Lilia Skala is great as a distant neighbor named Grandma. Another star is the barren Montana prairie. It is both a beautiful and a brutal country to settle in. There are some scenes that are both repulsive and necessary. No special effects here, what you see is real! It even has incredibly perfect music and a great script. Once you see Heartland, you will never forget it. It deserves every 10 that gets it here.
