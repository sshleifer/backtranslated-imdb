Paul was totally outsmarted by someone who made Dave. It's the same story, not so funny. <br /> <br /> Paul told me this morning about the scene in which Sammy Davis sings the new national anthem of Parador. he arrived in brazil after a long flight of vegas, three planes, car to set etc, he was beaten. He could barely stand, had to use a stick. He was in a caravan about the size of my bathroom. He did not know he could do it. then he saw the crowd of 6000 extras and paid $ 7. he came alive and they shot this scene for two hours. he was great, then almost collapsed. Paul is a great guy, albeit very liberal. a real talent.
