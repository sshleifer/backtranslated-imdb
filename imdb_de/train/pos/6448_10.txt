Kay Pollack (the man behind this movie) is a really great man who tries to share his life philosophy in different ways. He has written a number of good and well-written books on how to control your senses and keep your soul happy. Most of his books and this movie are about the message that your thoughts are actually causing your problems and that the reason for your anger is almost never what you think. The main message is that you can choose to be happy, but never do that. <br /> <br /> To watch this movie and learn something very important about life, you need to keep your mind very open and listen to all the "hidden messages" (or guidelines to get through life) that the Most parts of this movie are included if you are listening and looking. Watch it with your ears. <br /> <br /> You will not learn the meaning of life, but you will learn how to live and make the most of it ... <br /> <br /> Please note when observing: <br /> <br /> "The mind is like a parachute, it does not work if it's not open!"
