The movie is really poignant, unique and uplifting. History is universal in that it is a struggle between good, evil and the world in between. The important thing is that the rating is wrong, misleading and a travesty. Blockbuster rated it as if it were an X-rated movie. The truth is that it's closer to G than to PG and should be seen by children who can read the clear and simple subtitles.
