There is indeed much to complain about this film version of Molnar's mystical play - Farrell looks good in his title role, but his line reading stinks open. This also suffers to a great extent from the fact that this is referred to as the first film with rear projection. The sets look spotty. <br /> <br /> However, there are two major strengths in this show: Although the dialogue reading is weak, the visual performances are perfect. Rose Hobart, like Julie, has little to remember today, especially for ROSE HOBART, in which Joseph Cornell cut programmer EAST OF BORNEO to just take pictures of her. Their great beauty and simple (though amazing) performance help repair the damage to the earthbound sections of this movie. <br /> <br /> However, Borzage's theme is the mystical power of love, and that's how she handles the stretches of sky that make it great, from the arrival of the sky train to the drive to the 'hot place'. H. B. Warner's performance is perfect, as always. <br /> <br /> So we have a flawed, but very interesting version here. I think Lang's version of 1934 is better than the heavenly scenes in the Henry King version of CAROUSEL, the watered-down musical remake. But I still enjoyed this release a lot and I think you should give it a try.
