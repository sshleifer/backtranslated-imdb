Mitchell Leisen's fifth film as a director, and he shows his versatility by conducting a musical after his previous films were heavy drama. He also plays a cameo as a conductor. <br /> <br /> It can be said that this is a pre-code movie and nothing like it has been done in the US for a while (like over 30 years). Leisen recorded the musical numbers in a way that the audience would see - no widescreen recordings or from above, ala Busby Berkeley. What I find strange or interesting is that you never really see the audience. <br /> <br /> As mentioned before, the leads are pretty characterless and Jack Oakie and Victor McLaghlan play their normal movie personalities. Gertrude Michael, however, makes for a bit of spark. <br /> <br /> The musical numbers are interesting and good (the rape of the Rhapsody is amusing), but the drama is unconvincing and fake - three murders are too many and do not have a minimal emotional impact on the characters. Here this movie could have been much better.
