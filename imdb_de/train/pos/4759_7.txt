A clever little episode that was mainly played for laughter but with a skilful bunch of suspense. Somehow, a Martian got into a broken bus on the way to nowhere, but which passenger is it (talk about your illegal immigrants!). All-star cast, from wild-eyed Jack Elam (shamelessly pounding) to sexy Jean Willes (if she's the Martian, then I'll open the borders!), To the cruel John Hoyt (the most obvious suspect), along with the familiar faces John Archer and Barney Phillips (and a nice turn of Bill Kendis as a bus driver). Makes a very entertaining half hour, even if the action is limited to a single sentence.
