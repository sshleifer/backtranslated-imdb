Here comes the term "classic movie". This is a wonderful story of courage, courage and extreme loyalty of a woman. Poor Olan was sold to her indifferent husband, who had learned to appreciate her over the years. (Yes, A PEARL !!) <br /> <br /> Luise Rainer was the beautiful star who won the Oscar for Best Actress the year before for her small role (and what a waste of an Oscar) in "The Great . " It really did not show what talent she had except her exotic beauty, but in "Good Earth" she shows she can really act! Her beauty has been erased and she also did not have any great costumes. that she has not shown any real feelings in this movie, like hell, her character Olan is a shy and shy woman with inner strength, she is calm during parts of the movie, just with her eyes and body to convey her feelings. For example, these scenes during the fall of the city and when raiders were shot, if you say you are not doing well in this movie, DO NOT search! <br /> <br /> Paul Muni shows he is acting like this His character is not sympathetic to me He never sees her as she is until the end of the story A sweet, loving and devoted woman and mother with her very special beauty all, the beauty inside, like a pearl. <br /> <br /> If you have the chance to see this movie, look at it. You will see one of the best films created by the golden age of Hollywood.
