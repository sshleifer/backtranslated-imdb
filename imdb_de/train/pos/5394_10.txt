I was absolutely fascinated by this series from the moment Tom Long came into the picture - the whole Bad Boy thing, it was just addictive. <br /> <br /> History has intrigued you, what will happen next - will Joey Get the girl in the end after spending 5 years in prison and thinking all along about his lost love She crossed paths again and found that he has a son ... Although he is a violent villain, you still want to find him to be lucky. <br /> <br /> A really fascinating two-parter - please bring it on video!
