Based on a true story, like a man ahead of his time - the great American poet and humanist Walt Whitman of the 19th century - made a significant contribution to how Western medicine treats people with mental health problems. <br /> <br /> Interested in treating people with mental health problems, he began contacting psychiatric workers and patients. After seeing the psychological methods of the time (inhuman and ignorantly cruel methods), Walt rejected these methods and treated patients with compassion and dignity. He encouraged other people to do the same, full of drama, good humor, and wisdom. :)
