Those who only remember the late Sir Peter Ustinov as Hercule Poirot or a professional raconteur would do well to find this charming piece of late 1960s satire. Ustinov plays a convicted embezzler (we first see him on his last day in jail, where he prepares the prison director's tax return), who has the future in the computer, poses himself (by means of a skilful identity theft) A computer expert and wants an American Infiltrate multinational company. Ustinov (who co-wrote the script) is in great shape, as is the delightful Maggie Smith, who looks unusually cockney-prone here -sparrow dolly bird. Bob Newhart also plays an entertaining role as a suspicious leader designed by Maggie Smith. In addition, Karl Malden is satisfactory as Ustinov and Newhart's female boss. <br /> <br /> What do I like about this movie in particular? It's not just a well-thought-out "caper movie," but also a touching little love story. Ustinov and Smith are very convincing as the two outsiders stumble into love (the whole scene with playing cards is particularly effective.) <br /> <br /> So, what's not to be liked? Well, the script is not more computer literary than most movies (that is, almost not at all), although it captures the feeling of business computing of the late sixties pretty well. There are also a few small plotting glitches that you will probably not notice until the second or third time, but I think this is a minor puzzle. <br /> <br /> As I said, this is a movie that is worth looking for, and once you've seen it, you want to see it regularly. <br /> <br />
