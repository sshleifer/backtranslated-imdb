Yesterday I was at the world premiere of "Descent" at the Tribeca Film Festival in NYC. I had a nice time. It was sold out and was visited by all the big stars, including my colleague Marcus Patrick. <br /> <br /> I give the movie 7.5 out of a possible 10 stars. <br /> <br /> The film begins with Maya (Rosario Dawson) at college. You can imagine the typical college environment with wild parties and flirtations. The photography in this film was excellent. She meets Jared (Chad Faust) and they become beautiful. It seems like every other relationship at the beginning. The man is looking for attention and affection of the woman, and the woman is hard to get. Both played well. Very innocent flirt between the two. He invites her to his apartment and everything falls apart. <br /> <br /> The apartment is very dreary and dark. They finally end up in the basement, which is extremely dark and illuminated by numerous candles. That actually reminded me of a dungeon. Here he shows his true colors and rapes them. This is a very dark and gritty rape scene. This scene is not for young or weak people. The rape scene is a bit long and hard to take, but for the rest of the movie that follows, it is necessary. Maya loses her soul to drugs and sex. She falls into her own abyss. She starts attending the wildest parties and wakes up in a room one morning without remembering how she got there. She is to visit Adrian (Marcus Patrick). The first thing I remember about this character is that they say, "He is the person who saves everyone, who needs to be saved." He is actually the one who introduces Maya to drugs. They begin a dependency relationship that comes later in the movie. The club scenes at this point in the film are photographed with extreme skill. I found her well done and noticed that the director of photography was applauded by the audience during the closing credits at the end of the show. <br /> <br /> Maya is back in college as a TA and who is in her class - Jared her rapist !! They could see the confusion and emotions on Maya's face. What should I do?? What do I do next? The attitudes of her face and the emotions are invaluable. <br /> <br /> What's developing next is not what's happening right now. She is interested in Jared. She seems to revive the relationship and to be loved again. I sat there and said, could this really happen. It was not Nothing could be further from the truth. <br /> <br /> She invites him to her apartment and of course he shows up. Now her flat is dark and gritty. She took it off completely. He believes that he will get "lucky". She then teases him like every woman. She pats him everywhere and he gets excited. Note: For anyone planning to watch this movie, this scene is a frontal nudity - it may not be right for the younger viewer. <br /> <br /> She turns the situation around and she becomes a beast and rapes him. Again the scene is dark, somber and very rough. <br /> <br /> If you are watching the movie and you do not want to know what happens next, skip this paragraph and go to the last step Paragraph. <br /> <br /> Here comes Adrian into the picture. Maya has saved Adrian by doing extremely hard male sex with Jared. She believes that this is the last revenge. Adrian continues to cling to Jared's manhood and invalidates his dignity. Marcus plays as Adrian this scene as credible as anyone possible. He is a strong actor who plays a strong character and the strength is expressed throughout the screen. After the film, Marcus explained during a question and answer session that this scene needed a lot of trust between him and Chad. Maya thinks that this revenge will save her, but I do not believe she does. One of the last scenes shows a close-up of May's face and you see a tear roll down her cheek. This was a fabulous close-up scene that is constantly being discussed by everyone who visits this movie. Did she get the revenge she wanted? Was it as satisfying as she had expected? In my opinion, it does not do that. That just makes things worse. <br /> <br /> This is an excellent movie, gets well-played roles, and I recommend it to anyone who thinks to see him. I would be a little hesitant if I'm under 17 years old. Rosario, Chad and Marcus should be praised for their good work. The direction and photography must also be recommended. It was a night I enjoyed.
