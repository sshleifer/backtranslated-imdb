Zero Day lets you think and even rethink why two boys / boys are doing what they did - commit each other by slaughtering their classmates. It begins what must be beyond a bizarre way of being for two people who have decided to withdraw from common courtesy to define their own / mutual world through coupled destruction. It's not a perfect movie, but considering the money / time the filmmaker and his actors had, this is a remarkable product. In terms of explaining the motives and actions of the two young suicides / killers, it's better than "Elephant" - in terms of the movie that gets under our "rationalistic" skin, it's a far better movie than almost anything you do are likely to be seen. <br /> <br /> Flawed but honest with a terrible honesty.
