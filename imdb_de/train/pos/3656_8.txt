If you have difficulty exposing unbelief, this is not for you. Remember, a woman finds a newborn baby in a cabbage patch as late as middle age, and tucks it up like her own. Think about it; She makes no attempt to locate the mother, who may be a confused teenager in need of medical attention, and apparently no representative of the Italian social services makes an attempt to bring the baby into "care" (no social services, now I KNOW, that it's a fantasy, before you know, the young Toto is about ten years old, and his adoptive mother dies, and leaves him at the orphanage, from which he brings forth a HAPPY man who loves everyone, in no way does he have his suitcase given only to the man who stole it, but he made the local homeless into real Shantytown residents and leads them to an encore in the fight against capitalism in the form of the merchant who buys the land the Shantytown stands on when This requires some swallowing, without the subsequent "miracles" begin, in which Toto's dead mother (the old lady who raised him earlier) at, as his biological reared) that appears to him and gives him a dove that serves as a magic wand and allows him to fulfill modest wishes finale in which the hobos fly to a better place, presumably somewhere above the rainbow located. <br /> <br /> On the other side is the movie with Charm and is easy to give up. In sum, a little masterpiece.
