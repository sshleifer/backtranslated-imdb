I really enjoyed this movie. Britney is a great role model for teens and should be more appreciated. This movie is about following your dreams and never giving up, no matter what people do or say to discourage and criticize you. Holly fulfills her dreams just like Britney. <br /> <br /> There are times in every life when people judge them for what they are not. When you watch this movie, you will understand that you are special in your own way and should follow your dreams, no matter what. <br /> <br /> I want to thank Britney for encouraging me and my friends to follow our dreams. She will never know how much that means to me. Bravo Britney. You are the greatest!!!
