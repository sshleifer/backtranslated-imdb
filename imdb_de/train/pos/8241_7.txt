Fidois a very strange movie. And in many ways a very good one. <br /> <br /> My first thought after watching was, how the hell are they going to market this thing? When Shaun of the Dead is a romantic comedy with zombies, Fido is a boy, and his dog story melded with a 50-year-old nostalgia comedy with zombies. Do not stumble on the tongue. <br /> <br /> Fido has little of Shaun's slaughter, blood and stomach laugh. It is a very different animal (forgive the pun). <br /> <br /> Fido begins with a black-and-white information movie that explains the background story. Humans have won a war against zombies by developing a control collar that suppresses the carnivorous to dumb servants. <br /> <br /> At first I thought we had a fifties paranoia-parody-parody à la matinée, but soon we are entering a world of bright primary colors and mid-fifties class nostalgia. <br /> <br /> Young Timmy Robinon is a lonely boy who does not fit in school. His mother is a social climber and his father is nervous and distant. <br /> <br /> To keep up with the Joneses, mother (Carry-Anne Moss) has acquired a zombie. Jimmy is initially uninterested, but "Fido" (Billy Conelley) soon turns out to be a great buddy for Jimmy. Until his collar wobbles ... <br /> <br /> Fido is NOT a horror movie, but my problem with the movie is finding out exactly what it is. Much of the humor is of light family diversity, and sometimes the plot is too dependent on the boy and his dog / family. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, the movie will go through wonderfully dark, really funny moments that, though welcome, will ensure an R rating for a family comedy for a long time. <br /> <br /> The movie looks great and is wonderfully performed by everyone involved. <br /> <br /> Despite I hope this film finds a niche, because it is a little gem in this year's flood of cinema.
