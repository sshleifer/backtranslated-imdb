If you're one of Katana's movie nuts (just like me), you'll surely appreciate this metaphysical katana swing samurai action movie featuring samurai action. <br /> <br /> Performers Tadanobu Asano (Vital, Barren Illusion) & Ryu Daisuke (Kagemusha). This samurai war between Heikis clan and Genji's clan touches the climax in the last showdown at Gojo Bridge. The body count is countless. <br /> <br /> Demons, magic swords, Shinto priests against Buddhist monks and the beautiful visions provided by Maestro Sogo Ishii do the rest. <br /> <br /> A good Japanese fast for one rainy summer night.
