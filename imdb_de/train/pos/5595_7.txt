Polanski returns to the themes of loneliness and madness that he explored in Repulsion and Rosemary's Baby in The Tenant with such great impact. <br /> <br /> The atmosphere is a hallmark of Polanski - dark, brooding, unsettling - but there is something awkward about this movie and I'm not sure if it's intended or not. <br /> <br /> Sven Nykvist, who was responsible for some of Bergman's most beautiful films, will not agree. Since his name was one of the things that really drew me to this film, I was a little disappointed with how little really impressive cinematography can be seen in the film. <br /> <br /> The only thing that really makes the movie down is acting. Polanski is certainly not a bad actor, but he seems to be more grim than he can chew on Trelkovsky's difficult role. Some of the supporting actors are great, especially Melvyn Douglas as landlord and Shelley Winters as concierge, but others are weak and mismanaged. It is also hard to overcome that all these supposed Parisians have American accents. Quite unexpectedly, there are some nice moments of dark comedy in the movie. Anyone who has seen The Fearless Vampire Killers knows that Polanski is certainly a good comedic actor. However, there are times when it gets dangerously close to a parody. Trelkovsky's sudden (and somewhat inexplicable) "metamorphosis" leads to chuckles rather than eyebrows, which distracts from what was meant to be a significant moment in his psycho-dramatic journey. All in all, The Tenant is a delightful and mesmerizing experience when it is a bit boring. There are a handful of extraordinary restful moments and a thoroughly uncomfortable and startling atmosphere, but while this film is very good, it is not as successful as it could have been. An "okay" Polanski movie is still better this day than most other "good" movies. Definitely worth a watch, just do not expect to be blown away.
