This is one of the most beautiful, moving films that make you think. It is a good family entertainment and at the same time lets you think very carefully about the problems involved. Every time I see Zac's mind racing through the puddle, I can not help but expel my eyes. John Thaw's performance is so touching and it's a shame that he's not with us anymore, an excellent movie, full score.
