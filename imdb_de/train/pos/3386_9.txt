Is this the future that awaits us? A crowded, unyielding desert with a hellish, unwanted existence? This movie reminds us of a problem that still plagues us, twice since the movie was released in 1973. Let's hope the world does not end up like this ... <br /> <br /> Soylent Green is a wild movie that I really enjoyed. It had sympathetic characters, a semi-apocalyptic environment, a captivating and thought-provoking story, and the macho-macho man out there: Charleton Heston. Richard Fleischer gave the film a very unpleasant, dirty feeling. They are almost stifled by the stink of the city and its filthy inhabitants. The characters are wonderful. Charleton Heston, who has become one of my favorite actors, IS Thorn. The man has created this role of evil but sympathetic hard. I could definitely put myself in Thorn's shoes. He sees that something is wrong, but everyone around him either does not listen (rather pay as if not to listen) or wants to see him dead. Edward G. Robinson (in his last film, R.I.P.) plays the lovable old sol who has had enough of this unpleasant place. Everyone else is great, especially Leigh Taylor-Young as Shirl, a "piece of furniture" that belongs to the home she lives in. <br /> <br /> The special effects are fantastic even for 1973. The Soylent Green factory, the futuristic apartments and especially the "shovels" (bulldozers that get rid of people) were excellent. The polluted air outside looks disgusting and very unpleasant. The empty streets of the city, filled with the disgusting and lazy people, are very disturbing. <br /> <br /> One last note is the end that still shocked me even now. It's cruel, but if you think about it, it's a pretty good idea. <br /> <br /> The Bottom Line: <br /> <br /> An excellent 70s science fiction strip that makes you think and leaves you feeling very uncomfortable.
