The Neil Simon's Sunshine Boys starring Walter Matthau and George Burns are a funny comedy about the strange connection to life and its brevity, but the laugh is always bitter. When Willy Clark (Matthau) and Al Lewis (Burns) see two great theatrical comedians, they are reduced to stupidity in the hard and tireless age, which you can only find annoying and blue. Willy never surrenders and keeps working while Al is tired for the players and retires to his daughter in the country in the house. The pair in its old days was really funny and harmonious, but outside the scene there was a row and argument, and eleven years after their break, they did not talk to each other. If they work now, they will have to return together another time to make one of his best old sketches for a comedy story on TV. The meeting is explosive and liberating for the old questions. The script by Neil Simon gives the story a certain caustic spirit and the melancholic and blue overpowering of the many gags and laughter succeeded, also thanks to the great couple Walter Matthu (Nomination Academy Award for Best Actor) and George Burns (Won the Oscar for Best support actor). The two actors are very credible and real, and their harmony almost seems like they are really working together all this time, and this trait they do not carry. The film is also very touching for its all-consuming reality, as the story is narrated and how the Love-Heat report, which unites the two actors, is part of the foreign, but at the same time usually understandable, life. My rate is 7.
