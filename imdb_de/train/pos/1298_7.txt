A real anomaly in French cinema. This desperate work has no equivalent in contemporary production. You have to orient yourself to Louis Malles "Le feu follet" (1963) (the fire inside) to find something that is not completely different. Harel tries hard. Dry and cynical, having lost all illusions, the hero, a computer scientist, has no reason to live. Absolutely none. Apart from humanity, he seems to live his life as a kind of entomologist studying his colleagues. One of them captures his attention: Tisserand-Jos√© Garcia plays the most humiliating part of the decade. Then Tisserand becomes a kind of prey: all his pessimism will affect this poor man. The scene is the night. Club climbs on the strange relationship: The hero tells his victim that his life will always be unfulfilled if he does not ... Well, the movie takes a more conventional twist, so to speak (Clouzot's misanthropy, perhaps), but only for a while. <br /> <br /> The form is weird beyond the comment. There is t A voice for the narrator, who always refers to the main character as "our hero", one for the above hero. The story now takes place in Paris, now in Rouen, the town of Guy de Maupassant. The hero says that the madness of the writer was only the expression of his disgust for man and draws a parallel between his despair and that of Maupassant. This depressing film is only suitable for an informed audience. Not for the very short excerpts of X-rated movies, but because you might feel in the dumps after watching.
