Ah, the best and funniest movie about female football fans, just a bit better than the teenage crazy saga of 1982 in North London. By the way, I've just seen this on movie 4 [2008-12-21] and ruin my inability to tune the PVR.) <br /> <br /> This is easily my second favorite football movie after "Mike Bassett: England Manager", but this time with the certain something that it looks like a guerrilla movie by a team that seems to continue to produce films that are banned in the country where they are produced (just think of where the girls are. ) taken out of the stadium just as the sun goes down: fast reactions everywhere). <br /> <br /> It's rare for a movie to make me laugh, but when the rescuer escorted one of the girls into the raccoons while forcing them to wear an inpromptu mask from a poster by Ali Daei, I could not stop waking the others in the house with my snorting, especially when the young soldier had misunderstood the grandfather's cries for help ... <br /> <br /> Speaking of toilets, I only wish I could speak Farsi to me the writing on the toilet walls could work out (yes, there were a few scribbles in Roman script, but mostly related to wanky American rock bands). <br /> <br /> Farsi theme, do not you think that Omid Djalili sounds like a Jokel when he speaks Farsi? Listen to the Sergeant of Custody in this movie and then go to "Jup". <br /> <br /> I will not be bored with the sexual policy in Iran, and I will not be more than twofold; My love for this film comes from the script and the cut: first-class stuff. <br /> <br /> Here's a list of my favorite football favorite movies: 1. Mike Bassett, England coach 2. Offside 3. Those Glory Glory days 4. A shot at fame 5. The secret of the Arsenal Stadium
