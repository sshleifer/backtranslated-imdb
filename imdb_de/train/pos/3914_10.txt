I personally think that the film was made very professional, I loved the choreography and the acting. The plot is also enthralling and mysterious. The movie itself is very emotional, and I liked most of all that it makes him think afterwards. Antonio Gades has lived his role absolutely and I have to say that this is one of my favorite pictures and Saura is a wonderful director.
