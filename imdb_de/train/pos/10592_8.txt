Pleasant story of the Pimlico community in London, which, following an unexploded World War II bomb, locates a royal charter indicating that the area in which they live forms part of Burgundy. This film works because it likes fantasy Many of us have the idea to set our own rules and not listen to YOU. A solid cast of British Stalwarts, especially Stanley Holloway, makes that more credible. <br /> <br /> There are some very nice moments in the movie, for example when people have no more supplies and other Londoners on the other side of the barricade throw food and other things at them. <br /> <br /> Even if you always knew that Pimlico would become part of the UK again, it does not matter to the people of PImlico and the viewers. When this happens, it leaves a nice happy feeling. <br /> <br /> It's amazing that these low budget movies from a small studio in London over fifty years later are still so popular. The producers must have done something right.
