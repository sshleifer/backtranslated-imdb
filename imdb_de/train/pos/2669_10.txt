This story in Wellington, a suburb of New Zealand (Tawa - home of the prestigious Tawa College), is McCarten's first feature. <br /> <br /> With a contemporary New Zealand flair, Via Satellite is rich in absolutely funny situations that are in the (adult) family context. At the same time he manages to arouse intense feelings of sadness and desperation. <br /> <br /> One of the most moving and humorous films of the year - not to be missed!
