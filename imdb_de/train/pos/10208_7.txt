Rarely do we see such short comments from IMDb moviegoers. Maybe it's because this light dark comedy entertains and pleases without depth, or are we missing something? I would take another look at it, if I had an incentive. <br /> <br /> So what is a coincidence? For the French it is "Le Battement d 'Ailes du Papillon" Serendipity? Fate? Perhaps it is an event that is the culmination of a series of random events. We all had these (it's called life), but when you look at it that way, you get the feeling that "random" looks more like "fate". <br /> <br /> A "Coincidence" in This movie could be as minor an event as poking some lettuce leaves from the back of a truck, or as important as leaning on the accuracy of a stranger the accuracy of a stranger with a pebble casts. All of these incidents lead to other events that ... understand the picture? Domino. Multiply these by 30 characters and an average of 6 characters, and you really need to develop your imagination to accept the remote likelihood that this scenario might occur. And I think there is a diagnosis for those who believe that life is like this. But then this is the magical world of cinema. <br /> <br /> We admit that it's fun to see the author / director put these disconnected events together into a story that captivates the lives of these French citizens. If you have a few hours and are looking for a strange escape, you can do this here. Or if you recover from the surgery and go nowhere anyway, you will be affected while your bites heal. <br /> <br /> "Happenstance" will not go down as a laureate, but should develop a cult following. Strange things happened. <br /> <br /> Soren Kierkegaard is credited with the following: "Life can only be understood backwards, but it has to be lived forward." If you look at the detail (the meeting of your first love, the perfect present, the last car accident) in many of your own life experiences, you would find a series of seemingly random events that lead to it. <br /> <br /> That's the answer! I forgot to bring an Existentialist to explain to me "Happenstance".
