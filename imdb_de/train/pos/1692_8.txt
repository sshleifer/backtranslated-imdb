Like the big classic Bugs Bunny cartoons, this movie offers humor at different levels. I have just introduced this to my 10-year-old daughter and 11-year-old son. Both enjoyed the movie - he had to laugh a few times ... and my daughter is not a big science fiction fan. The movie made me laugh, though I've seen it a few times ... adult humor (that is, humor that adults will simply get because of greater life experiences, not baudy or R-rated stuff found here ) for adults alike. For example, for adult-level humor, Martian voices are based on characters from various films / actors. Mars pilot Blaznee has the voice and mannerism of Jack Nicholson; the scientist, the Dr. Strangelove by Peter Seller. The special effects are surprisingly good for this movie. The shortage of top 10 actors has a positive effect on the film, and the actors / actresses play their part. In fact, I would say the producers picked out actors and their skills for the role needs of the box office makers (an excellent result) One example is Wayne Alexander's "Vern" character, I had to write this review ... the kids play this for the third time in 4 days at dinner .. Good for a rainy day or late night, there is no nothing-to-be-bored movie.
