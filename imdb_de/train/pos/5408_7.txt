Of these Pokemon movies (which are best for me): Pokemon The First Movie, Pokemon 4Ever, Pokemon Heroes, Pokemon 200 and Pokemon: Entei and the unknown, this is probably the most ecofriendly the most beautiful and the quietest. Whether these are good points for you or not, "Pokemon 4Ever" still entertained many. <br /> <br /> In addition to the above three points, this Pokemon movie has good humor and good CGI (as well as anime). The movie's time travel is well illustrated, and Team Rocket (the comic reliefs / garbage villains) end up with pretty good jokes and are more main characters than sidekicks. <br /> <br /> The weaknesses are, as always, the more unnecessary violence and action, and the villain is pretty uninteresting, even more than a few Pokemon villains. <br /> <br /> A strange Pokemon is tracked down by a Pokemon Hunter in a forest. A boy tries to save the pokemon and it takes him somewhere ... <br /> <br /> In the meantime Ash, Brock and Misty enter a big forest ... <br /> <br /> Curious? Check out the rest ... <br /> <br /> Good for all Pokemon fans and "American" anime movie fans. Enjoy "Pokemon 4Ever"! :-)
