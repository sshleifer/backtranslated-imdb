I'm watching this on the overseas Star World network, which buys American and Canadian series that take one or two seasons like The Jane Show. I thought about how many female lead comedy shows I can actually see alone. There's Lucy, Charmed, I Dream Of Jeanie (the one with Barbara Feldman), and then my mind goes blank. The women are all supporting roles, not the main role. For me, The Jane Show is a pretty good company. One thing that I just thought about. I looked at a lot of things that were made in Canada, and I can not remember that in a regular TV show SNOW! It's all in midsummer, LOL! Granted, it's a great place to live in the summer depending on the climate, but you think they would show a little bit of Canada during the winter, as it's also part of the lifestyle. I mean, SCTV, Just For Laughs - two comedy shows shot in Canada for a long time, with very little or no snow on them, though they both take a lot of outdoor shots. I digress, but I bicker at Jane and her obviously liberal ways, who are accused of racism by her neighbor, and I like the bald guy and his craziness office female comedy lead. Not necessarily the best comedy ever, but for a guy who says he can watch them alone, that says something. If I was with my wife, she would really enjoy it, since it's sex in the office and stuff that could be a good comedy for couples. 7 out of 10.
