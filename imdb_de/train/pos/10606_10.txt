I just watched this movie and found it very enjoyable. It's a quiet little movie that does not overwhelm you with special effects or "big" performances. It simply takes you into the lives of people who live in a small hamlet in the backwoods of North Carolina. <br /> <br /> Henry Thomas performs well as Raymond Toker, a young loner who sees a baby exposed in the forest. Toker's search for the baby's parents takes him on a journey that will have a lasting effect on his life. David Srathairn plays Truman Lester, a slimy Conman with ulterior motives. And David plays the bad guy perfectly. <br /> <br /> There is a lot more to this film than it seems at first glance. Shot on location in North Carolina and worth a visit with a wonderful soundtrack of traditional music.
