I saw this kung fu movie when I was a kid, and I thought it was so cool! Now I'm 26 years old and my friend has it on DVD !!! <br /> <br /> We got a beer case and saw this classic! It has NOT lost its original kung fu coolness! If you're a fan of kung fu / karate movies, this is a must ... the DVD is available. I think this movie is also called "Pick Your Poison". <br /> <br /> Check it out soon!
