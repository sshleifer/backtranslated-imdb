The film by director John Ford and writer Lamar Trotti from 1939 tells a fictitious story about young lawyer Abraham Lincoln, his trial (literally) and his suffering. It's a sentimental movie, reasonably well done but barely breathtaking. The casting of Henry Fonda as Lincoln seems to be a mistake, because while the actor had the right sad qualities for the role, he is even too much for Honest Abe, who was known to be homey, with several inches of make-up and a false nose beautiful. It's a good try by Fonda, who is nothing if not sincere, but his abuse throws off the entire movie. The side cast is excellent and includes Alice Brady, Ward Bond and Donald Meek. But Ford is too reverent in his treatment of Lincoln, who is shown to be shy of a saint, and in the final scene, the film goes far beyond the borders.
