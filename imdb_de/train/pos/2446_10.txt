Carmen was there from the beginning. She was one of the best figures. Why did you let go of her ?! The show is not like it was before. It is even worse. <br /> <br /> The best episodes were with Carmen in them. You can not replace anyone from the beginning! This is like South Park without Kyle or a breeze without Chucky! That is not right! The niece who replaced her is just, oh! Dreadful. She does not fit into the plot at all. She was one of the main characters, and the niece can not replace her. She was a great actress. Much better than the niece. Get them back or you'll lose a lot of viewers.
