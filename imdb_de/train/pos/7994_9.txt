I really liked this movie. it's dark, it's not bullet-dadging that makes car chase deafening your brain action movie. Many backgrounds and motivations of the characters are quite vague and let the viewer come to his own conclusions. It's nice to see a movie in which the director allows the viewer to make his own opinion. <br /> <br /> In the end, motivated by love or revenge or desire for remorse - he does what he feels "right". "Will God ever forgive us for what we did?" - It is not a question mortal men can answer - so he does what he believes he does, what he can do, what he was trained to do. Denzel Washington is a great actor - honestly I can not imagine a bad movie he did - and he has a great side-line. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone.
