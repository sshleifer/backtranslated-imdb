This review is dedicated to the late Keith Moon and John Entwistle. <br /> <br /> The original drum and the bass. <br /> <br /> There seems to be very little early recording when there's something going on these days. It's more than getting used to it, nowadays it's usually a different kind of who's a spoof , a shadow of their (much) better years. To be honest, none of them has to prove anything to anyone, he has earned his respect and overtime. <br /> <br /> This concert material is one of the best for me. Mastering an audience of over 400,000 listeners requires skill, charisma, wit and a lot of damn good music. <br /> <br /> We all know the other acts on the bill, The Doors (their last) show weeks before Jim Morrison died), Moody Blues, Hendrix, Taste, Free and many more. The point was that whoever was there, The Who, to whom the majority had come. This show took place a year after the Great Hippie Festival of the 1960s; Lumberyard. The movie and the record were released and also had the biggest work of The Who, Tommy. The ever-hungry onlookers wanted a taste to experience their own unique event, knowing "Grove and Love" knowing it was their own. It took the best of what Rock'n Roll accused the hungry crowd. At two o'clock in the morning, at the end of August 1970, the M.C. Announced: "Ladies and Gentlemen, a small rock'n'roll band from Shepherd's Bush London," OO. "John Entwistle's body suit is in black leather, with the outline of a human skeleton from head to toe on the front, Roger in his traditional stage outfit with long tassels and long, flowing hair, Keith in a white T-shirt and jeans, while Pete had his white suit and Doc Martins he preferred to wear. <br /> <br /> The Who They have never stopped their run on High Energy Rock for more than two hours and their and other great tracks like Young Man Blues, Shaking 'All Over and then, as queued, Keith Baiting listed the crowd, "Shut up, it's one bleeding opera "with Tommy, the rock opera The crowd went wild That's what they heard, and the Who did not disappoint directly into the overture and never came to the last note of" Tommy, can you hear me? "Amazing. <br /> <br /> E Capturing a scale of this magnitude at a climax at a festival that was to be the last of its kind in the world was a fantastic piece of cinematic history. <br /> <br /> The English DVD comes only in a soundtrack of English / Linear PCM Stereo, as in the States, I think you can get them at least 5.1, "Check local press for details ??" OK. <br /> <br /> The duration of the DVD is 85 minutes without extras, which is a disappointment. Yes, for a piece of rock and festival history, this DVD would take you on a nostalgic journey right after pressing Play for some of the best Who concert recordings they should be, Live, Raw and in your Face! <br /> <br /> I would have given this DVD ten if it had not been for lack of 5.1, and some extras would have been nice. <br /> <br /> Thanks to Roger, Pete, John and Keith
