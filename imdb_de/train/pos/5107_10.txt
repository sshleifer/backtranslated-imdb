What an overlooked 80s soundtrack. I can imagine that John Travolta sang some of the songs, but when he saw the movie, he seemed to embody everything that was the cheese of the 80s. Movies relying on mechanical bulls, bartenders and immature relationships were clearly in style. The best part was his lousy Texan accent. Compare that to Friday Night Lights. I suggest seeing Cocktail and Stir Crazy to really immerse in the movie. As a side note Made in America with Ted Danson and Whoopie Goldberg is an amazingly bad movie. I was so shocked when I realized that I had never seen it before. A weird film of this genre would have to include Cadilac Man with Robin Williams. Just keep in mind that all these big stars have played big roles in these CHEESY movies. Tom Cruise, Richard Pryor, Robin Williams and John Travolta
