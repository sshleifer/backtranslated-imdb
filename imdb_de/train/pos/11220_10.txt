Goal for the top! Gunbuster is one of those anime series that was written about classics. I absolutely loved this series and until today it is my favorite anime. It was not Gainax's first animated product, but it was her first OVA series. <br /> <br /> Especially as a parody of the sports drama Aim For The Ace (Ace O Nerae!) From the 70s steam as a serious drama towards the end of Episode 2, when Noriko Takaya witnessed the death of her father, who joined the first encounter of humanity with the insect race with which humanity is at war was killed. Due to the death of her father, Noriko wants to become a fighter pilot. But her lack of self-confidence sometimes gets in the way and she wavers. Her friend Kazumi Amano even has doubts that Noriko was selected as a pilot. Noriko coach Koichiro Ota, however, has confidence in her. And he has made it a personal mission to see that she manages to become a pilot because he was a survivor of the battle in which Noriko's father was killed. Other characters include the Russian Jung-Freud fighter pilot who is to serve with squadron Noriko and Kazumi, Smith Toren, a love interest for Noriko, who is killed together on their first mission, and Kimiko Higuchi, Noriko's childhood friend. Kimiko's involvement is also of interest as Kimiko lives in space on Earth during her absence to lead a normal life. And due to the time dilation, Kimiko usually ages on Earth, while Noriko is the same age as when she left school. Noriko is about 18 years old by the end of the series, while Kimiko is in her mid 50s. All in all, this is an excellent anime series that can be seen if you are a fan of a giant robot Mecha and Gainax animation. If you like other shows by Hideaki Anno or are a fan of Haruhiko Mikimoto's artwork then give this show a try. It will grow on you.
