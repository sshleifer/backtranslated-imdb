Sayonara was released in December 1957 and received 8 Oscar nominations. He won 4 victories. Red Buttons won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor in his role as pilot Joe Kelly, who falls in love with a Japanese woman during the Korean War in Kobe. Oscar nominated for Best Actor, Marlon Brando plays Major Lloyd Gruver, a flying ass from the Korean War to Japan, who resolutely supports the military opposition to the marriage between American troops and Japanese women and unsuccessfully tries to marry his friend Joe Kelly , Ironically, Marlon Brando's character soon finds his own love in a woman of Japanese descent. This film highlights the prejudices and cultural differences of this time. Filmed in beautiful colors and with stunning backgrounds, I found this film worthwhile for these effects alone. Good movie, give me more ... GimmeClassics
