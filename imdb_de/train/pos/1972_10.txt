I do not understand your objections to this film. It's a taut, exciting extension of the character created in Basic Instinct. The only part of the story that is least unrealistic is the fact that the character of Sharon Stone is still alive at this late date and is not in jail. SPOILER ALERT: As the movie progresses, we're presented with three theories about what's going on: 1) Sharon Stone's character kills all these people because she's crazy (Risk Addicted); 2) The crooked Policeman of David Thewlis kills these people to determine the character of Sharon Stone. 3) David Morrissey's analyst kills these people for revenge. What excites most people about the film seems to be that none of these theories are ever declared "real" history. (Although the analyst is in a mental health care facility to kill the policeman, the only killing that occurs on screen.) <br /> <br /> I think this is a brilliant plot in the sense of 2001, A Space Odyssey. "WHAT CARE, WHAT IS REAL?" The blonde is really crazy, the cop is really crooked, and the analyst wants revenge. "Importantly, the interaction between these and other characters in the story is as complicated as anyone in the real world Reality is more complicated than a movie, get over it!
