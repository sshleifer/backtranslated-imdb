*** 1/2 Pierce Brosnan, Greg Kinnear, Hope Davis, Adam Scott and Philip Baker Hall. Director: Richard Shepard. <br /> <br /> Brosnan is a well-worded story and movie in a movie role outside of his "Bond" films. After 2004 "After the sunset", his latest role brings laughter and a great time. As it were, a professional hit man, Julian Noble, who had a job in Mexico City, met his very close opposite the highly strained businessman Danny Wright (Kinnear, possibly one of his best roles), who also did business. The two on screen duo produce a weirdly charged uprising and do not bring the laughter. Davis in one of her best roles since "American Splendor" delivers another charming and witty performance. One of the most beautiful and best films of the year. My final rating 9/10
