until HBO started rerunning this month. I remember that in 1991 I laughed aloud in the theater and now in my living room again. If I see it going, I have to watch it. It's just not a question. This is so much more entertaining for me than other, more popular parodies like Airplane! (which I really like, by the way). Cathy Moriarty steals the show in my opinion. Quotes like "Sudden Speech! The last symptoms of brain fever! It could blow any moment!" put me over the edge And Whoopie Goldberg has not been so funny since 'Jumpin' Jack Flash '. Kevin Klein, Sally Field and Robert Downey Jr. are all performing as expected. I gave away 9 out of 10 stars first, but then I realized that for the kind of movie it should be, there's nothing I could change or improve. So it's 10. I have to get that on DVD, that's all that goes with it.
