Good Times was a groundbreaking comedy about the first nuclear black family to live in the Chicago projects. Whether you live in inner cities, ghettos, suburbs or in the countryside, this show is still a treasure you can see when a family is just a family and not a show about a poor black family. But they do not dwell. They find humor and have strong family values ​​and morals. Despite the behind-the-scenes story, this show was worth it to stay in the air, unless I did not like them killing my father, and I agreed with Esther Rolle, who was fighting hard to keep the family together. Despite all the battles behind the scenes, Good Times was a family show. We all loved JJ's dynamite and his antics. We saw Janet Jackson's penny grow up a bit. This show was groundbreaking to show desperation in terms of drugs, gang and alcoholism. Without preaching, the Evans have always tried to do the right thing instead of doing something wrong to leave the ghetto.
