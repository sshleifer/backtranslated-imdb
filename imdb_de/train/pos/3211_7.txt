This movie is fine if you like mindless action, crazy acting and a very small action! The special effects are decent, considering that this film was by the director of "Event Horizon". The costumes are like something out of a crazy Max movie. None of the soldiers talk, so others say what to do. It eventually becomes a big shoot'em-up movie with explosions. Personally, I liked Russell better in "Tango and Cash," "Escape from New York," and "Executive Decision." This movie has to leave your thoughts on the door to make a sci-fi movie straight away !!
