The fourth of five Westerns Anthony Mann has made with James Stewart concerns a hard-nosed cattleman named Jeff Webster taking a cattle ride from Wyoming to Alaska via Seattle. He meets in Seattle with his partners Ben Tatum (Walter Brennan) and Rube Morris (Jay C. Flippen), whom he has sent in advance to prepare the boat trip to the north. <br /> <br /> But first, he has to deal with calm path people, chugging captains on the riverboats, and the charm of Coy, the manipulative Ronda Castle (Ruth Roman), who thinks Jeff is a valuable ally in the future. Therefore, she hides him on the boat while the captain searches for the former (and justified) killing of a trail hand. Jeff also has the misfortune of bumping into the rundown judge Gannon (John McIntire), who heads the city of Skagway, Alaska. Gannon locks in Jeff for hanging around town with his cattle. He punishes Jeff for owning his cattle, and Jeff has to eat only crows for the time being. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, Jeff agrees to drive from Ronda to Dawson to deliver supplies. But this is just a trick, so Jeff, Ben and Rube can slip back into Skagway and steal their cattle. Of course, Judge Gannon learns about it and is just behind it, but is delayed by Jeff with a rifle while Ben runs the cattle across the Canadian border outside of Gannon's range. After avoiding an avalanche and another shooting, some of the other Skagway men eventually arrive in Dawson, where Jeff sells his cattle to the highest bidder, which happens to be Ronda, who then promptly builds a new playhouse in Dawson. Jeff then takes his money and buys a claim and looks for gold. <br /> <br /> But then Judge Gannon comes to Dawson to attend the gold action up there, telling Jeff that he's a bit bored with Skagway and wants to try his luck at Klondike himself. In addition, some hired gunmen are brought along and some of the other miner's claims are forcibly stolen. Jeff and Ben now feel like it's time to break free while the gears are running well, and Rube has to defend himself as the most ineffective sheriff against Gannon and his gang. <br /> <br /> They're just looking for a way out You're being attacked by Gannon's men because Ben made the mistake of opening his big mouth. Ben is killed and Jeff is badly wounded, but that does not save Judge Gannon from his current due. The end of the nocturnal shootout in muddy Dawson Street takes care of that. First, Jeff kills two of Gannon's best shooters (Jack Elam and Robert Wilkie). When Ronda comes out to warn Jeff that Gannon tries to slip behind him, Gannon shoots her in the back and she dies right in Jeff's arms. Then Jeff kills Gannon while hiding under a wooden sidewalk. Revenge has spoken. <br /> <br /> This is another brutal western, with THE NAKED SPUR and THE MAN FROM LARAMY at the top. I do not understand why the Universal DVD uses pan-and-scan printing instead of widescreen printing used by TCM. You'll miss half of Alberta's glorious cinematography by William Daniels. So if you like well-written westerns of the '50s, this is an A-list holder. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10
