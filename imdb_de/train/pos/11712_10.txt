This is such a great movie "Call Me Anna" because it shows how a person has suffered for so long without knowing what was going on with it. Patty Duke's publicizing and telling her story is an inspiration to those who suffer from the disease. I have great respect for her as a person. The only thing I do not like is that I can not record it on tape. I tried to search for it, but to no avail. Does anyone know how to get it?
