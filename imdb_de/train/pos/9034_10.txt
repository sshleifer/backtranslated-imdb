This movie was absolutely BRILLIANT !! Every performance in this film is excellent, especially Jake Gyllenhaal and Chris Cooper. It looks like Mr. Gyllenhaal will have a HUGE movie career, if that's all. I thought Joe Johnston was a weird choice as a director, as he's usually associated with big budget blockbusters (Jumanji, Honey I, the kids shrunk down). He pulls out of every scene with pure class. My favorite scene was where Homer goes down the Mineshaft and looks up into the sky, like all his dreams were, it was beautiful. Joe Johnston should direct more of these brilliant, theatrically-driven films as well as Big Budget Blockbuster Faire, which is also excellent. KUDOS !! to all who are involved in this masterpiece!
