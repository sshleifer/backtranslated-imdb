Johnny Dangerously falls entirely in the category of hits or failures with his exaggerated gags and the total absence of a full script or story that makes sense in any case. But that's the point, right? <br /> <br /> The cast is sympathetic; Michael Keaton is a great comic performer before he took himself too seriously over the years. Griffin Dunne, Peter Boyle, Joe Piscopo, Marilu Henner and Danny DeVito all perform with enthusiasm and are at least laughed at by me. But the complete scene robber here is Richard Dimitri (who catches the word "Iceholes" in film history) as a gangster who makes it best to assassinate the English language. I associate many childhood memories with this movie as I have seen it many times and maybe I tend to enjoy it more than many others. At least Johnny Dangerously is a completely innocent gangster movie parody that even conveys some well-intentioned messages about the dangers of smoking (and sex). <br /> <br /> I like it, but it's hard to recommend. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10.
