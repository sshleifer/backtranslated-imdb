David Aames is a handsome guy who lives in New York City. When his "sleeping partner" Julie Gianni becomes very jealous after David has fallen for the Spanish beauty Sofia, she gets David in her car and tells him that he is the only guy she loves and wants to be with , She decides to commit suicide with David in the car by driving off a bridge. David survives the crash, but has a disfigured face. He is then charged with murdering Julie. The thing is, David does not know what's real or not because he has those weird dreams (most of which are nightmares) and flashbacks, some of which just do not make sense to him. Everything will soon come back to him as he begins to find out the truth. <br /> <br /> Well, there's an All Star cast here, including Tom Cruise, Penelope Cruz, Cameron Diaz, Kurt Russell, Jason Lee, and Noah Taylor, all of whom are performing well in the movie. In the movie, they all have different things about their characters, such as happiness, sadness, anger, etc., really well cared for. There is also a cameo film by the brilliant Steven Spielberg. <br /> <br /> Vanilla Sky is a well made, interesting and original movie that will tell you a lot about when it's done. It's not just a thriller, it's a real psychological thriller. The trailer for the movie is really good, but the movie is so different from what it might be. It was very well directed and there were also some really great scenes here. All in all, a pleasing movie that you should really pay attention to. They are sure that lately they have made many "Are they dead, if not who is dead" movies.
