This is a quirky little movie, and I have to admit that there are also some strange spectacles. <br /> <br /> He follows the adventures of a young man who decides to become a famous Las Vegas illusionist, and partly to follow his dream, partly about the dreams of others and the struggles of the showbiz. I found the film charming, and it has a moment or two of real magic that makes it all worthwhile. Alan Arkin is fantastic as a magician who has never been, and his mentoring from Max makes for a fun and touching relationship. <br /> <br /> Not likely for everyone, but if you like movies about the trip then I think you'll like them here.
