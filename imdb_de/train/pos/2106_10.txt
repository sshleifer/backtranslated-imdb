Would these more romantic comedies be performed as skillfully as these? I never thought that would be something commonplace, as the simple sale of a music box lets me gasp excitedly. Margaret Sullavan is a wonderful saleswoman, and she and James Stewart always made the best of it. This movie shows what I think is Frank Morgan's best performance, and with "The Wizard of Oz" and "Tortilla Flat" under the belt that says a lot. The way he finds a Christmas dinner partner makes me dizzy with joy. Director Ernst Lubitsch might have thought "Trouble In Paradise" his darling, but this one must certainly be considered a triumph. With some of the funniest dialogues American films of the 30s have to offer.
