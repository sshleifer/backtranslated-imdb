Prix ​​de Beauté was about to make the transition from silence to sound, which came a little later in Europe than in Hollywood. Originally designed as a mute, it was released with a dubbed soundtrack in France. A French actress spoke Louise Brooks' lines, but was published as silence in Italy and other parts of Europe. I was fortunate enough to see the impeccable restoration of an Italian mute print at the Cinemaeca di Bologna at the Tribeca Film Festival. I have not seen the talkie version yet, but I think you can assume that the silent version is much more satisfying, as dubbing is bad after all reports (Louise Brooks clearly speaks English, so her lips can not). In addition, the film is completely done in silent style, with few titles and little dialogue needs. The Prix de Beauté tells its story visually with exciting, imaginative camera work. The opening is immediately kinetic, with fast-paced scenes of city life and swimmers splashing on a public beach. Throughout the film, visual details, clothing, machinery, decoration and symbolic images such as a cage bird, a pile of tattered photographs and a diamond bracelet are emphasized. This is a silent movie technique at its peak. <br /> <br /> Louise Brooks is of course responsible for saving the movie from the dark. Seeing this just makes it even more heartbreaking to think that this was her last major role. Brilliantly beautiful, it dominates the film with its charisma and gives an absolutely natural yet highly charged performance. Her role here, more than in the Pabst films she is best known for, is a woman with whom we can fully understand and empathize. She plays Lucienne Garnier, a typist with an obsessed fiancé, who aspires to more life and secretly participates in a beauty contest, with immediate success. She is torn between the excitement of her glamorous new life and her love for the man who insists she give up or lose everything. All characters are nuanced. The fiancé inspires pity and is not just a thug: he loves Lucienne, but is a limited man who can not manage to have a life outside of him or attract the attention of other men. Even the "other man" in the story is not the slender thug we hold him first, though his intentions may be just as possessive as those of his fiancée. <br /> <br /> ********** **************** WARNING: SPOILERS DOWN ************* **** <br /> <br /> The film has many beautiful settings pieces, including Lucienne's triumph in the "Miss Europe" contest, portrayed by the strange reactions of various viewers who eventually beat the heroine with flowers; her misery as a housewife, peeling potatoes, while the pendulum of the cuckoo clock passes the time; a nightmarish journey to an amusement park (in the dumb version, this happens late in the movie, after her marriage), when Lucienne, smashed amidst the low-lives and depressed by the machos of her husband's husband, decides she does not can go on with her present existence; and most of all, the final scene in the projection room, where she sees her test on the talkie screen. Louise Brooks may have never looked more beautiful than here, the projector's beam flickering on her alabaster profile, her shoulders wrapped in white fur, her face glittering under the black helmet as she sings on the screen. The double setting of her exquisite corpse and her still-living image on the canvas is particularly poignant: Louise Brooks' image, like that of Lucienne, is immortal despite her frustratingly canceled film career.
