A Pentagon science team seems to have perfected a serum that causes invisibility, but if the lead boffin tries it on himself, he can not reverse the process. He is frustrated and full of power and becomes psychotic in the classic HG Wells tradition. <br /> <br /> This is a terribly horrible Invisible Man story, which is delivered with satisfaction by the always tasty Verhoeven and Bacon. Loontoon maniac. Like many of Verhoeven's works, it has an overwhelming, uninhibited feel for the comic book adventure of Boy's Own (the secret underground lab where the scientists work is simply wonderful), combined with the most horrible and degraded images (women in their lives) Underwear is attacked and attacked by an invisible enemy, animals beaten to death, literally gallons of blood, and wholesale slaughter in the last two roles). While the story does not bring an old twist to an old idea, the CG special effects of Scott E. Anderson are strikingly brilliant as we literally see veins and arteries, cardiovascular systems, muscles, tissues, bones and flesh out of nowhere. In particular, a sequence in which the team brings back a gorilla from the invisible state, and the scene in which Bacon drowns Devane in a pool, are absolutely stunning in detail and in the artistic invention of the effects. The film also has a great soundtrack by Jerry Goldsmith and classic horror film photography by Jost Vacano. The young cast is pretty much overshadowed by the film's technical heritage, but both Shue and Dickens are impressive. This is a great, bad movie.
