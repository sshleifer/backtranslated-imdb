For a movie supposedly about sex and leather, he has no right to be as cute as he is. The story of Bettie Page, a good Christian girl from the South whose mother did not get married until she got married, moved to New York, and became the most successful pin-up of her age, is powered by an outstanding performance by Gretchen Moll. Your site can not fully reconcile the images it shoots (which no one is allowed to touch, it's all funny and respectful) with the pornography and alleged abuses their images have on the world around them. > Page has always been an inspiration to any burlesque artist, not only because she had a character to die for, but because she had provided each image with an innocent sense of humor that was uniquely sexy and simple at the same time. More like this movie. Film decors in black and white and gorgeous technicolor, it's a nice way to spend a few hours.
