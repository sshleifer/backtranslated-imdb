The Last Hard Men finds James Coburn for an outlaw commiting a long prison sentence from a chain gang. He and his friends are going to the Mexican border from prison and for security reasons. No, they do not, because Coburn has a revenge action. To kill the peace officer who brought him and killed his wife. <br /> <br /> This peace officer is Charlton Heston, who is now retired and knows what Coburn is aiming for. As he explains to his daughter Barbara Hershey, Coburn was housed in a hut and involved in a Waco-like argument. His Indian was killed in a hail of bullets. It is not something he is proud of; she was a collapse victim in a search. <br /> <br /> If we do not regret Coburn, let us know what a bad man he really is. Heston is his usual brave hero, but the acting honors in The Last Hard Men go to James Coburn. He blows everyone else off the screen when it's on. <br /> <br /> Coburn has the bright idea to make sure Heston follows him by kidnapping Hershey and taking her to an Indian reservation where the white authorities can not touch him. He knows that Heston has to do it personally. Coburn's gang includes Morgan Paull, Thalmus Rasulala, John Quade, Larry Wilcox and Jorge Rivero. Heston has Chris Mitchum, who is his son-in-law. The last hard men are a wicked and brutal western. Andrew McLaglen has directed and I think it was a project originally planned for Sam Peckinpaugh. It certainly shows a great impact on the liberal use of slow motion to increase violence. There is a lot of that. <br /> <br /> For a bit of Peckinpaugh lite, The Last Hard Men is your movie.
