Those who know the dEUS group know the singer Tom Barman. He staged this movie as if he were making music, it's a mix of everything. This is a comedy, though mostly absurd and cynical, a drama, none of the main characters has a happy life, to say the least, and it does not really have a goal. <br /> <br /> The film opens on a Friday morning in Antwerp, Belgium, with scenes of several people, some of them have nothing in common, but they will come in contact during the day and night. There are several main characters: a teacher who writes books that nobody reads, a young researcher with a morbid taste for death, and his sister, a gallery owner, two young men who are constantly in contact with the law, a man who works in a cinema two young women. There is a man in the movie who has something to do with wind. All characters have their problems, with their family or friends, or just with life itself. <br /> <br /> The film is set in Antwerp and shows some nice shots of the city and the harbor. The events of the day are not easy to explain, I recommend watching the movie, there is just too much to tell. But I can say that Barman has a great use of the camera and uses a lot of music (mostly dance music, not really rock music) to create a mood, especially the party is filled with excellent music. <br /> <br /> This film is an experience in itself, it will not make you wiser, maybe just that you have to live it and not waste it or have false moral truths. <br /> <br /> In short, see, it's definitely worth it!
