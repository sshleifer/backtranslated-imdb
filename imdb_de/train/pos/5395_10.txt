I remember how I saw this movie. I really wanted to know what happened next. I was amazed at how much they could fit into an 8-minute short. We start in a schoolyard. , Two friends discuss skipping the lesson. Child B says to child A "Let's not go to class today." And Kid A refuses, saying they could miss something really important. Child B skips and child A goes to class. When he arrives, the teacher informs him that today they will learn the only and most important lesson they will ever learn. They would learn the meaning of life. She gives everyone a booklet, and when she gets A she runs out and tells the boy next to him to share it. Well, the child will not divide, so child A is looking for the teacher. When he finally finds her, he gets a shocking revelation of what the true meaning of life is. I suggest that everyone look so short. It only takes 8 minutes of your life, but the message is so important that it can help you a lifetime.
