I admit that I do not like Oliver so much! as a young child - it is long and the story is a bit slow due to the many musical numbers. As a teenager, I discovered that the fun of this movie is the experience itself. Do not consider it an adaptation of Oliver Twist, but a celebration of classical history. The adaptation is casual at best, but if you look at a musical, you are not there for the story. <br /> <br /> The music is at the heart of this film and an overwhelming majority of it is excellent and very catchy. Most or all casts were involved in the stage version of the musical, which is reflected in their performances - and I think that's a plus. The performances are all in a more "staged" style of acting, typical of much older films, and they are very entertaining. The exception is the kid who plays Oliver, whose job it was to look pretty and keep out of the real artists. <br /> <br /> Fagin and the Dodger are the true stars of this movie. Oliver Reed also does a fantastic job of upholding a daunting on-screen presence as threatening Bill Sykes. Even Sykes dog Bullseye performs well. <br /> <br /> This movie is not for everyone. People who hate musicals will despise it, as will those who take musicals too seriously. Breaking fake historical details or mistaking the exaggerated stage design for bad action will ruin everyone's enjoyment. Just sit back and enjoy the conversation - it's much better to remember that a musical is a fantasy loosely organized around the book, not a strict adaptation.
