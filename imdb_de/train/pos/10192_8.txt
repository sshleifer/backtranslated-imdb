This is the Who most powerful. Although before the masterpiece Who's Next, the anthems like Baba O'reily and Wont would deliver Fooled Again. This film shows the group in the transition from mod rockers to one of the biggest live bands of the 70s. <br /> <br /> Daltrey shows what frontman is all about. Entwistle is as ever. <br /> <br /> Moon is great, watch the ongoing conversation with the drum tech and see how he plays "side saddle" while replacing a bass drum head! He enjoys fun sometimes! <br /> <br /> Considering they went on stage at 2am, no one slept in the crowd! <br /> <br /> There are not many bands that could produce such a tight set these days, and it's hard to imagine one of today's bands producing a concert that will be just as enjoyable in 36 years.
