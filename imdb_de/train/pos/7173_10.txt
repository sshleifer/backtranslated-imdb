I just watched the documentary "Fog City Mavericks" on the Starz cable TV network. It is without doubt one of my most beautiful visual experiences I have ever seen! It features the artists and creative talents of the San Francisco Bay area, who are responsible for the best films of all time. In addition to the well-known artists, there are also segments with Irvin Kershner, Caleb Deschanel and a segment about Pixar Animation Studios. I hope it appears on DVD - this is a must for any collection about cinematic history and brilliant filmmaking. If you are even interested in movies and the people who create them, you will not be disappointed.
