SOMETHING YOU HAVE TO SEEN! I saw WHIPPED at a press screening and it was weird. We talk without cease laughing. It makes SOMETHING ABOUT MARY like a meandering drama. Amanda Peet screams star quality with her winning combination of beauty, intellect and serious acting. Director Peter Cohen has made an innovative film showing the raw interior of male egos in the urban dating world. For all his comedy Whipped succeeds with his intelligence. Which is so rare for a first director, especially in a romantic comedy. He is a great talent. Judah Domke, Brian Van Holt, Jonathan Abrahams and Zorie Barber complete the cast with depth and very strong performances, as befits smooth ladies of the lady. You have to see these guys go to work and get caught up in Peet's web. Check out the trailer on whipped.com, it's worth the 3 minute download.
