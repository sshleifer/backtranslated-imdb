A fantastic, unusual film by Audiard, Read My Lips, is a mushy, lonesome thriller. Perfect for the gloriously gruesome vibe of Vincent Cassel, it offers a wonderfully understated performance by Emanuelle Devos. Devos is a recurrent feature of Audiard, as is KArin Viard for Jean-Pierre Jeunet: unconventionally beautiful (she is considered unattractive in this film), versatile and able to create a subordinate profile. <br /> <This is almost the definition of her role as Carla, an angry office dog mocked by her colleagues who exploit her deafness. However, she finds an Ami d'Exploitation, if you like it in Cassel's ex-cheater Paul. Everyone takes advantage of the other's unconventional talents (theft and lip reading) to fight through their respective situations and form an unconventionally romantic rapprochement. Devos / Audiard master Carlas deafness and the concomitant, discarded inner world with a discreet, stylish flair. In this film (2001), Audiard already has a clear approach to excitement, action and investment within its framework with a truly visceral experience that will become a great success nine years later - A Prophet. 10.7
