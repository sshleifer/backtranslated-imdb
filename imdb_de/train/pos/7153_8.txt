My wife is a teacher and she is very familiar with the story after reading it in several of her classes. But it never sounded so interesting to me and I bought the DVD, assuming that this would be a movie that would not really be in my lane and I thought I was right. It starts a bit slow and I have to admit that I was a bit bored - but curious enough to stick with it. Boy, I'm glad I did that because it was a very satisfying and rewarding movie. I would certainly take a look again! <br /> <br /> The casting was very good. Since I did not read the book, I can not guarantee accuracy, but I have to say that Jon Voight was really adorable. They liked the characters you wanted to like, hated those you hated, and laughed at those who were supposed to be funny. I can see how some people do not like this movie. It is at times boring, especially at the beginning. All flashbacks can distract (though they are essential to the story). But when the story comes together, in your opinion, you're being piqued for your patience. All in all, I think this is a very good movie - 8/10. <br /> <br />
