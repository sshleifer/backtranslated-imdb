What percentage of films will a person visit these days to wonder what happened to their eight to ten dollars? ANSWER: TOO MANY! This movie is not like that. It's a story about real people, sometimes a combination of likeable and unlikely qualities. <br /> <br /> Disadvantage: <br /> <br /> Not enough character development and some action lines that turn in the wind. <br /> <br /> Upside: <br /> <br /> Forces viewers to think about the choices they have made for good or ill in their own lives. <br /> <br /> Well traded by: Scott Cohen, Judd Hirsch, Susan Floyd, Ato Essandoh and Elliot Korte. <br /> <br /> Includes good, good-natured humor.
