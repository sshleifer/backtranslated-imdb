In the wonderful world of horror, diamonds are made from time to time, and you are completely surprised by the sheer brilliance. This is no less than a diamond !! This is a movie full of eeriness, ghastly expectation and gloomy atmosphere, and I think it's safe to say one of my favorite horror movies of all time! And, of course, it probably contains the simplest, scariest sequence in the entire history of horror! Every time I see the movie and get to the point where you know it's bound to happen, I try to remember exactly when I get scared out of my mind, but it keeps coming back; I never really understand it and find myself as terrorized as the first time !! Well, it has to be said to frighten an exhausted horror fan, that's nothing short of pure perfection. Unlike the Americans, the British know their subtleties, they are proud of the art of acting, they do not need special effects to convey atmosphere, they rely on the power of the potent story and the horror (in this case). of suggestion and expectation. Every single element is impeccable, from the set pieces, the acting, the story to the menacing atmosphere. Pauline Moran could certainly make the devil whimper, that's for sure !! As a final remark, if for some insane reason you do not like this piece of madness, you honestly do not know what horror is about, and honestly, you do not deserve to know it. Many Thanks!
