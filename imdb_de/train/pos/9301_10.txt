I saw this very dark comedy originally around 2000 on cable TV. What a surprise and joy! Everyone is secretly armed in this film! Dreyfuss plays the "mental" Don (remember the New York Don, who was supposed to be schizophrenic - art imitates life or vice versa?). Diane Lane and Ellen Barkin are at their best and NOT to play! This proves that beauty and toughness fit together! Then there's the awesome "Bullshit" scene between Barkin and Jeff Goldblum (Rita and Mickey), in which they play the world "bullshit" verbally. This movie is both subtle and bald. It can be a very quiet movie during all the shooting. And you have the opportunity to see several actors in their last or near-completion roles. Joey Bishop Richard Pryor Henry Silva. It is not a movie for everyone. But if you like a movie that has a lot of pun and moves without blowing everything in sight, this is the movie for you. Roger Ebert drops this movie. He is wrong. THAT is a fine, fine film! Maybe not for Ebert. I think it's a 10 because it's done so well and how funny the script can be, though it's not really a comedy movie. I like it so much that I bought it on DVD because it does not show much on cable TV. Now everything is mine!
