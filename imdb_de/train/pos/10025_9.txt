This is a unique twist on two genres that have ever been seen. The giant monster movie genre with the living mummy movie genre. This unique blend creates a unique and compelling story. The performers are outstanding, including TOM BOSLEY, who has never been to a horror movie to my knowledge. The impact is impressive and the idea of ​​a huge mummy full of little mummies is a cool one. My only complaint, I just wish we could see more of the giant mummy, but I think they did a great job. The dialogue, the characters and the story were perfect. The acting was wonderful. This must be the best movie coming out of the sci-fi channel. You've heard, the best movie from the sci-fi channel. I give the fallen 9 out of 10 points.
