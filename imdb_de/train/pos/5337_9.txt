It could be the remake of Autumn's Tale in 1987 after eleven years, as director Mabel Cheung claimed. Mabel uses rock music as a medium in this film to express her personal attitude to life, in which love, longing and the resulting frustration play a crucial role. Rock music may not be the best way to convey the profound feeling, and it is not inappropriate to use it, as the life of rock musicians underground is bitterly more intense than an ordinary one. The director focuses more on depicting subtle affection and the ultimate vanity of life than rock music. The love between father and son, lovers and friends is mediated by the good performance tender and touching. Mabel does not try to beautify rock musicians as an artist, instead she tries to reproduce a true life on the screen by working on this project for years and collecting information in the subterranean pubs in Beijing. <br /> <br /> Daniel has shown the best performance in all films made so far. His innate discouragement and restraint fit perfectly with the movie's blue mood.
