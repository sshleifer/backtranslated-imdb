I did not expect to be influenced by this movie showing a family like the one you expect next door. They are ordinary people of flesh and blood, unlike the typical Hollywood dishes. You are facing an all too common problem - a debilitating disease. But history captures the heart with a powerful lesson. Casting, script, direction and drama flow together with a wave that draws the viewer deep into the story. Give this movie your full attention and its message will really inspire you.
