I have watched Dick Tracy for years and as a result, it has become an important part of my life - it has been with me throughout my childhood and I've seen it many times. As an adult, it's still a very good movie - dark, satirical and incredibly misunderstood. The only thing that can be said is the Oscar nomination that Pacino received - apart from the fact that she rarely gets discussed and did not fuss when she came out. <br /> <br /> Pacino is over the top, but good as he obviously enjoys it. Beatty is great because Dick Tracy and behind the camera capture the atmosphere of a comic from Noir movie better than any other movie I've ever seen. A look at a scene from the movie is breathtaking. The lighting, the velvety overtones and the smog / smoke create a great effect. <br /> <br /> There are some really funny cameos, including one by Dustin Hoffman as "Mumbles", and I do not think there are any shortcomings in acting - even the obligatory kid character is far better as expected. <br /> <br /> Overall a really good movie that has been misunderstood since its release over the years and is unbelievably underestimated at just 5.7 - 10 average on IMDb. Critics' critiques are very positive (see RottenTomatoes.com), and once the movie has been seen again, it's not hard to understand why - this is a perfect example of capturing the essence of a comic, from style to eccentricity , <Br /> <br /> Highly recommended. 4.5 / 5 stars.
