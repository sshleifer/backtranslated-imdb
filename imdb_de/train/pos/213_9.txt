Walter Matthau and George Burns were a famous variety comedy, Lewis and Clark, who have not spoken for over 10 years. Burns retired and Matthau took it personally and has since held a grudge. This is the premise of this hilarious Neil-Simon game that was made into a movie. What makes it so good is of course Matthau and Burns in their best shape, and the material is funnier than anything you can find today. Richard Benjamin shines as nephew and agent of Matthau. There are even old clips with real golden-era stars to get you into the groove of the movie, and character character Fritz Feld starts off with a "pop." Rosetta LaNoire, who started out in the thirties with Orson Welles in the theater and later became Grandma on "Family Matters", is great in a small role. <br /> <br /> The only problem I had (and maybe me too) I'm too picky and / or serious) is how Matthau Burns deals when they meet for the first time. Granted, he'd inherited a lot of grudges over the years, but some of the things he does are considered rude or simply bad manners that have been taken out of context. Besides, I'm used to seeing Matthau like that in other movies, but not George Burns. And Matthew's roar tends to get a little old. All in all, if you need a thoroughly funny movie to help and forget about your problems, enter "The Sunshine Boys". You raise your mood and make you think of a simpler time and way of life. <br /> <br /> Benjamin: "You have to move her." <br /> <br /> Matthau: "Wait, wait, I think you have to push it."
