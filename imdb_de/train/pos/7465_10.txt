Attention: Contains spoilers. <br /> <br /> Open your eyes <br /> <br /> If you have not seen this movie before and plan to do so, just stop reading and take my word for it. You have to see this movie. I've seen it four times so far and have still not decided what exactly happened in the movie. That's all I'm going to say because if you have not seen this movie yet, stop reading it. <br /> <br /> If you are still reading then I will ask you some questions and maybe somebody I can remember well my 11th grade English teacher. His name was Mr. Krisak. For me, he was wise beyond his years, and he always had this awkward way of teaching you things that you might not be so interested in. If we did not like Shakespeare, he made the story a modern romance with modern language so that we can understand it. Our classroom was never a room, it was a cottage and we sat in our spare time by the lake and read a book. This was his own indelible way of bringing something into our sponge-like mind. <br /> <br /> I begin this account of Vanilla Sky with a description of this brilliant man, because he once gave us a job that is firmly anchored in my head, like the phone number of a long-lost best friend and after Looking at The Matrix finally made sense to me. If I did not know better, I would have thought that the Wachowski brothers really were just a pseudonym for my teacher, Mr. Krisak. If we give them the benefit of the doubt, we assume that it was not him. However, this was the first time that this assignment was more than intangible. <br /> <br /> He had asked us to prove to him and ourselves that it really was. Show me how to recognize that you are real. This made the class pronounce all the usual ideas that you can imagine. Everything from pain to touch, to the feeling of loss, to hunger, has been passed on to our teacher to prove to him that we are real. After each scenario we gave him, he returned with the only answer that would leave us speechless. <br /> <br /> "What if you are nothing but someone else's dream?" <br /> <br /> What if you were someone else's dream? What a damn question that is. This was a question / scenario asked about 15 years ago of the astronomical use of the Internet and the rapid evolution of computers. How could it look like then? But if you look at today's technology, ask yourself what you thought about another participant's dream. <br /> <br /> In another brilliant but surreal movie this year, David Lynch's Mulholland drive explored similar areas. But Vanilla Sky goes deeper than any other movie could hope for. In short, this is a movie that literally (if you let it happen) will blow your mind of all the possibilities that surround you. <br /> <br /> Open your eyes. <br /> <br /> Tom Cruise plays David Aames, a young, hot man, righteous, full of publishers and owner of several magazines. He has inherited this from his father, and although he has talent and business acumen, the seven dwarfs, his board of directors, think he is a rich guy born with a silver spoon in his mouth. They feel that they have done nothing to earn the pinnacle of success that everyone believes is to go to them. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the film we meet one of David's beautiful toys called Julie Gianni, played by Cameron Diaz with wicked but bombastic perfection. David and Julie are playing a good game, both claiming that they are only there to benefit each other and are not in the least interested in a monogamous, committed relationship. This is the kind of relationship that corresponds to David's other curves he had in the sexual flowering of his life. And although both speak a good game, we can say that only one really tells the truth. <br /> <br /> Next we meet Brian Shelby, played by Kevin Smith's good buddy Jason Lee. Brian writes a book that David will release, but they are also very good friends. Of these, David has very little in his life and one senses early in the movie a real caring. Brian has a famous line that he tells David over and over again. And that is "the sweet is not so sweet without the bitterness." He goes on to tell him that one day he will find true love and not just this part-time-lover status, which he seems to exert on all the floozies who live one or two nights in his bed. <br /> <br /> For David's huge birthday fight (so big that Steven Spielberg wishes him a happy birthday), Brian performs his date Sofia Sorrano, who of course was played by actress Penelope Cruz with the best performance of the year becomes . This is a bash of just inviting and initially, David and Sofia seem to be intrigued. And in typical David fashion, even though his best friend is there, he flirts with Sofia. To complicate matters, Julie appears uninvited and begins to spy on David. David spends the night with Sofia, but they just talk and draw cartoons of each other. There is no handkerchief. The next day, when David leaves Sofia's apartment, he is greeted by Julie, who offers him a ride and from there ....... well, I think we all saw the commercials. <br /> <br /> That's all I'm going to say about the plot, because the movie seduces us with the reality and the hazy perception. We're introduced to a person played by Kurt Russell and a few other dodgy characters who all play a role in this maze like the haze. There is a subtext of death and possible panaceas such as panacea, which may or may not create the possibility of eternal life. This is just one of the fascinating possibilities the movie offers, but it does not end there. <br /> <br /> As many movies today seem to bloom, this movie has a secret. Sixth Sense might have started this madness, but look further and you may thank Angel Heart for starting the madness. Regardless of how it came about, Vanilla Sky has its own creep cancer. And what makes this movie so much fun is that the movie gives you a lot of obvious clues along the way, but not enough to give you an apodictic solution to the struggle with the truths and lies you just went through. I have seen this movie four times and every time I want to see if there is anything else I can pick up, something that I can understand. Being able to work in the theater, to open up to new possibilities is something rare in a movie. All so-called "best pictures of the year" were good, but nothing special. They lack substance. A beautiful mind was fascinating, but shallow. The Royal Tenenbaums was interesting, but uneven. Vanilla Sky is a rarity because it's a movie that makes you crave for more and still guarantees your satisfaction because the movie and those who made it take care of it. I know that the film received mixed reviews, but I think those who do not like it do not quite understand it. <br /> <br /> That's how filmmaking should be. That's what a movie should do to you. It should make you feel something. Most of the other films this year were just empty spaces. This is not. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10 The best movie of the year. I would love to have this nominated for the best picture, and I would love to see Cruz as Best Actress, Diaz for Best Support, Cruise for Best Actor, and Jason Mewes should be a shoe for Best Supporting Actor. Cameron Crowe should also be there. None of this is allowed to happen and that is a shame. This is a movie you should not miss. <br /> <br /> And finally, I'm sure Mr. Krisak would like this movie, and maybe it's the movie that could answer his question. Can you prove that you are real? Or are we just a fantasy of someone? Are we artificially transplanted for the confusion of another? This is a movie that raises more questions than answers. And I'm sure that's good for him. <br /> <br /> Open your eyes
