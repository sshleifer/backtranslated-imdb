This is a well-done documentary about the exciting world of Indy Car Racing. The photography is just outstanding. The scene in which Mario Andretti drives the old racing roadster along the old maple-lined New England road, which is blown aside by the car's speed, is unbelievable. On the small screen, the movie loses some of its beauty, but if you like pushing cars to their limits, you should watch this movie.
