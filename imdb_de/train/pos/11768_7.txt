This movie surprised me well. From the box I got the impression that it was an action thriller, but it was too funny to be a thriller, even if it was a bit more exciting. <br /> <br /> There are many beautiful one-liners and funny situations in this movie and James Belushi was born to make Bill Manucci, he does a great job. The rest of the cast is not bad either and especially Timothy Dalton is a treat. <br /> <br /> The story can sometimes get confusing when new characters appear during the movie. Things get more complicated because nobody rarely tells the truth about things. If you are not careful, things will end up being a bit chaotic, but I really liked it. <br /> <br /> Louis Morneau is not very well known, but he has done a very good job with this and I never got really impatient when I saw the movie. <br /> <br /> Made menu is worth it.
