This movie is the most iconic movie on metal there is. Premise: A child receives the last shot of his favorite artist Sammy Curr, who recently died in a hotel fire. He plays it backwards and calls him back from the dead to revenge himself in the name of Heavy Metal on those crazy jocks that torment him. Any fan of True Metal will enjoy this movie, and if you're a Metal head tormented by Jocks, play a Sammy Curr album backwards and watch it with your fist in the air, your head, and the volume at 11 o'clock !
