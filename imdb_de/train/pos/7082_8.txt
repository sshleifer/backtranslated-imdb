First, we know that Bruce Willis is a good actor, but if you take the majority of his films, you'll find that the characters have those moments in which they're the same. His character in this film goes far beyond each individual ... and counts. The story begins in the (not so distant) future in which a man is sent back to the past to find the source of a virus that has swept most of humanity from the face of the earth. The story seems to go in the direction of SF, but I think it's closer to a drama because of the slow rhythm of the story. Movies are usually faster and slower in some places and more in the end than at the beginning, but as you watch this movie, you become aware of this constant rhythm of the story and reveal facts that neither accelerate nor slow down , It's the same speed that flows gently and pretty well. That does not mean that the end does not get on your nerves because it's pretty good. As for the direction, it is prefect. Movies as such are easily destroyed by bad direction, but this has gotten a lot better. So if you are preparing for a sci-fi movie or action, you will miss it. B There should be more films like this.
