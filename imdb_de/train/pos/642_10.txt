I was dragged to this movie about four years ago by a friend of my French actress. <br /> <br /> The first half hour I sat in my uncomfortable seat at the New Beverly Theater in Hollywood and hated this movie. I hate myself and even hate the French actress. And then ... I do not know what happened, but I got involved in the movie in a way I had not had in years. And this despite the fact that one of the projectors broke down and they had to do each conversion by hand. I was in the theater for almost four hours, but it was worth it. <br /> <br /> I think great movies involve you in a world, make you part of it, and then get you talking to your friends over coffee or a drink. This movie did that. It was one of the best movie experiences I have ever had. <br /> <br /> <br />
