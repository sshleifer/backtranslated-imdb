This movie is really good. The action, which works like a puzzle, forces the viewer to think and guess what will happen next. Such a trick brings many surprises with it and really lets a viewer hope for a puzzle solution. Battle scenes are very good. There are many different styles of fighting (although one of the styles was a bit unreal for me, but that's just my opinion), and it's a fascinating show. The only thing that can be irritating is the look of the actors. A bit too feminine (at least for me). Hong Kong was always good at kung fu movies, especially in the 70s and 80s, so "Five Venoms" (or other versions) are a good choice.
