First of all, the female lead is too beautiful to miss. Now, actress Wang Zu Xian, who starred in the movie Xiao Qian, is 42 years old and old enough. It's always good to look through these glory days when you see old-school Hong Kong productions like these. <br /> <br /> The film is one of the most influential titles of the 1980s. The art decorations and other aesthetic facets are all fascinating. The movie had a fantastic black humor. It feels like a horror movie, but in the end it's not scary, it's just fun. <br /> <br /> I had the experience translating the second script of "A Chinese Ghotst Story" and I thought the script was a decent writing. However, when I saw the movie, I was initially disappointed that I saw it differently from the script, on a smaller scale and with more comic roles. However, it turned out to be more entertaining in terms of entertainment. <br /> <br /> If you've seen the Lord of the Rings, you'll notice the similarities in this movie with LOTR. The highlight is like a mirror by Miranda Otto, who is fighting with the Ring Witch. It's definitely a laugh. Bravo!
