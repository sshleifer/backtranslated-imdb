Pleasant movie, though I think he had the potential to get even better if he had more depth. It's a mystery in the middle of the movie to know why Elly is such a hermit. When we finally get an explanation that goes back to her childhood, there is still not much detail. Maybe they had flashbacks or something. <br /> <br /> Still, it's still a good movie I would watch again. 7/10 <br /> <br />
