Steven Speilberg's adaptation of the popular novel by Alice Walkers is not without controversy. When the first released members of the black community criticized their treatment of black men, others asked why a white man was shooting this movie about black women. <br /> <br /> This is the story of a young black woman named Celie. Growing up in rural America after the turn of the century. She has two children from her abusive father, who are ripped from their arms at birth. Her only consolation in her miserable life comes from her sister. <br /> <br /> Celie (later played by newcomer Whoopie Goldberg) is married to an abusive husband (Danny Glover). The husband is humiliated by the sister, and she is quickly removed from Celie's life. <br /> <br /> The story is often heartbreaking, because Celie hopes that one day she can be reunited with her sister and children. All her life she meets a number of characters, including Sophia, a tough woman for her stepson, and Shug, a loud and voluptuous saloon singer who teaches her a love or two about love. <br /> <br /> Speilberg's direction can be seen everywhere in this picture, which offers brilliant cinematography and some outstanding performances. I dare you to watch this movie and not to be moved! The movie The Color Purple manages to capture the essence of a complicated story. The film tends to minimize the lesbian aspects as well as African history, both of which are so alive in the book, but remains faithful to the theme, letting Alice Walker's voice shine through. <br /> <br /> I could not react to the controversy surrounding this movie. However, it is enough to say that this is one of the few films that I can watch again and again and that has left a lasting impression on me. <br /> <br />
