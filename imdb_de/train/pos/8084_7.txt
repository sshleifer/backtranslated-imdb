<br /> <br /> I just bought this movie on DVD and recently watched it for the first time. I have been a fan of Tolkien's work for about 4 years since leaving high school. I did not grow up with this movie ... maybe my mother kept it from me. It's definitely not for kids. Not that it's graphically bad, but the topics would exceed most of the 10-year-old's minds. Overall, the entertainment was excellent, considering that this was done in 1978/1979. I thought the story followed the book rather loosely. But it bothers me that not only did Bashki have about 40 minutes left to finish the king's return. That would have made him the ultimate movie. The abrupt end disturbed me, and when I heard the return of the king sucking, I was even more disturbed. Too bad that it was not a great animated film. It would have gotten a higher voice from me. I give him a 7. I can only hope that Peter Jackson will live up to the books with the new live action LOTR.
