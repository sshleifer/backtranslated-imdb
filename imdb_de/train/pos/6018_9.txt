I saw this in the early 1970s (when I was 16), and despite the long slow build-up, meetings, riots, and so on, as the desert began, everyone got connected, and I loved it. (Still, it has aged very well.) At that time, I was in a seemingly tiny minority. All criticisms seemed to focus on the lack of action and narrative. Fortunately, I am no longer in such a minority. <br /> <br /> It cleverly shows (in a somewhat prophetic way) the political fragmentation, restlessness, confrontation, brutal oppression, commercialization and delusion that lies ahead of it, and I'm glad of it.
