Stargate SG-1 is a kind of spin-off from the movie "Stargate" from 1994. I am so glad that you have decided to expand the topic further. The show starts from the first episode, a retired Jack O'Neill has to go through the gate once more to see his old companion dr. To meet Daniel Jackson. In the first two episodes, we encounter Samantha Carter, a very intelligent person who does not let anyone run over them, and there's Teal'c, a calm, compassionate warrior who defies his false god and joins the team. <br /> <br /> The bad guys are called Gouald. They are parasites that can fit into the brain to control it and do evil deeds. Any Gouald who has tremendous power is often considered the "system master". The warriors behind the Gouald are called Jaffa. They harbor the parasitic gouald in their bodies until the gouald can be put into a person's brain. Through the episodes we mostly see SG-1, the exploration team, consisting of Jack / Daniel / Teal'c / and Sam, go through the wormhole, which immediately transports them to other planets (this device is called Stargate), and they encounter new cultures or bad guys. Some episodes are on-world, which means that they will not even go through the Stargate in a row and deal with more pressing issues on Earth. <br /> <br /> Over the years you start to see a decline in the SG -1 team as tight-knit and more characteristic storylines. This in turn means more on-world episodes, which is understandable. <br /> <br /> My Rating: 8.75 / 10 ---- Although most of these shows are good, there are some examples of storylines over the last few years that have not always gotten to grips with and put less emphasis on goal driving. But still, first-class science fiction!
