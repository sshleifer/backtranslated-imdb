A great concept, a great cast and what a pity that there was not more time to refine the story. I loved it and wanted more. Dench, Dukakis and Laine, now there are some REAL women! Nevertheless, Dench and her character alone had enough substance to carry the script in some of the less important moments. I have it on tape and will continue to watch it, hoping that in the end there will be an indication that there will be a sequel. <br /> <br /> Top drawer! - No question! - No argument! <br /> <br />
