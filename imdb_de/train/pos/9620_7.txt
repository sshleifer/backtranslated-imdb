There are now so many "Hollywood" films that are not only torture, but also have no effect on a person's life. Granted, films do not always have to have a deep meaning, but it's nice to know that there are still filmmakers who want to tell "human" stories. I will not reveal the premise of this brilliant movie, but the script is certainly one of the more complex and memorable I've ever seen in my life, and I'm also a 32-year-old movie fan! Bug ranks number ten on my list of favorites, including: On the waterfront, Sunset Boulevard and Black Narcissus, just to name a few. This "moving" movie should also be one of your favorites - if you have a heart!
