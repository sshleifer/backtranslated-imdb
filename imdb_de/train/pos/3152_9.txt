This show was absolutely great, and I'm always looking forward to watching it. All the characters were funny and fantastic in their own way, each episode brought nonstop laughter, and it was totally entertaining and different from many other shows. Everyone was absolutely mad and breathtakingly funny that you could just love this show. There were a few surefire episodes, but this 70's show always managed to create a sympathetic atmosphere that just was not that. It was one of the best shows ever to be broadcast, and I'll always watch this show if I can, because she never gets old, never becomes unsteady and never becomes uninteresting.
