Every time I see this movie, I'm more impressed with the overall production. I've come to the conclusion that this is the best romantic comedy ever made. Everyone involved is perfect. Screenplay, drama, direction, sets and editing. While James Stewart can always count on a good performance and the side squad is great, Margaret Sullavan reveals what an underrated actress she was. Her tragic personal life expresses her qualities as a performer where comedic skills are not easily achieved. Lubitsch managed to achieve the best, and he obviously did his best. Pay attention to the number of scenes taken at once - breathtaking.
