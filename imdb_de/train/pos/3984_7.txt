As part of the celebrations for the release of Casino Royale, this film was featured with the new Bond in the lead role, by director Roger Michell (Notting Hill). I almost stopped it because I'm a bit boring, but I'm glad to stick with it. Basically, May (Anne Reid) is a single mother of Helen (Anna Wilson-Jones) who hardly sees anyone and has not had a boyfriend for years. Her daughter says she may want to marry her new boyfriend Darren (Daniel Craig, of course). After May and Darren have only known each other for a few days, they have a secret affair. And at her age of 30 years and the new Bond ?! Anyway, they obviously want to keep it a secret, but May regrets it and wonders if Helen will find out. If she does that, Darren gets less trouble than May. In fact, Helen asks her permission to beat her. With Peter Vaughan as Toots, Danira Govich as Au Pair, Harry Michell as Harry, Rosie Michell as Rosie and Johnny English's Oliver Ford Davies as Bruce. Very well!
