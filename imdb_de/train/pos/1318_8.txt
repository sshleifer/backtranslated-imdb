I felt compelled to write a review for Space Cobra as it received a good rating of 7.3 stars, but only some of the reviews at the time of writing were particularly positive. A strange situation and hopefully my positive review will point people to this old and most forgotten anime movie. The Space Cobra is the funky story of a smuggler and villain who engages with the three sisters of an ancient and dead planet and a wicked force seeking to harness the planet's powers. This is an old movie and the animation shows, but what lacks modern sophistication makes up for it with a wealth of charm. Space Cobra is very focused on a Western audience and very easy to see. There are few references to a particular Japanese culture and great anime novices to watch and enjoy. Space Cobra itself is funny and sympathetic. I can not say how much of that is due to the English Dub or the creator's intentions, but this is one of the few Japanese comedy characters that I find really funny. The style is very sixty Barbarellish with a fantastic soundtrack by Yello. The style is colorful and imaginative and there are constant measures to drive the story forward. The strangest aspect of this film is how it begins as a comedy and ends with a dramatic touch. I can not imagine another anime or general movie that has done so seamlessly and convincingly. You barely notice it's happening, but it's made so subtle and seems completely natural. You can really feel that the characters have gone on a journey and their lives have been changed through the experience. Check if you can.
