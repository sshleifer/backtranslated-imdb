Sure, the Titanic was a good movie, the first time you see it, but you should really see it a second time, and your opinion on the movie is definitely going to change. When you see the movie for the first time, you'll see the underlying love story and think, Oh, how romantic. The second time (and I'm not the only one who thinks that) it's just annoying and you just sit there and watch the movie and think: When will this d ** n ship sink ??? And even that is not so impressive when you see it several times. The acting in this film is not bad, but definitely not great. Was I happy that DiCaprio did not win an Oscar for this movie? I mean, who does he think, Anthony Hopkins or Denzel Washington? He does half a good movie and does not make a movie for less than $ 20 million. And everyone is surprised that there are hardly any films. But in my eyes enough for the worst character of the film. Kate Winslet's performance was wonderful. I also think that the director is very talented in putting together a film of such magnitude. There is a lesson to be learned about this film: there are too many love stories, as filmmakers should not try to give any film a seedy romance !!! Of the possible 100%, I give this movie only 71%.
