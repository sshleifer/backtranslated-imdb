I liked these films. It's another Yash Raj movie that you know will look good on screen. All characters are always nice or very nice, with one exception that you know will eventually turn into a beautiful movie; s have only one or no parent. Think back to all these films. MPK Suman did not have a mother, HMAPK Salman did not have any parents, and the last rule is that you see Alock Nath crying 90% ... <br /> <br /> The movie is good too. At first a little slow, but entertaining. There is almost no comedy, but you have to smile often enough. The little child (Hero's nephew) is well placed and delivers very good deposits. The actress is very pretty, but she is not shy in real life. There are no big, happy families living in a big house in this movie, which was a good idea and allowed me to differentiate the movie from other movies. At the end of the movie many women will cry. There is no strong message from this movie, but it is a good clock. If you are married (arranged marriage), the movie reminds you of what you have gone through. And if you are not, it will inform you and scare you ... <br /> <br /> Overall a very good looking movie. No big acts or twists, but a very gentle movie, very similar to the Bollywood classic.
