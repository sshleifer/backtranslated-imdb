If you have appreciation for character and dialogue as well as a sense of American cultural history, you will find much exciting material in this film. It was probably originally a play and that's why it's a dialogue, but I can not stress enough how these symbols, of which we have only a shallow understanding, are really complex and wonderful characters. Film is better than any college class To tell you how to create a character-driven story. <br /> <br />
