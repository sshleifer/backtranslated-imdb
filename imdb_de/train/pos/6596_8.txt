Brazilian films are often judged more positively than they deserve. Incredibly, Contra Todos (Against Everybody) (original title, which the producers refused: God Against Everybody) received on this website a very low GPA (grade point average). It seems to be rejected unhindered by female viewers. Actually, it's not that brutal. I mean, graphic violence. His brutality is inherent in being accused of being a lump, I mean my citizens, who indeed own high-tech equipment that carry out cold murder orders on behalf of Grana Graúda. Is this a postmodern man? Is his / her only concern a fast, almost impersonal, ultra-permissive situation in the midst of satisfying meals? The picture is probably the best Brazilian film of the year 2004. His glossy cut style à la Godard, his curious contrasts to the soundtrack, his more than effective overall cast and above all his original narration with subtle, non-chronological hidden dots that only appear in the epilogue come, earn at least an 8 mark.
