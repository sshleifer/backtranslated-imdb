I'm stunned by the negative comments I've read, and I can only assume that the people making such comments were less honest. This is the most moving and real portrayal of Joseph Smith I have ever seen. It was good to the point that sometimes I forgot that I saw a movie. It brought Joseph's life into the life of hardship, good-natured optimism, enduring faith in people and God, and ultimate sacrifice in such a way that, honestly, I remained dumbfounded and dumb with reverence. If anyone of ANY Christian religion can see this movie without being touched in a positive way - I would say it is a reflection of the individual and not the movie. I give the movie a "10" and encourage honest souls to look at it. At the very least, it is a most heartfelt portrayal of the man who gave everything he had for what he believed in ... In a world where values ​​and beliefs are ridiculed, this film is a lasting reminder of the nature of People we accept no matter what religious belief we are in. Ann Pruitt-
