This movie scared the shit out of me! I have to admit that I spent most of the movie looking through my fingers, but what I saw was really scary. I shouted two or three times during the show. <br /> <br /> Filmmaking, my favorite aspects were the sound and the photography. The sound was especially good and the surroundings were really beautiful. I read somewhere that it is a strange couple who made it. For some reason, that's even stranger to me. <br /> <br /> If you enjoy the jumps and jitters of creepy movies, then this one is for you! Very exciting and a great movie to rent with a bunch of friends who love to watch movies curling up on a sofa and screaming like little girls!
