I would not hesitate to put this adaptation of 'Death Trap' in a top 5 list of the best adaptations from film to film of all time: Caine and Reeves (an underrated actor who never really had the chance, more than muddy romances Dyan Cannon - whom I usually do not like - is perfect in a role that exploits her anger as an actress. <br /> <br /> I am I am not sure if comparisons of "Deathtrap" with "Sleuth" - another brilliant adaption from stage to screen with Michael Caine - are valid or even fair.Yes, the two stories have a lot in common, but "Sleuth" is just as much about that Class warfare as a joke, and the house in "Sleuth" is at least as much of a character in the movie as the two actors - the house does not really have an equivalent in "Deathtrap." And "Deathtrap" is not so much a mind-fight, it is a s punk Vignette about how people are not damn good (and are never as smart as they think) and deserve everything they get. I'm just saying that both films are great examples of the genre and worth your time and money. This is after all America. You do not have to vote! <br /> <br /> I will not reveal the plot's twists, but I do not think it's important anyway. I watched the DVD eight or nine times in a dozen years and still enjoyed the chemistry and the timing, as well as the terrifying moments when things "all become pear-shaped". It's all done so well that the ride becomes more important than the actual destination. <br /> <br /> Anyone who likes black-hearted comedy and excitement in Hitchcock-style filmmaking will likely enjoy "Deathtrap" immensely.
