I love the Doodlebops. My son has been watching her for over a year. Last year we were at the Doodlebops concert and yesterday at a concert (Connecticut). He loves her. The Doodlebops do not teach alphabet or numbers, but who cares? do you mean that seriously? The television should not teach your children about numbers or the alphabet. the parents should. Get over it. The Doodlebops can actually sing. Deedee has a beautiful voice and at the concert you can tell all 3 that they have nice vocals and NOT lips. Imagine, they dance, jump around and sing SILENCE. They have talent, the kids love them, I even enjoy watching the show. This show is by far the best show for kids on TV. AND a rock band for kids. How great is that? Why do people say that Chad (Rooney) is gay? where did you hear that from? Whether he is or not, he is great! Leave him in peace. It's not as if he or anyone else promotes homosexuality for our children!
