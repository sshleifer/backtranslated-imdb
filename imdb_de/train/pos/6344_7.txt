I am overwhelmed by the work of Jim Carrey. I always get this movie in my head. The Grinch likes Martha May, Cindy Lou (who is very annoying, her sweet innocence) trying to get the Grinch in the Christmas spirit, the Grinch's childhood (very funny!) And besides, the faint obvious ending with Christmas isn 'anything round for gifts. I have to say, I felt stupid going out of the theater with a bunch of babies and toddlers laughing and so on, but this movie was a good adaptation of Dr. Seuss' short film and IS for all ages.
