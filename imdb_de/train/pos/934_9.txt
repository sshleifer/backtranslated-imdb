In our household, we're huge fans of A Christmas Carol and watch virtually every version of the game at Christmas, including the old Reginald Owen from 1938 and the modern Patrick Stewart from 1999. Our general favorite is the 1951 Black & White classic, because Alastair Sim IS Ebeneezer Scrooge and his conversion are the best. However, this version of 1984 has its own unique merits and makes a beautiful and entertaining story that, in general, remains true to Dickens's novel. (See my comments on the other films, if interested) <br /> <br /> First of all, George C. Scott can definitely seem pretty scrap and does not make a bad scrooge. I love his sideburns, his long coat and hat. He cuts the finest fashion figure of the game and is a pretty handsome gentleman. But sometimes it seems that Scott just enjoys his role as a Scrooge a little too much and does not take her as seriously as he should! <br /> <br /> This rendering has the best overall Christmas atmosphere, hopeful and optimistic. Somehow you know that this story will have a happy ending. It was filmed in the city of Shrewsbury, England, and somehow seems very British. The film has a wonderful score with wonderful, lively music that plays in all appropriate parts of the story. Sometimes I could almost toast the chestnuts and sing the pudding in the copper! <br /> <br /> Marley's terrified mind (with his wonderful jaw-drop scene) and the three Spirits are all convincing. Christmas Past is a beautiful ethereal lady, a Christmas present, wonderfully gigantic and cozy, Christmas Yet To Come as always veiled and unaware. However, I found Scrooge's nephew Fred, a bit quiet and grim, not nearly as funny and welcoming as he should be. I like the nephew's wife, whom they called Janet, with her beautiful, dazzling hairdo. Instead of the Blinds Bluff, they've put together a game called Similes for the nephew's Christmas party. This is a nice little thing, because Scrooge is in the very spirit of the matter. <br /> <br /> The Cratchits and their somewhat meager (albeit much appreciated) Christmas dinner is well presented, with Bob (David Warner) being appropriately sympathetic and boring in his kilometer-long scarves. Mrs. Cratchit is charmingly portrayed by Susannah York, who also starred in the wonderful Jane Eyre 1970 adaptation of George C. Scott. Above all, this version undoubtedly has the best Tiny Tim, not just a charming and lovable little waif, but sickly. With these dark circles under the eyes, the fragile little thing barely seems to survive the hour! <br /> <br /> This is a delightful and heartwarming version of the holiday classic. With its festive atmosphere you will surely be put into the spirit of the season.
