One of the smarter serial killer movies of recent history. ZODIAC KILLER offers imaginative insight into the background and story of one of the most famous serial killers. The filmmakers get unexpectedly good insights into the pathology of this mysterious killer, and anyone who remembers Zodiac will be thrilled. Others will want to know more about this enigmatic criminal. Unlike many serial killers, Zodiac was not crazy, but very methodical and a self-actor. The director plays here the expectations of the viewer and pulls it through. The film is designed as a murder mystery or thriller in the "Cold Case" style. It's an intelligent investigative and procedural-style horror movie that will scare off Gore-Hounds in search of cheap thrills. <br /> <br /> Some people do not like a movie that is shot on video. This attitude is very old and provincial. It is a setting and view of films that places technical topics above the entertainment or artistic value. These settings are on the way out. ZODIAC KILLER is undoubtedly a low-budget movie, but more demanding audiences will look beyond and find a carefully crafted gem.
