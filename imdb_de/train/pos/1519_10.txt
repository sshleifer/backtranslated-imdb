Considering how cheesy these films are, you have to realize that they must have had fun making them. The film focuses on a house that strangely accommodates the one who lives there. The residents were: author Charles Hillyer (Denholm Elliott (with hair!)), Who is haunted by one of his own creations; Philip Grayson (Peter Cushing), who comes too close to a wax figure; John Reid (Christopher Lee), whose cuteness is apparently a facade; and actor Paul Henderson (Jon Pertwee), who is about to dive into the character a little too much. <br /> <br /> "The House That Dripped Blood" is indeed worth seeing (good duh, Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee). Besides being just neat, there could be a few undertones: it could challenge the question of real horror as opposed to the supposed horror. As in "The Shining", we might wonder if the house / hotel itself is reminiscent of past events. And if nothing else, Ingrid Pitt (as co-star of Paul) is HOT HOT HOT! At this time she also played in "Countess Dracula" and "The Vampire Lovers" (also with Peter Cushing). Maybe she remains - like Barbara Steele - known only as a cry queen, but my words: YOU IS A HOT SHRINE QUEEN! I would like to see Ingrid Pitt and Barbara Steele star in a role. <br /> <br /> I think the only strange scene is (so to speak) the scene in which Denholm Elliott wears a pink shirt and a fluffy jacket. You read that right. Which name is Denholm at all? Well. A very cool movie.
