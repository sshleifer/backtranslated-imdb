I stumbled over cables on this movie and was totally addicted. The story of a group of surfers riding on the big waves, waves that are immense, waves that make any rational man panic is one that manages to be spectacular and understand why people are living their lives with it spend hunting waves. There is nothing special about the film except that it brings together some very interesting people who fall in love with what they do and who makes them talk. Sure, there are scenes in which they surf, but what makes this movie so special is the people. Here are a few guys who are so excited about what they do that it passes to the viewers. Halfway through this movie, you also want to learn how to surf. Few documentary films have ever managed to satisfy their passion and the ability of the film to make us feel that this movie is going to be a great movie. Do you see it
