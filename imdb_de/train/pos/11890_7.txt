This is a pretty boring movie. Well shot with realistic performances, especially a very good one by Depardieu as Cad and Bad Boy with realistic locations and art-house connotations, it fails because the director takes up no position, attitude or critical commentary on the theme he has defined. As one of France's most respected and regular partners for films with Depardieu - I think they've made 7 together - Pialat is not involved. It seems to be a treatise on why women fall in love with the bad boy who gets hurt if they have a caring boyfriend and a kindhearted husband. Isabelle Hupert, who plays the Philanderer with a nonchalant distinction, offers opprobrium answers like "I do not know"; "I like his arms"; "I like the way he makes love" to her questioning husband, who tries to throw her out of the house, but paralyzes and thinks, because ... I suppose he loves her. He accepts and hopes for something? That one day she will wake up and come to her senses. Such things are not answered in Pialat's condescending docu-drama style with long speeches and even longer scenes that do not complement each other. I know the answers do not add up, but please comment. Jules et Jim, that's not the case. The last shot, which is as cold as the movie we've just seen, is heart and head ache that only leads to forgiveness.
