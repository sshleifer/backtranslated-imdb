I can not believe that people in this movie are looking for an act. This is Laural and Hardy. Make it easier. These two were a rebellion. Your comic genius is as funny today as it was 70 years ago. No dirty word from both mouths, and they could keep the audience in stitches. Her comedy was by no means refined. If you can not grin with a pillow, there's no reason to look at the things these guys did. It was an easier time, and people laughed at things that were fun without a plot. I think it takes a simple mind to enjoy this stuff, so I qualify. Two-man comedy teams do not charge, we're just too sophisticated ... Are not we lucky?
