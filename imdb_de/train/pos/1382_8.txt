Not everything is said in this excellent first contribution by Céline Sciamma. The friendship, the "adjusting", the first sexual feelings ... All this and much more is sublimated by the synchronized swimming scenes under water. All three girls in the film try to find and find express their personality in a very different way. It's a much less violent approach to understanding teenage years compared to "Thirteen," but a very rewarding journey. <br /> <br /> A must, and leave all American cinematographic biases at his door The soundtrack is by the way A +. <br /> <br /> Good Cinéma!
