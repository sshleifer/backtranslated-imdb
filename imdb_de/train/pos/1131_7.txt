This is a really funny movie. One of them can sit and watch mindlessly, as the plot becomes more and more twisted. always funnier. Sally Field, Teri Hatcher (on her day), Kevin Klein, Elisabeth Shue, Robert Downey, Jr. It's all these well-known, high-quality actors who pretend to be soap operas stars / producers. If you've ever seen a soap opera and thought "how on earth did you come up with this idea?", You LOVE this movie. I have seen it several times; And the more I appreciate the movie, the more I realize how good it really is. Do not expect Oscar quality. This is a funny entertaining movie, not some artistic attempt to find Man's Inner Man, and so on. Sit back, relax and laugh.
