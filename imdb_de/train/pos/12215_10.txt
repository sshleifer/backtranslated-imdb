I loved this movie from the opening sequence to the end. I found the director / actor style to address me / the audience directly, very appealing. <br /> <br /> What I found most exciting and refreshing about this film was the ignoring and challenge of gender and class stereotypes. The idiosyncrasies of the characters are presented as strengths, and the lack of judgment - and the acceptance of the characters among themselves and each other - allowed me to embrace them and draw me into their world. Without preaching and with intelligence and gentle and loving humor, this film has the power to open new possibilities for us and to provide hope for a world in which people see and accept themselves as unique and valuable individuals. I am looking forward to further offers from this creative and talented director.
