When this movie first came out in 1984, Prince was one of the hottest acts ever. Everyone wanted to see this movie, which was not much more than an expanded music video. Acting was pretty bad, but what can you expect from musicians playing for the first time on the big screen? Still, it was a very entertaining movie! Morris Day and Jerome Benton offer classic classics of all time, especially their version of "The Password", in which you think of Abbott & Costello, who plays their "who's on the first" baseball routine. those who went under a single name at that time offered some beautiful breasts, so they had covered the short nudity. Besides, she is very attractive. And of course, the album's soundtrack is one of the best princes ever recorded. Prince later had a Fallout with Warner Bros. and changed his name, but at this particular time in his career, he stood at the top of his game. <br /> <br /> This movie is not located in all areas. Great category, but it's pretty entertaining.
