Maybe I am too generous with the rating ... but I love this movie! I have seen it so many times, but every time I see it, I always fall in love with it. It's just a simple romantic comedy, in which nothing big or monumental happens. But I'm a great romantic and this movie * is * romantic. I love Meg Ryan and Tim Robbins and Walter Mathau is so funny. The scientists make me laugh so much ... I can definitely recommend this movie to anyone who has not seen it yet. It's such a clean, good movie - and that's so rare now! My 20-year-old brother also likes this movie, so it's not just a chick movie. ;-) I recommend it when you need to laugh or when you are just lonely and need to * watch * a romance if you can not attend it yourself. It is a good un!
