In all the comments he praised or condemned Dalton's performance, I found him excellent. He does not play Rochester as a spoiled, handsome, rich boy, but as a roguish, powerful man. I liked this version, although the shot on video was partly distracting and the scenes with Jane and St. John never really went well. I give an 8.
