There are few films or films that I consider to be favorites over the years. The Evangelienstra√üe was one of them. I saw this as a young girl and would like to have the opportunity to see it again. My favorite parts were the fact that <br /> <br /> 1 / Jesus was blond, <br /> <br /> 2 / the last supper was a huge meal, <br /> <br /> 3 / er liked to play with the kids, <br /> <br /> 4 / His death was for all people and for all time. <br /> <br /> The film was not theologically impeccable or high-quality spectacle, but it touched my heart at that time. Besides, I'm a Johnny Cash fan and it was a brave endeavor. If it ever comes out on DVD, I'll buy it for purely sentimental reasons.
