Without "mental anachronism," this film I want to find on DVD offers an extraordinary immersion in the vital and mental context of people's thinking about the "disappointment of the world." That there are thirty years, a director and a scriptwriter could put such an empathy to the test, and such a romantic truth to do the masterpiece makes me amazing. It would be necessary to be able to see and re-examine the film in order to grasp it better than the temporal and cultural distance, to lose the ability to be involved, analyze, and finally, such or such an example Since this thought, which in the secularized world is almost impossible to feel, contains certain keys to our behavior, only he can analyze future generations with sufficient relevance, if anybody knows where I have a numerical copy or get a VHS for me or a DVD? thanks in advance.
