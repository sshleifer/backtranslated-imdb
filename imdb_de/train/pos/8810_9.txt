I saw this movie for the first time when it aired a few years ago on the now-defunct Trio Channel, and I recently met it again on Sundance - without commercials. I was impressed for the first time and found it even more interesting on the second viewing. Yes, some of the segments are far from perfect - Amos Gitai's hysterical commentary stands out like a thumb - but overall, 11 09 01 is a complete success. Best of Show: Shohei Imamura's amazing closing segment, which contemporary critics like the fat-spirited Mick LaSalle have somehow misunderstood as an attack on "the terrorists", but now turns out to be a masterful anti-war polemic; Samira Makhmalbaf's opening piece that combines deep empathy for the victims of 9/11 with a forward-looking concern for the children of Afghanistan; and Idrissa Ouedraogo's amusing children's crusade for Osama Bin Laden - a hunt almost as serious and successful as that of the REAL Osama. The segment of Youssef Chahine is a noble, if unsuccessful, experiment that at least has the courage to remind audiences that Bin Laden and al'Qaeda are essentially American foreign policy and CIA creations, and although Sean Penn's character study Inappropriate, it is still a bittersweet piece of film. All in all, an indispensable consideration and a damned better sight than the reactionary World Trade Center by Oliver Stone.
