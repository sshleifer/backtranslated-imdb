I also loved this series when I was a kid. In 1952 I was 5 years old and my family always saw this show. My favorite character was that of Marion Lorne as a pretty stuttering, awkward and very lovable "auntie" person. I can still remember her "ubba bubba um um" comments as she would try to say something important. And when she came back and played Aunt Clara in Charmed, it was a great casting! <br /> <br /> It's the first time that I remember Walter Matthau, whose career I followed as a fan for many years. <br /> <br /> I have a question, if anyone can check: Was title or credits music of the "Swedish Rhapsody" by Hugo Alfven? Every time I hear it on my classic radio station here in Southern California, memories of Mr. Peepers' picture are taken with their backs to the camera. I'm not even sure if this picture is correct in my mind's eye.
