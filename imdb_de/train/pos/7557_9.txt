Gender Bender the Limerick: <br /> <br /> A man or a woman? Who knows? <br /> <br /> It turns out that "it" is both. <br /> <br /> Sleep in clay <br /> <br /> Then they all went away <br /> <br /> In one of their UFOs. <br /> <br /> Gender Bender is another great Season 1 episode. I enjoy this because it's the story that you're never really sure about what's going to happen next. It is completely original. The teaser is a lot of fun with the close-up of the eye and the reflection of the disco lights. I really have to learn my thumb-trick, which the genderbender hesitates. I like the atmosphere in the small village of Kindred and Mulder and Scully sneak around in the middle of the night. It is very exciting. This is actually one of my favorite episodes of the first season. I think what I like so much about him is how they turn out to be foreigners and leave crop circles behind. Many people see this as a non-mythological alien episode like "The Unnatural" or "Space", but I think this could easily be considered mythology-related. Maybe the genderbender was like the alien bounty hunter and could look like any other. Huh Whatever, I give the episode 9 out of 10 points.
