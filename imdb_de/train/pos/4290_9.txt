I think Charlotte Gainsbourg is one of the best artists in the world. I can not understand why some people say it is not. Boring....??? Maybe the one who said that she is bored because he / she is boring. She is a great actress and the movie was excellent. It has many wonderful ideas and very good performers. The direction was great. I show myself in the French environment with all the sophistication and scent, flowers, churches, problems, etc. If she goes to the sister's business, that's just unbelievable. Everything is great. We have a very good actress, wonderful for a long time. Alain Chabat and Bernadette Lafont are perfect. I like him more than in his next film LA SCIENCE DES RÃŠVES. And Eric Lartigau has done a very good job. <br /> <br /> Ana
