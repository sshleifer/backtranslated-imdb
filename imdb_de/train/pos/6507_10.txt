This series, which was probably produced at the best times following the events of World War II, is on a scale of values ​​far beyond a person's guess to criticize. <br /> <br /> The timing of World at War's production in 1974, about three decades after the events of the war, makes it possible to pinpoint events in a manner not colored by residual propaganda and bias. After thirty years, storytelling can be accompanied by an impressive and intriguing group of people involved, from some of the highest military and political figures to field soldiers, civilians and extermination camp survivors, to testify to the unimaginable inhumanity of which civilized people are capable are. Most of those interviewed already had enough time to reflect on their experiences, and in most cases they had enough time for propaganda and zeal that influenced them in the past, and were only remembered for what they saw and did what they have done. <br /> <br /> The information these survivors give is greatly enhanced by the attitude and expressiveness they display as they share their stories, and their stories are all the more powerful. Names like Ira Eaker, Adolph Galland, Louis Mountbatten, Albert Speer, Gertrude Junge (Hitler's personal secretary) ... the list is far too long to describe. <br /> <br /> Today, during the lifetime of the survivors of this enormous lesson on the hideous price of political ambition, young people who sing the same kind of militaristic and nationalistic warfare as in World War II live. The DVD series that we are discussing here should form the core of a compulsory historical subject in schools, that the lessons that were then bought at such terrible cost should not be wasted, but by those who did not experience it directly , should be taken to heart terrible price. <br /> <br /> I'm almost done with the 11-disc set after seeing most of the series when a local TV station broadcast it more than 10 years ago. It has not lost any of its meaning, in fact it has even become a wonderful chronicle of some of the darkest days of humanity. The highest possible rating does not seem worth it to be applied to this presentation. I think that the value of this series can not be counted.
