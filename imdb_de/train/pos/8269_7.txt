I've been fascinated by this movie for some time, partly because of the extremely high rating here on IMDb - an average of 9.0 with over 300 votes gives it the highest rating of all available silent movies! How did I hear about this movie before this site? Well, you can not always trust the reviews. This is actually a very good movie that has been well preserved when the rented VHS transfer is an indication - excellent behavior of those responsible, especially William Haines as Brown, and good location work in Cambridge with some good action footage in the climatic Harvard / Yale football game - but the story itself must have appeared in 1926 as a cruel chestnut. An obnoxious, selfish and charismatic guy goes to school and is put in his place, becoming a caring, self-sacrificing friend; I doubt that in 1926 people found much exciting in the final roles, the predictability factor is high. Nevertheless, it starts off very well and is certainly deserving to be remembered if it is not praised to heaven. Perhaps the previous 350 voters are mainly men from Harvard ... <br /> <br /> EDIT Now 600+ voters and the score has actually risen to 9.2! Seriously, folks, there are ballots here - I can not explain to anyone why this is a better movie than "Metropolis" or "The General"!
