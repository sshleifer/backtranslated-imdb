Bedknobs and Broomsticks is a fun fantasy adventure for kids. She plays with Angela Lansbury as an apprentice witch, who thwarts a Nazi invasion with the help of three evacuated children and a "Professor of Witchcraft". <br /> <br /> Brilliantly inventive and filled with laughter, this movie will delight children of all ages with great characters, exciting stories and catchy tunes. Lansbury is perfect as Eglantine, the not-so-perfect witch who takes the three kids on the adventure of a lifetime, and her three young co-stars (Cindy O'Callaghan, Roy Snart and Ian Weighill) are just as impressive as the Cockney Crooks helping in the fight against the evil Hun. <br /> <br /> The special effects are a bit dated, but let's face it, kids do not care about these things as long as they're entertained. And they will be entertained. With some impressive scenes that brilliantly mix live action and animation, and more than a hundred Harry Potters movie magic, it would be hard not to enjoy this wonderful piece of cinematic escapism. In Portobello Road, only a rather elongated musical number plays the perfection of the film, but enjoying so much with other things makes it easy to forgive. <br /> <br /> And every movie with British TV Legend Bruce Forsyth as 'Flash' Harry Style spiv guarantees me a good rating.
