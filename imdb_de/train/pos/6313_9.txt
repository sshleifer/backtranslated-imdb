Cosimo (Luis Guzm√°n) is told in prison of a perfect robbery. Since he is behind bars and can not do it himself, he has to leave it to his girlfriend Rosalind (Patricia Clarkson). There are soon five men organizing the crime - five men with very little brain capacity. The brothers Anthony and Joe Russo are the directors of Welcome to Collinwood (2002). It's a thriller comedy, which is often very funny. You can not help but laugh when things go awry with these guys performers who play these characters. William H.Macy plays Riley.Isaiah Washington is Leon.Sam Rockwell is Pero.Michael Jeter is Toto.Andy Davoli is Basil.Gabrielle Union plays his love interest Michelle.Jennifer Esposito plays Pero's love interest Carmela.George Clooney (also producer) plays Jerzy, the tattooed guy in a wheelchair. This is a very entertaining movie. I definitely recommend him.
