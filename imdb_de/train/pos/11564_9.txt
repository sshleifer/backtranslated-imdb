I've seen this movie many times and I like that all bad teachers want to give it ten out of ten, but it feels like it's unfair to other good movies. But I think that this is one of those rare jewels: a perfect comedy. I would dare one of the biggest comic films of all time. Matthau and Lemmon are perfectly coordinated. The script is so sharp that you have to stop the bleeding. The story is known and has been described in other comments. The two leads offer exceptional performances, the girls are great and the situations are fun. Not a single curse word is in sight (you have to imagine that Hollywood, you do not have to swear to be funny, you have to be funny) and the transition from stage to film is seamless. They do not do it like that anymore. Timeless.
