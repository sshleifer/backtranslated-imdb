I do not know "Largo Winch" as a comic book (or is it a comic book, I do not really know), but I have to admit, when I heard about an agent / hero movie, I expected something different from that What I actually got. <br /> <br /> While it was amazing to see this, it was nice to follow this movement. You would never really be able to tell where it would go (some turns are predictable, but in general you can never really tell where it would end). A more than stellar performance by the lead actor and a really good support cast make this watch a pleasing watch. Not as action-packed as some might expect or expect, but a really good mix.
