I saw this movie at the International Film Festival in Brussels. I also met the director of the movie. I heard that Ed Wood wrote the story in 10 years! I'm sure he thought that would be his masterpiece - his triumph. <br /> <br /> If you take the movie seriously (as Mr. Wood did) it's really one of the worst movies you'll ever see. And that's cool. The Big Joke of I Wake Up Early The day I died is that he does not even try to make a decent movie. <br /> <br /> This makes the movie very, very good. The script is full of nihilism and anarchism - a lot of black humor. Billy Zane's role is absolutely outstanding. You see, that's either fine art ... or little garbage. <br /> <br /> **** / *****
