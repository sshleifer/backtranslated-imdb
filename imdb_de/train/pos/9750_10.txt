Yes, Giorgio, is a movie to feel good. A bit of romance, great music, beautiful scenery, comedies (a great food fight) and a bit bittersweet are the ingredients of Yes, Giorgio. Every movie fan would enjoy this movie. Those who need massive special effects should look elsewhere. Most of us need some escape from time to time, and how can we do that better than having a feast for the eyes, ears and heart? Something you must have seen!
