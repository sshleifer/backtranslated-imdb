Once again Madhur Bhandarkar takes you on the wild side. And it is remarkable, literally and figuratively. <br /> <br /> Mumbai hi-society - stars and starlets, glamor dolls and witch doctors, business tycoons and broker types, all stinking sharp focus here. In typical tabloid newspapers unfold their worlds, with each colorful story a clever subplot. <br /> <br /> A stubborn starlet that the producer dumped after his pregnancy, stewardess and high-ranking husband. the pedophile businessman and his neurotic wife, the reporter and the police captain; All shades and countless shades in between. <br/> <br/> Bhandarkar's job is to pick up the dirt on the drama kings, the dancing queens and the living dead. Atul Kulkarni grabs a punch, as does Boman Irani and Sandhya Mrudul. Konkona Sen Sharma is effective as an ex-crime beat reporter, but she could have gotten used to the job change and the party circuit. <br /> <br /> Heavily concentrated (running time 140 minutes) and refreshing other movie, worth the money.
