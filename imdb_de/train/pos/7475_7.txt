After reading some pretty negative views for this movie, I was not sure if I should borrow some money to rent it. It was a pleasant surprise though. I did not see the original movie, but if it's better, I would be in heaven. <br /> <br /> Tom Cruise shows a strong performance as the seemingly unstable David and convinces me that he is more of a smile on his feet (for the third time in his career - the other examples were Magnolia and Born on the fourth) July). Penelope Cruz is lightweight, but also fulfills the requirements of her role, just like Diaz. The only disappointment is the slightly bland Kurt Russell. In the film, however, it is not acting that really impresses filmmaking. Cameron Crowe takes on the role of director and offers a welcome change from his usual fate. The growing madness of the movie is perfectly executed by Crowe (the short sequence in which Cruise runs through an empty Time Square is incredibly effective). The soundtrack (a distinguishing feature of a Crowe movie) is also great. <br /> <br /> As a spectator you are shocked and challenged. The plot seems a bit elaborate, but the questions behind it are endlessly debatable. The film is not perfect, but it's a welcome change for Cruise and Crowe, and for those on a diet with Hollywood glamor, a revelation.
