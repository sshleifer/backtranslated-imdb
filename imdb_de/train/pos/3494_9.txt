What it is, "Raising Victor Vargas" is about as close to perfection as a movie can achieve. Either the sheer genius of a young author or just one of those happy blends where everything was clicked (probably a part of each) - this simple, small, ethnic urban romance makes its young characters as deep as you almost can read her thoughts. The film begins with a strong "street," but turns into a Latino family affair, then focuses on a story that speaks volumes about the uncertainty of youth and the profoundly natural desire to love another. In my experience, so much has never been done with so little (Tyros cast, novice director, etc.). Highly praised by critics, but not for everyone, "Raising Victor Vargas" is recommended for indie lovers and realists in simple stories rich in humanity. (ON)
