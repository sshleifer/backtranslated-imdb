Riding Giants is an amazing movie. It really shows how these people at that time lived only for surfing. Her life was essentially surfing, living, breathing and having fun. They did not care about money, work, girls or other things. For her, the waves were her girls. I've never been on a surfboard and it looks so tough, I do not understand how they can stay on top of them, it makes no sense at all. This is a great movie and if you like surfing, then you should really see this movie. If you are a surfer and you want to find out who started surfing, how it came about, who is really famous or whatever, you should really see it. It could be a documentary, but it's really good. -Tara F.-
