I thought it was a very funny movie. I love dog movies and comedy movies, so they were twice as good. K-9, K-911 and K-9 PI are my favorite movies. Jim Belushi is hysterical and Jerry Lee is funny and adorable, they form a great team. The only downside is that I really did not understand how Dooley's wife died. She died before this movie, but how? If they said it, I must have missed it. Otherwise I give him two thumbs / cocks! These dogs (Jerry Lee and Zeus) must have trained a lot. They were so funny and all the sounds that Jerry Lee would make when Dooley talked to him were so funny. My favorite was when Jerry Lee sang and when he would bite people in the ass for very funny information
