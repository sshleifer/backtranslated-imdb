A much underrated film that tells the story of a young musician caught up in an ever-shrinking spiral of domestic violence. <br /> <br /> Sometimes difficult to watch while Morris Day is portrayed as a misogynist, Prince as a knight On (the motorcycle) Ross, he is still called upon to beat a woman in the script twice. That he can do this and still appears as a flawed, but proven hero is the merit of Scripture. In this movie, Prince is so free of ego that he not only portrays himself as a narcissistic megalomaniac beating women, but his most famous song is fictionalised by his father and Wendy & Lisa. Two of his compositions - Computer Blue (admittedly the album's weakest track) and Darling Nikki - are also shown as songs that kill an audience. The only concession to the Princely I may be a card in which the (slightly shorter than Prince) Apollonia is listed as 5'6. <br /> <br /> The almost full-blown amateurs are mainly band members who play themselves (and reviewers who have missed the point completely on the terms they have never seen in other films.) Morris Day Receives the most praise for his likeable ham, though Jerome Benton also has to get credit for bouncing off well, especially on her hilarious stage performance, and Day and Benton even make fun of an Abbott and Costello routine, which requires some steps <br /> <br /> Finally, there is Prince, though I admit to having prejudices, but in fact I think he is a pretty good actor if he can portray an inconspicuous version of himself ISNT is not his profession, this is a movie made for the entertainment, who points out that the guy in the lead role is not Robert DeNiro, who thinks he has a point m Eight, is sad. I do not want this review to be a ridiculous attack on other people's comments, but I even thought that this movie has a low budget and is dimly lit. How then would a film about domestic violence be filmed? With full ceiling headlights and a CGI dinosaur that goes into the frame? <br /> <br /> The movie looks almost like a perfect snapshot of the neon light and skinny tie era. until you remember that it was actually done in a world of curly perms and thin synths, and this is not a retro-recovery. Prince's best movie with Oscar-winning music sees him at its peak and it is sad to realize that even though he would do some good albums, he would never record that high again.
