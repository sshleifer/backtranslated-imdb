A good effort for an Australian show. That's probably not surprising, as the Aussie drama of quality seems to rekindle. May I compare this show with the brilliance of my love? No. but it reminds us of the early secret life of us. the cast is great, gibney is magical in the first two episodes I've seen, the British cast is strong, especially the Callum and Lizzie characters. But a little more than the frugal light (not that it has to be saved) if this show is to get another season. I was not a fan of his performance in the stunning miniature series of mark time a few years ago, but he was great as a hal in getting greener. It's also good to see Brooke Satchwell again. Let's hope the show continues to improve with each episode.
