I'm from Belgium and that's why my English writing is rather bad, sorry ... <br /> <br /> This is one of the little-known films that are only played once on television and then appear to go up in the air. I rummaged through my old VHS video collection and came across this title. I checked and got an IMDb rating of more than 7/10. That's pretty decent. I have to admit that this is a very well composed movie and that's why I'm confused. This is the only film by this director ...? How come he did not shoot a lot of films after this pretty good movie ...? Someone with so much potential should be forced to make another film, ha ha ;-) <br /> <br /> Anyway, I'd really like to see him bring his file together and make another good movie like this, please .....
