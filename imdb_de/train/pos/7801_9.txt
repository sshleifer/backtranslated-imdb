This film uses cinematography fantastically, the depth of the camera captures every character. Denzel Washington and Kevin Kline have done fantastically well, although Washington's accent dies in certain scenes. How is this movie forgotten? Do not rent or rent lately it threatens to be lost forever. a worrying idea. Attenborough at its best since Ghandi, this masterpiece stands for what it should be in films like this, without worrying about SOUT African apartheid audiences crying out for freedom. Although the film is criticized for the biased nature, the film is the true book of Donald Woods and faithful to the message that is to be expressed to the world. ta and peace
