I would not say that this is a bad movie. In fact, it's pretty typical of the type of film the "Poverty Series" studios released back then. Filmed for monograms, Bela Lugosi is very effective in his role as a somewhat crazy doctor and scientist disguised as a respected member of the community. In this film, Bela and his followers have the unpleasant habit of stealing young brides and injecting Bela's wife with a serum from her body to keep her young after her demise. Lugosi is more than capable of making this film into an entertaining film. However, the film suffers from the ultra-wooden drama of co-stars Luana Walters and Tristram Coffin. Coffin (nice name for a guy in a horror movie) is especially bad in this case. I've seen him in numerous movies and TV shows and he's always the same; stiff, made of wood and absolutely unconvincing. Miss Walters is only a little better, but her acting talent is missing to make her role credible. Nevertheless, the spectator can enjoy the great Lugosi Act, another devastating scheme that will be thwarted in the end! Despite the bad acting, "The Corpse Vanishes" is a fun movie for everyone.
