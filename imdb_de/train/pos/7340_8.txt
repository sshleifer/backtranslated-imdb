This animation has a very simple and straightforward plot against evil and it's about action. What sets it apart from other animations is how well human movements are animated. It was really nice to see the fleeing woman running from left to right on the screen looking around. Her movements were so well done. Why do not you use this rotoscopic technique anymore? It is pretty effective. <br /> <br /> Fire and ice, in its prehistoric setting and barely dressed women, were clearly dedicated to the sexy woman, who was shown affliction in various sexy ways. Her voluptuous body serves as pure eye candy. Some may hate this and consider it as another moronic male sexual fantasy, while others (including many women) will love their aesthetic quality. I certainly do not mind! Bakshi just loves to animate lush, voluptuous women, as you can see in Cool World, and I do not think he has to refuse, as it's pretty animated for adults. But I had enjoyed this animation as a kid and I have never forgotten it. <br /> <br /> This animation was just something special and different from the usual Disney or anime prices. That's why the clock is worth it. It may be the best of Bakshi. For those who like animations with lush women: Try the Space Adventure Cobra as well. <br /> <br /> I give fire and ice 8 out of 10 points.
