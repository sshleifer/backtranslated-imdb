Since watching this movie as a kid over 30 years ago, I never tire of looking at it. From the opening scenes in the Horn Factory, to the car engine running from the back of the car to Ollie, who picked up the phone and was accidentally pushed out of the window by Stan, this was probably the best movie of the last day. After that, they switched to 20th Century Fox, and although these films were not terrible, they missed the comic times of this film. Jimmy Finnlayson, her long time slide, in his last appearance with the boys, as the Doctor is awesome! Quote: "I said goat's milk," Stan replied when he asked him how to milk a ghost! Charlie Hall and even Ben Turpin appear! Overall, I would call one of my favorite comedies from L & H.
