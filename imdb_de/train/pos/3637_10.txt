That was really a great movie. I loved Dennis Quaid and the entire baseball team. Jay Hernandez is also a very sympathetic actor whom you are welcome to see. The chemistry the team had when they got things together was spectacular. It simply shows what you can achieve when heads unite with a goal. This team came back from the sidelines and had several lost seasons to win just about anything. I love movies like these because they are really inspiring. <br /> <br /> In addition, Dennis Quaid's character gets a place in the big leagues. You can not do anything for you, except for this guy. It just seems as if someone should do something, he will do that. Things just go together and leave everything to click. <br /> <br /> Based on a true story, this movie will really make you think that "nothing is impossible".
