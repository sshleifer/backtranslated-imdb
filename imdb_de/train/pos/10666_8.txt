When I really started getting interested in movies, at the age of 11 I had a big list of movies to watch and I went to blockbusters and rented two or three each weekend. Some of them were not for all audiences and my mother would go crazy. I remember that one of the films on this list was "A Chorus Line" and could never get it; Now it's a dream come true. <br /> <br /> Of course I have lost the list and I would do anything to get it back because I think there are really interesting things to see. I mean, take "A Chorus Line," a stage play that's turned into a movie. I know it's something we often see today, but back then it seemed like it was a bit different. and this movie has something special. <br /> <br /> Most of the musicals produced today use the chance that the camera gives them for free to create different landscapes and bring the characters to different locations. "A Chorus Line" was born as a play on a theater stage and dies in the same place as a movie. After a big audition by acclaimed choreographer Zach (Michael Douglas) Richard Atenborough conducts a large number of dancers trying to get the job. <br /> <br /> Everything happens the same day: the tension of ignorance, the stress of having to learn the numbers, the dumb competition between the dancers? And everything happens on stage, where Douglas puts every dancer in focus and lets them talk about their personal lives and their most terrible experiences. There are hundreds of dancers and they are all fantastic, but they get shorter and shorter over time. <br /> <br /> Like a movie I recently saw, "A Prairie Home Companion," the broadcast of a radio program, Atenborough's focus here is on the issue of continuity. On or behind the stage it continues and time does not seem to stop. I'm not repeating it when Atenborough has cut a lot to make it, but it certainly does not look that way; and yet it's a great directorial work and editing work (John Bloom). But in this little stage you are wondering what to do with the camera? With only one shot, Ronnie Taylor's cinematography finds the way to look at certain characters in close-up, zoom in and out, to show the stage from different perspectives. It also gives us a nice view of New York. <br /> <br /> At a crucial moment, Douglas says to those who are left: "Before we start eliminating, they are all great and I would like to hire them all, but I can not." It made me think about reality shows where the only thing that matters is singing or dancing talent and where the jury always says the right words to the participants before some of them go (even if they are not good ). It's hard, you have to imagine; At least here, where everyone is really great. <br /> <br /> To tell some stories, the characters use songs, and in a second the stage takes on a new life and it literally becomes a dream come true '. The music of Marvin Hamlisch and the lyrics of Edward Kleban turn the film into a film without any mistakes, show the feelings of these dancers and let them perform these wonderful choreographies by Michael Bennett. The book in the theater is also a flawless and very short script by Arnold Schulman; which is sometimes very touching. So if it is not a song, it will be in one word; In "A Chorus Line", however, it is impossible not to be moved. <br /> <br /> During a trial break during the casting, Cassie, a special dancer played by Alyson Reed, comes on stage to convince Douglas character she can do it. The words "let me dance for you" never sounded more honest and beautiful in music and lyrics.
