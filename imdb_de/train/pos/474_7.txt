Since I had not read Nabokov and knew nothing about chess, I could only watch The Luzhin Defense as a movie. <br /> <br /> It really works well as one of my favorite genres "Sport Romances". The chess game is much more alive as a hard competition than in "Searching for Bobby Fischer", showing how much hard mental work the game can afford, which requires reflection, preparation, perseverance and planning. I particularly liked the special effects on the chessboard, as alternative games are expected. With feminist director Maureen Gorris (of "Antonia"), Emily Watson's big blue eyes are gradually reinforcing her transformative relationship with John Turturro's rather monotonous, absent, intense chess genius. <br /> <br /> The settings in Italy and Hungary are beautiful. <br /> <br /> (originally written on 27.5.2001)
