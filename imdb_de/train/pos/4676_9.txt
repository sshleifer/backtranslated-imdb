I found this movie thought-provoking, and its ambiguity refreshing in a world of Quick Fix movies where we are manipulated to love the good and hate the bad guys. Scott Cohen, a very handsome television actor, is doing a great job at depicting the black sheep of the family / lost child seeking the love and respect of his father, as well as those of his widowed sister-in-law, with whom he clearly has one story. Judd Hirsch plays against his usual good image as a father who has triangulated his sons, and now stays with the one he always rejects. When I saw this at the Tribeca Film Festival, I was thrilled. So the sawdust presented a family tradition, as the director explains. <br /> <br /> This is a fitting successor to the classic "Ordinary People". I just realized that also Judd Hirsch was there!
