I researched this movie a bit and discovered a website claiming it was an inside joke about the gay and lesbian world in Greenwich Village. With the exception of Stewart and Novak, the Warlocks and Witches represented this alternative lifestyle. John Van Druten, who wrote the play, was apparently gay and very familiar with this Greenwich Village. I found that ironic because I saw Bell, Book and Candle in the 5th or 6th grade in the theater just because my parents took me along. It was hard to get me into a movie that did not contain horses, machine guns, or alien monsters, and I was planning to get bored. But I remember the moment when Jimmy Stewart hugged Kim Novak on the roof of the Flatiron building and threw his hat away as the camera fluttered to the ground. As the glorious George Duning love theme increased, I suddenly had a sense of what it felt like to fall in love. The first excitement of romantic / sexual love made me dizzy when I left the theater. I'm sure I'm not the only boy before puberty who was seduced by Kim Novak's startling, direct look. It is ironic that a homosexual parable could spur heterosexual puberty on so many of us. I'm in my late 50s and watched the movie again last night. These feelings aroused when I put on this hat fifty years later. , ,
