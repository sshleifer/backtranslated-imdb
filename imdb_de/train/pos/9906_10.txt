YES, the plot is hardly plausible and very thin. Yes, acting ranges from average to ridiculous. Yes, that has been done so many times. But we are dealing with a film that does not shy away from these facts and pretends it's nothing else. There are indeed some original death scenes and the tension is increasing throughout the movie. Besides, you're never more than a few minutes away from a bloody murder. I urge everyone to watch this film with an open-minded look and see what it was about to do. a scary, funny slasher strip with an incomparable theme.
