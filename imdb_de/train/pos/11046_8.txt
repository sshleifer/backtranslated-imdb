Maléfique is a very interesting film. It is an unholy alloy of successes and failures. The central concept is great, three inmates with bizarre personalities are joined by a fourth (to which the audience identifies) and they try to escape their cell with a magical book they find inside the cell walls. <br /> <br /> The atmosphere is woven and reminds me to read about Edmond Dante's imprisonment at the Château d'If (before he became the Count of Monte Cristo). The director makes you feel that the characters are tied to the cell, especially the person we are supposed to identify with (Carrère - a white-collar criminal whose crime is not stated, but there is an inevitable reference to fraud). In one case Carrère behaves as an exercise when leaving the cell and has closed the cell door; we never leave the cell, the claustrophobia is unbroken. There are no shots of the prison outside the cell, and the view through the bars is a wistful sunset over a generic prison wall. Although the film seems very modern, it has a very old sense of incarceration. <br /> <br /> The characters are fascinating. We have Marcus, a violent pre-op transsexual who plays an abusive mother for Pâquerette (French for Daisy), a backward young man. Pâquerette likes to eat everything that he likes, and that unfortunately also included his little sister, hence his current situation (I like this commentary to the internalization, very primitive). Lasalle is a retired, obsessed elderly man who brutally murdered his wife. <br /> <br /> The central message of the film is that your wishes will destroy you, and there is a ritual to it. I think that's what worries me the most when you see people ritually destroy themselves. It has a real ring. The fairly simple soundtrack supports this well, every step deeper into the quicksand is accompanied by a dull ringing of a gong. I hear the gong every time I do something self-destructive. <br /> <br /> I think one of the plot problems is that the ends of the characters do not consistently reinforce the message, especially with Carrère, and the concept of the book seems to change as the movie progresses, not in terms of one successive revelation. I also think that some of the images we see are a bit amateurish, more of design than design, like the famous "vagina eye" and the sodomy of Lasalle, for me totally hollow images. <br /> <br /> In the end, the movie feels like the director is in a hurry to deal with it, and some things do not seem logical. For example, we were awkwardly induced to believe different things about the child of Carrère. That does not change the fact that this rare bird is a "pure" horror movie. There is no comic pollution or genre-spanning music like Cube (1997 / Natali), the obvious film to compare to. It's an absolute immersion experience that makes you feel like in the cell with the characters. This last remark that I make about it being a "pure" experience is, in my opinion, something that has been mentioned by others. This is a pretty unanimous point. <br /> <br /> My personal comment is when is my favorite part of the movie Lasalle talks about his past as a librarian. He describes very vividly a scene in which one day he goes to work and sits down in his usual place in the middle of a room in which all the books are arranged in a circle around him. The books seem to tell him that he will never contain their knowledge. This causes Lasalle to go crazy. That's really the problem with an obsession of understanding and knowledge. It's something that I felt myself. <br /> <br /> One last comment is that two of the well-received comments on the board have confused the names of the characters. To convince yourself that Lasalle is the senior librarian, just click on Philippe Laudenbach's page. You will see that he was born in 1936.
