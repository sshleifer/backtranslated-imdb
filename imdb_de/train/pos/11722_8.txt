To be honest, I only saw this movie because of my puberty needs. I mean, I could not get women at my age (I was 9 or 10 years old), so I thought seeing Elvira's cleavage was the biggest thing in sex. <br /> <br /> I had a great time with this cult classic about horror comedy, Halloween parties, sassy humor and a sexy evil shown by Elvira. <br /> <br /> They just do not make movies like this ... It felt like an amateur mixed up with him a moderator style for the evening cable talk show. <br /> <br /> The truth is that because of his humor and his ability to perform on Cassandra, it has produced many fans. <br /> <br /> This is a classic that reminds me of the good days of the USA Up All Night.
