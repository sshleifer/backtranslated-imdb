The story of "A Woman From Nowhere" is rather simple and quite adapted from an Eastwood spaghetti western: A mysterious stranger arrives in a lawless city run by a kingpin and starts shooting the place up. Even the opening credits and the music have that spaghetti feeling: Sergio Leone and Ennio Morricone would be proud. The really interesting twists are that the stranger is a beautiful (!) Woman, Saki (Ryoko Yonekura) on a Harley, and the location is in a city somewhere in Japan. <br /> <br /> There's a considerable amount of gunplay in this actioner, some good, some predictable, and some pretty hokey, but it's a lot of fun. Ryoko treats its weapons with credibility and sovereignty and gives the thugs the right. It was not an acting challenge for her as it was a physical challenge, but she handled things very well. She shows her acting skills much more than Otsu in the NHK drama "Musashi". <br /> <br /> I would highly recommend a movie if you're a Ryoko Yonekura fan (who I adore) and / or a "girls with guns" movie fan and stand up to repeated sightseeing. "Girls with guns" movies like "La Femme Nikita" and "The Long Kiss Goodnight" have something weird and inexplicable about. And a great girl like Ryoko, who plays a major role in it, is a powdered sugar.
