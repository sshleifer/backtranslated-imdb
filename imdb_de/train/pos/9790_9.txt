Although there is a melodrama in the middle or at the end of this film, the story is narrated beautifully and subtly and the acting is great. <br /> <br /> Yaara, who studies in Princeton, returns to Israel's homeland. Funeral of her oldest and dearest friend Talia. Because Yaara practically lived with her friend's parents after the death of her own mother, she lost her adoptive sister. And because Yaara, who is blind from birth, was led and guarded by Talia, her friend's suicide is as unbearable as it is inexplicable. Although she can not see, she has insight. Although she can not see, she can figure out what is out of sight except the "normal" people around her. The film thus becomes an enthralling mystery as Yaara investigates her relationship with Talia, the home of her adoptive family, tapes, diaries and people in the past and present of Talia for clues. visualizing what she hears, believes and imagines. The solution of the puzzle is more conventional, but the search is done with such subtle care, and the answer is made so beautifully and without noise that the pat moment is easily forgiven. The truths are gradually and yet unstoppable, clarifying not only Talia's life, but also her relationship with Yaara. Tali Sharon, as Yaara, uses her mobile face and voice effectively and is totally believable, both as an adult and as a teenager. We accept their ability at the end of the film to find their place in the world more self-confident. <br /> <br /> Remarkable is the precision with which places and actions are repeated with small but significant variations that never get boring, the dead-on the minor characters and the interesting decision to represent Talia only as a teenager. I'll argue with Yaaraa's final explanation of how she and Gadi, Talia's last boyfriend, are clinging to one another, but this journey to the edge is so intriguing that the picture stays in sight longer than their words will remember.
