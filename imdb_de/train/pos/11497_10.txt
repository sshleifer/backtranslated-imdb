This is one of the few films that are very erotic without being pornographic, though there is only a very rudimentary conspiracy. There is not much live sound or dialogue; Instead, the actors make voice overs where they describe their experiences of why they participated. > I fully understand why nobody else has tried this. There is already something like that. These. :-) <br /> <br /> Note: The producer has no distribution rights for a DVD version. I have never sold it anywhere. You can send an email to Mr. Boerner and order a copy from VHS.
