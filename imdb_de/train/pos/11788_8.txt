I really think people are going the wrong way here. At first I find this short film very entertaining and interesting. I just take it the way it is. I think the tension and mystery are awesome in their hint of the Guardian. Another thing that intrigued me was that the viewer is immediately involved even though there is no clear story, just hints and pauses and emotions played out by the characters who give the impression that there is a story to everything No one else could have done better than Lynch. This is the essence of Lynchianism in its best form. Of course, I agree with everyone that people who start to see this with the desire to be entertained by the viewer without truly imaginative work will be disappointed. And in good law. Lynch is not about it. At least this page is not by Lynch. The one who Lost Highway / Mulholland dr. is in full swing here, and people who are just waiting to be entertained as if they see something different will not understand what it is about. In my opinion, Darkened Room is all about dealing with your animal core, your instinctual ego, by giving you the means (image, sound, situation) to react instinctively. It's not about pleasure, it's about getting the desired response out of you. And that, my friend, is pure art.
