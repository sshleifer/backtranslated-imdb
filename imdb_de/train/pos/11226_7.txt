Star Trek Hidden Frontier will surprise you in many ways. First, it is a series of fans that are only available on the Internet, and mainly includes friends and neighbors who have the computer programs, home video cameras, and sewing machines, as Mickey & Judy once said they are showing a show. It's definitely friends and neighbors, you can say that. Many of these people are not the most beautiful-looking people you've ever seen, the youngest or the thinnest? Some of them stumble through their lines, as if walking on marbles? Some of them have a heavy accent or just do not seem to speak well, which makes it virtually impossible to understand a single word they say. However, one has to admit that it is fun for all these friends and neighbors to watch. Yes, some dialogues are hokey. Yes, it's a bit strange (though admittedly a little bit cool) how two male Starfleet men kiss (though some of the kissing scenes seem to go on and on), other shows and movies, or if you have the theme of Galaxy Quest in the beginning and end Listen to the end of every show. OK. We can do this. Why? The graphics are first class. Better than almost everything you've seen. And sometimes, one or two shows really stand out in terms of stories? Some of them are really real jerks. <br /> <br /> Hidden Frontier is a totally guilty pleasure in every way? but you have to give the people involved credit where the loan is due. A production of this magnitude is very expensive. People, sets, costumes, graphics? It's a big effort in many areas. We watch, we return and we thank them.
