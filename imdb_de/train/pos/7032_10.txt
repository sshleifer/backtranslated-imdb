The drama club of my school will be hosting this show in the spring of 2002, and I can only hope that we are as good as these! I've recently seen this movie as a kind of "research" for my role (Rosie Alvarez), and I just want to say, Vanessa Williams is the coolest! <br /> <br /> Wow! The casting for this movie was correct (with one exception). Jason Alexander, oh my god, is there something he can not do? He was the most wonderful Albert Peterson I've ever loved - especially his funny facial expressions and dancing during "Put on a Happy Face!" He is so great! Vanessa Williams is, as I said, the coolest. She was a beautiful Rosie, and her transition from secretary to temptress was absolutely believable. Tyne Daly was weird because Albert's disgusting mother and George Wendt were outstanding when the angry Mr. McAfee (but I LOVED Paul Lynde's 1963 performance!). Brigitta Dau tore me up as Ursula Merkle; She really put it down! And Marc Kudisch was a great Conrad Birdie ... "Suffer!" <br /> <br /> There was only one casting that I did not understand 'I do not understand. Chynna Phillips as Kim McAfee - what was that? I mean, she's really pretty and very talented, but ... she looks a little too old for the role. Eh, maybe I'm crazy. <br /> <br /> Okay, I highly recommend this movie. It makes you smile! <br /> <br />
