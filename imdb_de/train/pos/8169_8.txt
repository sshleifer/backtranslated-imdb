This is a bloody mess and pretty convincing. Corbin Bernson dominates this film with his skilful portrayal of the eponymous practitioner who plays a crazy control freak. Linda Hoffman plays his fraudulent wife and she is very eye-friendly - for her, the little "tryst" with the pool man brings heavy punishment in a way that the good doctor knows best - too bad for that pretty smile! The last half hour of the movie is dedicated to Bernson's character, who completely lost him, and the spotlight falls on a young actress named Virginya Keehne. As an extremely talented actress, she shines from the moment the braces release. Nice legs too!
