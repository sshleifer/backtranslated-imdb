The era of the sexploitation films of the late sixties and early seventies began with the permission to grant nudity in mainstream films and ended with the legalization of hardcore porn. The main years were between 1968 and 1972. One of the most popular and talented actresses of the era was Monica Gayle, who had a small but fanatical cult of followers. She was indeed able to act, unlike many who played the lead roles in these films, and her later credits proved it. And her seemingly deliberate disappearance in the dark, just as her career began, only compounded her mystique. <br/> <br/> Gary Graver, the director, was also a talent; Probably too talented for the genre of sexploitation, and his skills, combined with Monica Gayle's screen presence, make Sandra, the Making of a Woman, a pleasurable experience. The film never pulls and the finger is not pressed on the fast-forward button.
