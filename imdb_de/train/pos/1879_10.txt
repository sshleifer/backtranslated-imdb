I was too young to remember when I saw this movie for the first time. But I saw it for the second time about seven years ago. My sister told me to see it. Now my whole family has memorized it. We quote it at least once a day. I absolutely love this movie. I still laugh after all this time. Sure, it's about a really, really drunk millionaire who's irresponsible. The point is that he has still lost mankind in the others that we see in the movie. And that he is ready to give up everything for love. I can only recommend this movie to anyone who wants a laugh. Much laughs. It's funny, cute, and if you're a movie fan, it will really change your idea of ​​"Funny." Watch it with a group of your friends or family, and I promise you'll never have anything to discuss again, with some authur lines in your head. It will make you laugh for years. <br /> <br /> In my family, it's really hard to find a movie everyone likes. But I think this movie brought us closer. And I know that it will do the same for you !!
