According to the board, I believe you either love or hate it. Normally it is with all films. However, it is not necessary to compete with others. We only make opinions here. I rented this movie last night and would like to come and contribute my opinion to the mix. I was surprised how many people beat it up. There is a difference between a movie fan and a horror movie. I am a horror movie fan. Most simple movie fans do not like horror movies. Nowadays, so many low-budget camcorder films are coming to light. It's hard to keep up. And what makes it hard to stay in these movies is how bad they are. I wanted to come in and write a review on "Hood of the Living Dead" because it's damn good compared to the rest of the garbage. It's not fancy, but it's the horror movie producers who try to be too serious and make a horrible horror movie. I really liked that. Are you telling me that there is no effort? And one more thing, I bet all of you have all those huge DVD collections you're so proud of, nothing but Major Motion Pictures, right? Nothing wrong with that, but you have to know how to estimate low budget independent. I knew what I got when I saw this movie. I'm not going to get upset because I thought it would be a $ 100 million movie. Some of you may have to look at the matrix over and over again and stop comparing everything to the Matrix. And if most of you are under 24, that explains everything. Good movie people, look at it.
