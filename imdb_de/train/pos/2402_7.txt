The main reason for this film is Warren William, who is in top form as a Shyster campaign manager. He is electric and constantly looking for ways to deceive the public and defeat the opposing party in the midst of the greatest catastrophes. William is a great actor - I feel like he never got his right. Bette Davis as his girlfriend also shines in a signed role. Personally, I did not think Guy Kibbee was right when the candidate that William and the others blamed the public. He looked more like a blank canvas than a person. I would rather have seen a real character than a non-character. The story itself is implausible, stupid and clich√©d. But Warren William and Bette Davis are well worth seeing.
