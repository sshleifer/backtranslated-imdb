I had mixed feelings for "Les Valseuses" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started to look at it, but I finally liked it. I would not call it vulgar ("Stupid and Dumber" is vulgar, "The Sweetest Thing" is both vulgar and unpardonably stupid); I would call it shocking and offensive. I can understand why many viewers, especially women, do not like it or even hate it. It's the epitome of misogyny (or so it seems), and the way two antiheroes treat every woman they meet seems incredible. But the more I think about it, the more I realize that it's kind of an adorable little gem. I am fascinated how Blier got away with it. The film is very entertaining and very enjoyable: it is well written, the acting is first class and the music is sweet and melancholic. When I think about it, two pals had done something good to the women they met: They were preparing a woman on the train (the pretty, docile blonde Brigitte Fossey, who started her film career with one of the most impressive debuts) René Clément's "Forbidden Games" (1952) at the age of 6) for meeting her husband, whom she had not seen for two months; They found a man who could finally leave a cold Marie-Ange (Miou-Miou) and satisfy; they enlightened and formed the young and very willing Isabelle Huppert (in one of her early cinema presentations). Her encounter with Jeanne Moreau raises this comedy on a tragic level. In short, I'm not sure if I would meet Gérard Depardieus Jean-Claude and Patrick Dewaere's Pierrot in real life and invite them to dinner, but I had a good time watching the movie and two hours were almost flying it was never boring.
