I think this is the strongest movie HBO Pictures has ever made. This movie should be released in cinemas so that the public can see it on the big screen. It is available as a video. So make sure you search for it and check it. Chris Gerolmo did a great job with the director and screenplay. The performances of Stephen Rea, Donald Sutherland and Jeffery DeMunn are flawless. A masterpiece of the genre.
