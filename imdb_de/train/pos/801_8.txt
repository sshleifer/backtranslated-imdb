I guess JEDI is now chronologically considered the "last" entry in the popular saga, and it's a very good entry, as well as some of it. I liked how straight this sequel went to THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK, and I appreciated the maturity of Luke Skywalker as a character (and also Mark Hamill as an actor). After hearing so many negative things about the Ewoks, they were not so bad. I enjoyed the thrilling chase in the woods and I felt there was a lot of emotion in this chapter. The end (with some new additions, I suppose?) Successfully interweaves all 6 chapters into a wonderful fantasy story. I know a lot of real Star Wars fans hated George Lucas because of the changes he made to the original films, but since he came to the movies relatively late and did not miss what I did not already know, I think that he worked these 6 films perfectly as a whole. Oh, and um - Carrie Fisher looked pretty yummy in her tight outfit.
