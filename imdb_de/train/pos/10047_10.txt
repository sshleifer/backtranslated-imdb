To all wretched people who have done everything complain about dialogue, budget, this and that ... who wants to hear it? IF you have missed the point of this incredibly beautiful movie, this is your loss. The rest of us, who love this movie, do not care what you think. I'm a total guy who has seen thousands of movies in my life, and this one is in his own being, in my book. It was not supposed to be a documentary or a full-fledged presentation of what happened that night. It is the most amazing love story ever attempted. I know it's the cynical 90's and the millennium has all come in a tizzy but come. Someone in this commentary complained that he had earned too much money! How lame is that? It has made money in every civilized country on earth and is the highest revenue movie on the planet. I will like to stand with the majority side this time. Okay, cynic, time to crawl under your rocks, I'm done.
