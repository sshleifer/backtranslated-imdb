Ed Harris' work in this film follows his usual standard, meaning he steals the canvas from anyone he shares with her, and that includes the impressive Sean Connery. The film, which is more than a little ugly, comes alive only in the scenes in which Harris is interrogated by the lawyer for another convict. It's stunning, a master class for artistic control. <br /> <br /> The other actors are all clever and Connery is reliable, just like Fishbourne, but the story itself does not work. The conspiracy largely depends on the premise that a black prisoner is maltreated and forced by white police officers. This is the engine that drives the story, right or wrong, and you end up feeling a bit cheated. <br /> <br /> Still, it's worth seeing Harris in action.
