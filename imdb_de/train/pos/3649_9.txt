I've watched a lot of TV movies while I was a student, the majority is the normal waste of time that US television spends. This was however well processed and drawn and had a very nice turn at the end. Having seen Richard Dean Anderson only in MacGyver and Stargate, I was more surprised at his excellent performance than the range of A-B expressions he normally gives. It was a pleasant surprise to see Daphne Zuniga after she had returned to The Fly II for quite some time. Also nice to see Robert Guillaumme back in a lead role. I can not say that I ever take Jane Leeves seriously after her Benny Hill days, but she has managed to get along well in her role. All in all a very recommendable movie.
