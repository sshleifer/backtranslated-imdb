An unmarried 20-year-old guy (played by John Travolta) leaves the farm and heads to Houston, where he meets life and love in a Texas honky-tonk. At par, it's a modern love story ... in the style of Texas. There are a few cowboy hats, pickup trucks, neon beer signs and hints on big belt buckles and rodeos. The music, though not from Texas, is Texas-adapted, courtesy of the talents of Mickey Gilley, Johnny Lee, and the Charlie Daniels Band. And this Texas Twang ... "y'all". <br /> <br /> The story and characters are as subtle as the taste of Texas Five-Alarm Chili made with jalapeno peppers. It's enough to make civilized audiences break off the film in favor of a distinguished classic, perhaps with Laurence Olivier or Ingrid Bergman. "Hamlet" is not. But "Urban Cowboy" is sharp and explicit, and I like it somehow. <br /> <br /> Technically, the movie is generally good. The dialogue, the production design and the costumes are all realistic. The processing is sent. And both casting and acting are commendable, if not Oscar worthy. I would not have played Travolta in the role he plays, but he does a good job ... even Debra Winger. Also Barry Corbin and Brooke Alderson are good supportive roles. But the cinematography seemed to be weak. The film copy I looked at was grainy and sometimes had a reddish-orange tint, a visual feature I've noticed in other movies from the same period. <br /> <br /> At first glance, the film does not seem to offer any social or political "message". But I would say, when "Urban Cowboy" was released twenty-five years ago, it had a pretty prophetic impact. In 1980, the US had all sorts of problems, not least the American hostages detained by Iran. In the minds of many people, the US was then pushed around and bullied. <br /> <br /> This film, along with others of its time, offered something Americans wanted to see in their political leaders. .. toughness. "Urban Cowboy" is a very physical movie. The characters in it may not be the brightest people on earth. But they are tough! <br /> <br /> Everything about "Urban Cowboy" is anti-intellectual. This 1980 movie was one of several that set off a new and hard era for the US. He began in 1980 with the election of Reagan. And this era continues today with a president who is probably remembered not for his intellect, but for his toughness and aggression, qualities that attract Americans as surely as Texans to five-alarm chilli.
