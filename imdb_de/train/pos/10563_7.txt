Wow ... what ... a whirlwind. The '30s is a decade with many films of all kinds that I can imagine, especially in the early talkie phase. There have been films that are painfully static and boring, like "Dracula" with Bella Lugosi, and there are those who just can not bring it to rest, sometimes well and sometimes not. This is one of the movies that does not stop for a minute, and that's both a miracle and a pity. Lloyd Bacon, who also staged "42nd Street," must have been the king of Depression Era musicals, and he was probably thrilled with the possibilities that the sound brought to the cinema world because he filled out that image with it. It can not take a minute or two without music or anyone talking. It is totally crazy! I thought the movie deserved a 5 because the tempo was very bad because it was incredibly fast and sometimes I did not know what was going on and what to think. The characters just seemed to run back and forth, talking about things that did not interest me and probably no one else. I thought I would just be rewarded with a little headache. I noticed that Lloyd Bacon also took the female lead in "42nd Street," Ruby Keeler, and "42nd Street" was a movie whose end was the best. And you know what? It happened exactly the same with "Footlight Parade"! The end is absolutely incredible! It is undoubtedly the most impressive musical I have ever seen. The last part contains some musical numbers, and I think that's something that makes it worth watching the rest of the movie. The numbers are perfect! There are three major parts and the most impressive is certainly the second. Suddenly the screen was filled with beautiful and imaginative camera work, beautiful people and simple conversation that made me forget my little headache.
