<br /> <br /> Artistically shot, actors act exactly their role. You have a real feeling of watching Lucienne rise from poverty to the most beautiful girl. A sense of tragedy to triumph again to tragedy. All in all, I have watched this movie at least 10 times. And can very well say that Prix De Beute (the beauty award, Miss Europe) is a big favorite in my silent film collection. The expressiveness of Louise Brooks is perfect and I can recommend this film to anyone who appreciates artistic beauty and a tragic plot.
