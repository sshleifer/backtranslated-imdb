Now I had the pleasure of seeing Contaminated Man first when he premiered on television in December 2000. An infectious disease expert (William Hurt) loses his family when an unknown disease invades his home and kills her. A few years later he is now in Russia or somewhere. I'm not sure where exactly, all I know is that it's happening somewhere in this area. However, due to budget cuts in an infectious diseases laboratory, they have to lay off most of their workers. One of them, an angry watchman named Joseph Muller (played by Peter Weller, known for his role as indestructible robocop), steps in and asks him to give him back his job. He needs this job because he is divorced and he needs to pay child support. So he goes in, a fight breaks out and some things get knocked over, dangerous things. It was soon discovered that Muller was infected with a deadly pathogen. In fact, it is so deadly that a drop of his blood will kill a person within seconds. Soon the news comes out and the disease expert (Hurt) is called in to investigate, and he later teamed up with an American reporter. Now Muller is determined to come home to see his wife and son, and will stop at nothing, even if he has to infect the entire Russian population. We have a troubled person (Weller here, Michael Douglas in Falling Down) who stops at nothing to reach their destination, even if they have to kill some people. Next we have a heroic person (Hurt here, Robert Duvall in Falling Down) who is both sympathetic and determined to stop the opponent. The contaminated man is indeed a very good movie with a good story line and some very good performances. <br /> <br /> 8/10
