I saw this movie in the theater and was absolutely impressed. At the time, Claire Danes was a good actress, not the stupid, arrogant, Hollywood slut she is today. In any case, this movie really seemed to me one of the more raw, realistic and beautiful friendship films. How far would you really go for your best friend? I ended up in tears and still tears when I see it now (I own it). I remember when I left the theater, I called my best friend and sobbed at her how much I loved her. This is a great movie that you can see with your best friend. However, be prepared for the near-sure conversation afterward by addressing you and asking if you would do such a thing for them.
