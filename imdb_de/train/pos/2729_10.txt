I voted very well for how good the drama was, not for the content. It still gives me a shiver after reading the book and then watching the movie. Two ex-cons travel to their destination to rob a family of money from a safe consumer they learned about in prison. During the ride, the tension increases, as the soundtrack in the film contributes to the general expectation. After the murderers have finished their work on the farm, the next morning the family's mortal remains are found by the daughter's church friend. The blood-smoked scream, as the scene with the cut-through cord was swung onto the phone, made my blood really cold and let me cool down. That the murderers fulfilled their righteous fate is a small consolation for this condemned family. Robert Blake was excellent in his portrayal of Perry Smith. The book was also excellently written by Truman Capote.
