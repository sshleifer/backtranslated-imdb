It's not Braveheart (fortunately), but it's good conversation with engaging characters and good acting. I enjoyed this movie when it was released, and when I saw it again last week, I found that it has behaved well over time. Not a classic movie, but a very nice and worth watching movie to enjoy as great entertainment.
