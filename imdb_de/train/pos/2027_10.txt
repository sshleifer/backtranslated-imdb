What can one say about the convincing performance of Tara Fitzgerald? She is as credible as the injured Mrs. Graham, stubborn and strong-willed, but not immune to Markham's passionate attention. With every mischievous look and temperament, every flicker of discernment in his eyes and facial expression, Toby Stephens is a master of his character. He is the power of passion and hope that will restore Helen's injured mind. Graves' Huntingdon is a perfect feat of the unreformable rogue. Despite what he has done, there is an undeniable human dignity in his refusal to end up playing the hypocrite; he is at least aware of his own mistakes and how they ruined him. Helen's attempt to save his soul - after leaving him and taking his child with him at a time when it had never happened before - is a triumph of hope, hope and faith in the value of every human life and every human being Soul, however misleading, even if sinful person can be. Markham's permanence can then be seen as a reward for her faith and her relentless moral character. Although Tenant's opinion-based moral standards are outdated by today's standards, the story is steeped in integrity, passion and conviction, which still have an impact. The tenant is far more believable than Wuthering Heights or even Jane Eyre; here is an adaptation that will do justice to the novel. I highly recommend it!
