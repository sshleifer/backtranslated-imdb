Despite some negative comments this film has made on the IMDb pages, it is still worth a look, as this is a story about survival and camaraderie between two different men with different mentalities while engaged in a difficult mission located in the jungle of Panama. <br /> <br Peruvian director Luis Llosa takes us to see this thriller in Panama. The film has some good moments when Beckett, the veteran of the Navy, arrives at a newly arrived man recently sent to eliminate a notorious drug cartel head and the corrupt army general, who may be the country's next president. The only problem, Miller, has no experience in what has been entrusted to him. Miller, the arrogant newcomer to the jungle and guerilla warfare between the military and drug addicts against the infiltrates American intelligence officers learn a valuable lesson from Beckett. What looks good in theory is irrelevant in the jungle. <br /> <br /> Tom Berenger, is an actor who does not register much, as he proves in this movie, but in the context of the movie he is right like a man in a few words. Billy Zane plays Miller as he can, with a role that will not give him fame until the final end. <br /> <br /> For action movie lovers, "Sniper" offers a 112-minute action that would have made a satisfying film with a little trimming.
