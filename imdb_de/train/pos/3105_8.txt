The Bourne Ultimatum is the third and final mission for Superspy Jason Bourne, a man who wants to kill the people who made him a killer. The Bourne series is one of critics' most respected trilogies (Ultimatum has an 85/100 rating on metacritic.com, which means it's "universal applause") captivating. <br /> <br /> First, I recommend you watch The Bourne Identity and The Bourne Supremacy, the two fantastically titled ultimatums of the Ultimatum: There are three different films, but in reality they are all permanent you miss, you get stranded and confused, just like me. You'll still enjoy Ultimatum's action and battle scenes if you've missed the first two, but then the story will definitely lead to confusion. <br /> If you were lucky enough to see the prequels of this movie, then She would probably like a pleasure as Bourne defeated his enemies and tracked down the man who screwed him from supremacy. Jason Bourne is played very well by Matt? Damon does not do anything to earn an Oscar nod, bu His work here is good enough to hold his own. Bourne's adventures take place in many different cities; The cities are all so diverse that the film is not bland at times. The agency that pursues Bourne uses every technological tool known to humanity to track it down. <br /> <br /> I will not dwell on the characters as they are a continuation of the first two films. However, it would not hurt the movie to phrase a few things for the audience - not every viewer is a hardened movie watcher who can pick up on any little hint of storytelling. Ultimatum would not have been harmed at all if the story had been a little bit ahead. <br /> <br /> It seems that most people agree that ultimatum was a movie's success: The film opened for $ 69 million and - The total number of box office accounts now stands at up to $ 216 million , Currently, the film is still running in the cinemas since August 3, very strong. It's the best action movie I've seen since Live Free or Die Hard. <br /> <br /> Good) Damon is solid but not spectacular, very intelligent movie. The story is like many others
