Robin Williams and Kurt Russell play boys in their thirties who endanger their perpetrators by (reluctantly) deciding to repeat their heartbreaking duel with rival Bakersfield years later. Williams is okay, but Russell is the legendary Taft quarterback Remo Hightower. Holly Palance makes a beautiful and attractive turn as Williams's wife could live without this rematch. It's worth watching the movie just to see the famous Remo in action. Highly recommended.
