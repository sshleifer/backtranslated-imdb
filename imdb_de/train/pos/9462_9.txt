Clean, family-oriented movie. I laughed, I cried ... I loved it. I was worried that I could not see Steve Carrell as something other than stupid Michael of The Office. Boy, I was wrong. He should win an Oscar for his performance. I will definitely buy it on DVD when it comes out. My husband liked it and he is not in films of this "type". I saw it with two other 30-year couples and we all agreed that it was the best movie we've seen in a long time and certainly the cleanest. Just a dirty word! Not even sure why it was PG13. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes comedy, drama, romance and more!
