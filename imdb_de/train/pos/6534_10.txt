I had heard that this movie was good by many of my friends who saw it, and everyone said it was great, so I had very high expectations - and Nancy Drew surpassed those high expectations! It had fun parts, it kept me entertained with the action and all the guys they wanted to kill, and Emma Roberts was amazing like Nancy Drew. The rest of the cast was also very good. I would definitely recommend this movie !! <br /> <br /> Nancy: "I wonder why the boys tried to kill us?!" Corky: Yeah, that's what I asked myself ... Actually, it somehow sneaks out! " <br /> <br /> Nancy: "I hate it when people try to kill me, it's so rude!" <br /> <br /> ~ Nancy Drew
