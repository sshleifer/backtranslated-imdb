Excellent view of a mature woman who will lose everything (even the pruner has a mortgage). The way she fits into this particular "business", the innocence and true love that exists between the people of a small town, is perfectly mixed to give us a fresh, light and funny comedy. I could not stop laughing with a very funny scene of two old ladies in a drugstore. <br /> <br /> I love European movies, and movies like these make my opinion stronger. A movie that I also recommend with closed eyes in this genre is Waking Ned Devine. <br /> <br /> Saving Grace, a comedy that many friends enjoyed as much as I did. You will love it.
