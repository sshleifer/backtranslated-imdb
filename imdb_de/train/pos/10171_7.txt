Once when I was in college and we had an international fair, the Russian department had a poster from the Soviet era with the inscription "Ne boltay!", What "gossip not!" Means. I "translate" it for the "generation" of TV viewers as "Do not be Gladys Kravitz!" (in reference to the curious neighbor on "Charmed"). <br /> <br /> However, if you get the result of gossip in Pvt. Snafu short "rumors", you can see that it is not really a laughing matter. In this case, the ever-knowing soldier hears about bombing and immediately assumes that the Axis powers have attacked the United States. So he tells somebody who tells somebody to tell somebody and it goes on. As in "The Russians come, the Russians come," the story will get more and more in the way each time, so when she returns to Snafu ... well, you know what I mean! Yes, it's mainly World War II propaganda - with a derogatory name for the Japanese - but I have to say that the Pvt. Snafu shorts were actually pretty funny. Of course, since they were from Dr. With Seuss written and Mel Blanc in the lead, it's no wonder they were pretty cool. Worth seeing.
