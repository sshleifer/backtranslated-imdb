This did for the crime what "Not Another Teen Movie" did for the school. I laughed all the way as two awkward gangs fought each other and each other. An inconspicuous comedy with open jokes and gags that made me roll all the way. I think the biggest thing in the movie was that time never seemed to go forward and the characters were trapped in the 30's.
