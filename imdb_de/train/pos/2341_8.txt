This is indeed a funny show done in a scary way, similar to a Tim Burton movie. It's worth a look as it's a lot more creative than most of this season's shows. Best of all, it's not a reality show. I wonder why audiences are so willing to accept shows like these (which lack creativity) and ignore wonderful shows like these that actually have a creative bent. <br /> <br /> While some disregard the premise, I think it's really unusual. Much more pleasant than "Ghost Whisperer" and "Medium". I think it's the funniest on the subway since "My Name is Earl". Oh, and the narration and the music are wonderful. If you enjoy shows that are off the beaten track, I would recommend it. It's not as weird as Twin Peaks, but it has a serious kink.
