That was unbelievable, that is, it was hard to believe that the "forgotten tribe" would make this amazing trek twice a year, and filmmakers Cooper and Schoedsack did not stage some scenes and scenes. But what does it look like? Cinematography is brilliant under mostly extreme conditions, and the film music of Iranian music, which has been added to the video release, adds extra value to this memorable documentary. <br /> <br /> I had the pleasure to see this and "Kon Tiki". That same weekend, that was exciting and certainly got me to see how hard and brave and courageous people can be, whether for primitive survival or the need for adventure or in the name of science.
