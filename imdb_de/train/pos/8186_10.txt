I love the Satan Pit !!! David Tennant is such a great actor and so is Billie Piper !!! Who still loves Will Thorp to pieces? He is so cute, right? I hated the pieces in which he was possessed by the devil and where he was told to "go to hell," as Rose so frankly said. Mind you, he was pretty funny when he said, "Rose, do us a favor, or shut up!" Mr. Jefferson was so brave, right? Dying to save the others. I was really sorry for Toby (Will Thorp) when he came out of the house for the second time because he was so scared. I was like, "Oh my god, if I were Rose, I would be so afraid for him". And when she hugged him, I was like "grrrrrrrr, he's mine! Hands off!" but I thought that was really cute. And the doctor ... well, I thought he would tell Ida, "Tell Rose, I love her," but he did not. Well.
