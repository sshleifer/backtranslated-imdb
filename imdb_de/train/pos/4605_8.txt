Not only is this one of the greatest Jackie Chan movies, but also one of the greatest kung fu movies ever. <br /> <br /> In Chan we expect crazy stunts and fast, creative action movies, and this has set the benchmark for others. It's just two hours of pure entertainment that will impress you all the way. <br /> <br /> In addition to great action, we have a viable storyline and believable characters, with Chan pursuing a more Western approach to writing that mixes eastern dissolution methods (ie kicking ass). Overall it's funny, serious, entertaining and groundbreaking. A must-have for every kung-fu fan as it remains accessible to the general public of the film community.
