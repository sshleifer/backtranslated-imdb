As an amateur historian of World War II / Nazi Germany, I could hardly wait for this to appear on DVD. I missed it when it first hit the market in 2003. I do not want to repeat what has already been said on the last 8 pages of comments on the historical inaccuracies. A better job could have been done to portray the "charming" Hitler. I also had a little problem with some of the castings, not so much because of their acting, but because of their appearance. Peter Stormare does not look very much like RÃ¶hm, why did not they get Babson to wear a wig? And my biggest complaint. So much was always done by Hitler's eye-catching blue eyes. Why did not they get Carlyle to wear blue contacts? On the plus side, I found the actors who played Goring and Drexler looked pretty good. As long as people watch this, they understand that this should be conversation 1, story 2. I do not think much damage is done.
