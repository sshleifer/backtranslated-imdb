I will not spoil the contents of anyone who has not yet seen this modest masterpiece by Kay Pollak. A world-famous conductor brilliantly played by Michael Nyqvist seeks peace by returning to his childhood village. The villagers, silently following the genius, are slowly trying to make him part of his greatness. Each role in this film has a specific purpose and shows in each of the actors a remarkable potential to play their own accord in short but precise words, a symphony of love. Not love in the sense of a relationship, but in the tone of the mind buried deep in each of the characters, each of which reveals its own present history, their needs, their skeletons, desires, and much more. <br /> <br /> I will not forget to mention the two main parts that are played by Frida Hallgren and Michael Nyqvist, whose dramas are played in memorable emotional harmonies feedback. They touch with a pain related to their own disability to love themselves. Michael Nyqvist is put to the test here in a very difficult environment, in one of those films that ends up being catastrophic or fantastic. And it was fantastic from beginning to end, not a second less or more than enough. There remains a sense of change and the taste for more. <br /> <br /> Definitely one of the best movies I've had the pleasure of watching.
