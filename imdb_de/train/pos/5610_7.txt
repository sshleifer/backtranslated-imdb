Roman Polanski masterfully directs this type of variation to the same theme as Repulsion. I can not imagine that there is an honest moviegoer who can not recognize the good director at Le Locataire, but both parts of the Dyptic may not be quite satisfactory to most people, including myself. <br /> <br / > Polanski is very good at feeling the inner torment of his characters (Deneuve in Repulsion and himself at Le Locataire), starting with a certain lack of self-assurance that soon turns into a mental disorder that eventually becomes irreversible physical illness becomes. The common ordeal for the characters and the audience is really unlike the horror and tension of the horror movies, as there is no perceptible supernatural element here. While horror movies allow a kind of catharsis (be it cheap or elaborate), Polanski tortures us sadistically, and when in his last opus the dark humor lasts, we are mostly on the nerves and not at the edge of our seats. <br /> <br /> Suspense, horror, all this is a matter of playing with the expectations of the audience (as an alternative to deceiving and fulfilling), not literally with the nerves of the people. In my book, Rosemary's Baby is a far greater achievement because of pure paranoia and simple reason in constant struggle: the story is about a couple moving in a strange flat while identifying with a single character. If the fantasy elements are all in the hero's mind, the situation is extremely uncomfortable as we, the audience, are forced to judge and reject it while we summon it "paint'n lure" to have.
