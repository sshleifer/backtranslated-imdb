I happened to see this movie a few days ago while switching channels. My expectations were not very high, but it was an interesting movie. In "A Guy Thing," Jason Lee Paul, a downright swollen guy from Seattle who just wants to marry his fianc√©e Karen (Selma Blair) and set himself an undisputed life of bourgeois domesticity. We meet Paul for the first time at his bachelor party, where he does not feel like taking part in the usual bachelorette party activities that encourage his (surprisingly few) buddies, if he is a bit naughty and gets into trouble with his early difficulties and Dispute. The next thing Paul knows, of course, is the morning after the night before, lying in bed with a naked hula dancer and his mother-in-law phoning to let him know that Karen is on her way there. Oh, and the hula dancer is Karen's cousin Becky (Julia Stiles). From this little acorn of potential trouble grows a mighty oak of frenetic unhappiness as Paul crawls from misfortune to misfortune, trying to cover up what he has done, while appearing to be a good-natured, family-oriented good at his upcoming wedding pleased. Ironically, his efforts to make Karen unsure of possible iniquities are forcing Paul closer and closer to the fun-loving Becky and forcing him to question whether he really wants the life that seems to be planned for him. The film contains the right mix of comedy and romance. Definitely worth a watch.
