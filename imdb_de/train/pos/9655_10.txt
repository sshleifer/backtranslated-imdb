Maybe "Presque Rien" is not the best movie ever made ... But it's better than many of you have said. I still have not seen a better movie about homo. <br /> <br /> You Americans are accustomed to seeing very narrative films with a clear beginning, a clear development and a clear result. However, European films are less narrative, but leave much to think and feel. <br /> <br /> Many of you did not understand the meaning of the movie. The purpose of this film is not to show us a simple "summer movie", with commercial characters that "fall in love and live forever happy." Summer holidays and beach are just a background, and this movie is for all boys who might feel identified with these boys. <br /> <br /> Maybe some of you have shown this movie because of its 3 not well understood parts, as flashbacks.These 3 moments are: - Summertime in Pornichet, when you are After Mathieu spent a year and a half in Nantes, he does not go to see a psychiatrist himself, he tries to take something and Cedric takes him to the hospital and later he talks to a psychiatrist to find out why he did that.-The last part is when Mathieu returns to Pornichet alone in the winter ... to think about how his life has changed, how his life has changed and he trying to find yourself. <br /> <br /> It may be that some people did not understand all this well, because all the scenes are mixed together. But like I said, that's not a funny movie. If someone wants to see meat, then we have Belami films. <br /> <br /> Presque Rien, which shows us how cruel life can be, for a boy who is not sure about his feelings and not sure what to do in life. Mathieu just wants to leave home and try to lead the life he thought might bring him happiness. But what initially seemed perfect is not as good as he thought, and he is worried. and feel that he has lost the way of his life. He is lost and does not know what he really wants to do or what makes him happy. He eventually gets depressed and tries to commit suicide. <br /> <br /> So funny? Is not a funny movie. Very hot scenes? just a few .. but this is not a movie for entertainment. It's about feelings ... friendship, love, happiness, unhappiness, pain, depression, loneliness ... I, like many others, feel identified with the life and problems of Mathieu, and that's what the director wanted to do ... a movie that shows us the cruel reality of a boy's life. <br /> <br /> For me the best homo themed film of all time.
