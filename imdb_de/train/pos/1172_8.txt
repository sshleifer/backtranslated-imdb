And yet another run of South Park is over. This was not as strong an episode as I had hoped, but Night of the Living Homeless was a stronger finisher than Stanley's Cup, Tsst, Bloody Mary or Erection Day. Woodland Critter Christmas and Goobacks still can not eat it, but few episodes can do it. The Night of the Living Homeless is a parody of the zombie genre, which is done in a way that only South Park would think of. Instead of carnivorous zombies, the creatures are homeless, begging for change and seem to survive on it. Randy and other residents are locked up in the community center, but this time on the roof, where they can overlook the scene. A particularly funny moment is when a member finds out that his home has disappeared and becomes homeless so Randy has no choice but to shoot him. Meanwhile, the four boys set out to solve the problem The whole story behind the homeless takeover, trying to convey a message, but seriously uninspired. South Park is usually best when it's ridiculous. Matt and Trey have made sure this week and not really criticized the homeless problem, but only playful. <br /> <br /> The shock of the episode occurs when a scientist shoots himself to avoid the homeless. This is the first time a South Park suicide goes awry, and we watch the poor man miss his brain and then try to shoot himself many times while he dies painfully. Another inspired South Park moment. <br /> <br /> All in all, the episode was funny, but it was not going to be great, holding back any real comment on the homeless and staying with the zombie shtick. The end is a bit funny, but nothing new. Now we have to wait until October for the next episodes. It's a long journey, but South Park has to be applauded for its run. The show seemed to be losing power last season, but now it's in great shape again.
