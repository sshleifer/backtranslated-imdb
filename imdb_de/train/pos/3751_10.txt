I know you've already recorded this at film festivals (or at least I think I might think so), but I think that should be in every "Best Animated Short Film". Bravo. I can not wait for the whole movie. I realize you do not hear this often enough because of the bizarre nature of your animations, but listen to it now and accept it as the truth. Kudos, my friend. Okay, now I'm just trying to get ten lines ... Although I still mean it. And here comes another shoe - and I can not stop here yet. This is extremely annoying and at the same time I have nothing better to do. In fact, I'll probably see all your movies in another convulsive "Jason Steele Marathon". I have many of them. <br /> <br /> -R
