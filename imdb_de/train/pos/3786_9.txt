Ying, a Chinese girl speaking Czech, invited us to show a Czech film (with English subtitles) in the Department of Visual and Environmental Studies (VES). It was the first time I saw Samotáři (Loners, 2000) and it was pretty good. <br /> <br /> Similar to many other Czech films, the seven main characters seem to have a rather difficult, dirty life; The Web shows that this theme was popular among American films in the early 1990s. Their relationships dissolve, combine and recombine. A typical feature of the Czech films is that none of the characters is generally negative, nor is it a permanently positive characteristic. You can also see how the characters judge the functions of others depending on the context. This is a very realistic feature of the psychological analysis of the film. <br /> <br /> Ondřej is a talented and married young surgeon who has two daughters. However, they learn that he has only studied neurobiology to prove how much he loved another woman, Hanka. He is so obsessed that he disguises himself over and over again as a plumber to get into Hanka's childhood home - a house he repeatedly burns. <br /> <br /> Hanka now has a very mixed relationship with her parents. She decides - by throwing up a coin - to part with Petr working in a private radio station. Hanka does not see the bourgeois life of her parents as a good example, but seems rather unsuccessful in creating a better environment. But she is a very flexible character in terms of her friends' style. <br /> <br /> Hanka seems to have serious plans for some time with Jakub, an innocent drug addict whose memory seems to have been badly devastated by the drugs. Friends of his band, however, tell Jakub that he already has another girlfriend , Hanka is disappointed and returns to her parents. <br /> <br /> When Hanka and Petr split up, she is organized by Robert, a matchmaker who also works for a travel agency, where he shows the life of the ordinary Czechs to Japanese tourists. Robert, who also provides Jakub with marijuana, never takes it seriously and usually sleeps with many different women. Eventually his mother dies in a hospital and he has his own way to deal with the depression. Vesna (a Slavic word for "spring"), who came from Macedonia to Prague, works as a barmaid - and you do not know whether she came to the Czech Republic to see her father or her UFOs. She seems pretty confused, but sometimes helps the other characters with her problems. <br /> <br /> Petr works in the radio station and he is the only one who likes his job - a job he finally loses. He tells his audience that he broke up with Hanka - that's how Ondřej learns about the news that makes him very happy. After all, Ondřej's wife Lenka is always ready to forgive him and stabilize their marriage - even after Ondřej asks a magician to make him disappear, so Ondřej can try to capture Hanka again. (The magician pays his debts because he is a victim of a serious car accident - Jakub and Hanka bring the victim to the hospital, and Ondřej saves his life.) Lenka also works for the travel agency - as a translator - and finally she has some hysterical Translating scenes for about 20 Japanese tourists shooting their films while eating Hanka's parents' parents. The seven characters interact in interesting and exciting ways, which would be natural if Prague were smaller four orders of magnitude. Given the actual size of the Czech capital, it is unlikely that all these events would take place in seven people, but it is fun.
