The inspirational story of Carl Brashear (Cuba Gooding, Jr.), a black man who grew up in poverty in Kentucky and then joined the US Navy to become the first black Master Diver in Navy history. We see the series of childhood struggles that Brashear must overcome to make his dream come true (and then to keep him alive.) Last but not least, the challenge was Master Diver Bill Sunday (Robert DeNiro), the head coach of the diving school to which the Navy sends Brashear is not particularly sympathetic to Brashear's goals, but eventually becomes an unlikely friend and supporter. <br /> <br /> This is a good movie; fast and with a lot of action, if not an action picture in the normal sense of the word. There is also a very humane history here and an interesting study of racism and the struggle to overcome it. There is also a feeling for the struggle that took place in the 1960s between older and younger naval officers (the "old navy" versus the "new navy"). The performances are pretty good - especially "goodings". I thought that DeNiro was perhaps somewhat exaggerated in his Sunday representation (although, who knows, Sunday could have been this extreme kind of loose cannon), and the representation of women on Sunday Gwen (Charlize Theron) also asked me if These areas have been "beefed up" to provide entertainment value. <br /> <br /> A good movie. I never wondered if it would be worth attending in 7/10. <br /> <br />
