Sweet romantic drama / comedy about Stewart and Sullavan, who write love letters to each other without anyone knowing who the other person is. Of course, they work together and can not stand. You can guess the rest. The entire cast (especially Sullavan, Stewart and Frank Morgan) is beautiful, has a fun, intelligent script and looks absolutely stunning. It takes place in Budapest and was filmed in Hollywood, but I thought I would see Budapest! Everything looks so perfect and gorgeous. A unique movie. Do not miss it!
