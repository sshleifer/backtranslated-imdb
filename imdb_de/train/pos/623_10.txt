There are not many films in the area that made me feel like Stardust did anything during the movie. Stardust is a magical fairytale like the Princess Bride and is undoubtedly the most wonderful fantasy spectacle of the 2000s and 1990s. Exciting, funny and with wonderful pictures and unforgettable characters, especially Michelle Pfeiffer and Robert DeNiro. I challenge everyone to watch this movie without a smile. From the first ten minutes of the movie you know exactly how it will end, but it is the journey and not the destination that thrills the viewer from start to finish. <br /> <br /> Ten stars and no decimal Less.
