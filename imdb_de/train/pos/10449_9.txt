I had never heard of this movie before, but its concept interested me when I heard it: An American meets a European woman on his last night in Europe and spends the night together. It caught my interest, but I never thought it would be so great. Before Sunrise is a masterpiece, and it is also one of the most romantic films that have been recorded. To my surprise, he was completely missing the cynicism of the 1990s. It's impossible to really talk too much about it, because there's no real conspiracy (though there are many interesting things to talk about, but not only the conversation is important, but I'm just saying it) YOU IT!
