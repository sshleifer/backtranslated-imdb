When I saw this movie and started to see how its characters evolved, I felt like this was a great shot. If you get that feeling and the movie actually meets those expectations, the experience is rare. I had that feeling throughout the movie. Robert DeNiro and Cuba Gooding Junior played fascinating and amazingly strong roles, both of which were Oscar-worthy. The side cast was just as strong and created a successful foundation for the image on which it grew. I can say without hesitation, seeing this movie will not disappoint him.
