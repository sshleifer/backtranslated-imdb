Pandora's Clock is one of the best thrillers you'll ever read, and this is one of the best thrillers you'll ever see. A very faithful adaptation of the novel by John J. Nance, who had a terribly real scenario in the novel, is made even more here. <br /> <br /> Although done for television, this is top notch entertainment. The cast is great and slides so well into characters from the novel that you'd think they read the novel. Richard Dean Anderson emerges from the shadow of Macgyver and shows the best performance of his career so far. Jane Leeves is great in her role as an ambassador in a role that proves she can be a good actor. Daphne Zuniga is excellently suited as Dr. Sanders and although the character is a man in the book, it works incredibly well. Robert Loggia, Edward Herrmann, Robert Guillaume and the rest of the minor cast are first-rate and fit in with the novel's counterparts. <br /> <br /> Of course there are changes in the story (including and a minor change) at the end), but these changes are better in comparison to the novel. The storyline is realistic and confident in the way it's presented, making it the best aircraft set since the original Airport movie. The production values ​​are high and although the special effects could look as good as they did ten years ago, they work well. The sets are great, especially the CIA headquarters and the Oval Office show that the filmmakers spent a lot of time. <br /> <br /> It does not matter if you first see this and then read or read the novel and vice versa. Just do both and you will not regret having lost four hours of this movie and as long as it takes to read the novel. That will leave you breathless.
