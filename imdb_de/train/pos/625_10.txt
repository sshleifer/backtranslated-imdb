That afternoon, we took the kids to the movies and saw Neil Gaiman's stardust and all I can say is wow. <br /> <br /> It's rare that I'm completely surprised, but that's probably the best fantasy movie I've ever seen, maybe even the best movie of all kinds, and it's all Neil Gaiman's fault. <br /> <br /> Sure, I could have been pulled in by the wonderful dialogue that was smart, smoothly flown and made. The characters are absolutely believable. <br /> <br /> I could talk for days about the spectacular acting. Charlie Cox is perfect as Tristan, Claire Daines Brilliant as Yvaine and Robert Di Nero almost steals the movie as Deeply the Closet Pirate Captian Shakespeare. <br /> <br /> Pure joy, caused by the humor that has made Laugh funny funny and intelligent enough to make the first Shrek look like a sitcom from the 80s and fit perfectly into the The Rest of the movie alone would have made this movie a great one. <br /> <br /> Special effects were almost perfect, t This was not a HdR or Star Wars SF Extravaganza, but where they were needed they were just what was required, not too much to distract you from the movie itself , and fit in perfectly with the story. <br /> <br /> Then there is the story? What can I say. How often do you come across a story that contains all the classic elements of the fairy-tale formula, which is not just a cheap Princess Bride offensive. It succeeds to be familiar and comfortable and at the same time completely new and refreshing. <br /> <br /> Each of these things would have made this movie a good movie, all together make it a great movie, but they are pale compared to the rich, enchanting world that combines these elements to be good to bring to life. Once again, Neil Gaiman has made it. He has brought another dagger into my heart by creating a fantastic world that is so beautiful and enchanting that I would do almost anything to live in it, and just give me a glimpse of it. I did not want it to come to an end, I wanted to be sucked through a whirlpool into the land of Stormhold and meet Tristan and Yvaine in person, travel through the fields and valleys, stroll through the marketplaces and the inhabitants both dangerous and friendly and stay there forever. It's a feeling I've noticed when I've read anything from Gaiman, The Sandman, American Gods and Coraline. When I finished reading, I had a deep sense of sadness because it was over, and I could not see anything in the movie worlds he had created seemed much more alive and alive than the one in which I was To live, and to observe Stardust, was no different. <br /> <br /> In the end, I am sure that Neil's writing and this is The movie does not affect all people alike, but trust me when I say that you have the time and the money You have spent with watching the movie, will not regret. He's just one of the top 5 movies I've ever seen, and I can guarantee anyone with a soul will like it at least.
