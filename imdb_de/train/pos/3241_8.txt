Action. Comedy. Tension. This movie has everything. <br /> <br /> The Plot expects 4 professional thieves to be invited to participate in a robbery in a small town in Montana. Every kind of archetypical character of a thriller movie is here. Frank, the master spirit. Carlos, the weapons expert. Max, the explosives expert. Nick, the safe cracker and Ray, the car driver. Unfortunately, Frank is arrested by two hobbling detectives (very well represented by Ed O'Niel and Daniel Roebuck) who chased him from New Jersey after sending the letters to the other four. <br /> <br /> Our 4 characters meet at the train station and from the beginning none of them likes each other or trust each other. The mix comes with the fact that Frank is gone and they are not sure why they called together. <br /> <br /> Now Frank is brought back to New Jersey by the 2 detectives, but quickly escapes on foot and tries to return to the boys, who have all sorts of problems. <br /> <br /> Truly a great movie full of laughter and great acting. Simply a good movie for anyone looking for a laugh or something else
