A real scream situation comedy of the mid-70s. This movie became a HUGE hit for about 5 minutes and disappeared from the face of the earth. I'm always amazed at some comedy films that are released for a week and then disappear: HIGH FEAR, THE CHEAP DETECTIVE, THE BLACK BIRD, DO NOT LOOK NOW IF WE'RE SAYING ... and today have no profile at all. NORMAN was the comedy of the month 1976 in which everyone seemed to be laughing and never to mention it again. NORMAN is famous for its video recordings and its broadcast on film, an experiment that was an experiment at the time. NORMAN is a rude, politically incorrect toilet that The Farrelly Brothers is working on today. If they had done it, there would be no complaints about their content and inclination. It is very funny and YES very rude and weird everything is wrong. As it should be. As a groovy 1976 movie with all these horror colors and garments he actually works better.
