I had a personal interest in this movie. When I was 17 and was in high school, I got a job at 20th Century Fox as a member of the Labor and Hod Carriers Union. At the end of my first day (sweeping the deck of an aircraft carrier) I was advised to bring a suitcase with enough clothes and so on for a week or two the next morning. When I arrived the next morning, a bus was waiting and about 20 of us were driving south towards San Diego. Shortly thereafter, we stopped at an army base called Camp Callan or Camp Hahn. Once we were penned, we drove a few kilometers north into Camp Pendleton, the large naval base. There, on the beach, we started building a Japanese Pacific Island. It took about a week or ten days for the installation to finish. These included a water tank, rifle trenches, sand ditches and living quarters. All of this was at a very high salary, sometimes "golden time", three times our regular hourly wage. Our food was also top notch = great ribs for lunch etc. - which was amazing because it was wartime and it was very difficult to get good meat at home. <br /> <br /> After the work was over, I waited anxiously for the food movie to appear, which was about eight or ten months later. Then I waited two hours for the movie before my handiwork finally appeared on the screen. Then it was not more than three or four minutes (maybe less) when the movie's heroes bombarded the base and blew them into small pieces. A bit disappointing, but still funny. <br /> <br /> Despite the disappointment, I liked the movie and have not seen it since. Later, I learned that the film was taken over by the government and Fox was paid on a cost basis, which may be responsible for our extravagant pay and lifestyle. Bob Weverka
