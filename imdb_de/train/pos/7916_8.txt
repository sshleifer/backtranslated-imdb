Alright ... Roeg touched a little nerves, did not he? He was a genius when he cataloged the descents of various characters into psychosis for several decades, but once he has the bad taste to assume that salvation (or even a good piece of advice) could be found in the bad old Catholic church it will hipper-than-th-alternative movie audience especially vicious. Even worse, the character of Theresa Russel, who is confronted with experiences for which there is no explanation in her rationalized rationalist view, is not arbitrarily forced to deal with these experiences on another level - the spiritual one. You know, the realm of ignorant and superstitious beliefs, the kind of things arthouse cinephiles should have over them. Oh, the horror ... So she finds her marriage - the idea that it could be a one-time important commitment - corroborated by something that feels uncomfortable like divine intervention. People who find this idea offensive at first glance may wonder why they instinctively go into attack mode when asked to take the idea of ​​a spiritual dimension in their lives seriously. But probably they will not. Sure, this movie has some issues, especially Talia Shire's delirious Hamwork as an overburdened nun, 1950s clothing and so on. And the dialogue between Marie Davenport and the young priest in her final scene is straight out of the Spellbound School of Glib Interpretations (though Hitchcock's film escaped similar accusations because the source of wisdom had perfectly worldly credentials as a Freudian psychoanalyst). Sadly, Nicolas Roeg seems to have left a critical abuse even when he asked the question and the possible answers that this film offers.
