Undying is a very good game that brings new elements to the tired genre of first-person shooters. It tells the story of Patrick Galloway, an expert on occultism, and an impressive fighter called by a friend to his Irish estate to investigate some strange phenomena. The game takes place in Ireland after the First World War. So do not expect to find weapons like Chainguns or rocket launcher. All the weapons in the game can be considered antiques, but the real fun in the game are the spells and the system that they operate on. Our hero is ambidextrous so he can use both hands at once: casting spells with his right arm and his Weapons with the left arm. So you can simultaneously shoot and cast spells, which you understand very entertaining also unique to this game! The graphics are great and they work very well with a medium power of P.C. to run. The level design is also cool and atmospheric. Most of the time, the game revolves around the Covenant estate and mansion, but there are many other places waiting to be discovered. Thanks to the talents of Clyve Barker, the game has an excellent plot and storyline (something very rare for a first-person shooter), and I said before a great and very weird atmosphere that the voice acting is also good but not excellent. But the game has two main flaws. First of all, it's pretty linear. For example, if your mission says you are entering this room, all the doors of the house will be locked, except for those who lead to the room of your mission. Although this can save time, but limits your freedom of exploration. Second, the fact that all weapons are antiques does not appeal to most FPS players used to high-tech weapons. In terms of difficulty, the game is very balanced. Most of it is intermediate, but sometimes it gets harder but not frustrating. Overall, the immortal is a great game. Definitely one of the best FPS out there.
