While I'm not the biggest fan of wirework-based martial arts films, if a movie is more of a fantasy than a fight I get a lot more fun, and this movie is one of the best in terms of fantastic plotting and crazy flying shenanigans ching Siu Tung has created an enchanting pleasure with fine performance and a lot of ethereal beauty. The terrific, tragic Leslie Cheung plays a tax collector hero who spends the night in a haunted temple, engaging in a stunning Fox spirit and a crazy Taoist. Cheung's performance is filled with naive but dignified charm, and Wu Ma, as a Taoist monk who performs some swordplay and even gets a musical number, is pleasing off the wall. Perhaps Joey Wang is the best, as a fox spirit, who is fascinatingly seductive with every movement and gesture. The film contains elements of fantasy, horror, comedy and romance, all of which are combined into one ever-entertaining package. Ching Siu Tung, directing and handling the choreography, takes care of the tightrope and fills the film with fog, shadows and sinister, rousing forest colors that add a wonderfully magical atmosphere to any forest scene. Noteworthy are the elaborate hairstyling and the beautiful flowing robes of female figures. If I'm not mistaken, Joey Wang wears hair that is sometimes worn like fox ears, a wonderful touch. Although the film has relatively little action and some cheesy pop songs that may have been bad, this is a beautiful entertainment object with Swell characters and plots, even the somewhat odd character arc, a nearly constant supply of visual treats and a lush dreamy atmosphere. An ethereal treasure, highly recommended.
