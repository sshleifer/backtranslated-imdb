This film is one of the funniest, saddest and most accurate depictions of the mentality that seems to have permeated the Balkans 45 years after the depicted time. All the usual characters and conflicts are presented with such anger, sadness and love that it is impossible to decide whether crying or laughing is the more appropriate answer. However, the accuracy of the portrayal and the timelessness of the guys makes it a great movie, if you want to understand a bit of what drove ex-Yugoslavia to its madness. In fact, no diplomat dealing with the area should do anything until this film and its twin father * Maratonci trce pocasni krug * were seen.
