The cast is different and now they have chosen a different approach, we have the street smart team "Networth" vs. the supposedly professional team "Magna", but if you think the street smart team has problems, you're right. While the Magna team has been struggling at times, the road team has disintegrated week by week. First of all, some things that repeat themselves when "Apprentice 3" first sums up the same absurd mentality (by Trump) and the game in this series: If you're a good project manager but you lose, the team will turn against you and you are fired, even though their teammates with backhorses are often half the assholes. Simply absurd, a game show claiming to be the best candidate actually looks the best, while the dysfunctional candidates sting each other until one is left and that person is the best. lol <br /> <br /> Anyone who has seen everyone this season has seen curses, entanglements, and even gay offensive stereotypes as teams try to campaign. <br /> <br /> The list of victims so far Tara Dowdell, Audrey Evans, Danny Kastner These three are the only ones I think have been unfairly dismissed by Trump. The rest had really done it, as they only aroused conflict, anger, and suffering. It's just amazing how one contestant told Audrey Evans how she who did a good job was fired and how some of her worthless teammates are still in the game. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's the game, it's "The Apprentice" Where manipulation, backslash and ever-popular thinking are offered to everyone involved in the Project Manager. <br /> <br /> It was a fun ride, though the contestants do a wide range of tasks ranging from photo shoots to the construction of mini golf courses, the construction of new homes. <br /> <br /> Although it is still the "apprentice", you can basically just laugh all the time, since the madness and the chaos are working to the happy person is the winner.
