It's worth it to see it, especially with the nice twist of a journalist with integrity. They expect a big fall, as Gray Owl is exposed as a fraud. However, this is not recommended and contributes to the generally optimistic and uplifting theme and drama in the story and the film. <br /> <br /> This must be Brosnan's best performance so far, he convinces as an Englishman playing Indian. The standout scene is the return to his? Aunts? where Brosnan and the two older female actresses make a wonderful scene full of nostalgia and a life with so little dialogue, just with facial expressions and good orientation. Perfect. <br /> <br /> The story is so little known and the message so universal and important that it is really a pity that the movie was not recognized better. Maybe he will become a classic sleeper over time. I hope so. <br /> <br /> Well done, Dickie Attenborough and cast.
