In rare cases, a movie comes with the power to expand the mind, warm the heart, and touch the soul. "LOU" is such a movie. I got "LOU" from my wife who got it from a neighbor who works in the film business. She saw me a second time. We were both excited. It's like the first time. <br /> <br /> "LOU" is a magical piece that sends you back to the moment in which all your dramas begin. It does so while it is relentlessly entertaining. Bret Carr's acting and pacing as a director will not leave you looking away from the screen. He makes a character who makes a beetle that stutters like an innocence, but is warmly supported by such a subdued sincerity that you forget you're watching a movie. When the epiphany hit during the brilliant climax, I saw my wife in tears for the second time. <br /> <br /> As a Life Coach, I support individual growth and transformation, and this film is a must-have life coach and anyone looking for their personal growth and transformation. It's a brilliant, creative masterpiece with the power to change lives!
