50 years old, this musical comedy fantasy may look old, but she wears it with dignity. <br /> <br /> This movie is still a lot of fun. Crosby was never really romantic lead material, but he delivers the material with the slightly humorous touch it needs. Bendix plays wide and fun in a role that requires his strengths. Hardwicke - as joyous for a knight of the empire - a real - to throw oneself with such dedication into such capers. And Rhonda Fleming enjoys herself in the fewest performances of the main roles. Only Murvyn Vye disappointed as unconvincing Merlin. <br /> <br /> Although not a musical, the songs are very good and the "dance" routine that accompanies Busy Doing Nothing is perfect. and turn Crosby's musical movement into a virtue that, to be honest, was inherently amusing because it was never his greatest strength. <br /> <br /> The color is good, the sound is a bit mushy in places br /> <br /> And the story - well, the original needs some freedom, but I suspect that Mr. Clemens is with the Result could have been quite satisfied.
