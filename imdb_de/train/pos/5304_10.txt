Pecker is a funny, but twisted film about a small town in Baltimore whose daily routine is interrupted by Pecker, a young photographer who takes pictures of "real things". No pretty models, no beautiful men, just live hard. This wonderful movie is fun for the plasticity of the urban art chain. There is a special scene in which a homeless person shopping at Pecker's thrift store buys the same coat as one of the Whitney Art junkies for just 25 cents instead of five hundred dollars. This just shows that, no matter what money you have, you may not always have taste. Once again, John Waters sends you into an infinite spiral of laughter and raw reality. You can have your mainstream Hollywood movies with special affects and mountains of celebrities, but give me a "pecker" or a "hairspray" (another great John Waters movie) about a "Titanic" or a "Godzilla" every day !!
