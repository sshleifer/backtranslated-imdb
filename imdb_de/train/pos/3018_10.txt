This movie is an exception to the rule that a sequel is worse than the original. His comedy at its finest. This movie is a fast-paced action-slapstick comedy that seems to be happening every second. On more than one occasion, the entire audience laughed aloud at a joke. <br /> <br /> It's a great advantage to have seen the first movie, but it's not a prerequisite to have the benefit of being a parody of reality series of recent decades like Survivor (Expedition: Robinson in Swedish ). So do not see it if you are unfamiliar with Sweden and its language. Otherwise: Have fun! Johan
