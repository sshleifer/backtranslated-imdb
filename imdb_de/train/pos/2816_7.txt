This is an above-average Jackie Chan streak, due to the fantastic finale and great humor, but this is nothing special. All the characters are pretty cool, and the movie is thoroughly entertaining, plus Jackie Chan is just amazing! Jackie and Wai-Man Chan had fantastic chemistry together and are both very funny !, and I thought the main challenger looked really threatening !, But dubbing was just awful! Character development is above average for this type of thing! And the main fight is just fantastic! Also, some of the bumps that Jackie makes in this case are tough! There is a lot of silly and silly humor in it, but it amused me and the end is hilarious !, and all the characters are very personable. It looks pretty cheap, but is generally very well made, and while there are not as many fights as you would expect from a Jackie Chan movie, it's enough to keep you watching and one of my favorite moments in this movie when Jackie (Dragon) and Wai-Man Chan (Tiger) play with a rifle and off we go! This is an above-average Jackie Chan movie, due to the fantastic finale and great humor, but it's nothing fancy, but it's still worth the clock! The direction is good. Jackie Chan does a good job here with solid camerawork, fantastic angles and mostly fast pace of the movie. The spectacle is very good! Jackie Chan is amazing as always, and here he is amazing, he is extremely personable, funny, as usual he does some crazy stunts, had fantastic chemistry with Wai-Man Chan, kicked his ass and played this wonderful, cocky character, he Was incredible! I just wish they would stop syncing him! (Jackie rules !!!!!). Wai-Man Chan is funny as Jackie's best friend, I really liked him, he's also a very good martial artist. Rest of the cast OK, I guess. All in all, the clock is worth it! *** of 5
