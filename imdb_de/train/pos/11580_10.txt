As another reviewer notes, Hanna's war is an outstanding film about a person of excellence, Hanna "Anniko" Senesh, who would become the Jewish Joan of Arc. Unfortunately, I think that Miss Detmers as the main actress is too beautiful to be taken seriously as a resistance fighter. In truth, her performance is not restrained by her beauty, but it makes the terror of sadistic brutality as resistance to her even stronger. Maruschka Detmers performance is courageous, poignant, heartfelt or understood and absolutely believable. In other words for me "In the Zone". from the opening credits. If you want to learn about the suffering of another person they believe in and entertain impressively, try Hanna's war with Maruschka Detmers. My hat also goes to Ellen Burstyn as Hanna's mother, a famous and famous actress who could have made an effort to leave the film. This is a team effort by maybe two actresses, but not an All About Eve situation.
