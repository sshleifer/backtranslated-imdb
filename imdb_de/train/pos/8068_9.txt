To watch this movie from start to finish, without ever having to break out into laughter, almost requires an act of faith, as one must always say to oneself, "It's old," "it's a classic," " be kind ", not because film is so bad, but because it is best, it is so good. This is a dated movie. It's also a classic when it's tarnished. I'm not inclined to laugh at people anyway, and I'm more annoyed when others do. To make fun of The Informer, it's kind of like giggling an idiot when he dribbles his orange juice over the tablecloth. Yes, one says to himself, he is an idiot, and if he has his game on top, he is also a true scholar. The same is true of The Informer, which is sometimes very horrible, yet boasts great photography, fine acting, a wonderful score, and a good, decent, simple story. In the end, which I do not give away, politics, religion and psychology come together in a church so that the scene looks crazy and exaggerated, and sometimes life is like that sometimes. Uneducated people of simple faith behave differently than we (presumably brilliant) modern people, and the scene is not so unbelievable (I buy it, but I know the Irish) as embarrassing. But people behave like that, they say things like that. Not everyone is hip and it may not even be desirable for everyone to be hip. Are people so superior to those of seventy or eighty years ago today? And how? I do not think we are just different. Now watch the movie.
