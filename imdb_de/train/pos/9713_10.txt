This series premiered on the cable television channel "Comedy Central" in the USA. It was hacked to death and shown in order. That was sad for the crowd that should have put it on, but it fell by the wayside. Fortunately, at the same time my cable company was digitized and I received the BBC. Thankfully, because I've seen "The League of Gentlemen" in sequence, complete and uncut. <br /> <br /> The "The League of Gentlemen" group is very close to England's "Monty Python's Flying Circus" and Canada's "The Kids in the Hall". But a warning. However, <br /> <br /> "The League of Gentlemen" are a step ahead. It's not just about dressing and fighting cultural ills, it's going deeper and much, much darker. I can now tell many of you - it will offend certain groups of people, it will make others angry. But remember, it's the only comedy ... dark, dark comedy. If that's not your thing, do not look. If you think you KNOW dark comedy, then look at it - if you're angry and upset then you do not quite know DARK COMEDY. <br /> <br /> These guys got it right and got it on the button. They are brilliant, they are excellent and I enjoyed every character creation. There is a COMPLETE story told here from episode one to end. You can not see this episode at any time, whether you like it or not, that's one of the charms of this series. Look at it in the right order. See how creative and stylish these guys are. Nobody and nothing is out of bounds. This, my dears, is "dark humor". Bravo!
