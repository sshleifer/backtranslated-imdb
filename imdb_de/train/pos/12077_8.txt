This 1945 mystery thriller film about the young woman Nina Foch (Julia Ross), who is unemployed and retired and looking for work, was a lot of fun. Julia reads an ad in the local London newspaper looking for a secretary and hurries to find that position. Julia gets the job and is hired by Mrs. Hughes (Dame May Witty), who demands that she live with her employer in her home and wants her not to be friends with men all her time dedicated to this job. George Macready (Ralph Hughes) is the son of Mrs. Hughes and has some very strange wishes to mess around with knives. This was a low budget movie and most scenes were close-ups to avoid the background and scenery costs. This strange family lives in a huge mansion off the English coast of Cornwall. There are secret doors and lots of excitement.
