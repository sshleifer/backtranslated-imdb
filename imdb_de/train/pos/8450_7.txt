Was not that bad for Raw's first PPV of 006. But the end was really shocking for everyone present and those watching at home. EDGE W / LITA FOR WWE INTERCONTINENTAL CHAMPIONSHIP Not a bad starter, they can show a serious match if they have more time for a wrestling match. Flair wins by DQ after Edge kills him with his MITB Briefcase. 3/10 SECOND GAME TRAVEL STRATUS VS. MICKIE JAMES FOR THE WWE WOMEN CHAMPIONSHIP Not bad to note that this is the first time that these divas have been standing together in the ring. Mickie wants a modified chick kick, but Trish ducks & nails her own chick kick for the win to retain her title. 3/10 THIRD PLAY TRIPLE H VS. BIG SHOW The game was really good, really. Throughout the game, HHH focuses on the injured arm of Big Show, but Big Show is still fighting. Later, HHH can overthrow the Big Show and nail a pedigree for the win. 5/10 FOURTH GAME SHELTON BENJAMIN W / MAMA VS. VISCERA {This was a bonus match} Not so bad, it was alright. After Viscera was behind the referee, Benjamin's mother got a purse and hit Viscera three times on the head. Viscera only stood up to be caught by Benjamin with a heel strike against the big man. 4/10 <br /> <br /> FIFTH GAME JERRY 'THE KING' LAWLER VS. GREGORY HELMS Boring, slow & sloppy. Both men did not really try hard. Jerry Lawler wins after a fist drop for the win. 2/10 <br /> <br /> SIXTH GAME TORRIES Wilson VS. VICTORIA VS. ASHLEY VS. MARIA VS. CANDICE MICHELLE IN A FIRST WOMEN GAUNTLET MATCH It was quite entertaining for me. Ashley (I think) defeated Candice last time to win the first Women's Gauntlet match. 5/10 SEVENTH MATCH- JOHN CENA VS. CHRIS MASTERS VS. CARLITO VS. SHAWN MICHAELS VS. KANE VS. KURT WINKEL W / DAIVARI IN AN ELIMINATION CHAMBER GAME FOR THE WWE CHAMPIONSHIP It was a cool match in the elimination chamber. But nothing will overtake last year's elimination chamber, which was the best. The last three are Masters, Cena & Carlito. Carlito turns away from Masters and gets a roll-up to eliminate him. Seconds later, Cena switches to Carlito to win the elimination board and retain his WWE title. But his night was not over yet. 7/10 After the match, Vince McMahon comes out and congratulates Cena on his victory. Vince McMahon declares that his night is not over yet, and says Edge is using his chance on Money In The Bank to ask Cena for the title. Edge comes out with Lita, gives Vince the briefcase and goes into the ring when Cena has another match tonight. <br /> <br /> EIGHT MATCH- JOHN CENA VS. EDGE W / LITA FOR THE WWE CHAMPIONSHIP {Cena pitched during the chamber game} is immediately struck by Edge, Edge then hits a spear at Cena, walks to the cover and to his shock Cena breaks out. Edge nails another spear & cover for the shocking Three, defeating Cena and winning the WWE Championship for the first time in his career. 1/10 The New Year's Revolution of last year was better than this year, but it was still alright. The match was also good and the shocking effect that Edge is earning in his MITB opportunity is definitely the most shocking in the PPV show. <br /> <br /> All in all: I give him a 7/10 & a C
