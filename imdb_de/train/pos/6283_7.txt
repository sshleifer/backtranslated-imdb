As much as I like big epic images - I'll spare you the namingroping - it's great to sit back sometimes with a few beers and a simple action movie. Movies where the plot is behind the scenes. Films in which the dialogue is not so cleverly written that it binds itself in endless knots of purple prose. There are HUNDRED movies that fit the bill ... but in my opinion Gone In Sixty Seconds is one of the better ones. <br /> <br /> It's an update of the movie that shares its name. It also shares the ethos of this picture, but not quite the execution. Whatever was good about the original was streamlined. Whatever was streamlined was increased thanks to a larger budget. Often these efforts are recipe for a complete disaster - see the ugly ugly remake of The Italian Job for one that messed it up - but Sixty succeeds here thanks to a cast of mostly stellar actors. <br /> <br /> The plot and much of the dialogue is not much to write about IMDb. Often you have scenes in which the same dialogue line goes back and forth between the actors, each of whom will pronounce them with different twists. Many people found that annoying; I think it makes a smile. Each actor has a chance to show his definition of style, with Cage, Jolie and Duvall, of course, leading the pack (and it's also amusing that Ms. Pitt does not get the first bill here). The chemistry between the good old Saint Nick the Brave (see date of review) and Angelina leads to some nice moments. <br /> <br /> The bad guy is not even a bit scary - I've seen Chris Eccleston playing hard guy roles before, so I know he can deal with them, but I think he was deliberately instructed to make his role insignificant so as not to distract from the plot. We know that the heroes will somehow succeed. We just sit in the car with them and enjoy the ride. I think many of these scenes were played with so much tongue that many people shot them over their heads, which resulted in a poor rating. In fact, I would not have minded that the look of the fourth wall was broken in the camera: it's just that kind of movie. <br /> <br /> All of this style and not so much substance - something that my patience does not run exhausted * just * so - would be worthless if the action were not there. And for the most part it is like this. Wonderful that way. I've noticed that targeting extremely fast close-ups these days is a common trend. Personally, I find this thing exhausting. I prefer movies like these, where the stunts are impressive enough not to need an artificial voltage ramp, raping tight shots all the time. I've been told that Cage actually did as many auto stunts as he could manage without losing his insurance (in real life I mean - his character obviously does not care), and that shows. The man can really move a vehicle, and this is well utilized in the slow-burning climate finale, where he drives a Mustang into the most outlandish and funniest way. <br /> <br /> So, yes, this movie is not an "epic, life-affirming post-Sept 11 picture with compulsory social commentary". The tempo is uneven, some scenes could have been cut and not all actors pull the line. But car films rarely get better. So if you hate cars ... why are you reading these comments at all? <br /> <br /> I would take it every day in the numerous reruns of "The Flaccid And The Tedious" (guess the franchise). 10.7
