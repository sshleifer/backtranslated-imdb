Fido is a cute comedy that deserves wider recognition, especially given the mainstream crap that is supposed to entertain us today. <br /> <br /> As mentioned before, this is hardly a real zombie movie, but rather a sweet satire that makes the undead point with his fingers. Although there are inevitably some bloody scenes, there is almost no thrill and the way in which this film is presented (feel-good style of the 50s). I can not imagine that anyone is really scared or shut down by Fido and his fellow sufferers. > <br /> Although the cast is generally good, I had the feeling that Moss and Nelson noticed. The humor is not in your face, but rather subdued; There is a lot of attention to detail and I started to smile with a good-natured smile throughout the movie. This is certainly not a masterpiece of cinema, but it does not want to be - instead, Currie manages to produce a heartwarming black comedy.
