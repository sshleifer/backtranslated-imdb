Spoiler! Classic 70s sex garbage! The Swedish gala (Helga) made this movie so great. She was beautiful, but what really brought me was how sexual she was. She radiated a huge amount of sexuality throughout the movie. Her best scenes were when she stimulated herself. Whenever she was on the screen, I was banished. <br /> <br /> Also, the doctor Julia (sister of the weak male focus of the film) was visually very interesting. Although most 12-year-old girls have bigger breasts than Julia, she knew how little she needed, and her scenes (especially the silk blouse and black skirt scenes) caught my attention inexorably. You also loved the big, hoarse scene in which the bats took off their nekkid; I do not know if I have ever seen anything more ridiculous and sexy. Classic stuff!
