This two-hour episode is a strong pilot who brilliantly sets up the characters and background for Enterprise, the prequel of the original Star Trek series. It stumbles a few times over "Trek" convention and clich√© - candy colored space strippers never seem to go out of fashion, and I can already foretell tickling references to T'pol as "Seven of Vulcan" - but the ensemble looks like The Characters are strongly drawn and there are already indications that this crew must be more ingenious in other ways than the earlier (later?) series. As captain, Scott Bakula meets the right note with Kirk's daring and daring. I'm looking forward to the way in which the series includes the engineer, the armorer and the communications officer (no longer just a glorified telephone operator!) As supportive players. The authors seem to have picked up on the big mistake made in "Star Trek: The Next Generation", "Deep Space 9" and "Voyager": Instead of starting with a big ensemble cast and giving the characters short notes Start a smaller core of characters that can be added a bit more variety later - which will hopefully happen, because after about half a dozen episodes more variety will be needed.
