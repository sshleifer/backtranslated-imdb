This movie is by far the cutest I've seen in a long time! Wonderful animations and lovable characters (even the bad guys were cute!) Made this the overall winner in my book and also in the books of those with whom I've seen it. I still want to see it, but I did not have time. Better than Toy Story, which was good, but not THIS good.
