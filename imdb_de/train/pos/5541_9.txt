A very atmospheric billiard costume that displays a great ingenuity in the use of props, sets and effects (fog, lighting, focus) to create a sinister and evocative texture. The story is far-fetched, the play is only functional, but it shows how imaginative effects can develop a whole visual narrative. This movie is recommended for its mood and texture, not for its story.
