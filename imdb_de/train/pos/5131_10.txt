Jammin 'the Blues is an Oscar-nominated short film from 1944, which essentially represents 10 minutes of improvisational jazz in a long jam. Marie Bryant sings "The Sunny Side of the Street" at one point for the highlight of the film and jacks with Archie Savage to bring this entertaining "jam session" to an exciting ending. Director Gojn Mili was a photographer and this experience shows in some double exposure shots of some musicians that this is one of the most innovative aspects of the 40s. According to some notes I read, one of the musicians was white and had to be shot in silhouette to reflect the social attitudes of the time. Too bad. However, this most unusual movie of the time is available on YouTube. If you love jazz, I suggest you look for it there.
