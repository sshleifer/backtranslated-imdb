In short, this movie is a cinematic masterpiece. The film is brilliantly moved by intense images that deeply move the sensitive viewer. The film begins during the Spanish Civil War when a group of children seek revenge on another child. In fact, they play in their world a version of what they have experienced in the adult world. Later, we meet three of these children as adults in a sanatorium. Here we see what life has done to each of them. One is a withdrawn, sexually oppressed patient. Another man is a hustler who has fallen ill. The third child, a young woman, has become a nun and serves in the sanatorium. This film is an allegory about the effects of violence on the psyche. <br /> <br /> This movie has a climax that is definitely not intended for the squeamish onlookers, but it is logical and deeply moving. The drama is excellent and the script is pretty well written. There is a music score, which in this film is an undercurrent of horror. This is not a movie for seekers, but a movie for a thoughtful audience.
