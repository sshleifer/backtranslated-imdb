The financially troubled Paramount pulled out all the stages for the 34-stage adaptation of the stage adaptation: large budget, large cast, extravagant production and Mitch Leisen as a director. What happened? Two things: Busby Berkeley did not work for out-of-focus rock and a murder mystery script that did not deserve to be in the same trash can as the worst Charlie Chan who first pulled down the street. I have to believe that the cut Leisen was out of the hands, since the number of the great Duke Ellington is brutally hacked, but that does not mean that it is worth a look: The 'Sweet Marijuana' number with topless chorus girls is a mind Blower, taking into account the looming production code, and it also has the gorgeous Toby Wing (whose unfortunate lines played terrible lines and played the prototype stupid blonde) as chorus for an otherwise occupied Jack Oakie. Carl Brisson's acting is boring as Melba Toast, but he is a competent singer. MacLaglen takes as stereotypical detective for new plateaus. And try to discover Lucy in the chorus. This is a curiosity of 7.0. Thinking back to Feb 2010: I recently reviewed the movie and feel wrong about complaining about the lack of production of Busby Berkeley. I can understand Leisen's argument for more realistic production figures in the context of the plot. However, I still have huge problems with editing. Paramount, the city's most racially-charged studio, had serious financial problems with the Production Code at the worst times in its history, pulling out all the stops on it (see 1934 Search for Beauty). A must for pre-code buffs.
