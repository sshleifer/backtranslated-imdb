We often see films about unwanted things in politics, but I still recommend "City Hall." In a role in which he was born, Al Pacino plays the mayor of New York, who has to deal with the shooting of a boy. It turns out, however, that nothing he does will really make a difference. In this movie, the characters are as bleak as we would expect of anyone involved in a political scandal. No matter how much you trust a particular politician, you may have doubts after watching this movie. <br /> <br /> I understand that I can not give a specific example of something similar to the movie in this movie, but that's not the point. If we had idealistic impressions of those at the top, this film tears up such ideas. Certainly one to which I encourage you to see. With John Cusack, Bridget Fonda, Danny Aiello, Anthony Franciosa and David Paymer.
