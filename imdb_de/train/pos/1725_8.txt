Played some 13 years later as a precursor to The Great Escape, this brutish little British movie plays it without thrill and can dare overkill. The first part of the film is the construction and subsequent flight of our protagonists, while the second part focuses on survival while trying to reach Sweden. The film is based on pure characters with simple, effective and credible dialogues to enforce, and it miraculously achieves its goals. There's not much suspense ticking the movie, and as an adventure story, it works perfectly for the time frame it's in, so a big thumbs up for the movie, which is perhaps the first of its kind? <br /> <br /> 7/10
