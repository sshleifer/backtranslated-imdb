This game is the bomb and this is the 007 game of the year and should be among the best hits. When I got Agent Under Fire, I thought that was a good game, but then Nightfire came and that was better, but now there's a new kind of James Bond game. This time it's a 3rd person shooter and there are more than 12 missions, the graphics of the game is outside of this house. It even has all the great actors and actresses in the game, such as Pierce Bronsan as James Bond, William Dafoe as villain Nikolai Diavolo, and Judi Dench as M (forgive everything if I misspell it). This game would be the best James Bond game out there. <br /> <br /> I give this 10/10
