Surviving Christmas is a surprisingly funny movie, especially considering that the public was bad at the beginning of the release. Ben Affleck is funny as a disgusting millionaire who pays the family living in his childhood at home to be his family for Christmas. Then he drives the family crazy because he is happy for Christmas. I have not been a Ben Affleck fan in the past (though I liked Daredevil and Paycheck), but here he is well-placed in this role. I also like Christina Applegate as a daughter in the family, the Afflecks character initially dislike. Surely you can see where this movie is going, but you do not care. Ignore what the critics say, and rent this movie because it's funnier than many Christmas movies.
