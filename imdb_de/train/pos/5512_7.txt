The first meant victory. This means defeat. It takes place in a Bolivia, where the guerrillas are sick and watchful and do not meet with so much sympathy among the peasants. If you know your 60s story, you know how it ends. You will understand it without this knowledge. Del Toro is once again great. He builds this symbol further on the revolutionary who remains the same regardless of success or failure. Legend has it that Guevara is like that, but still it plays so well. <br /> <br /> The documentary feel is around the symbol, which is one of the biggest achievements of this great Soderbergh project. He did it.
