Well done, but basically desolate low-life melodrama, which, according to the accompanying interview with Isabelle Huppert, author / director Pialat, pervades many autobiographical details; He is not complimented by the mainly disagreeable characters - and he seems to have been a troubled man, as Huppert also says that Pialat often disappeared for days during filming! <br /> <br /> The spectacle, however, is consistently outstanding; Despite their relatively young age, Huppert and co-star Gerard Depardieu (as the title character!) Were already at the forefront of modern French stars - a status that both continue to claim with varying degrees of success. <br /> I have 3 more films from Pialat in my "VHS To Watch" stack, but all in French without English subtitles; Because of this fact, but also the oppressive realism of LOULOU - despite his indisputable artistic merit - I can not say that I am in a hurry to review them now ...
