I have recently read the novel "Mother Night", I have owned the DVD for some time and watch it again and again. Few films I own and have seen have made me think and question as much as Mother Night. I am amazed at the brilliance that prevails not only from Vonnegut, but also from the translation of his text on the screen. Do not rent or watch this film on VHS, it has to be done on DVD and must be accompanied by a comment from the director to the film , To see them record a fairly simple story with complex substance and dialogue and make it work so well, I think every viewer will be thrilled. <br /> <br /> The omissions in this film are few words and do not distract much from the fact that the movie might as well be the book and is the best adaptation I've ever seen. I recommend both book and movie so much that it does a disservice, if you just say, close. <br /> <br /> It will change you if you do it.
