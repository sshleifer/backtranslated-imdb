As a "re-shuttle" to the 100 best films of the AFI, the British Film Institute has worked out a documentary with Martin Scorsese. I'm a big movie fan and I'm proud to have seen many, many movies. But I am now in conflict with my idol. In this fantastic (albeit long) documentary, Scorsese takes the viewer through several phases of American history. This is divided into several sections, including the Western, the Gangster movie and the Noir. Martin Scorsese is full of enthusiasm and a great tour guide as well as a fantastic professor.
