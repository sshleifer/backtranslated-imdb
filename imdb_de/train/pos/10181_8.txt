I originally bought this DVD because it had SRK and Aishwarya Rai on the cover, and I thought, hey! Another movie with Aishu and Shah Rukh. I did not know that Aishwarya would appear in the last quarter of the movie only in an article number that she shares with SRK's protocol. Shakti is a movie about the love and perseverance of a mother. It's a film about transformations, ignorance, growing up, immersing in knowledge and addressing the harsh realities of life. The article number in which SRK and Aishu appear has nothing to do with the film. It's actually a dream sequence that occurs while the drunken character of SRK is drunk on alcohol. He dreams that Aishwarya Rai is this sexy street girl who appears one day at her favorite location, lightly dressed and starts seducing him. The title of the song is "Ishq Kamina" (loosely called "Love is a slut!") And it's just hot! Do not miss it.
