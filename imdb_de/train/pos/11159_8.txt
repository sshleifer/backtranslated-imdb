This is a wonderful movie ... First impressions of cynicism and crass are quickly dispelled by a fun-loving portrayal of the different motives of women and women (Vive la difference!). You can spite people and sometimes because of their weaknesses. People are really a bit of garbage, but we have big hearts and we try our best, despite temptation. It is not our fault if sometimes the temptation can not be resisted. That's exactly what we are. <br /> <br /> There is consistent styling from start to finish. crisp photography and sharp composition, very pleasant viewing when adding provocative content, well suited music and loud laughter laugh. <br /> <br /> Pay attention to the very young "lonely voice" ... brilliant; Wisdom of innocence balancing comedy from human condition.
