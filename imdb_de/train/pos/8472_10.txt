I do not agree at all. I thought this was a great movie for kids. Fountain from the island of Gilligans, promising to see a barely-known dana plato. It's not scary and was not meant to be. I will not ruin the end. But it was unusual how it was done. The plot also had much more to do with these children than you say, the fact that these children were experienced fishermen is, above all, very central to the plot at the beginning. It also helps them to jam towards the end of the congestion. I think it takes too long
