This is not the best romantic comedy ever made, but it is definitely beautiful and good to see. It's old fashioned and it works well. Cybill Shepherd as Corinne is not bad in her role as a woman who can not overcome her husband's death. She has a sexy maturity. But I can not say much for Ryan O'Neal as Philip, because at best he is inconspicuous. He may be appropriate in the role, but that's not good enough. <br /> <br /> However, I feel that some of the characters, especially Alex and Miranda, are not written with enough deep thought. We do not know anything else about them, because minutes after their appearance the story gets fatter and the authors do not tell us much about what's going on. However, this issue has been resolved because Mary Stuart Masterson has a fresh sweetness to whiten it, and Robert Downey Jr. is so charming that he melts the screen. Even his smile is contagious. And so it happens that his big, dreamy eyes are perfect for the Deja-Vu and Flashback scenes. <br /> <br /> This movie is easy and simple anyway. If you like them so much, give it a try. <br /> <br />
