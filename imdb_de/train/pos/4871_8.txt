To understand and enjoy the situation, the characters and the jokes of 'Zavet', as well as many of the other Kusturica films, requires a Serbian or at least a familiarity with the Balkans. For example, look at the opening scenes with the remote village in the Serbian mountains, with the low-tech devices that defend the integrity and lifestyles of the inhabitants, the nostalgia after the good days of Communist rule, and the awakening of the young brat his naked teacher at the sounds of the Soviet anthem. Not only does Kusturica try to deviate from the tragic history of Serbia he described in his previous films, but he creates a whole world of his own. <br /> <br /> This is not a political film or an explicit political film in definitely. It is, above all, a funny movie. Kusturica creates a group of characters that are important to us. Music plays an active role in this film as in all of his other films. His style is direct and grotesque, we now feel about his characters and know that he wants us to feel the same way. The space he develops merges present, history and magic, and the colors seem to resemble a Douanier Rousseau of modern cinema. <br /> <br /> This is not a perfect movie either. The main mistake is the length, some editing and shortening would have been useful as the director eventually run out of ideas and repetitions appear. It's still one of the most intriguing, fun and moving films I've seen lately.
