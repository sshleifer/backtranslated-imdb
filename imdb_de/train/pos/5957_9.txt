The title says it all. <br /> <br /> I am not a film critic and I will not behave like the rest of the snobbish people who comment on this movie. I have a budget of several million dollars but the plot was very well done, the show was great and the cinematography was great! It looked like you all had fun filmmaking! I chose 9 out of 10 votes because the sound was strong for only one channel instead of both. However, I think that this was possibly a mistake when recording the DVD. <br /> <br /> I will definitely check out other movies from Brain Damage Films! <br /> <br /> Dylan O'Leary, cast and crew, thank you!
