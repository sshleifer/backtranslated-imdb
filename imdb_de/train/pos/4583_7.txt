I saw this on a Cantonese VCD with English subtitles. I thought the story was good, but there were times when some of the characters were grossly exaggerated. This took away the movie as well as the pretty lame music that really annoyed me throughout the movie. When the score improved, I was able to overlook the few rerecoded scenes. Then the movie would be much, much better.
