I really enjoyed this debut of Ringo director Hideo Nakata. If you have seen Ring before, you are familiar with the style and idea of ​​this strip. It has a subtle spook that works better than the steady (and predictable) stingers that infect most of the mainstream movies in the genre. If you like movies that give you goosebumps then you will probably like this movie. A good, scary debut by Hideo Nakata. 8.10
