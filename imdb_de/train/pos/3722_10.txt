At first I saw this movie without knowing anything about it. I only knew that Joel Schumacher did and that was enough for me. A friend and I watched a Danish film festival called the Night Film Festival this time, which shows a lot of movies shown after hours. The festival is pretty much specialized in showing films that would not otherwise be shown in Danish theaters /> <br /> My friend and I looked at it, and we were amazed at how real it seemed and that it was by our feelings really lumped together. We were really entangled in the plot without our being able to figure this out. That's a big plus in our book. <br /> <br /> The film was shot in a style reminiscent of the Danish initiative "Dogma 95" by 4 Danish directors, including Lars von Trier (Dancer In The Dark). <br /> <br /> In summary, the movie is really worth seeing. He Gives Another Perspective on Things for the American GI Joe will be leaving school expecting to serve his country a long way from home. <br /> <br /> Also Colin Farrell is exceptional in this movie. I have never seen him, but I can not wait to see him more from him. <br /> <br /> Lars P. Helvard
