This is indeed a treat for any Bolan fan, some may think that it's a little over the top and that it's all about Ringo and Marc's ego, but I think it's just like any other concert video, except for the fact that it's so is Marc Bolan, not just any guy! I especially liked the music video for children of the revolution, with Elton John and Ringo Starr. This clip alone is worth all the money, I can not believe that they have not released this version as a single. The movie is really great, especially for us Danes. Well, I was not alive in the 70s. but generally the Danes were shot out of what was happening around them. The media did not play or show any of the popular music, including Marc Bolan and T. Rex, they just played a bit with The Doors, just the really popular songs. Well, I know from my dad that this is part of his youth, he has never experienced it. <br /> <br /> I do not do that too long, so ... If you are the smallest fan of Marc Bolan, you have to see that. You may find it boring or, as I said, a bit over the top. But at least you've seen one of the best musicians of all time, in action! <br /> <br /> The only thing that makes me a little disappointed is that Ride A White Swan is not on the band. but I forgive it because Jeepster and Get It On are so wonderfully played.
