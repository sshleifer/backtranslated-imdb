It's certainly not a classic, but it's full of classic lines. One of the few movies that my friends and I quote from all the time is fifteen years later (maybe it was too often on Cinemax!) To figure out how to play it - but it's surrounded by a fantastic cast that knows exactly how to play this parody. Are you looking for a movie that will cheer you up? That's it, but hire it with friends - it will make it even better.
