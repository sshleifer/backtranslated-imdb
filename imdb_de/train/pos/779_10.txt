In northeastern Brazil, the father of twelve-year-old illiterate Maria (Fernanda Carvalho) sells his daughter to the middle man of the prostitution organization Tadeu (Chico Dias) to become a house maid and lead a better life. However, the girl is resold to the farmer Lourenço (Otávio Augusto), who deflowles her, and he gives the abused girl to his teenage son to make his first sexual experience. Then she is sent to a brothel in a gold field in the Amazon and explores his owner, the despicable Saraiva (Antonio Calloni). When Maria flees to Rio de Janeiro to expect a better life, she is explored by the Cáften Vera (Darlene Glória). <br /> <br /> "Anjos do Sol" reveals the sad and shameful reality of child prostitution in Brazil destiny of the girl Maria. Last year, I saw "Lilja 4-ever," which tells an identical story in the former Soviet Union. Therefore, there is this problem in third world countries. The director and author Rudi Lagemann presents a great film that shows reality but never nudity or explicit sexual scenes. It is the debut of the promising Fernanda Carvalho, who performs excellently in the role of a frightened child struggling to survive. Most prostitutes are amateurs, and it is impossible to tell the famous Darlene Glória that she is so different after many plastic surgeries. The bitter and hopeless end of the story is also very realistic. My voice is ten. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Anjos do Sol" ("Angel of the Sun")
