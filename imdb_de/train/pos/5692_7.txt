This is the second movie based on the life and time of ultra-hungry pornstar John Curtis Estes, better known as John Holmes. Boogie Nights is also roughly based on his life. Maybe someday somebody will make a movie about the life of Tommy Byron. <br /> <br /> The problem is that the story is not told very well. There are many Law & Order episodes that have more twists and turns than Wonderland, and the director never gets the criminal case with any kind of rapture. Val Kilmer has two problems - he is nowhere near hanging like Holmes (and this time no prosthetic, unlike Boogie Nights), and he looks much better than Mope Holmes. <br /> <br /> The director does not introduce a single sympathetic person among the performers. The racist, immature lowlifes he's with, or his wife, and the police are not much in the way of characterization. <br /> <br /> The best part of the movie is Eric Bogosian, who tells Paris Hilton to "get lost". <br /> <br /> After all, anyone interested in the worst side of porn business in the 1980s or the real crime should not miss it.
