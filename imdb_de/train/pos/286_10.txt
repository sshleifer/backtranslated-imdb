I read a lot of commits when it was in the cinemas and they were all bad ... I think you have to be a specific person to enjoy these movies. If you are not a person who has enjoyed the Waltons or the little house ... you will not be able to understand or enjoy these movies. Now about Loves Abiding Joy ... I knew he was bad news from The beginning of the movie .... I wish he had shown more of the end instead of just letting her think about it. This movie has a lot to do with Jeff ... he's 6 years later, so you know he'll be interested in girls. <br /> <br /> I would like to say that I have enjoyed all 4 films so far. ... was not crazy about the books ... I can not wait until the next movie. The way Clark speaks will get you every time. I would like to see how January Jones makes an appearance ... maybe a family reunion or something.
