Yes, Shakespeare would indeed have been proud. Laurence Fishburne was not at his best, but certainly not bad. Kenneth Brannagh, on the other hand, was brilliant. His plan was wonderful, just as he played with the audience. Very good work. <br /> <br /> There was sometimes too little drama where more was expected. Cassio's death, for example, was a little clouded because too many events were too far apart, causing the viewer to turn his head to capture everything. <br /> <br /> Did I mention Michael Maloney? His madness like Roderigo was unusual; annoying even. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen Othello yet, you will see it. If you have not read Othello, read this. If you have not heard Othello, you will see this. On the other hand, you do yourself a favor by reading it, seeing how it was played on stage, and also hearing it sung.
