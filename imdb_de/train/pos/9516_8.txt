Tom Hanks, as if you had never seen him before. Hanks plays Michael Sullivan, "The Angel of Death". He is a hitman for his replacement father John Rooney (Paul Newman), an elderly Irish mob boss. Sullivan's little son (Tyler Hoechlin) testifies to what his father does for a living, and they are both on their way for seven weeks robbing banks to avenge the murder of Sullivan's wife and other son. Enter Jude Law as a reporter / photographer willing to kill Sullivan himself to include the collection of dead gangsters in his collection. Filmed beautifully the drama of life in the 30s. Sometimes the tempo drops, but a burst of graphic violence keeps the story up. Director Sam Mendes directs this powerful drama about loyalty, responsibility, betrayal, and the bondage of a secret man and his young son. Other notable performers include Dylan Baker, Stanley Tucci, Daniel Craig and Jennifer Jason Leigh. Hanks once again proved excellent in a memorable movie. Make room for some Oscars!
