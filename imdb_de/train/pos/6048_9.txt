What a great piece of British cinema! It's time. And a side-splitting comedy to boot! <br /> <br /> If you want to relive a bit of freedom from your miserable youth, this road movie will prove. <br /> <br /> It's a mix of "witnail and me" and "easy rider". The movie runs at a solid pace and will not let you drift too long ... Sometimes there are reflective moments, but I think they are well justified and contribute to the characters that the actors represent. I was a little bit worried about the character of Phil Daniels in the beginning, but thankfully he was half won in one of the funniest scenes in the entire movie! In general, I laughed through the movie as if I were annoying some people around me. Well. <br /> <br /> I would highly recommend it. This becomes a British cult comedy. Worth a visit
