This movie started with a Nick Cage kick. It's a story full of twists - a movie of motives and movements. Of course, Dennis Hopper was a ham, but J.T. Walsh and Laura Flyyn Boyle are the perfect couple to catch the unsuspecting man who got into their net. Everything about this film is good - cinematography, storytelling and, above all, the end. Cage stands out for what he does best - it's not an action hero, but an everyman who falls into the trap of life.
