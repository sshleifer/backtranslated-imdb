This film is from the suburbs of Philadelphia and is very interested in local history. It offers a superb vintage view of Philadelphia in the 1940s. There are scenes of downtown, a station that no longer exists, 30th Street Station - which still exists, and scenes from the northeast of the city. Good shots of the old row houses, as they appeared then. The movie sometimes gets a bit "talkative" - ​​the viewer briefly loses interest ... but the whole plot is solid and very moving. Anyone who enjoyed the movie should also watch the movie "Bright Victory," including local footage of the Valley Forge Army Hospital in Phoenixville, Pennsylvania, and scenes from downtown Phoenixville. The Army Hospital has since become a college campus. None of these films are available on any format, and I can not imagine why. I've both recorded on VHS from home, as shown on TCM in recent years. I highly recommend them to any history buffs in my area!
