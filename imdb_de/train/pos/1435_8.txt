I appreciate movies like these: chic and well done, entertaining, exciting, good natured and nicely addressed. No one - even Pacino - chews the landscape * and tries to stand out; One of the most effective moments of the film (Aielo is passing his beloved ramp) is chilling just because of his reserve: involving the mind as well as eye, ear and heart. It's hard to say why well-hewn entertainment flops are at the box office. <br /> <br /> * You know, Pacino chews it in a particular scene, but that's precisely because it's required. Great scene too.
