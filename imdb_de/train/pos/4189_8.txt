Richard Widmark is a corrupt character in this movie. He is a professional pickpocket. He was in prison three times, but at the beginning of the film he tries to make it four. Thelma Ritter is a busy facility that sells information to almost everyone. Jean Peters is amazing when Widmark's girl was flamed. <br /> <br /> This is a play from the McCarthy era in which the Red Scare dominated politics and is very well incorporated into this conspiracy. The special feature of this film is that at a time when women were rarely more than sex objects in films, Peters & Ritter were victims of violent beatings. That makes this movie a noir, as women often get different roles in this kind of movie. <br /> <br /> The film is only 87 minutes long and was obviously designed by Fox as a sub-box for dual functions in the theater. The sets show that this is a limited budget movie. The screenplay freaked out J. Edgar Hoover because patriotism only gets a little knickknack. Hoover wanted it to be changed. <br /> <br /> Instead, it became a B under a map image that became a sleeper-hunter in 1953. The script and acting are better than other big features this year.
