Every year during the first week of May, the memories of the Holocaust are recaptured through television films. Among many films they showed, this was the one I had not seen. <br /> <br /> The story is about Hilter's life and how he came to power. It starts with his childhood and ends with him holding the highest position of power in Germany. <br /> <br /> The film was previously presented as a television series and later converted into a film format. The Scottish actor Robert Carlyle plays Adolf Hitler with great courage, conviction and excitement to convey a true portrayal of this man. <br /> <br /> It's a good script and a narrative that educates the public about the main events that Hitler is leading and trying to show Hitler's probable psychological makeup. The film is a biased viewpoint of the director Christian Duguay? Who shows Hitler as a one-headed, threatening, angry and screaming person? Who had the Germans and the people around him so strong control. Hitler is not shown as someone with charisma and attraction, and there the film can not convince Hitler's presentation. <br /> <br /> Although the venture referred to the television, all the ingredients of the production are top notch and equivalent mainstream movie. The production value, the sets, the costumes etc. were perfect. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of criticism of this film, of the authenticity of historical events. But the movie is still gripping, everyone rousing and entertaining. Robert Carlyle overwhelms and dominates the screen like no other. He is amazingly good? brilliant! I would have liked a more balanced picture of Hitler's life because I believe that Hitler could express the sleeping feelings of millions of Germans and not only that he should be held responsible for the Holocaust. As I have said several times that ?? Very sad - our society loves to crown or persecute a person as a representative of the good or evil of society.
