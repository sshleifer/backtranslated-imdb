Gillian Holroyd (Kim Novak) is a witch. Secretly she attracts her normal neighbor Shep Henderson (James Stewart). She casts a spell on Shep, who forces him to throw his fiancé and become interested in her. Things are going pretty well until Gillian discovers that she's really interested in this mortal man. She decides to tell him her secret. But how will shep react when he finds out that he has been seduced into falling in love with Gillian? <br /> <br /> As far as light-hearted comedies from the '50s are concerned, Bell Book and Candle are good, but nothing special. It's a brilliant watch and should appeal to almost anyone who sits down with it. Just do not go into the movie and expect the biggest since sliced ​​bread. The movie is cute, sometimes funny and touching at the end. Kim Novak and James Stewart do their best and have real chemistry. Novak (as others have already mentioned) looks unbelievably unbelievable. The side cast with Jack Lemmon, Hermione Gingold and Elsa Lanchester is often funny and pays much attention to Novak and Stewart. The biggest problem I see is that Bell Book and Candle can not decide exactly what kind of movie it wants to be. Is it a screwball comedy? Is it a romantic comedy? Is it a supernatural comedy? If director Richard Quine had chosen only one approach, the film might have been even better and more memorable.
