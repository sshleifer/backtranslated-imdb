I found that a deeply amusing dark comedy. Brosnan is a genius; As everyone will testify, he must not be included in the binding role. Kinnear was as charismatic and as funny as anyone in the role could have been. I do not know if I laughed so much in any movie! What an unexpected pleasure! My favorite line would be "I feel like a Bangkok hooker on a Sunday after the Navy leaves town." Brosnan provided this very noncommittal line with such unexpected comedic finesse. I was also very impressed with the performance of Hope Davis. It seems that everyone in this film has gone so far from his previous work that the comedy has actually been improved. If you liked the dark and funny "The Weather Man", you will definitely like it. <br /> <br /> I chose 10.
