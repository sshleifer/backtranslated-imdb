Bela Lugosi appeared in several of these low-budget coolers for Monogram Studios in the 1940s, and The Corpse Vanishes is one of the better. Bela plays a mad scientist who abducts young brides, kills her and then extracts liquid from her body so he can look young at his aging wife. After a reporter and a doctor spend the night in his house and find out that he is responsible for the bride's death, they report the murders to the police the next morning, and the mad scientist is shot dead and dead shortly thereafter. <br /> <You have almost everything in this movie: the assistant's assistants consist of an old hail, a hunchback and dwarf (their sons), a thunderstorm and scary passages in Bela's house. Bela and his wife think that they sleep better in coffins than beds in the movie. <br /> <br /> The Corpse Vanishes is well worth a look, especially for Bela Lugosi fans. Have fun. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3 of 5 stars.
