Randolph Scott travels to Albuquerque to take a job with his uncle. On the way there, however, the stage is stopped - although they do not have a vault room with them. However, a nice lady on board hides $ 10,000 for her and her brother's business ... and the robbers seem to know that. <br /> <br /> Once in town, Scott goes to this uncle to get the job done. However, he soon learns that this uncle is an idiot - the typical villain of Western. You know, the rich guy who just wants to get richer by cheating, stealing, and threatening until he owns everything. And by chance, that jolt was behind the robbery. Scott demands that the uncle returns the money, and then Scott goes into business with the nice lady and her brother. <br/> <br /> It's not surprising that this is NOT the end of the problem - just the beginning. Again and again there are intrigues of various kinds to crush the opposition of the uncle. A trick is to make a pretty lady with Scott and his partners. She's a hit and it looks bad for Scott - until he finds out why she came to town. <br /> <br /> Unlike most of Randolph Scott's later films, this one shows Scott as a more idiosyncratic man. In his films he is too often the last to point to violence. In this movie, however, he quickly suggests lynching (screw the law, let us hang) and later threatens his uncle quickly. What a surprise to see him as such a hot-blooded head - though in most other ways he's the same old Scott you'd expect. <br /> <br /> As far as the movie is concerned, that's nothing special. Gabby Hayes plays the usual character, Scott is a hero, the villain can not be justified and is eventually destroyed and Scott gets the girl. Despite this very typical plot, everything is handled very well and is therefore worth your time. <br /> <br /> By the way, there are two strange scenes in the movie. First, late in the movie, there's a fist fight between Scott and his uncle's # 1 stooge, Lon Chaney, Jr. .. Chaney smokes it while he's fighting - something I've never seen before, and I admired how he could inflate away when he got kicked his butt. Second, get a load of this out-of-control car scene with the whip - now that was an impossible achievement!
