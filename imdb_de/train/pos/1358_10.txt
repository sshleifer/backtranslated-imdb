Season after season, the players or characters on this show seem to be people you would absolutely hate. Has this show been manipulated or been selected for the same? Each episode defeats a single person and ends up being killed. You enjoy watching it being screwed, even though it is completely wrong and sick. You enjoy seeing them beating up on others, beating themselves, playing dirty games, getting back, escaping, and finally getting thrown out by Trump. The number of tears also seems to increase with the season. <br /> <br /> The rewards that try to compensate for past humiliation and suffering are also greatly reduced. In the newer seasons it says "you get to know xyx, who will teach you about uvw". The characters are collectively and individually so hateful that you wonder if they are paid actors? The only healthy person can win. <br /> <br /> Caution is advised and the conscience is preserved. These are your fellow men in the line of fire.
