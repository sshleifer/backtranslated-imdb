This movie was a fantastic comedy. It had many comedians like Akshay Kumar, Rajpal Yadav, Paresh Raval and John Abraham. <br/> <br /> Rimi Sen could play Akshay Kumar's wife well and so were all the stewardesses. Mr. Hot as Mac (Akshay Kumar) and Mr. Cool as Sam (John Abraham) are two fashion photographers who like the same girl Maggie (Neha Dupia). When John Abraham cheats on his work, he becomes Akshay Kumar's senior and Akshay Kumar becomes really jealous because his apartment must be given to John Abraham and Neha Dupia John likes more and more. Akshay Kumar wants to be better than John Abraham, so he finds an apartment and goes out with three different girls (Nitu Chandra, Nargis Bagheri, Daisy Boppana).
