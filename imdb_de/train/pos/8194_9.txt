Despite the other comments listed here, this is probably the best Dirty Harry movie. A film that reflects the country's socio-political feelings in the Reagan glory years of the early 1980s - for better or for worse. It's also a kick-ass action movie. <br /> <br /> Opening with a liberal, female judge overturning a murder case for lack of evidence and then bumping into the coffee shop and with several unfortunate Hoodlums (the scene that encourages them to speak the famous line "Come on, make my day"), "Sudden Impact" is a non-stop roller coaster of an action movie. The first time you gasp, annoying Inspector Callahan is sent to a nearby town to investigate the background of a murdered hood. From there it only gets better with a towering group of grotesque thugs that Callahan and a sheriff have to deal with in a mysterious past. Outstanding directing and photography as well as a sometimes funny script make this film one of the best of the 80s.
