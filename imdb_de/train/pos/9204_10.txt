The story for Hare Rama Hare Krishna actually came to Dev Anand's mind when he saw hippies and their fallen values ​​in Kathmandu, where he was visiting after the protests against his former Prem Pujari in Calcutta. He was in a bad mood because his film had been rejected and some of Prem Pujari's posters had been burned. But the hippies' life sparked a story in Dev's mind, which was to be turned into a movie. <br /> <br /> This was perhaps the best directorial work by Dev Anand. The movie was a blockbuster super hit at the box office and Zeenat Aman as Dev's sister made a huge impression. <br /> <br /> This film was Dev Anand's call to the nation to uphold its moral values. <br /> <br /> This is a Montereal-based Indian family, and the role of the brother is very affectionate to his sister. But the parents quarrel and separate from Prashant (Dev) with mother and Jasbir (Zeenat) with father. She is repeatedly told that her mother and brother are dead, and she finally believes that she will never see Prashant again. <br /> <br /> She is treated ill by her stepmother and runs away from home. Dev grows up as a pilot and learns that Jasbir is in Kathmandu with certain hippies. In order to meet his sister, Dev travels to Kathmandu and meets Shanti (Mumtaz), who would later marry him also Janice, who is actually Jasbir, with a new name and a new identity. She has forgotten her childhood and also her dev. <br /> <br /> Dev has to bring his sister back from all the other happenings he belongs to as a thief in Kathmandu, and people are after his life. <br /> This was a story by Dev Anand was well directed and played. We see more of Zeenat Aman than Mumtaz. But the music of Rahul Dev Burman was well composed. Dev had first offered the music to be composed by Sachin Dev Burman, but Burman Da did not want Dev to make the film. He was very close to Dev and his earlier film Prem Pujari, although he was good, but had been against it in Calcutta. Burman wanted Dev to try a lighter topic because he felt the hippie cult film could revive people's anger against Dev. But Dev continued with the movie that reassured Burman Da, and the film was indeed a success. <br /> <br /> R D Burman had Asha Bhosle sing the award-winning Dum Maro Dum. Kanchi re Kanchi re was another good number. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's a good movie.
