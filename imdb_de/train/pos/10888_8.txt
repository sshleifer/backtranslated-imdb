This is one of those little Christmas movies for everyone. Our affrontist is Ben Affleck, who decides that money is not enough. He rents the family who lives where he believes he believed his family. OK? This is a great high school soap, PG-13, but the little sexual cues are a comedy. If your child can not cope, it can not live in the real world either. <br /> <br /> Well, Affleck is a guy, and as usual, this fun walk, OMG, remember when we ... had an ensemble piece as if he was at the end of a neuroinfectious illness. But that's fine, because even this old Oracle still hopes that if Ben is so well proportioned, well, there is still hope for us ladies. Luckily, the rest of the ensemble - Catharine O'Hara, James Gandolfini, Christina Applegate, Udo Kier, and Josh Zuckerman - are alternately funny, cozy, and warm with this Shadow Ozzie and Harriet Christmas. <br /> In this movie, you can jump up and get popcorn, and when you come back, everyone wants to back it up to show you what you've missed. <br /> <br /> This is a happy movie and you feel good about life, love, family, Christmas and Chanel. There really is something for everyone.
