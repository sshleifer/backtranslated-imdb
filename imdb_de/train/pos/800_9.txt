I could not have been more excited; I was just eight years old in 1983 and wanted to see a Star Wars movie in the theater! The best day of my life should happen. At that time, my only Star Wars experience was a couple of Star Wars HBO shows. I had not even seen The Empire Strikes Back yet. <br /> <br /> And boy, this day worked for my less critical eyes. Jabba Great rebel spaceships. The Emperor A lightsaber with green blades !! Impressive! Since that magical day, I have seen this movie hundreds of times. I can not even give an accurate estimate here. Of course, during these multiple visits, I realized that this movie - the REAL Episode III - has its shortcomings. <br /> <br /> Of course these "mistakes" related to a Star Wars movie are more like "quirks". <br /> <br /> Millions had their magical day in 1977 and 1980. In May 1983, I had mine. And that was my Star Wars movie.
