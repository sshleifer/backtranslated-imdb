"Zabriskie Point" (1970): That was particularly interesting for me personally, since it takes place under identical circumstances, with identical colleagues in my own life? the counterculture movement of the late 60s / early 70s, on and off campus. We follow two independent young people in separate stories that are slowly interwoven. One is a young man in Los Angeles, tired of the endless, pseudo-revolutionary chatter in the classrooms and lunchrooms of his campus, and the other a young woman who goes to Phoenix to visit her father and her employer and join them to meet a man "branch" job. The film is FULL of the visual notes of our Italian director (Michelangelo Antonioni) about America and the confused Psychedelicrazies of this self-righteous era of this era: "We know everything, we will do everything for the better youth". Who is the "revolutionary"? What does that REALLY mean? Are you getting dressed and marching around? Do you fly "under the radar" and announce your arrival in advance? Do you keep your plans and make the change without requiring a group permit? "Zabriskie Point" is definitely a "period piece" - full of slang, uniforms, some surreal movie moments (after all, this is a film of the man who gave us the amazing "Blow Up" of 1966) and the artifacts of that era though more. It offers options for a cultural revolution, and Antonioni (who seems to support that), the youth is too self-responsible to see what is needed for a radical success. Because of this, it becomes a powerful, terrifying film that applies to everyone, anytime, anywhere.
