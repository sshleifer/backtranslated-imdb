I enjoyed this movie as a kid when it came out and is still doing today. A simple story in which the search for a kidnapped girl and an adventurer was literally done directly from paperback history. It has actors that were recognizable earlier. This should not prevent the viewer from giving him a fuss. Wayne Crawford plays the main character Jake Speed. Sure, it could bite on certain elements of Romancing the Stone and Indiana Jones. But this movie is good enough to keep it out of the basement. I am surprised that not many people know about it. It must have been overshadowed by other films in cinemas in 1986. I saw it on cable TV back then. It may be hard to find because it is no longer printed on both VHS and DVD. I managed to get a DVD from Ebay for less than $ 8! Cool strip.
