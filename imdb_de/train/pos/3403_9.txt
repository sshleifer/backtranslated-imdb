Gorgeous Techicolor production tells the story of the unusual romance between a woman of strong religious faith and a Trappist monk who left his monastery and broke his vow. The film opens in a convent in Europe where a former student is praying - a lonely black beauty named Domini (Marlene Dietrich). She is recommended by the mother's matron to go to the desert and "find herself" and lose her grief over her recently deceased father. On the way to the Sahara, she sits in the train carriage opposite a very, very restless man (Charles Boyer) - our former monk. She soon arrives at a hotel near a palm-covered oasis, where she sees our mysterious, disturbed man again, wondering what to do when confronted with a seductive dancer. Domini makes friends with him, but knows nothing about his past - romance will follow soon. <br /> <br /> This film is sentimental, melodramatic and different (in a sense almost surreal and even a bit clumsy) - I found it rather funny and entertaining. The photography here is really interesting - it's full of extreme close-ups and beautiful color shots of horse-drawn carts crossing the desert, silhouetted figures in front of a sunset sky. Marlene Dietrich gives a well-done, albeit restrained performance and looks ravishing. Charles Boyer - usually not one of my favorites - is actually pretty good at it, I think the part suits him and he looks pretty young and pretty too. Basil Rathbone is fine here, unless he has little to do. Another great orchestral score by Max Steiner helps keep the drama going - all in all a very entertaining movie.
