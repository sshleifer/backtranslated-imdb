"Casomai" is a masterful story showing the story of a young couple wading through the murky waters of marriage. The story is very credible when it comes to saying the weird seesaw between forgetting and constantly interfering with others, which is quite typical in Italy (though one may wonder if such events are different elsewhere). Pavignano and D'Alatri wrote very well, and that's one of the movie's strong points. The acting of Stefania Rocca and Fabio Volo is sober and enthralling. And the figure of the sympathetic priest is funny and rounded. All in all a really deserved movie, probably one of the best Italian films of the year.
