I'm 14 years old, so you'd probably think I'd never heard of George Burns or Walter Matthau or anything like that. Boy, are you lying wrong? I had heard that George Burns was in this movie and that he received an Oscar for it. I'm a fan of George Burns since I was ten years old. I've seen the movie Oh, God lately and loved it. This was also very good. George Burns did a great job. Walter Matthau (this is the first time I have seen him perform). And though they really did have small roles, Phyllis Diller and Steve Allen have done a good job. That special they were filming would have been fantastic if it was really done. If you are a fan of George Burns or Walter Matthau, you should see this movie right away!
