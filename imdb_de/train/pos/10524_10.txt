Jane Austen would definitely approve of that! <br /> <br /> Gwyneth Paltrow does a great job of capturing Emma's attitude. She is funny without being overly stupid and elegant. She sets a very convincing British accent (not even British, maybe I'm not the best judge, but she was wrong about me ... she was also excellent in Sliding Doors ... I forget sometimes that she is American! <br /> <br /> Also ingenious are Jeremy Northam and Sophie Thompson and Phyllida Law (Emma Thompson's sister and mother) as Bates women, almost stealing the show ... and Miss Law does not even have lines! /> <br /> Highly recommended.
