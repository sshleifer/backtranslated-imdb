I really loved this version of Emma best. Kate Beckinsale was great as Emma and Mark strong was very good as chivalrous. The only complaint I had was to Mr. Woodhouse. I can not believe that a man can cry so much or be so selfish with his daughter's life. As always, I love the places where these Jane Austin films were made. The settings are so spectacular. I think the actors selected for this movie were also a good choice and all the other storylines that are best crossed with Emmas! I am glad that I saw this too.
