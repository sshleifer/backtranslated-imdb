Pinjar is one of the few films that really leaves its mark and makes you think. This film used in Partition India shows the true reality of Partition India. Urmila gets full marks for her beautiful and deeply emotional depiction of a suffering woman who has no way to go. Their freedom, personal identity and family respect were taken overnight in a tragic land dispute. Manoj Bajpai is just brilliant as her repent kidnapper. There are some moments in the movie where one is brought to tears. The film is at times profoundly traumatic. Some of the partition scenes are daunting, but the endurance and survival of Urmila are remarkable. From a woman deprived of her freedom to a woman who gave women freedom in similar situations. A remarkable movie that should be recognized for smart characters and storytelling.
