I loved this movie since I saw it in 1979 for the first time. I'm still amazed how exactly Kurt Russell depicts Elvis, just how he moves and how he expresses himself. Sometimes it's scary how much he looks, behaves and how the real Elvis speaks. Fortunately, this is released on DVD, so anyone who has been waiting can finally get an excellent version of the feature film. I've heard the critics say that there are some inaccuracies or some things are missing, but I think considering John Carpenter had only about two and a half hours to work with it, and this was shown on TV (only two) Years after Elvis' death!) That he has done a good job with it. In fact, I have not seen another Elvis movie that even comes very close to this movie. Highly recommended.
