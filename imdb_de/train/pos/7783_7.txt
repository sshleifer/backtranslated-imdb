A young girl who survives as a prostitute. <br /> <br /> A cheap hustler who wants to reach the big score. <br /> <br /> They meet in Thailand. You may think the opening credits are going to be a violent movie, but it's also a love story with two people battling for better living in their own fight for money. This movie sometimes feels like an essay, sometimes due to image changes, but still refreshing. This story is also about Eros and Thanatos. "It's not an original joke, but it's well narrated," says a character, and that's also true of this one: we've seen the story, but that's how we see it. Thailand appears in hot tones, the photograph changes from a colored to a multi-colored place. And it captures the city as a cage of these imperfect persons. There is also a good use of the music to puncture the actions.
