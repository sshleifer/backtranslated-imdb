This show is quick-witted, colorful, dark and yet funny, hip and somehow clean. The cast, including a fantastic rotation of special guests (Molly Shannon, Paul Rubens, The-Stacker-Guy-From-Office-Space) is electric. There is murder, romance, family and zombies, without ever being considered a cartoon ... Anyway. You really connect with these characters. The entire production is an unlikely magical act that has left me, something skeptical, if I say it myself, completely enchanted and come to more every Wednesday night. I'm just reading this again and it sounds a bit like someone who has paid me to write it. It's really that good. I just heard a rumor that it was canceled, so I thought I'd send out a goodwill. This is one of the shows that are under the radar because the network does not fit how to make it sexy and sell cars with it. Do yourself a favor, if you have not done so yet, and enjoy this gem while it lasts. OK, one more thing. This show is smart. This means that every Hollywood critic / "writer" inserts a stick in his knowledge before sitting down to look at it, and refurbishing his hotel room with a "I could write that" language before anyone in their loneliness Hollywood. In other words: the internet. This is a general / anonymous website. Before you give Dirty Sexy Money or Next Hot Model your Wednesday TV lesson or whatever other triplets that are not commenting on these Internet "critics", give my favorite show a twist. It is fun. Good, unpretentious fun.
