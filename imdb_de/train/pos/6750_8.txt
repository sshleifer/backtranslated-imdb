This is a very well done film that is meticulously staged and has a great character that is sometimes very moving - like the scene with the faithful but straightforward buddy and his wife. The plot is convincingly elaborated and exciting. The gangster character is particularly interesting and plays an almost metaphysical role in the hero's life. It is made clear that the cops are as rough and ready as the underworld characters. <br /> <br /> A few slight reservations: I found the end a bit biased as it celebrates the successful integration of the hero into the structure of the police and justice system, which breaks down the ambiguity of the police figures maintained to this point. I also found the main female character a bit weak: little more than a catalyst for the Hero's salvation, all she seems to do is cry and faint while the tough guys fight it.
