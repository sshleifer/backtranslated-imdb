Great drama with all covered areas, except for the screenplay, which was too slow and should have shown more relevant scenes like Pitt's character interviewing the president, or Pitt, who is being murdered instead of just describing it to us. Scenes like this would have kept the audience awake. Cutting off a few unnecessary minutes would have created more room for more heart-pounding scenes like this one. Pulling the film saved this movie from all grandeur, even though Pitt is seen here, it makes the movie so worth watching. Even big fans of Fising, early The styles of the 20th century and Montana will really like this ........
