On a lonely late-evening road, Martin Sheen spins a group of murderous ranchers who have killed some men and abducted Cassidy's girl in an empty salon for Robert Carradine of Hopalong Cassidy and his friends Writer / Director Christopher Coppola The Wrath of William Boyd Purists may have resulted from a bold, modern low-budget movie with her beloved Hoppy, but I'm glad he made it! No character should be so attached to an actor that no one else is ever allowed to play him or her again! <br /> <br /> I thought it was a lot of fun and an interesting update of the classic programmers of the thirties forties. Even though the bad behavior is guilty, it is really serious and unpretentious, which makes it hard for me to dislike. <br /> <br /> The whole production is a bit strange, but I really enjoyed the scenes between Sheen and Carridine. The fact that we look at a story in a story makes the weirdness and the exaggerations tastier.
