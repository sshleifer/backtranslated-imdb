An American in Paris is a showcase of Gene Kelly. See, Gene sings, plays and dances through Paris in different situations. Some are purely majestic, others pure corn. One can imagine what Kelly was all about when he first shot this movie a year before "Singin 'In The Rain". He is definitely one of the greats. It's interesting to look at the parallels between the two films, especially Kelly's characters. The only difference is that one lives in Paris, the other lives in LA. Some say that Leslie Caron's acting was less than pure. Maybe Cyd Charisse, who was originally meant for the role, could have done better, but Caron is quite believable in the role and has chemistry with Kelly. Oscar Levant's short role in the film was exactly what he needed, someone who did not look like Gene Kelly. Taking on the role of Everyman is not an easy task, but Levant has done it with as much class as any other starring role. <br /> <br /> The song and dance routines are all perfection. Even the extra long ballet at the end of the film makes it a better movie than without. Minnelli realized that there was not really much time on screen to make such a love affair believable, and used that sequence to make it look as if you had spent four hours with them. Brilliant! <br /> <br /> I would have to rate this movie with Singin 'because it's very similar in story and song. Singin 'would hardly nod because of the uplifting performance of Debbie Reynolds. <br /> <br /> Full recommendation. <br /> <br /> 8/10 stars.
