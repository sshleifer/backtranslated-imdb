I do not agree with anyone who can dismiss this movie as "just" entertainment. Right behind the carefree, roaring 20's, in the early days of the Great Depression, Dance, Fools, Dance is a serious warning story in his heart, with a clear message on how best to endure these hard times. But this fast-moving and closely-plotted film is anything but a bleak morality. <br /> <br /> In the thirties, Hollywood had the talent to produce an entertaining * and * enlightening public enjoyment after another. Everything without wasting a film frame. Dance, Fools, Dance - one of * four * films shot by Harry Beaumont in 1931 - is barely 80 minutes long, but his characters are well-developed, his story never seems to be rash, and despite the many twists in the storyline, the audience becomes never left behind. <br /> <br /> With the sole exception of Lester Vail as a slippery love interest Bob Townsend, the side cast is equally strong. Worth mentioning are William Bakewell as Crawford's brother, Cliff Edwards (known as the voice of Jiminy Cricket) as reporters Bert Scranton and Clark Gable in an early supporting role as gangster Jake Luva. <br /> <br /> But this is Joan Crawford's movie, and she absolutely shines in it. This lesser-known version of Crawford was made at the age of just 27, and is likely to be unrecognizable to those who are more familiar with their later work. Here's proof that, long before she took home an Oscar for Mildred Pierce, Crawford was a star in the truest sense of the word, a terrific actress with the charisma of wearing a picture on her own. <br /> <br /> Result: Eight in ten
