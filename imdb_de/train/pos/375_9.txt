This was one of the most moving films I have ever seen. I was about 12 years old when I saw it for the first time, and when it's on TV my eyes are tight with it. the spectacle and the plot are amazing. It seems so true to reality and touches on so many controversial topics. I recommend this movie to anyone who is interested in a good drama.
