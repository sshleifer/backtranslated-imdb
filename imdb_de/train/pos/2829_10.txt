Without a doubt, Private Lessons II is the biggest movie I've ever seen. A Japanese import (bad) translated into English, it is a pleasure to see him. Not much of it makes sense, but that does not matter. It's the greatest comedy without ever being intentionally funny. <br /> <br /> The film is rare and not available on video, but I caught it a couple of times late, late at night, with cable TV. My layered copy has been seen dozens and dozens of times as I slowly introduce this movie jewel from person to person to the world. <br /> <br /> Joanna Pacula plays the tutor / lover of Ken, our hero. (Apparently, she only worked for her check.) Ken is played by Goro Inagaki from the Japanese pop band SMAP, who gives it all and has great hair all over the movie. Famed by "In the Company of Men," Stacy Edwards also appears in the movie and is probably happy to have found more films afterward. <br /> <br /> It takes at least three considerations to figure out what's happening The act is. If you look at it repeatedly, you can enjoy elements such as the unusual number of vases Ken has in his house (at least 50), or Ken wearing a shirt with embroidered cornflakes in the final of the movie. <br /> <br /> The movie is predictable, but highly citable. My friends and I play whole scenes. Yes, it sounds like we are lame losers and we are ... but we are lame losers who have seen "Private Hours II". Be one of ten people in the world who have seen this movie. You will thank me for that.
