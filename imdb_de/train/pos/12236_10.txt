I saw this movie in 1959, when I was 11 years old with my family, in a drive-in movie theater. <br /> <br /> I used to think it was very funny. , , Although I was too young to understand 90% of what makes this wonderful movie so sexy! I saw it again this morning on "Turner South". When I saw it, I was totally tense with laughter! "The Mating Game" is a unique classic from the past. If you are too young to see the enchanting time in the story this film was produced, I am very sorry for you. There is no way to watch films like this and to understand how they (even today) can bring such a delightful piece of heaven to such old timepieces as me, respectfully ask that younger people do not comment on films like "The Mating Game" , <br /> <br /> Films like these were created for the generation that preceded the current group of your people. And as such, these films speak a very different language than any of you can understand. <br /> <br /> In other words? If you do not understand the issues that the movie addresses, please do not be embarrassed by offering comments that? honestly? makes no sense.
