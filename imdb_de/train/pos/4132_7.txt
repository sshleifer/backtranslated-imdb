One comedy that worked surprisingly well was the little British effort "The Divorce Of Lady X (1938)." It's the first couple of Laurence Olivier and Merle Oberon, in front of this little film about uncontrollable passions in the English moors of the 19th century. Although Olivier and Oberon are not very well suited to the screwball comedy, everything is progressing well. Oberon is Leslie, a young woman who falls into ambitious divorce law firm Logan's (Olivier) hotel suite due to an unpleasant English fog that prevents travel. She does everything possible to irritate him - but in the crazy way movies work, he falls in love with her. And she falls in love with him. A serious case of false identity, however, occurs when Oberon's "Lady X" (that's all Oliver leaves in a note) is thought of by Olivier as a married woman. To make things even worse and amusing, Lord Mere (Ralph Richardson) goes to Olivier to divorce his wife, who, dear Larry, believes she must be Oberon! There are some nice dialogues between the sexes and an exciting exploration of sexual politics. One can see that Olivier is not too confident with the comedy, but in true Olivier he is a consummate professional and delivers. And he masters the twists and turns of the screw ball, perhaps not with ease, but with high pressure. As an actress, Oberon was not a big shock, but usually she was competent enough, and despite her alleged aversion to the screen of her, she worked well with Olivier. This was filmed in early Technicolor films that look very primitive today (everyone looks even whiter than Michael Jackson), but maybe the pressure needs to be cleaned up.
