I admit that I'm a vampire addict: I've seen so many vampire movies that I have not seen, and this one is definitely in the top ten. I was very impressed with the original vampires of John Carpenter and when I came out there was a sequel that I bought out directly. This movie does not obey the same rules as the first, and it's not that dark, but it's close enough and I feel it's well built on the original. Jon Bon Jovi was as good as Derek Bliss: his performance was sympathetic and yet so heavy that the viewer might think he could actually survive in the world he lives in. One of my favorite parts was shortly after meeting Zoey and going to the bathroom to see if she was more than she seems. His comments are wonderfully disrespectful and yet extremely practical, which stands out well in the course of the scene. <br /> <br /> The other performers were also well-selected and created a fun and original movie. It's not just a repeat of the first movie, and it's grown much the same as Fright Night II outgrowed Fright Night. There are several elements that make it a new movie with a similar theme. <br /> <br /> If you like vampire movies, I would recommend this movie. If you prefer your movies to be less bloody, choose something else.
