Red Eye is a good little thriller that you can see on a Saturday night. Intense acting, great villain and unexpected action. <br /> <br /> Some may not want to see this movie because it only takes a very short 85 minutes and 88% of the movie is on a plane and just talking. Do not worry that they can do it well with the smart and witty dialogue. <br /> <br /> A PG-13 movie seems to be a new reason for director Wes Craven. But he certainly has as much violence as possible in this thriller fit. <br /> <br /> The strong point of this movie is its cast. This film needed good actors to convey the dialogue and the thrill. If they did not have these actors, the movie would have been lost and boring. We had Rachel McAdams from Mean Girls and Wedding Crashers. Cillian Murphy of Batman starts and 28 days later. Rounding out this cast is Brian Cox from X-men 2. <br /> <br /> The pace in this movie was great. Only when you think it is boring, they throw a turn on you. Fortunately, this is not a long movie and does not feel like it. Much better than the other movie Flight Plan. <br /> <br /> Here is my comment on the flight plan: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0408790/usercomments-578 <br /> <br /> I recommend. Not too long and not too shabby. <br /> <br /> 8/10
