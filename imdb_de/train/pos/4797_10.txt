I've always been a fan of David Lynch, and with this movie, Lynch has proven to critics that he has the talent, style, and artistic integrity to make films beyond the surreal aura he's become known for over the last decade. Just like the movie G-Rated, it's pure Lynch in style, beat and tone. The film moves at a masterfully hypnotic pace and is full of scenes of real emotion and power. <br /> <br /> The cinematography is terrific, as one might expect from a Lynch movie, and the transition sequences of the montage are breathtaking. It's also refreshing to see a movie in which the characters are all friendly, kind-hearted people and not unmotivated characters who are clearly called "good" or "evil". Richard Farnsworth will be a wonderful performer like the rest of the cast, notably Sissy Spacek in a ravishing performance as his daughter, and Harry Dean Stanton in a small but infinitely important role. <br /> <br /> With this film, David Lynch proved to critics that he was able to make a strong moving movie, just like in the 80's with 'Blue Velvet' and 'The Elephant Man'. Critics seemed to lose confidence in the last decade after producing surreal films such as "Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me" and "Lost Highway." With this film, however, he showed that there was a method for FWWM and LH, and it looks as if it did. Critics finally made their entry with his recent film "Mulholland Drive," given the high praise and Oscar Nomination for Lynch. <br /> <br /> "Straight Story" is one of the most moving films I have. It's a loving story about family, friendship and the friendliness of strangers, I would highly recommend it.
