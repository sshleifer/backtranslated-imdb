The second episode of the first season is a delightful Christmas story about love, betrayal, ... and a murderous, crazy madman, dressed like Santa Claus. A woman (Mary Ellen-Trainor) has just murdered her husband on Christmas Eve for his life insurance. What begins as a perfect crime begins a survival struggle as a disturbed Santa Clause suit with a psychopath (Larry Drake, totally exaggerated) who threatens her life ... as well as her precious young daughters. <br /> <br /> Those who know the program casually remember this episode as well. By the way, this particular reviewer regularly watches it at Christmas. Most notable for it are escalating suspense and narrative twists, and All Through The Houst is among the best stories of The Crypt.
