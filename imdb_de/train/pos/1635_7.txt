For my high school days in Salina Kansas, they filmed "The Brave Young Men Of Vineyard" on location, and the film crews were pretty prominent for weeks. After all, we learned that the movie was "Up The Academy" and was a little um, "lower head" when we were accepted. <br /> <br /> I had to see it since I was there and the local crowd seemed to be less pleased with the show. I was 17 years old and I thought it was a rather inartistic attempt at a sort of "Animal House" comedy, except for the fart jokes. <br /> <br /> I have seen it many times since and my opinion has matured a bit. It's stupid, but sometimes it catches a bit of the "crazy" magazine humor, at least as well as most "crazy TV sets". Ron Liebman likes to hate it, but he's almost perfect and memorable. For me, my favorite moment would have been a short scene on Santa Fe Avenue where I parked my car while buying guitar strings. Too bad that my pinto has only a short appearance and is usually cut for television. I have not seen the new DVD, but if my old Pinto is visible, they have a sale.
