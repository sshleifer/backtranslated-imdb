This is an absurdist dark comedy from Belgium. Shot in gaudy black and white, Beno√Æt Poelvoorde (Man Bites Dog) is in good shape as Roger, the angry, obsessive family man in a small, disgruntled Belgian mining town. Roger is a photographer who visits traffic accidents with his little daughter Luise to take pictures. He is also obsessed with winning a car by taking part in a contest where the participant has to break a record - and he decides that his son Michel must try to break the record if he is constantly going through a door Train him Michel dresses as Elvis and has a spot on a radio show called "Cinema Lies" where he describes mistakes in movies. Luise is friendly with neighbor Felix, a pigeon breeder. Roger is a callous figure as he pushes Michel over the limit during the record attempt, almost leading to his death. Magritte-like surreal images are scattered throughout the movie. It is undoubtedly charming and worth your time.
