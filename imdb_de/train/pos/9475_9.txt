The most satisfying thing about "Dan in Real Life" is that the relationship between Dan (Steve Carell) and Marie (Juliette Binoche) is meaningful and very realistic. The casting of Oscar winner Juliette Binoche as a love interest of Dan was a great decision. She is exceptionally talented, intelligent, naturally attractive and, thank God, aged appropriately for the role! Had this movie been shot with Jessica Alba or Scarlett Johansson, it would have been a disaster. <br /> <br /> Another wonderful aspect of "Dan in Real Life" is that it's a perfect movie for interested adults, a mature comedy that omits the three pillars of the "frat pack" formula: stupid chicks, chauvinistic guys and dingy jokes. "Dan in Real Life" is funny and has fun, intelligent laughter. While other comedies contain jokes that shock, or almost exclusively, the audience to laugh, the jokes of "Dan in Real Life" are more natural and clever and require some reflection from the audience. <br /> <br My only problem with "Dan in Real Life" is that actress Brittany Robertson's rebellious middle-class daughter is too rude to play. It's hard to say if this was a personal decision or a decision of the director. In any case, her character is unrealistic and annoying. However, this is only a small mistake in the movie and does not take the whole story with it. <br /> <br /> All in all, "Dan in Real Life" is a great movie, a fantastic escape from the release of offensive and mutilated comedies. The quality of writing, directing, acting and (especially) cinematography is excellent. It's just a beautiful, carefree comedy.
