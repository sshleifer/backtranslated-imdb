I recommend watching this movie with your partner if you are planning a romantic evening with him. The chemistry between Johnny Weissmuller and Maureen O'Sullivan like Tarzan and Jane is so hot that it could fog up your screen. After the original film we start to see how Tarzan and Jane got used to the jungle and each other. Jane's brief jungle wear and Tarzan's protest when Jane hides her visitors shows that they are not only romantically but also sexually in love. Jane, to illustrate how much Jane Tarzan teaches love emotionally, romantically and sexually. And Jane 's student is not only hugging, but also has a positive effect on his previously unused sexuality. <br /> <br /> The skin show in this movie is off the charts. In addition to Jane's two-piece, sexy midriff, leg and hip costume, she also offers an underwater act with Tarzan. (Although it's not O'Sullivan, but Olympic swimmer Josephine McKim, doubling for them in this scene), Weissmuller reveals in his barely available loincloth a huge body and perfect chest muscles. The ladies will be happy when Weissmuller climbs out of the water after his long fight with the giant crocodile and screams - his water-soaked loincloth drops practically from his hips. The censors have weakened the adult character of the Tarzan films after this entry. Although the Weissmuller-Tarzan films would still be successful in the years to come, they would rarely approach the sex appeal of this film.
