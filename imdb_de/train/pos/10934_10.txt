After reviewing this intense martial arts film for the first time in almost 18 years, I have to say that he did not lose his mystique or his stunning martial arts action that I remembered in my youth. The story of a dying Martial Arts teacher sending out his "unfinished" disciple to find the five former members of his poison clan so they will not seek a fortune that Master's friend hides. Fearing that his last student had not trained enough, he instructs him to befriend one of the five "poisons" to defeat the other four. <br /> <br /> I can not say enough about the choreography or the camerawork. A good movie in its own right and one of the best martial arts films ever made. A CLASSIC !!
