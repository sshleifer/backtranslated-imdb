This is a great movie. I love it more and more each time I watch. Most comedies can be quite lame because you know all the gags, but Mystery Men have so much integrity in writing and characterization that they look at each other again - when Ben Stiller tears at the bonnet of the sedan or Hank Azaria says goodbye to Louise Lasser or Geoffrey Rush flashes his choreography, or Tom Waits mumbles as he watches the news station, or Janeane Garofalo refuses to kiss Paul Reubens - it's a pleasure. This is a perfect ensemble. The story develops directly and consistently, the storylines are creative and not too dominant, all setups pay off in the end. Seriously, if you've seen it and it's been a while, look at it again and if not, start. You can not see it again until you see it for the first time. (Wes Studi, William H. Macy, the tryout scene, too much good!)
