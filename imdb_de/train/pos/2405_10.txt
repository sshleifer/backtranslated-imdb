Wow, I can not believe I'm the first and only one to comment on this great movie. <br /> <br /> Although the movie itself seemed interesting enough, the real thing that drew me to this movie was Matt Lillard, most people either believe that he's too caffeine-happy or just crap, but us Both are the same age and of the same generation and I have seen this guy so many times that he is now one of my favorites. This is one of the only films in which he is the big shot and the main star, as in SLC Punk, another great Lillard movie that is starting to go crazy. Also noteworthy in this film is another great actor named Vincent D'onofrio, a very subconscious person in the film industry. The woman in the movie is a newcomer and she's not that bad, though you know she's been hired mainly for her accent and nude scene. It's a game of Jack vs Jill vs. Bob as each of them I want to reap the rewards, but do not share with anyone. They all try to kill each other, and it's a time bomb waiting to explode. Matt shows his true ability as the planning JAck, which initially starts the whole scheme. Vincent and wife play a few art thieves who need money for lack of business. Vince's character is a bit confused and skitzy throughout the movie, but this only adds to the intensity of the movie. <br /> <br /> The surprises left and right are well received and the end is not a clich√© and you feel happy Well, maybe that depends on the kind of endings you like. This movie really interested me, except that Matt was involved. It's a great movie and I recommend it to anyone who likes movies. Critics may not like this movie, but they do not watch movies because they like movies anyway.
