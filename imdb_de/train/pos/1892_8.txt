After seeing Arthur several times on television, I laughed so hard that Dudley Moore's role as Arthur was fortunate, a drunken millionaire was hysterical, but John Gielgud as his servant-father, Hobson, was equally charming. I bought the DVD a few weeks ago and watched the DVD. Despite her nearly 27-year career, she is still as enjoyable as Liza Minnelli's role, because the love interest fascinated that the chemistry between the two was magical. <br /> <br Arthur Moore, (Moore), is a spoiled, drunken millionaire who has a cash bill that reads like the public debt he does not want and likes to behave like a kid. His activities are supervised by his dry English butler Hobson (Gielgud). It seems nobody cares about Arthur except for him. Arthur's father (Barbour) makes an ultimatum, if he does not marry the dreadful blonde celebrity Susan Johnson (Eikenberry) in four years, he will cut off his son's inheritance of $ 750 million. <br /> <br /> But Arthur meets Linda Marolla (Minnelli), a young working-class waitress and a thief who falls in love with her now. Now he faces a difficult decision to marry for love or money. When Hobson dies, Arthur eventually grew up and breaks him off before the wedding with Susan, so he can keep both the money and his true love. Arthur is a charming romantic comedy for all
