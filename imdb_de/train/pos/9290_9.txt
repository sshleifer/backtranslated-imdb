This is not the kind of movie John Wayne is known for. He plays a diplomat, a man who does things through words and persuasion, not physical actions. The film moves with a quiet realism through its superficially unruly story. <br /> <br /> For open-minded, patient and thoughtful, this film is a rich portrayal of a fascinating part of the story. <br /> <br /> There are two interlinking stories. The big story is the internalized, isolationist Japan and the externalized, expansive America that comes into conflict when their interests conflict. The little human story is about an outsider barbarian (Wayne) and a civilized geisha who initially means hostility and aversion to mutual respect and love. Human history reflects the larger history of the two nations. <br /> <br /> The movie is very well done and all actors play their roles well. The two main roles are perfectly executed. John Wayne is a Distinguished Townsend Harris and encounters the right mix of violence and negotiation in dealing with the Japanese. Eiko Ando is as excellent as the Geisha of the title, charming and adorable. The interaction between her character and John Wayne is particularly well represented. Exactly how these two persons (as they are shown in the film) would have behaved. <br /> <br /> The script is very well written. It lacks all pomposity. and is a realistic representation of the manner in which the events presented may have occurred. The characters are real people, not self-confident "big" characters from the story. In addition, the conflict of cultures and interests is portrayed with great skill and subtlety. The clash of a traditionalist and traditionally strong isolationist Japan with an emerging, new, powerful nation from the other side of the ocean is very well summed up in an exchange between John Wayne and the local Japanese baron. Wayne complains that shipwrecked people are beheaded when they land in Japan, and that passing ships can not even put water in the harbor. The baron replies that Japan simply wants to be left alone. Wayne's character replies that Japan is at an increasingly important crossroads of international shipping and that, if things continue as they have been, the nation is seen as nothing more than a group of brigands infesting an important road. A very real summary of how both countries have come to be right and others wrong. The resulting conflict between two self-righteous peoples with conflicting interests is reflected throughout history and is a perennial theme that recurs to the present and the future before the accelerated growth toward industrialization that would follow later in the century is. A visual treat and a revealing glimpse into ancient Japanese civilization. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend anyone who is a John Wayne fan or not, to watch this movie if you have the chance. Just be aware that this is not an action movie. It is an illustration of an interesting place and an interesting time in history and a slow-boiling love story that (to her surprise) dominates the personal lives of the two main characters. Watch this film without prejudice and immerse yourself in its story and you will fully enjoy it. <br /> <br /> All in all an excellent movie.
