Fatal Error is a really cool movie! Robert Wagner, Antonio Sabato Jr., Janine Turner, Jason Schombing, Malcolm Stewart and David Lewis are in the film. The cast of the movie worked really well. Robert Wagner played his role well. The relationship between Saboto Jr. and Turner was very nice. There may be a big difference in age, but they are a unique couple. The two actors worked really well together. The music in the movie is really good by Ron Ramin and goes very well with the movie. There's a lot of stuff going on in the movie and you do not know what's going on and what's going to happen next.
