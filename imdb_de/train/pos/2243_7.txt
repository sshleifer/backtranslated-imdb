I thought the whole movie went wonderfully with fresh pictures and interesting cinematographs. The actors were in almost perfect timing on the back of their character and looked great. The music was lush and thoughtful. It even had a decent turn of an end. So, what is to be agreed with everyone? The story was not entirely fresh (felt like a remnant of "Running Man" with the entire TV show idea), but the attitude towards Christianity and Judaism on how the public chooses its Messiah certainly sounded right. It made sense to follow this one man, standing in front of a modern crowd, and to put him on a pedestal for his opportunity. <br /> <br /> It is possible that Christians or other religious people notice this, because the film has the word "God", but that shows what the filmmakers were trying to do, it is, people who do World may never have seen such a possibility, especially in the modern world, where Christianity has become more and more accepted and forgotten by some. <br /> <br /> I have given 7/10 stars here on IMDb. I found that every gram of the movie was mostly entertaining and original. Take a look if you are not too offended to watch a fun movie from Madrid, Spain, about the possibilities of the coming modern Messiah to watch a television near you.
