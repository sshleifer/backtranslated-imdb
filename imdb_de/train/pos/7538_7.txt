Nothing new is this tired serio comedy that wastes the talents of Danny Glover and Whoopi Goldberg. Considering that this was produced by the stars and Spike Lee, that's pretty tame and tired. And how is it that the Whoop never changes hair or glasses over the many years that this film covers? Blah!
