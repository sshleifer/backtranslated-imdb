Like his early masterpiece The Elephant Man, Lynch proves to his critics that he can tell a straightforward, simple story without losing his artistic influence. This is a true story of a retired elderly man (expertly played by Richard Farnsworth) who decides to drive a tractor through a few states to visit his estranged brother who is now at the door of death pay. A wonderful score from Badalamenti, exquisite photographs of rural life (love the aerial photos of cornfields) and the hand of a crafty director who reveals the fundamental humanity of man is a beautiful piece of life film. The extremely slow pace can make some spectators go to sleep, but those who stay on the road are well rewarded in the end.
