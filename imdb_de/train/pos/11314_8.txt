Impressive! The kind of film that you could see ten times and still enjoy the nuances. Absolutely unbelievable! If this was the debut film by Visconti, I shudder at the thought of what would happen if it gets better from movie to movie. The only other one I've seen (at the time of writing) is Death in Venice - which was absolutely unbelievable: visually more glare than obsession (obsession). One of the most beautiful movies I've ever seen, but his story was not as interesting as Ossessione. If you click on "Miscellaneous" on the links of this page, there will be still images from the film on these websites. You will not really live up to the experience of the movie: such graceful camera movements, such beautiful composition, such wonderful faces, such great characters, such a great story, the first movie ever adapted by James M Cain's "The Postman Always Rings" Twice , "<br /> <br /> I can not believe that this was done in 43, eight years before Brando was to produce realistic acting with Streetcar Named Desire (1951), the actors may not have used the methodology, ie they may not have felt everything themselves (I know nothing about it) - but they are some of the best, most authentic and realistic performances in the cinema until this date, eight years before Streetcar Named Desire brought a new sensuality to the screen, Ossessione was electrifyingly sensual Yes, I'm a superlative, but Ossessione was just so terrific. <br /> <br /> The reason why Ossessione did not cause the effect of Streetcar was that it was in Fascist Italy and was banned by Mussolini in America.The American public saw its full glory only after 59 years, eight years AFTER tram. <br /> <br /> I will not I'll tell you more about it - just to tell you that it's one of the best, most beautiful and exciting movies I've ever seen and tell you to go and see it! Like another reviewer, I'll buy it as soon as I can find it!
