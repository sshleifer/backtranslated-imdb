Disney did it again. Brilliant as Timone and Pumbaa are brought back to life, telling us how they met and helping Simba when he needed them. I love this movie and watch it over and over again. It shows how Timone lived with his family and other meerkats before setting off to find his dream home and adventure. Then he meets Pumbaa and things change. Together, they search for the home, Timon wants and fails again and again, which is funny, because Timone is getting crazier. Then Simba turns up and we see more of his childhood than in the two previous films. You already know the rest.
