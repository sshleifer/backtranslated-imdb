This is one of the best "Our Gang" shorts ever made. Spanky is the cutest and funniest, and the babies he still babysit are also funny. Tiny Spanky is forced by the gang to watch all her little siblings. The opening shot of them in strollers and talking about various things that are hung by the gang of fishing rods is a beautiful gag. Spanky's apparition wears his giant toy knife when asked by the older lads to babysit is priceless, as well as his answer - "Hey, where do you get that stuff from - I do not care about babies!" The tiny guy who says "remarkable" throughout the movie, all the lovely gags and Spanky telling the babies "all about Tarzan" make this one of the best "Our Gang" models you'll ever see.
