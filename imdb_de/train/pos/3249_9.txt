Corbin Bernsen has sent letters to four criminal colleagues he has worked with in the past, and it's a real mix of generations with Fred Gwynne, Lou Diamond Phillips, William Russ, and Ruben Blades. They are supposed to meet him in this dark city in Montana, and he does not explain why, because he was then picked up by the state of New Jersey police with a warrant. <br /> <br /> They know Bernsen of the criminal group that has gathered but they do not know each other. A lot of comedy is that they feel each other. As the eldest Gwynne, though she denies it, she somehow takes responsibility for the others who grumble but go along. Especially when they find out what Bernsen was up to. <br /> <br /> As for Bernsen, he is fortunate enough to be picked up by two bumblebees in Ed O'Neill and Daniel Roebuck. He gets the drop on O'Neill and flees. <br /> <br /> Afterwards, the four criminals try to end what Bernsen started and to get Bernsen out of the police. In the elaborately drawn script, it is fascinating how both storylines connect with each other. Hoyt Axton, a local sheriff, watches in amazement what is happening in his city. Disorganized Crime is an incredibly funny caper movie by a group of players who mostly have a background on television or would soon do so. I can not say that someone in the cast has excelled, who seems to be so good at clicking. <br /> <br /> Ironically, none of these people are comedians per se, but they all have a slight comic touch that comes from good direction. <br /> <br /> Disorganized Crime is a very funny movie written by the well-known pessimist, Mr. Murphy.
