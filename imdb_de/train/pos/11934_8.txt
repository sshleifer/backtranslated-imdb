At first you think of another Disney movie that may be good, but it's a children's movie. But if you see it, you can not help but enjoy it. All ages will love this movie. I saw this movie for the first time at the age of 10 and now, 8 years later, I still love it! Danny Glover is great and could not play the role better. Christopher Lloyd is weird and perfect for the role. Tony Danza is as credible as Mel Clark. You can not help but enjoy this movie! I give a 10/10!
