I had to think about it for days after seeing it. That's the sign of a great movie for me. Eyes Wide Shut had the same effect on me. I am tired of these people who need these happy Hollywood cookie cutters. I plan to see it again tonight to get a better understanding of the storyline - but still the emotional messages of the movie were totally palpable.
