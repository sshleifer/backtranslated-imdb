I borrowed this film from a friend who did not know it, and it turned out to be an excellent documentary about a journey on an old ship across vast expanses of the ocean. Thor Heyerdahl had developed a theory that the ancient Incas in Peru managed to travel thousands of miles across the ocean to Polynesia, based on certain relics that can be found in both places, certain types of ancient seagoing vessels that we know of that they were available. Analysis of ocean and wind currents and the knowledge that the Incas were indeed traveling in an indefinite amount at sea. <br /> <br /> To test his hypothesis, Heyerdahl and his crew build a ship as closely as possible, as far as possible, what the ancient Incas had available, only from balsa wood and other materials that were available at that time, and from Lima, the capital of Peru, to reach the islands of Polynesia, which are about 5000 kilometers away. His theory, like so much of the history of antiquity, can not be proved with complete certainty, but the coverage of her trip provides strong support for him being right. The film is little more than a narrative of footage taken during the more than 100-day expedition, but it's a very detailed description of what it was and what the trials and tribulations they were facing. I often wish that Oscar-winning documentary films are easier to find, and those over 50 years ago are still as interesting and informative as I was sure when they were first published.
