Mating Game is an enchanting, wonderful movie from a bygone era. Hollywood needs to consider a charming remake of this movie. My wife and I would see it. <br /> <br /> It's an excellent romantic comedy that my wife and I saw on AMC. <br /> <br /> This film has Tony Randall at his best. Debbie Reynolds is great as always. <br /> <br /> loved it. We intend to order on DVD to expand our growing film collection. <br /> <br /> Too bad that Hollywood stops making movies. <br /> <br /> Hey Hollywood ... Time to Choose some of these scripts from the old safe, update them a bit (without damaging the original movie and script like other remakes), and hold a casting Call off. <br /> <br /> A remake would be a great success on the screen, on DVD and on cable / satellite TV. <br /> <br /> SN Austin, TX
