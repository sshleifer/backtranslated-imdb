"Five Days" is considered something special, a crime drama that consists of a series of episodes, each arranged on a specific day of a police investigation. In fact, this element of the story proves to be less significant than initially thought, since the fact that the action is limited to 24 hours in each episode is barely perceptible, and the program barely distinguishes from countless other thrillers. In fact, it's almost impossible to make comparisons to the last "prime suspect," as one of the subplots focuses on a single, cynical female cop approaching retirement. There's a lot of serious over-emotional, manipulative music and a bunch of characters that seem to be fictitious, that everyone is sympathetic in one sense, and suspicious in another. And it is possible to guess the culprits well before the end, not because of the inner dynamics of the story, but rather because of the construction of the drama as a whole: certain things must be true to justify the focus of the series on certain characters times. Despite these mistakes, the series grew in my mind: In the end, I was pretty packed. However, it is a sad sign that the BBC, which once made "The Singing Detective", boasted of "perhaps the best drama of the year": for there is little genuine originality here, and the claim reveals a lack ambition that is terribly disappointing , "Five Days" is not really a trash; But it's a formula, and one would hope that the best the BBC had to offer would be a little more innovative and fresh.
