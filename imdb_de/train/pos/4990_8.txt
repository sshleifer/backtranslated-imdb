As other reviewers have noted, this is an unjustly neglected film from the Depression. Directed by Frank Borzage (two Oscars) and written by Jo Swerling (Leave it to Heaven, the Westerner, the Lifeboat, etc.), this is a hard-core, well-structured and realized movement about residents of New York City. They are breeders, beggars and women forced into prostitution, but they are a community of good and bad people whose loyalty is as complex as any other group. <br /> <br /> Perhaps one of the most important features of this film is the contrast between Spencer Tracy's figure Bill and Loretta Young's Trina. He talks harshly, is physically aggressive and obviously fearless - but Bill is not the character that gives this film its steely sense of survival. As he blows, Trina is really stubborn (if that term can be applied to such a ladylike figure). Her devotion to him is obvious and complete. When she gets pregnant, she says she'll raise it herself if he wants to go, or "I'll even give up the baby if only you're happy." The dignity of Loretta Young's appearance (at the age of 20) as a fairly simple character appears to be neither weak nor dependent, but rather a woman who recognizes happiness when she finds it and does not want to.
