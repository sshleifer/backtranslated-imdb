It may (or may not) be considered interesting that the only reason why I really really checked out this movie was in it, that I wanted to see the performance of the man who beat Humphrey Bogart in his CASABLANCA (10/10 role for the movie) Best Actor Oscar. (I would have still given Bogie the Oscar, but Paul Lukas did a great job and at least earned the nomination.) Well, I'm glad I watched this movie because I really enjoyed it, I think the movie preached something, but it not only did not bother me, I enjoyed the speeches and was never bored with them. <br /> <br /> The acting was outstanding in this film, I particularly enjoyed Paul Lukas, Lucile Watson (rightly nominated for an Oscar), Bette Davis (wrongly not nominated), George Coulouris and Eric Roberts, who the middle child plays. I really enjoyed his character: a strange-looking boy who talks like a speaker to philosophers: he just kills me, even the name of the characters (Bodo) is funny. <br /> <br /> The end of g, where Luke's character was forced to do something he thought was wrong, even though he did it for all the right reasons, worked for me as well. I agreed why he felt he was doing what he was doing, and I understood why he could not quite explain it. The message this movie makes is good and noble, the scenery (ie the house) is beautiful and acting is best. Watch this movie if you ever have a chance. <br /> <br /> 9/10
