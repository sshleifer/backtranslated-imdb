That's a good little shocker. not perfect, but tight, competent and disturbing. An excellent example of a simple idea that has been developed into a compelling 90-minute script. <br /> <br /> The decor does not require frills, lengthy finishes or verbatim background stories. Kate (Franka Pontente), a young German businesswoman living in London, is drifting while waiting for the last subway. She awakens to find the place but quickly realizes that she is far from being alone. Someone or something is with her and his intentions are completely vicious. In fact, she encounters several other characters in her quest for survival, including a lascivious workmate, a homeless couple, and a caged sewage worker, all of whom lend pace and substance to the plot. Somewhere in the middle of the movie, when the thrill of excitement mutates into big festivals, there's an awkward gear change, but nothing so awkward that it slows down the hustle and bustle. For those of you with weak dispositions, this is probably a shattering ride; For those of you who love a bit of well-executed carnal chaos, this should push all the right keys. <br /> <br /> The climax of the film may be less successful than the main part of the film, but is interrupted with a beautiful moment of unexpected social commentary that provides a satisfying conclusion. <br /> <br /> Some will feel cheated when they have cheated on a clear explanation of the nature and history of the threat Kate and her allies encountered. However, this was not the case for me. A horror film writer should not feel compelled to cross every point and cross every point, as one would expect from an author of political thrillers. There is enough evidence to give you a pretty clear idea of ​​what made this evil exist, making a detailed and conclusive solution superfluous. The maintenance of a certain mystery is to be welcomed and reminds us that in this film the journey was always more important than the exact destination. My understanding is the budget for this film was, to say the least, minimal, in which case our applause for this British horror should be all the louder, because nowhere you have the impression that corners are cut off or the effect is insufficient. <br /> <br /> If this sounds like your kind of movie, it probably is. Buy a ticket and get on board.
