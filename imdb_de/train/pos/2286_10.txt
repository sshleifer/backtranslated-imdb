The people who produced this masterful film did a good service to a novel, perhaps the best novel work focused on human guilt and responsibility ever published. Nolte takes on the role of Howard W. Campbell, Jr., and makes him his own. He remains faithful to Vonnegut's portrayal of a man who has lost ALL for Love. <br /> <br /> No weaknesses fine adjustment.
