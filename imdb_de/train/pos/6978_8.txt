Well, I have to say that I have been waiting for it to come. <br /> <br /> I will not try to spoil it, and some people have genuinely spoken of the pilot. On the other hand, I'm not quite sure which critics understand it, who call themselves BSG fans and are not like the pilot. <br /> <br /> What did you expect? !! The background is set 50 years before BSG. We are there to help with the birth of the Cylons, see the life of the Adama family (we already have some knowledge of BSG), get a deeper explanation of the Caprican population and their perception of the other colonies and possibly the Origins of God's belief in God and the unique beliefs of the Cylons. <br /> <br /> I do not expect the same amount of special effects or space opera as in the previous series, I make the difference between the two, though I know that Caprica will reinforce the BSG. <br /> <br /> This is one and a half hours of the promising start, and I also believe that this will make the scenarios as good as the BSGs. I expect much from the following, but I have no reason to doubt that we will learn much more. <br /> <br /> Looking at the deleted DVD scene, there is more material for your brain <br /> We look forward to January 2010
