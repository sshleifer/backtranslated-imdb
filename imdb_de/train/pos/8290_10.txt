This is just another example of Gene Wilder's absolute genius. He wrote and played in this grandiose mystery. Nobody could have done better. The tension was noticeable everywhere. I wish Mr. Wilder would pardon us with another of them. I've enjoyed everything I've ever seen Mr. Wilder, but I had no idea how talented he was until I saw "Murder in a Small Town" and this sequel. He really has a keen sense of what the audience wants and how it can be translated into his writing and, of course, his brilliant acting. His subtle wit comes through in spades. I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes Mysteries and / or Gene Wilder's film work. His star is just getting brighter and brighter.
