Probably the biggest low-budget horror movie ever. I saw this movie for the first time when I was about nine years old, and I have to say that it scared hell out of me. Now that I've all grown up, I see this movie for what it really is ... a work of genius. Everyone, or at least everyone of all tastes, dreamed of seeing a snowman kill people even if they did not admit it. I've always found something really scary about snowmen, and for a horror junkie like me, of course, this movie was a dream. Some people say this film is stupid or otherwise contains no intelligence ... it's a movie about a serial killer snowman. What the hell did you expect? Anyone who gave this film a low score is obviously too nervous to sit back and laugh at stupid one-liners and cheap gore. I love this movie for what it is, a comedy, and until the movie industry gets awake and makes a serious horror movie about a killer snowman (which, sadly, seems impossible), I'll keep this great piece of indie horror forever in my heart.
