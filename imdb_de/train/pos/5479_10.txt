<br /> <br /> With a freight car arriving in New York City, the smart young woman with the BABY FACE methodically begins her journey to the top of the power of a large bank. <br /> <br /> Barbara Stanwyck is fascinating as an amoral hero of this influential pre-code drama. With no decency or regret, she coolly manipulates the removal or destruction of men unhappy enough to find their way. A wonderful actress, Stanwyck has the full opportunity here to showcase her great talents. George Brent, who appears fairly late in the story, is a welcome addition to the one who may possibly deal with Stanwyck; His sophisticated acting style forms a nice counterpoint to her icy appearance. Douglas Dumbrille, Donald Cook and Henry Kolker portray a number of their unfortunate victims. John Wayne appears for a few seconds as an unsuccessful admirer of Stanwyck's affection. This would be the only time these two artists would appear together on the screen. <br /> <br /> Film artists should recognize Nat Pendleton as Speakeasy client and Charles Sellon & Edward Van Sloan as bank managers - all without charge. <Br /> <br /> The music that is heard throughout the movie on the soundtrack and perfectly underlines the plot is "Baby Face" (1926) by Benny Davis & Harry Akst and "St. Louis Blues' ( 1914) by WC Praktisch. <br /> <br /> BABY FACE is a prime example of naughtiness before the Code, which is exactly the kind of film that was to be eliminated in 1934 by the introduction of the Production Order.
