I bought it a while ago, but I did not see it until last night. I like Juliette Lewis, although I do not care about Brad Pitt. After this visit I have to admit that he is a perfect actor - his character was absolutely believable and I did not think "Brad Pitt" at all. Unfortunately I can not say the same for David Duchovny I'm an X Files fan and I had to look twice to confirm the date of this movie, as I had thought it would be done a few years later has been. I like Duchovny, but found his character a bit two-dimensional, except where he makes voice overs. This part was strong and had a characteristic character, good intonation, etc. Otherwise, I always thought of "Agent Mulder", which is a pity. Michelle Forbes was a pleasure. Why have not I seen her yet? (I'll see what other roles she has played and which will be seen as soon as possible.) I'm a bit worried about the stereotyping of Lewis, this movie and "Natural Born Killers" (a firm favorite). Interesting to see a contrast of characters - in NBK she is a willing accomplice, while here she ignores the violence and strives hard not to acknowledge Early's dark side until she has hit her in the face. <br /> <br /> I liked the movie almost unrestrictedly. Apart from Duchovny's character, which did not seem to be fully formed (and maybe "washed out" by Pitts), he was perfect. I was also happy with the end - glad that the innocent heroes did not die, but they had to suffer first. It was realistic, tense and disturbing. <br /> <br /> If you like NBK you may like this movie and vice versa.
