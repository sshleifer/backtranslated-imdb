Running Man viciously mocks the modern American media complex and hits its target. It may be an easy target, but they still pull it off. RM effortlessly does pro wrestling (with some pro wrestlers like the hunters), network television, the Nielsen ratings, the American government (which appeals to conversations anyway), crime & punishment and half a dozen other things on the way. It's a long way from the original Stephen King novella, and Arnold is not Ben Richards's novella. But who cares? It's basically an Arnie movie, with all the well-choreographed action sequences and one-lines that such a company requires.
