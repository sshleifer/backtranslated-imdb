This rousing drama has it all: first-rate acting, incredible photography, good story. It is often compared to "Braveheart" as both films are in historic Scotland. Although I love Braveheart, I think that this is the better of the two films. Jessica Lange gave an incredible performance (should have been nominated for an Oscar). Liam Neeson is fantastic in the title role. Tim Roth plays one of the most evil, despicable characters in film history (he was nominated for an Academy Award). John Hurt is great as Lord Montrose, another unpleasant character. I'm always amazed at the incredible variety of characters that John Hurt can play. This is a story about a dispute between Rob Roy and his clan and Lord Montrose over money. Rob Roy is a self-made man who will not solve his problems with Montrose if he violates his sense of honor. Montrose, who inherited his title, has no sense of honor. And that's what this story is about; Glory of the simple man against corruption of the nobility. This movie is very entertaining and should appeal to everyone. It has romance, action, a beautiful landscape and an exciting action. One of my favorite movies.
