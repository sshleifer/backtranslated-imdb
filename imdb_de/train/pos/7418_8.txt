"Shower" is a story about loyalty, about the unstoppable progress of the modern world to the detriment of more traditional and human ways of life. A man had to choose between his successful career in business, his big-city life, his wife and his retarded young brother. The eternal doubt between what we want to do and what we should do. Modern China against the old one. The public baths with their gatherings, cricket fights, shopping malls and skyscrapers. Many old men and women who are no longer needed. China, one country, two systems, as Xiao Ping said ... even though one of them kills the other. <br /> <br /> Affectionate, moving, full of funny moments and bitter-sweet moments. The actors are enormous, especially the one who plays the role of the backward boy. and Yang Zhang is doing a good job, simple, simple and just let the story flow by itself. <br /> <br /> My rating: 8/10
