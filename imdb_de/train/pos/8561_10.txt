When two authors write a script for Breakfast At Tiffany's horror version, you know something is going right. Drew Barrymore, Patrick Highsmith, Leslie Hope and Sally Kellerman are outstanding actors. The FBI agent was a terrible actor. The scenes in which Patrick Holly looked up and down like a kind of objectifier were just funny. Drew Barrymore is very hot. Intimate strangers, where Sally Kellerman worked, were a great part. The funny rubber worm was just funny. Nathan was a very pretty cat. But what was this scene when Patrick Holly followed in a cloaca and Mr. Gooding attacked him? And the scene with Dr. Wallace? What was he fumbling around in there? And not every man has a wife, as Sally Kellerman stated. And when Patrick and Elizabeth saw Drew outside Victor, it was funny.
