Other reviewers seem to think that this is a horrible movie. That's just not true and a bit unfair. <br /> <br /> The spectacle is of good quality and the direction is moving with decent fluidity. I do not think there is anything wrong with the Tarantino method of linking stories together. Maybe it's just a new tool for directors. I found the movie much more interesting. Maybe some elements of the script need to be tightened, but that's the only mistake I can find. Nestor Cantillana does a great job as Sylvio, Antonella Rios is also breathtaking and worth the price.
