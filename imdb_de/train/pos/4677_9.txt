I understand this movie as a debut and is therefore very impressive. It has the feel and pace of a "true indie", but director Todd Yellin clearly has the photographic and editorial vision, command and judgment of a mature and experienced professional. The recordings are well framed and thoughtful and serve to advance the story. He and screenwriter Ivan Solomon provide a story that is much deeper and more lyrical than the typical "paint by numbers" script. It's a story that needs the talent of the Judd Hirsch caliber to do a good job. Judd is fantastic as always; as well as Scott Cohen and beautiful Susan Floyd. The real surprise, however, is Elliot Korte, who plays Adam Groden. Yellin succeeded in eliciting nuance from the young actor in a role that could easily be devalued by stereotype or assault. Still, I found the movie refreshing and entertaining.
