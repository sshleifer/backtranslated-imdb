This film takes you to a different time, with a different pace in everyday life. We get an idea of ​​how families had to deal with the war and how quickly we sent young men into the fight. A very touching look at the past and the memory that war victims do not just happen on the front line. Fortunately, many of us had never had to go through what our great-grandparents, grandparents or parents had gone through during a war. I think this movie is a little thank you. Peter Outerbridge looks amazing as a young Peter O'Toole and Russell Crowe is absolutely charming and as Australian as he can be. It definitely pays to listen to him and recite "High Flight". I wonder what he could achieve with Shakespeare.
