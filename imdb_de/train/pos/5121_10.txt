I'm a big fan of the movie, but not for the usual reasons. I think that Travolta and Winger performed better than average. I think the sets were representative of the place and the era. I liked the soundtrack and the Charlie Daniels band. I think the photography is great! As the indoor scenes were shot in the actual club and Gilleys had low ceilings - maybe 10 to 12 feet high and the smoke that was supposed to simulate a "smoke-filled bar" hung 2 to 4 feet below the ceiling. The camera managed to beat the smoke, focusing on the actors, the bull, the bar, the women, the dancing and the dim light that was actually in the bar! What a performance! There was certainly additional lighting, but in order to maintain the atmosphere of the bar, low-light shots were required. Ray Villalobos (the cameraman) was outstanding! He got some shots he could not hope for, and the effect of the pictures brought a sense of reality to the movie. Thanks, Ray - great work!
