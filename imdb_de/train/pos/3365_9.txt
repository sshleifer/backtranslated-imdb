A SPECIAL DAY (Ettore Scola - Italy / Canada 1977). <br /> <br /> Now and then you come across a movie that really touches a nerve. This offers a very simple requirement, which is executed in almost every way virtually flawlessly and at the same time moves incredibly. It is surprising that Ettore Scola's "Una giornate particulare" is relatively unknown and even hated by some critics. Time Out calls it "garbage" and Leonard Maltin, a bit milder, "pleasant but insignificant". I do not agree with that, not only because this film is deeply moving, but in its simple history it shows us more insights into everyday life in Fascist Italy than most of the films I've ever seen. The cinematography is downright inconspicuous, even a bit boring, and the plot is straightforward, which could explain the film's relative unpopularity. Given the fact that audiences were not spoiled with great Italian films in the late '70s, it is even stranger to the critics. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a ten-minute collage of archive material From Hitler's visit to Italy on May 8, 1938. Against this background, we first meet Antonietta (Loren), a lonely, in love housewife with six children in a Roman dwelling , One day, when Beo escapes, she meets her neighbor Gabriele (Mastroianni), who seems to be only one in the building and does not attend the ceremonies. He is good-natured, cultivated and soon attracts him. Throughout the movie, we hear the fascist rally from the concierge radio roaring through the courtyard. Scola playfully uses the camera to make us part of the process. After the opening scene, the camera swings over the inner courtyard of the modernist (then hypermodern) block of flats and seems to be looking for our main characters, whom we have not met yet. <br /> <br /> Marcello Mastrionani and Sophia Loren are unforgettable in the two main roles. It is all the more astonishing that they are completely against type. Born in Canada John Vernon plays Loren's husband, but can only be seen in the first and last scene. I think his voice must have been dubbed because he is not of Italian descent and, as far as I know, has not yet lived there. So I can not imagine that he speaks Italian. When his voice was dubbed, I did not notice anything at all. On the contrary, he is absolutely credible as an Italian, even more than the rest of the cast. The story is simple but extremely effective, the performances are superb, the ending is just perfect and the framing does not seem overbearing, it works completely. Do not miss these. <br /> <br /> Camera Obscura --- 9/10
