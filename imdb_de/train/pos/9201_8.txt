Dev Anand (or Prashant) and Zeenat Aman (Jasbir / Janice) are siblings who grew up in single parent families. Jasbir (the sister) grows up in a prosperous environment, but this is not enough to make her reject her life and eventually join a hippie movement that eventually leads her to drugs. Prashant (the brother), however, grows up in a less affluent environment, but becomes a mature gentleman. Throughout history, Prashant is trying to save his little sister (who is constantly in a trance) from a hostile hippie environment. This film is a test of time, commenting that cults and hippie groups are a place for those who give up their lives when they have to stand up instead and be counted in the face of adversity. Great musical compositions in this film that mean different things in different situations and for different people, and the director gives an eerie feeling.
