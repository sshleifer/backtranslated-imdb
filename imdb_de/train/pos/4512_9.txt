I've seen this movie today and have to say it was way better than I expected it would take a few hours before seeing it. Personally, I had some language bias, but it completely changed my idea. The movie was in most cases surprisingly good with the great actors and actresses. It was a story about a boy who had a dream and did everything to reach it. That really touched me and as a movie based on a true story, he convinced me. A new school, a psycho-school leader and a little boy who becomes acquainted with a new teacher, a bit different from the others and fighting for things, even if they do not seem to work. It showed how small things in many things can make big changes and how differences can sometimes cause difficult situations. I also think that the selection of actors was perfect. It really felt like you viewed the episodes as an outsider as a viewer. Before blessing this movie with praise, I must admit that there were some things and situations that did not look realistic and feel realistic. Like the one where the headmaster Frits aka beat. Martin in front of the class, at the end of the film. He was really badly beaten, but the only thing that was inflicted on him was some blood from the nose, compared to the first beats in the beginning, when Frits got some stitches ... I have to say, if I ever get this DVD somewhere From the shop, it is sure that I take her.
