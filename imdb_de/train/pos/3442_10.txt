This movie makes the intellectual mind think and try to analyze the story. I also can not understand why people would ruin this movie. <br /> <br /> If you're a Jerry Bruckheimer fan, this movie may not be for you. <br /> <br /> This film offers a high degree of realism. The performance of the actors and actresses is exemplary. No fake, only natural. <br /> <br /> No special sound effects, so special side effects. <br /> <br /> The camera work is excellent, the music is oh so good. I can not wait to get the soundtrack. <br /> <br /> It makes your body numb like Constant Garderner. The direct talent has raw talent, certainly not a follower.
