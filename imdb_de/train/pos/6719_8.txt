I like this movie because it's a fine movie made by people who care about art, not just home movies. It's filled with Super Surfer Greg Noll's home videos and a plethora of amateur videos of others tackling his 50-year passion. Nevertheless, it has been extended so far that it approaches aesthetic fame. It is filled with artistic talent and athletic talent, even if you consider surfing something easy. Surfers are neither astronauts nor test pilots. Nor are they surgeons (maybe) or Ph.Ds (again maybe). It believes in the search of the surfer. It believes in the beauty of human stupidity. She believes in the great gift of peace that comes from ending the war. Surfers celebrate the end of the war on the northern edge of a Hawaiian island that was attacked by Japanese zeros fifteen years ago. It is celebrating the downtime of a country that has waged a Cold War with the Russian Socialists instead of a hot war. Surfing is the ultimate narcissism. It is dangerous, but only a little historically. I suppose Alexander the Great would not be celebrated for his surfing technique. He had to conquer a few dozen countries to get the cheap press he had received. This movie has no military heroes. It has no weapons. The only surfers who only surf beach heads have a beer stand and a surfboard shop. This is not a problem. Peace is not desperate. It's the pleasure of exhaling.
