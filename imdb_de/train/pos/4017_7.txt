This is a very memorable western spaghetti. It has a great plot, interesting characters and some very good plays, especially by Rosalba Neri. Her role as a vicious malice in this movie is really classic. She steals every scene she's in and expresses so much with her face and eyes, even when she's not speaking. Your performance is very credible. She manages to be quite mesmerizing without being over the top. Mark Damon is also surprisingly good in this movie. <br /> <br /> The music is excellent, and the title song is the type that keeps going through your head for days after you've seen the movie, whether you want it or not. There are a few parts that are very amusing. I especially like the part in which Rosalba Neri takes off her clothes in front of the parrot. There are also many smooth weapon games that have been done very well. <br /> <br /> I would probably have given this movie 8 or 9 stars, if there had not been two things. The first is a stupid barbaric brawl that occurs about 25 minutes after the movie. This is one of the most ridiculous fights I have ever seen in a movie. It is very poorly choreographed and looks more like a dance number from a bad musical than a real fight. You might miss that if it was a Terence Hill / Bud Spencer comedy, but this is a serious western and the brawl should be more realistic. The other thing that annoyed me about this movie was Yumas cowardly Mexican buddy. I think he should be comic relief or something, but the character was just stupid and unnecessary in a movie like this, and he was not funny at all. I can only say, where is Tuco when you need him? <br /> <br /> All that has been said, I would like to assure all those who read this that Johnny Yuma is a classic Western spaghetti despite all the mistakes mentioned above and that all fans of the genre must see this movie.
