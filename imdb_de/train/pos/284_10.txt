The only season has just aired here in Australia and I thought it was absolutely awesome! I love it! All storylines are so good! and it's a much more realistic view of teenage and family life today. Nonetheless, strong family values ​​kept them together and to be there for each other. Her problems were real and it really drew you into the show. The show is essentially about this family, the "days" and their lives. The family consisted of Abby Day (mother), Jack Day (father), Natalie Day (sporting daughter), Cooper Day (outsider) and Nathan Day (boy, genius son). Each of the episodes is a day of their lives, and coopers have a perspective on things. I loved Cooper very much. His insights throughout the show were just great. He was by far my favorite character. It ended with so many things that could have gone on, I'm really sad that another season has not been done. It was a great show that I will miss.
