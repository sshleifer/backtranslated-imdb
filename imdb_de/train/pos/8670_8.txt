WWE Armageddon, December 17, 2006 - Live from Richmond Coliseum, Richmond, VA <br /> <br /> Kane vs. MVP in an Inferno Match: This is WWE's fourth inferno match and it's Kane vs. MVP (ask me, why it was the first game on the map). I just looked at the end pieces where Kane sets MVP's ass on fire as they stand on the apron and then MVP runs around in the arena and roars ?? Finally, the referees extinguished the fire with a fire extinguisher while MVP spread around the entrance ramp. Funny and visually quite entertaining end. 7/10 <br /> <br /> WWE Tag Team Championship: This was originally supposed to be William Regal & Dave Taylor vs. Brian Kendrick & Paul London (c) in a regular tag team match. GM Teddy Long, however, comes to the ring and announces that it will be a fatal 4-way tag team ladder match. MNM and The Hardys are thrown in and it's all mess. A word to describe this eye-opener? Impressive. Man, I really can not remember how many sick spots there were in this game and words can not really do it justice. There was a particularly noteworthy point where The Hardys set up a ladder in a seesaw position and Jeff jumped off the top rope while Matt held MNM for the kill and then WHAM! Nitro blew away as Mercury apparently botched him and bleeding with wounds on his face. He had to be taken away and Nitro continued the game alone. Another point was when Jeff bombarded London while flying off the ladder. There were other breathtaking spots that you could not remember. London finally unbuckles the straps and wins this enthusiastic show dealer. 8.5 / 10 <br /> <br /> The Boogeyman Vs. The Miz: The two men are thrown in and around the ring until Boogeyman explodes a sit-out powerbomb for the win and then, as usual, slobber worm over The Miz's mouth. 5.5 / 10 for this three-minute incognito. <br /> <br /> Championship in the United States: Chris Benoit (c) faces Chavo Guerrero in another typical Guerrero match. Among the good spots were a Superplex on the upper rope of Chavo and an unusually long chain of German suplexes of Benoit. Vicki Guerrero comes with his belt in the ring to nail Benoit, but Benoit scares them off and takes a long time to decide whether he is in a Sharpshooter or not. This allows Chavo to roll-up, but Benoit rolls it up again and Chavo is locked up in the Sharpshooter. Game over. Nice, hard-fought fight, albeit at times slow. 7/10 <br /> <br /> WWE Cruiserweight Championship: Gregory Helms (c) against Jimmy Wang Yang for this tournament in a fairly moderate fight. The match had some good flights? especially Helms' moves from the top rope ?? but the crowd did not seem to have been there after experiencing the ladder game, and Yang needs to blow up more. Helms won the match after banging Yang off with a facebuster on his knee. 7.5 / 10 <br /> <br /> The Undertaker against Mr. Kennedy in a Last Ride Match: This time, after a series of matches between the two, this is a Last Ride match, the second of its kind and the very first Der Winner must accompany his opponent in a hearse from the arena. Pretty good for what these two can offer. Kennedy handled a large part of Taker and even broke free from a Chokeslam to throw Taker from the Armageddon range, which was about 15 feet deeper. and thank God for Kennedy, otherwise it would have been brutal. Kennedy almost won the race until Taker got back into the hearse (I liked the camera in the hearse). Taker then missed a steel spinner on Kennedy and instead opened the hearse window. Later he opened Kennedy with a chair and followed with a successive Chokeslam and Tombstone on the hearse's roof. Kennedy was unconscious and Taker drove him out of the arena to win. I was really interested in the willingness of these guys to take really sick shots. 7.5 / 10 <br /> <br /> Santa Claus enters the ring, I go "What the hell?" Like many children in the crowd, and then the word "lingerie competition" comes to my ears. Break time. <br /> <br /> Batista & John Cena Vs. Finlay & King Booker: Talk about charisma vs. Technology. This match was actually a pretty good major event, with the impulse rationally shifting from one team to another, keeping the tension alive. Even Finlay had some legitimate shots on his opponents this time (I somehow doubted he was battling the champions) and, above all, he and Booker did not manage to cheat. except at a point where Booker rammed his scepter into Cena's throat. Batista beats the bomb on Booker for the win, could not see the F-U; Cena still performed the 5 Knuckle Shuffle and I think he did the STFU too. This was probably the best technical match of the night and the participants really did a great job in what they could do without a ladder. 7.5 / 10. <br /> <br /> As an on-and-off WWE fan, I have to agree. Armageddon was studded with numerous eye-catchers, and the ladder game ended up swallowing half of the show; The last Ride match offered some pretty nerve-wracking points, and the Main Event was also very good for its category. All other games also matched their payroll, except perhaps Boogeyman Vs. The Miz fight and the always useless lingerie competition. Overall, Armageddon was a very enjoyable price-performance ratio and despite some major setbacks in the PPV chronology, Armageddon wishes this year's farewell heartfelt. PPV rating: 8/10.
