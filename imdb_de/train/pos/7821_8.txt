Very seldom does Denzil Washington make a bad movie and remember it applies to Kevin Kline. In this case, this must be considered one of the best films. It's more about a film about how a strong friendship can be more than the story of Steve Biko, though we get a glimpse of how the man was and how far the reporter and friend Donald Woods has gone to name the man and let the world know What a corrupt, lazy society was South Africa. The Direction is excellent by David Attenborough as for Gandhi, although criticism should be exercised, this could be down to the length of the film. Two and a half hours is a long time to sit through a historical movie. It's amazing how he manages to control all extras. Thousands of people in both films. This movie really opens your eyes to what happened before the separation from Aparthiet, and you can not miss it. 8 out of 10.
