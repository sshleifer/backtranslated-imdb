This is not one of Jimmy Stewart's best films - I admit that quickly. Although some see his film as pure propaganda, I wonder what's wrong with that? Yes, sure, just like the TV program THE FBI. This is an obvious case where the Bureau is doing some public relations work to try to build up the support. But as for entertainment, it does a good job. And, surprisingly, the film focuses more on crime than espionage and commies. Instead, it is a fiction of one of the first agents and the career he has chosen. Well, considering that the agent is being played by Jimmy Stewart, then it's pretty sure drama and writing were good - because this was a movie with a real budget and a studio that did not waste the star on a third-rate movie would. All in all, it's worth seeing, but not great.
