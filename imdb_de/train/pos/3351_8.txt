Very good western. This was the first time author Richard Wilson made a film, and this too was a premiere for Samuel Goldwyn Junior. It's a pleasure to see a very young and pretty Angie Dickinson as a girl in the saloon. Robert Mitchum comes to this city, ruled by outlaws, and is hired as a city tamer. However, people are worried that he will go too far, also because of the damage he inflicts on the city's shops. There are some similarities in the story with "Warlock" made in 1959. This movie keeps a very fast and exciting pace and really keeps you on the sidelines.
