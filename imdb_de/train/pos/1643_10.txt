This is a movie that should be seen by everyone, if you want to see great spectacles. Mr. Torn and Mrs. Farrel do an excellent job. I think they should have it back on TV for a new audience to enjoy. Wonderful performances. <br /> <br /> You have a real sense of what the pioneers had to go through physically and emotionally. A great, never been there movie. <br /> <br /> It was done when Mrs. Farrel was very young. I've always seen her as a comedian, but that's certainly not a comedy and she's just wonderful. There are very few dialogues, but that only makes it more real. Mr. Torn is as always a great presence and only his breathing has a great feeling. I have to watch a movie.
