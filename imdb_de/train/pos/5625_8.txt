The attractive Marjorie (Farrah Fawcett) lives in fear after being attacked by a single biker. She is mortally shaken by the fact that her attacker knows her address. As expected, Joe (James Russo), the attacker, intrudes into Marjorie's house and subjects her to humiliating terror. Marjorie is hurt and bloody and manages to pull her attacker into the upper hand, throw the living daylight out of the rut and make him helpless thanks to wasp spray in his eyes and neck. Hog, who had tied and beaten, tries to explain to Marjoy's flatmates (Diana Scarwid and Alfrie Woodard) when they get home. It's almost a touch of grace, but it's not from Marjorie. Should she continue to impose her own punishment? Violence, sexual abuse and coarse language make for a rating of R. Fawcett really escapes the thick rolls that would spoil her career forever. Kudos to director Robert M. Young.
