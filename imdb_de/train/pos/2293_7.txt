This is a very, very early cartoon of Bugs Bunny. Therefore, the character is still in a transitional period - he is not as drawn out as later and his voice is not quite right. Also, the chemistry between Elmer and Bugs is a bit unusual. Elmer is a poor guy who buys bugs in a pet store - there is no weapon or desire to blow the rabbit in the air! Nevertheless, this film is still very pleasing. The early bugs were definitely bolder and cruel than his later incarnations. In later films he played with Elmer, Yosimite Sam and others because they started with the rabbit. But in this movie he is much more like Daffy Duck of the late 30's and early 40's - an idiot who loves to irritate others !! A true "anarchist" instead of the hero of later cartoons. While not among the best bug bunny cartoons, it's really fun to watch and it's interesting to see how it has changed over the years.
