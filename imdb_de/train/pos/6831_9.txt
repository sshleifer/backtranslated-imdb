I just know another movie that could possibly match Opening Night, and that's Bergman's Persona. Both films are just incredible, they have a wealth of ideas that you can hardly understand at first glance. We have a profound meditation on the relationship between art and life, as an actress, Myrtle Gordon (Gena Rowlands), more closely associates herself with the character she plays on stage than she would like. The accidental death of one of her fans, a young girl who loves Myrtle and is hit by a car, leaves a deep impression on the actress. She begins to ask questions that relate to her aging, which she begins to influence until the only solution becomes alcohol. But that does not help much and Myrtle is one step away from utter insanity. The scene where she kills the dead girl's imaginary (or not) mind is one of the most exciting scenes I've found in a Cassavets movie. The film ends with a stroke of genius for the director as he films a theatrical scene in which he and Gena Rowlands improvise a scene, as Myrtle appears too drunk on the opening night to play her role exactly. This scene was shot spontaneously, with a live audience, the laughter is real, the chemistry between Casavates and Rowlands is absolutely amazing. If you like persona or are interested in a movie that offers great entertainment as well as great ideas, this movie is for you.
