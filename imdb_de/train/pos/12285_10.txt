Brilliant adaptation of the novel that killed the relatives of Chilean President Salvador Allende. Surrounded by a large estate that emerges from the ruins and becomes a source of abuse and exploitation, a luxury property for up-and-coming Esteban Trueba and his undeserved family, brilliant Danish director Bille August creates what would be the process at the time which led to the greatest shame of his story for the hardened Chilean nation, whose main character would be Augusto Pinochet (Stephen 's similarities with it are inevitable: remember as an example the image of the senator with dark glasses forcing him to wink Build a palace). <br /> <br /> Bille August visits an extraordinary cast in the prominent Irons of Jeremy, whose character changes from arrogance and extreme cruelty, the hard lesson of this life always makes us change almost. In Esteban, the law of resonance applies with great wisdom to the fullest: "The things that are freckles are the same punishment that will serve you." <br /> <br /> Unforgettable Glenn Close-playing track, the foul sister of Stephen, whose sin, driven by loneliness, spiritual and platonic love, was the wife of his cruel, snow-covered brother. Meryl Streep also brilliant, a woman whose name appeared to him like a glove Clara. With telekinetic, cognitive, and medial powers, this hardened woman, loyal to her dull, conservative husband, is a sign of the character and self-control we desire for ourselves and for all people. <br /> <br /> Each character is a portrait of virtuosity (as Blanca worthy rebel leader Pedro Segundo unhappy ...) or a portrait of humiliation, such as Stephen Jr., the bastard child of Senator, who serves as an instrument for the return of the boomerang. <br /> <br /> The film moves the guts, we have recreated some facts that should not be repeated, but which are still absurd (Colombia is a sad example) and another reminder that life, after all wonderful are always people like Isabel Allende and just perpetuate Bille August.
