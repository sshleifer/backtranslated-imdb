I really liked Tom Barman's AWTWB. You just have to let it come to you and enjoy it while it lasts, and do not expect anything. It's like sitting on a cafe terrace with a beer in the summer sun and watching people go by. It's definitely not thought-provoking, that's true, but that's not a requirement for a good movie. It's just the experience during the movie that's great. <br /> <br /> I had the feeling that there were a few strands that could have been worked out a bit more, but as a lynch fan, I do not care so much anymore. <br /> <br /> And I * loved * the style or the flair of this movie. It's smooth but fresh, and the soundtrack is a beauty. Any music lover will get his tricks out of the AWTWB, I can assure you. <br /> <br /> I give him 8 out of 10 (<br/> <br /> (Musical 10 out of 10))
