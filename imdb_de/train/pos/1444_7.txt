Nestor Serrano, Eddie Santos, was to meet his drug supplier, Tito Zapatti, Larry Romano, in the buy-and-sell operation in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, with Tito the one to break. Santos and Tito are shot dead at the end. During the deadly shooting, innocent six-year-old James Bone Jr., Jaliyl Lynn, was also killed in the crossfire. With New York City was scheduled to host the 1996 Democratic Presidential Conference this summer. The last thing the extravagant mayor of the city of Pappas, Al Pacino, wanted was a possible uprising against the tragic death of young James Bones by a possible one in which later it was discovered that it was a bullet from Tito's gun that killed the young James, a member of New York City Police Department. <br /> <br /> Far more shocking than Bone's death is the fact that his killer Tito Zapatti was sentenced to probation by respected New York judge Walter Stern, Martin Landau. If he had to sit behind bars for 10 to 20 years, being arrested with a kilo of cocaine in the back seat of his car! It soon turned out that the person who got Richter Stern for a payout of $ 50,000.00 was not the political head of Brooklyn, Frank Anselmo, Danny Aiello. It is Anselmo who is involved with Mayor Pappas in a land deal involving the New York subway system. That would bring tens of millions of dollars to him and his friends over the next two years! Mayor Pappas in The Bone Murder would be indirectly linked by joining with Judge Stern, who enabled Tito to be free, who is a friendly friend of his and his Gomba or compatriot Frank Anselmo. <br /> <br /> To keep it from happening, the late Det. Santons is framed by undercover in the bone shoot without the authority of his superiors. Those who frame Santos go up to $ 40,000 in cash in his back home summerhouse, so it looks like Tito's uncle Mafia boss Paul Zapatti, Anthony Francoisa, paid him to bring drugs with his nephew has the action. What can explain him and also Tito who is shot by Tito shot at his paying Santos! <br /> <br /> As it turns out, mayor Pappas's deputy in the town hall, Kevin Coulack, concludes he screwed up everything for his boss by being too honest when he found out who was responsible for it, Covering up Tito's criminal history, which allowed him to be on the street. The facts that Kevin uncovered lead directly to Frank Anselmo, an important political supporter of Mayor Pappas, who turned out to have his hip tied to Tito's Mafia chief Uncle Paul. <br /> <br /> A bit over the top. "City Hall" shows how big-city corruption can go against anyone in the city government without them, like Mayor Pappas, even though he knows about it. Mayor Pappas biggest sin was that he was friends with Brooklyn boss Anselmo, which brought people into work, such as Judge Stern, who was blackmailed by Anselmo's real boss, Mafioso Paul Zapatti. *** SPOILERS *** In Williamsburg, it was just a lethal shootout to get things moving, not just Tito but Det Santos and James Bone were killed, but why was he allowed to be on the streets to tear down the popular mayor of New York City? Mayor Pappas looked forward to much bigger things, such as the governor or even the president, in his future political activities. As it turned out, his deputy Kevin Calhoun, who was not looking the other way, was responsible for his death, as was his good friend de s Mayor Frank Anselmo and the person he assisted as state judge, Judge Stern. The decision to dismiss Tito Zapatti has made this whole catastrophe possible, resulting in at least half a dozen murders and suicide!
