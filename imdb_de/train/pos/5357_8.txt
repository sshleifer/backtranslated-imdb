This comic style is funny, has action and a great futuristic style. The writer Steven de Souza, who has also written Commando, gives Arnie many lines in which he can comment: "Send me a copy," after signing a contract and stabbing a lawyer; "What a pain in the neck", after he strangled with barbed wire subzero; "He had to split," after he had cut his body between his legs; And when Killian hits through a billboard with his own face, Arnie concludes, "Well, that was fine." Funnily, it reminds us that there are some similarities, a completely different sci-fi movie with Schwarzenegger.
