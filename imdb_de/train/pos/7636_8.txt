It has been a few years since I saw this, but I remember it and would like to see it again. It became a kind of "therapy" for me with a personal experience. <br /> <br /> A 35-year-old man complains about a high school baseball game in which he "missed the ball" and his team has lost. He thinks about it 20 years later "if only I could beat this ball" and how his life would be better. Then he gets a chance to find out ... and gets a bit more than he expected. <br /> <br /> It reminds me so much of my high school when I twice tried our Drill / Dance Team for our school and did not make it. This team was most likely a sisterhood in my school. When you were there, you were "that all". I did not try it until my last two HS years, and after the second time I was really struggling. I had hit my leg hard and bruised and worn stockings just before the tryout to cover the bruise, which caused me to fail. That was in 1987. <br /> <br /> Over the years, sometimes now, I think, "If only I had not hit my leg, I would never have worn those stupid tights." Now I'm not sitting and I think that my life would have been better or different if I had done it, but when I saw this movie, I realized that we never really know how different things can be when we have something in it Change the past. Who knows, it could have changed the course of things so that I would not have met my son's father. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this movie to anyone who has that one moment in the past he wishes you could change. Be careful with your wishes !!!
