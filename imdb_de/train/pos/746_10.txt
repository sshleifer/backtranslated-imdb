When I reach the "back" of 35, I shake my head more and more about today's sexually hot, drug-addicted teens. It was great to be reminded that it was just as crazy for me then as it was for teens today. This film brings this point to the core. If you are a fan of the late 70s, you will love the movie. From KISS posters to a fishing concert, this movie rocks! <br /> <br /> Watch out for a young Laura Dern. Why did not they have any more songs from the Runaways I'll never know? <br /> <br /> I had a problem with Randy Quaid's character, who deflowered a 16-year-old girl. While he was away, she and her friends have a party that destroys Dude's house. The police come and everything, but no mention of all the underage drinking and how these children got their hands on this stuff. Foxes belongs to Over the Edge, Fast Times, Dazed & Confused and Kids as one of the Teen Teen Fear Sticks. <br /> <br /> I say, buy it and look at it with your kids and talk about it.
