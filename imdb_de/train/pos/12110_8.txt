If you think that anime is just about huge reptiles rapping schoolgirls, think again. The Japanese animation has a completely different side. Yakitate! Japan is one of those shows. It's a good-natured story about a little boy who has the gift of making delicious bread. In his universe, it's all about creating a Japanese bread that goes with the famous European bread. The show is as crazy as they come and I'm sure non-Japanese viewers will miss a lot of jokes. It is still very nice to watch because the show is completely innocent. <br /> <br /> In the world of Yakitate! It's not uncommon for people to look like they had an orgasm after eating bread. The bread hallucinates and can give the consumer a variety of super powers, from time travel to swimming like a fish. This weird aspect makes it one of the least predictable and funny shows I've seen in a while.
