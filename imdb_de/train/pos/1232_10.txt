Very funny movie. Classic movie funny Eddie Murphy of the 80s. I saw it as a kid and have a good memory. The classic irony of Murphy does not fail, the movie is funny, well done. Murphy in the 1980s did a lot of action films, making fun of everything dangerous. The result can only be appreciated by a few films that have changed since 1986. The atmosphere for a movie of this time is good and the special effects are good for a movie of that time. A beautiful movie to appreciate the taste of the ironic, recently disappeared actor Murphy. The last part are anthologies, the sympathetic actor who plays the role of Tibetan Monk. That's it.
