Brilliant adaptation of the largely internal monologues of Leopold Bloom, Stephen Dedalus and Molly Bloom by Joseph Strick, which recreates the charming portrait of Dublin on June 16, 1904 - Bloomsday - a day to celebrate - a twin goal. Bravo director Strick, screenwriter Haines as well as casting director and cameraman during the creation of this masterpiece. Gunter Grass' novel The Tin Drum, filmed by Volker Schl√∂ndorff (1979), is another fine film adaptation of the inner monologue, which I compare favorably with Strick's film and there are also recognizable characters in the film, but with different names in the novel. For example, Buck Mulligan, with whom Dedalus lives, turns out to be a prominent Dublin surgeon. <br /> <br /> This movie will be even more beautiful with more sightseeing. <br /> <br /> Brian invinoveritas1@AOL.com June 15, 2008
