I can not say whether the British comedies produced at Ealing Studios after the Second World War are an acquired taste or not, but I am totally addicted and the man in a white suit is one of the best. The well-known conspiracy that both the textile industry and the textile trade unions are threatened by an indestructible, dirt-resistant fiber need not be discussed further. Suffice to say that the slingshots and arrows that the naively idealistic Sidney Stratton suffered in pursuing his polymer vision provide a comedic pleasure. Many of the familiar faces of the British character actors - nervous Cecil Parker, arrogant sneaky Michael Gough, and blatantly reckless Ernest Thesinger - performed well. Guinness is as always and forever outstanding, and Joan Greenwood is delicious as Daphne (just as she puts the word "Daddy" makes the whole movie worth seeing). <br /> <br /> "Knudsen !!!!!"
