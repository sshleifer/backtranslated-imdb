Three scumbags get their righteous deserts after wasting their lives with greed, drugs, ego and bad attitudes. Interesting and well done; With this style of film, I always wonder where reality ends and fantasy takes over. Although these people were the scum of the earth, I still felt sorry for them. They never really had a chance.
