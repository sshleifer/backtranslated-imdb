I was thrilled to finally see the first season release of Amazing Stories on DVD. I had forgotten what an outstanding cast of actors and directors had worked on this series. For the longest time, the only way to see this remarkable series was with the VHS 2 or 3 episode collections or when Sci-Fi would re-run the episodes. However, when sci-fi hosts the reps, they usually stay with the same episodes. In season 1, there were some outstanding episodes like The Mission that they did not repeat. Does anyone know exactly how long this series ran? IMDb is at the top from 1985 to 1987, but I thought it was more than two years old. If you loved Twilight Zone, Night Gallery and Outer Limits, you will love this series and you will not be disappointed with your purchase.
