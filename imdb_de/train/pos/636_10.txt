Why are the previews so blah for a movie that is so great !! Everyone should know what a great movie that is. It is captivating and funny from the first moment, original and good-natured. I wish the movie went as well as it deserved! <br /> <br /> For those who love The Princess Bride, Maze and other really fun and original fantasy adventures, this is one of the big ones. Robert DeNiro is hysterical. The relatively young newcomer Charlie Cox is an incredible leader. Claire Danes is fantastic as always. Michelle Pfiefer makes a big splash with her recent return to the screen. There are also many wonderful moments from minor characters ... to facial expressions.
