I try to see most of the time everyday, and although I have seen it in the last 4 years, I have not seen every episode. <br /> <br /> The show is about Danny Tanner, the guy who does news for the sport. His wife is killed by a drunk driver's car accident, and he asks Jesse, a Elvis madman with a motorcycle, and he is obsessed with his hair. Joey, an adult kid who makes comedies and keeps making cartoons to take care of his three girls, Donna Joe, call her DJ, Stephinie, the second oldest, and Michelle, the youngest. <br /> <br They all live under one roof without anyone helping them. <br /> <br /> Later on the show, Jesse gets a girlfriend and is later married to her and has twins, Nicki and Alex. (This starts in the new seasons.) This show is fantastic. If you like the suite life of Zack and Cody, that's Rabe, Boy Meets World and Designing Woman, you'll love this. (It's starting to get better in the last few seasons) Take a look, you'll love it!
