We do not have to lose this movie, this is one of the biggest I have ever seen. Jean Pierre Leaud is amazing (more than usual) and the movie is one of the most memorable of the new fashion. Jean Eustache is no longer in the world, we only have these black-and-white images to commemorate one of the greatest and most underrated French directors. You just have to love this masterpiece. I'll never forget it. <br /> <br /> P.S.: Sorry for the English ...
