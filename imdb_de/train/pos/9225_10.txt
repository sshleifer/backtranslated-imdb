Bo Derek's beauty and John Derek's revolutionary direction make this film worthwhile. <br /> <br /> Bo, who looks even prettier than ever, is a recently widowed woman who witnesses a visit from her "dead" husband (Anthony Quinn). He has a plan. Bo has to procure the body of a young man so that the mind of a husband can turn from the ghost back into the physical life. Can she find a suitable candidate? How will she do it for Tony to do his thing? <br /> <br /> With the attributes of Bo, John's unique focus, Quinn's film presence, and John a very exotic look for the entire movie, this movie is pleasing to the eye.
