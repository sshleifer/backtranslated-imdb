Greetings from the darkness. Mary Heron has put together a whole series of films that give an insight into their specific time. Their previous "I Shot Andy Warhol" and "American Psycho" commented best when they commented on the bizarre society of that time. Although "The Notorious Bettie Page" is obviously about Ms. Page, it is also a highlight behind the scenes of the world of confused photo shoots in the 1950s. <br /> <br /> The film is fun both from the perspective of history and from a technical point of view, as it was filmed and put together. The grainy B & W movie and photos capture time, and the introduction of color in Miami Beach through the photos of Bunny Yeager is very well done. <br /> <br /> The side cast is strong with David Strathairn (fresh from his Edward R.) role of Murrow), Chris Bauer (as Irving Klaw) and Lili Taylor. The star of the film is the wonderfully talented, underrated and underworked Gretchen Mol. Ms. Mol always brings a brimming edge and spirit into her roles. She was absolutely mesmerizing in the little-seen, Jason Alexander directed "Just Looking" in 2000. Here she is the notorious Bettie Page. Her smile fascinates and her body is flawless. She seems to really enjoy that role and helps us to understand how the Tennessee next-door girl could become the pin-up queen of the underworld. <br /> <br /> As expected, the soundtrack from this period is terrific. Patsy Cline and Peggy Lee are just two of the featured artists. Although the film suggests a story in this industry, the third third somehow falls flat and prevents pure movie magic. But the magic of Gretchen Mol and Bettie Page makes this movie an entertaining movie that will be shown endlessly on HBO in the near future. Well, will someone please make Ms. Mol the star she should be?
