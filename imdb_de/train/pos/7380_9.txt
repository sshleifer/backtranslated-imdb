The three main characters are very well represented, especially Anisio, a rock musician who became the first actor Paulo Miklos. He is extremely convincing as an invader of the lower class. The film shows very well the snowball effect, which affects more and more dodgy businesses, the contrast and the similarities between the lower and the higher class. How everyone gets carried away by greed and ambition. 9-9.5 out of 10.
