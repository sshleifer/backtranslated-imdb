I have enjoyed seeing Brigham Young and found it a positive and largely accurate representation of the LDS faith. I think remaking this epic journey through the plains would be beneficial as many people today are not familiar with the processes and persecutions faced by the early Mormon Church. It is an incredible story of a strong and devoted people. <br /> <br /> As a member of the Church, the movie (most of the historical inaccuracies did not bother me much) disturbed the portrayal of Brigham Young as one who had "knowingly deceived" church members in the belief that he was as successor to Joseph as prophet. While I understand the dramatic reasons behind this plot, it does give the impression that his doubts in this context are historical facts, as both Brigham and the mass of church members were understood in reality and firmly convinced that he had been called to do so Church. Brigham did not knowingly deceive the saints; rather, he led her by inspiration confidently. For Mormons, this point is important because it has an important aspect of our faith: God really speaks to prophets today, and Brigham Young, like Joseph Smith, was an inspired prophet of God. <br /> <br /> Whether or not you believe that statement or not, just know that the film is not exactly what Brigham himself believed.
