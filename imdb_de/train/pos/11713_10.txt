I think it took a lot of courage to make it that way. It is unfortunate that when a celebrity suffers that helps people the most. What she did, however, was remarkable. I have been in the field of mental health for five years and think it's great that mental illness is not a terrible word anymore and I think it has helped. I always thought she was great and always will. I'm glad she wrote this book and the movie was made. She is a remarkable woman and I hope she continues to act. She has been through a lot and is confronted with it. I really would like to see that she works more with children, especially with children actors. Her ordeal should not have happened, and I think she would be wonderful as a mentor to young people. The movie moved me so much that I was very touched. It suffers from a TBI that led to the onset of my illness, and with PTSD. It is good to know that someone has the courage to show his life as it was. I think it has helped this nation and people in general to recognize that there are others and that there is help. Thanks, Mrs. Duke or Anna, whatever you prefer.
