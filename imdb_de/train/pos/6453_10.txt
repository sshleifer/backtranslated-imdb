The arrival of a world-famous conductor leads to unexpected events and feelings in the small village. Some people are threatened by dealing with the church choir and how people are gradually changing. This movie is heartwarming and lets you leave the cinema with a smile and tears in your eyes. It's about making the most of people, and Kay Pollak has written an excellent script based on the ideas he's become so famous for. The actors are outstanding, we already know Michael Nyqvist, but Frida Hallgren was a new and charming acquaintance for me. She has a very lively face that leaves no one untouched. Per Moberg does his part as Gabriella's husband almost too well, he is also terrible to see. One wish would be for him to play a nice guy someday, so we can see if he can handle that character as well. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that will not leave you untouched. If you have not seen it yet, do it today!
