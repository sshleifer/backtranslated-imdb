What a funny, sexy movie! You certainly will not do it like that anymore. 4 sexy au pairs arrive in London and have all kinds of sexual mishaps. The sound is strangely innocent, as the considerable nudity develops from the usual farce situations, and not for any apparent sexual desire of the characters. Only when the actresses accidentally lose their clothes, the male characters become rampant. Richard O 'Sullivan literally gets' randi' (sic). The film certainly reveals the origins of softcore film, as found in the nudies and nudist films of the old school. My special interest in 'au pair girls' is that I'm a big fan of Gabrielle Drake. If an actress has ever looked better naked (she's slim, but wonderfully curvy) or dressed (I've loved her since the first UFO run - who else could wear a purple wig!), I'll eat my hat.
