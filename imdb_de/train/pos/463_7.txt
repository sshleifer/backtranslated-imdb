Of course, the plot, the script and especially the casting in the film are strong. To see so many beautiful things. One aspect I particularly liked is the antagonist's idea - Luzhinis (Turturro) - a former mentor who works his evil on the sidelines. His chess opponent - an Italian dandy in three parts and stick - proves to be a true gentleman and a really good chess player. In his opinion, the "adversary" nobly goes with the plan at the end of completing the final game for the championship posthumously (Luzhin has brought a flyer out the window - sad, but releasing him) by the unstable genius widow (Emily Watson.) In death, Luchin's defense (which he worked out in a late moment of clarity) may be played for the gallantry of a honorable chess master. The Italian praises the piece and calls it brilliant. Talk about a dramatic "endgame!"
