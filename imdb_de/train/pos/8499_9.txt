A very funny film from the East and West, influenced by the closure of the GM plant Flint in Michigan in the 1980s and the rise and integration of Japanese automakers in the US. Located in western Pennsylvania, it features grand performances by Michael Keaton, Gedde Watanabe and George Wendt. Music by blues legend Stevie Ray Vaughan.
