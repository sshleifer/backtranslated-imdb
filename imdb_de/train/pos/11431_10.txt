My 3rd year French lessons have always enjoyed this movie. In a multicultural, inner-city high school, the film offered many points of discussion (in French in the classroom, but I know that after class many discussions took place in English). The most obvious is the relationship between Protée and Aimée compared to that between Protée and France. <br /> <br /> I've always mentioned that this movie had one of the sexiest scenes I've ever seen in a movie. A year ago, a 17-year-old African American called out: "Yes!" when he found out the scene: The one in which Protée Aimée is assisting in putting on her evening gown, both examines the reflection of the others in the mirror. Directors use the "mirror technique" when they want to focus on the inner conflict of one or more characters in a scene: this is a perfect example of the technique, and it's "sexy." <br /> <br /> Most students had difficulty understanding the end of the movie. One hinted that one theme of the film was "Africanism" and that no matter how much you loved Africa or Africans, you can not become African (as the driver wanted it): you have to be African.
