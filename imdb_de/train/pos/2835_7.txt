Thank the Hong Kong VCD / DVD distributors that I paid only $ 1.4 to enjoy a surprisingly enjoyable experience. <br /> <br /> Adultery? As usual in our modern days. Eva grabbed her two children and kidnapped Nick to hunt Luis and Charlotte to Italy. She wants her revenge done, but in the end she also commits Luis' same crime: she had sex with Nick. <br /> <br /> In this small indie production, Vivian Naefe has dealt with the teething problems in modern marriage. How dare one to treat marriage seriously in this fast food time, in which the Do people experience greater mobility physically, mentally and technologically? Conjugal Commitment demands too high a price that most people would subject to circumstances. Nick once trusted Charlotte, but he fell in love with Eva after this hijacking trip, forcing him to experience a lot of growth. Most viewers can be happy about the end, because Eva and Nick get together, well, that should be his biggest reward for their spouse's unfaithful deed. But I want a sequel, I want to see how the four would develop after this exchange. Maybe they'll talk back, how can you be so sure about the shaky love relationship? <br /> <br /> Good spectacle and good scenery. The two little child actors should not be neglected, especially the boy when he cries at the reception of the hotel in Venezia. And how can we of course forget the "bella, bella" scenery of the city?
