"Home Room" such as "Zero Day" and "Elephant" was inspired by the recent wave of school shootings. Unlike the other two films, "Home Room" focuses on two survivors (not the shooters or those who were killed) after a shot. To make less exploitative and useful as little effort is spent to ask questions for which there are no answers. <br /> <br /> Do not give up this little movie for the first 20 minutes, it's supposed to set the real story, but it plays like a declined "Hill Street Blues" episode. It's lame, but bear it, at least it takes the run length so far that the movie is classified as a feature. I recommend skipping this completely and just jumping to the hospital scenes - there is nothing here that you can not pick up from the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> Like many good little movies, this was creatively a one-man show as Paul F. Ryan was both the author and the director. Although this arrangement does not guarantee a good film, it is usually a good sign, because it means a certain unity of construction and execution, which often lacks large budget effects. Since the Home Room script is its real strength, it is fortunate that the author also ran the production and assured himself that his vision made it to the screen. <br /> <br /> Ryan has a big chance with the end, testing the limitations of the sentimentality tolerance of the average viewer. He lets it run to the brim, but against all logic you cry instead of crying. Why the final work is a combination of the audience that needs a reward at the end of such a journey, the song (Sarah McLaughlin's "Sweet Surrender") he goes for, and the amazing last minute editing. <Br /> <br /> The other strength of the film is the casting of Busy Phillips (Alicia) and Erika Christensen (Deanna) as the main protagonists. Although Phillips plays her usual, alienated, grumpy teenager and Christensen, her intelligent daughter of a good family, both bring their roles more intense than ever. The family life of both girls is more than satisfactory and not very interesting for Ryan. What happens here is all about the two, despite a lame side story about a police officer wondering in the city as he tries to tie Alicia to the individual shooter. If they ever had to re-cut and crop the movie, that side story should be compressed. A story about two extremely different girls connecting and helping each other is hardly a novel idea and Ryan could have easily controlled this movie in clich√© and predictability. Instead, his script leads her to a fascinating and convincing sparring game that slowly cuts off each other and shares moments of vulnerability just to withdraw into herself. Deanna's "I'm dying in" line just tears you apart - I can not imagine a moment in another movie that I've felt so intense. She desperately needs a connection that resists Alicia just as desperately. Deanna only makes progress when she retires. The audience always expects a group hug that never happens. <br /> <br /> In the end, not only will you create a lot of excitement, but you will be able to admire the two characters and the two actresses that brought them to life. <br /> <br /> What else do I know? I am only a child.
