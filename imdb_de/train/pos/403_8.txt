I remember that the trailer for Legend of To was quite impressive and was a fan of A Man Called Hero (my absolute favorite), Storm Riders. I decided that I have to see this too. I know that there's too much criticism of Ekin Cheng's acting all over, but he's still my favorite Hong Kong cinema (much better than Nicolas Tse) and he's one of the factors that I liked about this movie. There is no doubt that this film is a work of art from start to finish. I even thought that only the actors were real and everything else was generated by the computer at the end of the movie. They must have invested a lot of work in them, and they deserve a good credit for it. The story of the movie was a fairy tale between good and evil with a love story (I think Ekin Cheng pulls the girls along easily.) The story is not very intellectual and profound, but that's not what you'd expect when watching an action movie rotates. I wish there were more martial arts with fists and fists instead of magic skills, but that's life and it's never the way you want it. And why did they end up sounding like supersonic planes fighting through the sky? That's too funny. The legend of Zu can not, in my view, be a man called a hero, but it flows like a video game and that's not a bad thing at all. If a company chooses to publish games in this movie, I'm not going to be surprised, as it contains all the video game elements. Good work. Please make more fantasy movies like these
