"I moved here to get away from it!" The sheriff of the small town complains. <br /> <br /> "That happens often in Chicago?" His deputy asks. <br /> <br /> Well, no, not really. The plot is that a group of Martians mistaken a Halloween reiteration of the Orson Welles Worlds War as a report of a true invasion of Mars and decided that they must take part in the action! What follows is a series of glitches involving Martian's fortuitous attempts to conquer the city of Big Bean, IL. Everyone concludes that they are children in really good costumes, with the exception of the sheriff's daughter and her boyfriend, a duckling child. <br /> <br /> The Martians themselves are weird and you get the impression that they are not a threat to anyone except themselves pretty early. It's a funny family movie.
