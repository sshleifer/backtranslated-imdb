This is a movie that can make you see him again. I especially liked how it ended. I did not see the end coming, but when Laws was not blown away for the first time, it is believed that he will return. <br /> <br /> The story is gripping and could have been more psychological, but I understand the story that was needed to catch the viewer and the action was necessary. <br /> <br /> Hard to believe that Michael Jr. could be as obviously unmoved as his younger brother and mother are blown away. But I appreciate that the scene did not really grab our attention because it had a bigger story to tell. Some have complained about Hanks as a gangster. I think that's not justified. If his character had been even tougher, he would not have cared if his son had pulled a trigger or not. <br /> <br /> Eight stars for this. Although it was released in 2002, I only saw it on DVD for the first time yesterday.
