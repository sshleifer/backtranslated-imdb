While Hollywood somehow stagnated in the few years after the Second World War, a very productive film industry developed in England. In "The Man in a White Suit," inventor Sidney Stratton (Alec Guinness) creates a suit that never gets dirty. Unfortunately, this means that certain other companies are likely to leave the business! How can Sidney handle this and preserve his dignity? This is an example of one of the great films in which Alec played Guinness before becoming Obi Wan Kenobi. It's a good look at the general absurdity of the business world. If you are planning to start a business, you should watch this movie.
