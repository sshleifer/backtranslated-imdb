I really do not like both Shrek movies. (Since they are both "PG" and have words in them, I would never say myself, so I did not like them.) <br /> <br /> But when it comes to "Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron" I have barely seen it for the first time last month and am a fan of animated films, except Pixar. *** Verderber voraus *** In "Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron" is born a horse foal and finally to the leader of his hearing. One night he sees a strange light in the distance and sets off. This action eventually leads to his capture and some other things. Throughout the movie, we hear a narrative. It is through Spirit's thoughts, though the horses never speak. That makes the movie so good. They (the filmmakers) collected real horses to make the sounds of the horses; None of these sounds were made by humans. Spirit meets Rain, a beautiful mare, and Little Creek, a Native American owned by Rain. Little Creek later frees Spirit and Rain, they run home. <br /> <br /> I've never been a big fan of Brian Adams, but I plan to buy the soundtrack for this movie in the near future. <br /> <br /> Take a look at this movie and you will not regret it. My score: 10/10
