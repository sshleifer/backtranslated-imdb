Most people (36) gave this film a 10 and those who are not too critical or might have expected something different. This is one of my favorite movies from the '80s, it grows with you and has it all. I only got it on DVD and 20 years later it still does not disappoint. I have a lot of action, drama, romance and even comedy. Add to that the great car chases, automatic weapon jumps and loads of stuff going up in the air, and you enjoy sitting! After seeing this, you even hum or whistle the main theme song. <br /> <br /> You can watch this movie with your wife / girlfriend and you will both have a lot of fun. The premise is that of a paperback hero like Doc. Wild, real and helping people to fight evil so they can write history is almost lifelike. The actor Jake Speed ​​is also a director, producer and author of numerous films. In this movie, Jake Speed ​​(the character) is an adventurous guy from Indiana Jones. He usually uses his head to get out of difficult situations, but sometimes uses brute firepower (yay, and sheer luck!). Look out for its only "James Bond" high-tech equipment, the ultimate SUV that falls from the sky. <br /> <br /> The heroine is the very young love interest of the early Jim Carey vampire movie "Once Bitten" and here she is a bit older and still a knockout, even compared to her teenage blond little sister. <br /> <br /> The bad guys are "real evil" men and are the worst evil villain love to hate The ending is just perfect and can stand alone or invite a sequel that was never done - but you can Just imagine what would happen next! <br /> <br /> You must watch this movie just because it will entertain and amuse you and that's worth the price of a ticket.
