I was looking forward to it and was not disappointed. It was written by the writer who wrote the excellent Murder Rooms series, which described the adventures of ACD with Doctor Joseph Bell. It was moving rather slowly, with Doyle's frustration with Sherlock Holmes much emphasized, which was very accurate and well presented. It was an interesting character study and very well received (on digital video, uncommon for a historical piece). Acting was all around outstanding, especially Tim McInnery and Brian Cox, though the actor who portrayed ACD and whose name I can not remember impressed me. An excellent character study that has about as many twists as any normal Sherlock Holmes case. See this if you have the chance
