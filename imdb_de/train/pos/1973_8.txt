I never trust a person's opinions on a movie. This also applies to critics. Sure, if it gets positive reviews, that's OK and a plus, but most of the movies that get critical rapture, I hate. I enjoyed this movie as it was, an entertaining movie. It brings you out of your life for a few hours and becomes a fictional character ... this is Catherine Trammell. Sharon Stone is great in this role, just as she was in the first role. Anyone who says he's terrible in this movie must have felt the same way in the first movie when he came back and was just like in Basic Instinct 1. Catherine belongs to her and she plays it perfectly. Their singles are great, similar to the first one. Who can forget in the first movie when she tells the cops, "If you arrest me, do it ... otherwise bring the crap out of here!" Great scene and believe me, she does it in this again. I was fascinated by her. Her outfits, as she smoked her cigarettes, believe me, it's worth the price, just to see Stone's achievement. I can not wait to release this movie on DVD, uncut because I can only imagine how much better it will be. And yes, there are many twists like the first, including the end!
