Time for a scream, eh: I thought Spirit would be a great movie to watch. However, there were a few things that kept me from rating them higher than a 6 or 7 (I'm a bit more generous with the 7). <br /> <br /> Point 1: Matt Damon makes me worse. I thought, "what a big voice they had for the main character" when I first heard him heard - and then I realized that it was Matt Damon. The man annoys me so much - his appearance in "The Departed" was terrible and ruined the movie for me (before the movie had a chance to ruin itself, but that's another story for another time) than it did he almost "Spirit". "I could pass that fact because there were so few stories ... luckily. Point 2: Brian Adams is shit ... The whole score was awful. The songs were unoriginal, generic and poorly performed, I did not even find the music fitting and the lyrics were terrible, every time one of the lame songs came I was turned off I almost thought I'd start to hear some patriotic propaganda that has slipped into the lyrics of the Super-American Freedom (I can not remember the terrible patriotic songs that were constantly being played on the radio after 9/11), given the Native American aspects of the fil ms, they should go with proper music with proper instruments, not with a small radio hit, teenage Bop and a 14-year-old girl. I thought I was back in junior high school. I can not believe that there could not have been a better one - I refuse. If that had not been for me, I would have rated the movie more at Disney, which knows a thing or two about originality (ok, do not bother to say what some of you probably think;). Too bad it's a shame that they could not hire better musicians. <br /> <br /> I liked the art and the animation, apart from a few things here and there ... as if the angles were sometimes too sharp in the face and the lines are too thick or too dark on the body (thick / dark lines mainly at the end). There were often times when I thought that they were trying too hard on the emotions and facial expression and did not take on any real emotions. But there were also times when the emotions became strong. However, many scenes were lazy and the shifts were obvious. <br /> <br /> OK, I'm falling asleep here, so I'll summarize it briefly before making any sense ... <br /> <br /> Nice try on an epic movie ... it turned out however, as mediocre. Matt Damon, you idiot!
