Vincent Cassel plays the role of Paul, an ex-con who has been assigned to an office job where he meets Carla, a secretary who is pretty numb if she has her hearing aids in very numb. If not (played by Emmanuelle Devos). Together, they help each other develop as human beings. <br /> <br /> What was particularly interesting about this movie, was the complexity of the characters? do not fit into obvious clich√©s. Paul is uncomfortable in the office environment, is not he just fit for work? This belief is reversed when he gets a job in a bar and shines. <br /> <br /> The film has some amalality that I find refreshing and showed how easy it is to act criminally, even if we consider it harmless or justified. <br /> <br /> Finally, it's a movie full of great moments that are both touching and humorous. One of them is when Carla is a babysitter and tries to comfort a crying baby. She cuddles on? but takes her hearing aids out for her own comfort.
