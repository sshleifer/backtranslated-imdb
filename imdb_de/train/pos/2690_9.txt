La Teta i la Luna (The Breast and the Moon) describes the life of a 9-10 year old boy named Tete obsessed with breasts growing up in Catalunya. I love this movie because the characters are very honest and very human, like all the characters in Bigas Luna's films (also director of Jamon, Jamon). Tete reminded me how fascinating and exciting life can be at this age. Also coming from Catalonia (northeast of Spain), it brought to mind many memories. This movie shows how beautiful Catalunya is, nice people, beautiful life and especially many non-intrusive people.
