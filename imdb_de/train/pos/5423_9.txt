Gunga Din (1939) is based on Rudyard Kipling's poem. The film is directed by George Stevens. In the 19th century India plays in India, where three British soldiers have to stop a bad guru and his cult of murder. Gunga Din is a wonderful adventure war comedy with many exciting moments. The three leading men are brilliant. Cary Grant is Sgt. Archibald Cutter, Victor McLaglen is Sgt. Mac MacChesney and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. (the son of the legendary, you know who) is Sgt. Thomas Ballantine. Let's not forget the other good players, including Sam Jaffe, who brilliantly plays Gunga Din himself. The beautiful and talented Joan Fontaine is Emaline Stebbins. It's so much fun to see the difficulties of Tommy and Emmy's wedding plans. Have fun. It can be funny, it can be exciting. It can be anything that a good movie requires.
