I enjoyed this movie, and after seeing it I wondered how many "Caitlin Rose's" there are in the world. How many other girls were exposed to this kind of sexual abuse and torture by classmates and were too afraid to talk about it? How threatening and cruel young people can be to each other, because, as this film shows, human rights are not important, they are popular and dreaded, which manipulates and influences the minds of adolescents to facilitate this kind of immorality. Tiffani Amber Thiessen gives a strong performance as a rape victim, and Brian Austin Green convinces as the guy who's torn between the girl he thought he loved and his best friend. This is the kind of movie that does not deserve to be considered. Remarkable and brilliant, too good to be just a movie for television.
