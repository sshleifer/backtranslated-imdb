How can someone NOT like this movie? This movie is so good that the first week when I saw it in the video library on the shelf, it was stolen ... BEST Horror Movie Ever !!! You know, HAHAHA .. how's that not funny? The only movie that comes close to this theme is Bride of Chucky and that was just great !!
