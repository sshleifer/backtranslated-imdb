I stumbled across TCM late that night. <br /> <br /> I had not seen it since it first came out, but I never forgot it. <br /> <br /> I had completely forgotten how beautiful and talented Signe Hasso was when she was young, even for Shelly Winters, before she set off. Ronald Coleman epitomized the state actor of his time - I had read English to Othello in high school - and hated it. After seeing "A Double Life," I read it again and finally understood what the piece was about. <br /> <br /> The Gordon / Kanin writing team was at its peak when this script was ready - <br /> <br /> A movie worth remembering and seeing again,
