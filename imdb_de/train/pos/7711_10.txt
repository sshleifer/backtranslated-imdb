Okay, Robbie is a bit hokey-looking by today's standards, and part of the acting is pretty stilted, and most of the special effects could now be copied by a 12-year-old boy with a decent computer-editing program. And do not let me start with the poster. <br /> <br /> This is still a great movie, 40 years after its release. I grew up on Sunday afternoon with "Science Fiction" in the local science TV's "Science Fiction / Adventure Theater", so I saw some SF movies from the 50's. At a time when most movies were content to give someone a rubber costume and tear him down a miniature model of a city, Forbidden Planet forever raised the bar and showed it was possible to shoot a sci-fi movie who actually had an action. <br /> <br /> I doubt that many SF films made in the 90s are still worth seeing in 2030.
