Channel 4 is a channel that allows more naughty stuff than any other channel. This show was certainly a naughty one. The moderator of this sometimes brutal adult chat show, the four-time BAFTA win and the British Comedy Award-winning (also twice nominated) Graham Norton was simply the perfect gay host for a good show like this one. It had one or more celebrities in the middle. They basically had an idea for adults that would either insult, humiliate, or bring humor to the guest, but some are not for the faint-hearted. They had women who played the recorder with their parts, men playing a xylophone with their tails, women who came up in the bath, men with or without underpants, and many other crude but funny ideas. This is for adults only, but enjoy it! It twice won the BAFTA for Best Entertainment (program or series), it won the British Comedy Award for Best Comedy Entertainment (also nominated), the Best Comedy Talk Show, it won an Emmy for Episode # 18 (?) And It won the national television awards twice for most popular talk show. It was the number 52 of the 100 greatest funny moments. Very well!
