Something surprised me about this movie - it was actually original. It was not the same old recycled garb coming out of Hollywood every month. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie on video because I did not even know about it before I saw it in my local video library. If you see this movie available - rent it - you will not regret it. The tension builds up and the twist end is excellent. <br /> <br />
