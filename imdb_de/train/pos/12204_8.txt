One can only imagine the film Mr. Welles would have finished without the interference of the studio! This movie is a flawed Welles, but worth every minute because you can see the size of perhaps America's best movie director of all time! <br /> <br /> We see the tribute that Orson Welles demanded for the filming of this film. The story has many holes, perhaps because of the demands of the studio managers who did not trust the director. <br /> <br /> It is strange to read some of the opinions submitted to IMDB comparing Orson Welles to the Coen brothers Roman Polanski and even Woody Allen, if all the directors should be considered followers of the great master himself No one was more original and creative in the history of American cinema than Mr. Welles. Fortunately, we still have his legacy in retrospective looks, such as the Film Forum in New York, or his films on tape or DVD. Rita Hayworth has never been lovingly photographed here. If she was a beauty with her red hair, as a blonde she is simply too captivating for words. Everett Sloan and Glenn Anders made an outstanding contribution to the film. <br /> <br /> The only thing that made this film another masterpiece added to Orson Welles's work was his own performance. If he had focused on directing and interpreted Michael O'Hara by another actor, a different film could have been created. Orson Welles has to be respected for being perhaps a pioneer when he takes the camera from the studio to the street. The visuals in this film are so amazing that we leave the theater after seeing that this film is really impressed with the work, the vision and the talent it has given us.
