I got the first Bill and Ted movie for Christmas and got the second one when I saw him in a shop. This was (I think) as funny as the first, but a much stranger story. It was funny how they had their personal hell and how they had to die. The funny thing was that they played him in stupid little games like hunch. The only thing I would change is that Station and Death are in the band, but otherwise it was great.
