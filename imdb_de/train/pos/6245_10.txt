"Hundstage" is the first feature film by Seidl (previously he shot major documentaries as "Animal Love" or "Models"). seidl has been working on this project for more than 3 years, but it only cost about 2 million dollars. The actors are very good, especially the non-professional actors, who have almost played themselves. The cinematography is also good. The whole movie is shocking and some scenes are too much for "normal" viewers. The film shows a lot of sex and violence, but also that people are lonely and can not communicate with each other. Finally, I have to say that this is one of the best and most rewarding Austrian films of recent years. Please excuse my bad English. <br /> <br />
