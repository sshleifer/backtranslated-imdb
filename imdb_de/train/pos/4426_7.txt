I'm glad I saw this movie, which has seen some of the director's other films in the past. I thought the production values ​​were great as the costumes and settings of the bridge. It was interesting to see how the concept of mind and demons was handled. <br /> <br /> I agree with some other comments on the fight scenes. At times they were hard to follow. Ultimately a moral story. It would be interesting to know what Japanese viewers thought of the film. It's a movie I'd like to see again. <br /> <br /> Some scenes like the one in which Benkai and the prince fought on a "psychic" level were well done came out of the cinema and thought about what just happened here. Violently.
