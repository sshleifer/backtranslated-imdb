The reason I say that is because I wrote the script and knew very little about it being done until I was asked to see the movie. I wrote it for some producers who resold it without telling me. Since Alan Dobie was a friend of mine, I found out about it. I had just written a first draft, so I was understandably worried when I heard he was lying on the floor. I asked Peter Collinson through my agent if he should perhaps make another design. I also asked if I could see my original script because I lost it. I was told too late. So I did the only thing I could do under those circumstances and took my name off. I had no idea what they could have done with my script. Then I was invited to see the finished movie. I was so impressed that I quickly asked for a new name. It is a beautifully made piece, from a hastily written first draft, I expected that I should be asked to work much more on it; If I had it, it might not be so good. I would like to see my original script again, if anyone knows where it is? I would like to see the movie again, I only saw it once in a small theater in Soho.
