One of those wonderfully intense movies that take us so deep in them ends way too soon! Then they looked at the screen like, "No, they do not!" Lol. All-round good performance! The show is wonderful, with Emily Blunt just outstanding! I knew she would give a solid, compelling performance that would draw the regalia, temperament and vulnerability of young Victoria throughout the movie. The production is also outstanding in every respect: style, substance and sensitivity. A notable glimpse of a notable time in Britian's story was told by a very personal and touching biography of the school-age princess until her reign as Queen, who later married Prince Albert when it ended with the birth of her first of nine children. It had a well written script and a flawless editing. Rupert Friend as the so patient and compassionate young Prince Albert, who tried to fight for the attention of the young Queen, rather than securing his love before Lord Melbourne (Paul Bettany) caught the attention. Equally enthralling was the relationship between the adolescent Victoria and her mother, who was sometimes angry, as with her mother and King William (who did not like her mother either). The acting and the scenes were fascinating and very emotional. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this to anyone who is interested in the historical and political situation of that time, and anyone who likes a convincing true love story
