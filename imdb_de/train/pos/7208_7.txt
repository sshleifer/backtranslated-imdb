Playwright Sidney Bruhl (a wonderfully exaggerated Michael Caine) would kill for a hit game. Enter the young prodigy (a solid reeve) who has just written such a piece. Take a look at this overly hysterical woman from Bruhl (played by Cannon excellently) and a German psychic (a very funny Irene Worth), and you've made a wonderfully funny suspense movie. <br /> <br /> "Standards," "Deathtrap," however, is a very capable, curvy, weird suspense ride based on a terrific play by Ira Levin. The actors obviously have a field day with the material, especially Caine delivers high-pressure lines of the highest class. <br /> <br /> The film loses some steam halfway and the ending is less satisfactory than the hilarious original, but overall "Deathtrap" is solid, well-played and exciting fun.
