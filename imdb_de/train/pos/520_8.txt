My only small criticism of the film I have come to know as STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN is the fact that the wonderful RAYMOND MASSEY is banished to the last twenty or so minutes in the process scene. And the attempt itself, IMO, is the least interesting part of this fascinating fantasy. David NIVEN and KIM HUNTER are wonderfully cast as young lovers, but it is ROGER LIVESEY who gives the most vivid and credible performance. MARIUS GORING with a French accent is a joy (he even gets a comment about Technicolor) when the angelic messenger recaptures Niven if his death is not reported by mistake. Goering has some of the funniest lines and delivers them with satisfaction. <br /> <br /> After watching TCM this evening for the first time in over twenty years, I think that this is a great example of a wonderful 1946 film year. The Technicolor photography, a bit reserved and not at all shrill, is excellent and the way it shifts for the heavenly sequences in B & W is performed with great imagination and effectiveness as a spectator in the fantasy aspects of the story - and Niven's tense conversation with radio operator Hunter as his plane crashes toward the ground unexpectedly leads to an unforgettable romantic encounter. A truly wonderful movie from start to finish, another triumph for Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger.
