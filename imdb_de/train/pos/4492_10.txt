But I want to say that I can not agree with Moira anymore. <br /> <br /> What a wonderful movie. <br /> <br /> I thought about it this morning and wanted to give some stupid stuff Who had lost money on his debit card by cheating and wanted to say, "Keep your money in your pocket" and realized that I'm talking like James Mason , <br /> <br /> Even though he did not say those words I still think he would! I never forgot, "Wear?" In his reconciliation with his son Hywel Bennet: "Always money in your pocket!" Good advice. <br /> <br /> Not enough children have fathers with such ruthless but well meaning attitudes. Or any dad. <br /> <br /> It would be a good thing for us to use "you", "yours" and "yours" in our language to show that we are interested. It's just the same as "Tutoyer" in French or "Du" in German. Postscript: I just realized that many of my comments on James Mason were in The Family Way! <br /> <br /> I think it's because I mistook Susan George for Hayley Mills. Well, simple mistake. <br /> <br /> I stand by the comments tho '. <br /> <br /> And spring and port are very similar to The Family Way. <br /> <br /> If you took a friend to the pictures back then, you really had something to say and tell, something that influenced your knowledge of the world and your personal development. <br /> <br /> Theater experiences are almost real, and they are important in helping young people to grow up. <br /> <br /> It does not happen now, I think teenagers can just go to the pictures as we do.
