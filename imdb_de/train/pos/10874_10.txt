<br /> <br /> I have to admit, I had expected something different when I saw Cut for the first time last night, even though I was thrilled with the unexpected Australian horror jewel. I'm a real horror fan who is as true as he comes and I thought "Cut" is not just the best of the genre Australia has ever produced, but one of the great parody / comedy films of the world last time. <br /> <br /> My only concern is that mainstream audiences do not pick up on many of the comedic elements - the film was not very smart in its use, but it made me laugh at every opportunity and tried ANY possible clich√© to find the horror genre he could. I'm sure that was meant to be humor ... hoping that this was meant as humor. <br /> <br /> And of course there was the gusset. <br /> <br /> The use of the 'Customized' secateurs were brilliant - besides the expected stitches and slashes. In short, the many violent deaths were very diverse and creative enough to justify even the skeptics of those films. <br /> <br /> The performance of both Kylie Minogue (in short, her appearance) and Molly Ringwald was just another reason to watch the movie - both performances were fantastic, as was Simon Bossell ('The Castle') in a brilliant role as a jokey technician. All in all: I think this movie is one of the best horror products of the last couple of years, and a beautiful satire / parody - until the end toungue-in-cheek. <br /> <br /> Loved it. Look at it!
