Why are people complaining about this movie, not horrible movies like The Godfather? Titanic is the biggest movie of the 21st century. With great acting, directing, effects, music and generally everything. This film is always dumped by everyone because someday someone said he did not like it anymore, and most people decided to agree. There is nothing wrong with this movie. I can only say that this film is not only the highest Oscar-winning film of all time, but also the most money ever earned and, unfortunately, one of the most underrated films I have ever seen. Apart from that, it's really the best movie ever. The only movies that are almost like all Star Wars and Lord of the Rings trilogy or all of the masters Hitchcock or Spielberg or Tim Burton. These are all good movies and directors, but no one fits James Cameron's masterpiece TITANIC.
