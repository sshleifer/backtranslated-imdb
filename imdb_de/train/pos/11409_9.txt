When Philo Vance (Edmund Lowe) precariously stands on a balcony high above the city, seemingly hypnotized and shortly before his death, it immediately reminds me of an almost identical scene in a film made nine years later. The Woman in Green, in which Sherlock Holmes (Basil Rathbone) also flings himself into space and is hypnotized. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, Philo Vance and Sherlock Holmes survive these attempted murders by unscrupulous criminals In both scenes, when will you learn that you can not tarnish the mind of great fictional detectives?
