"Spin it!" <br /> <br /> The 90s opened with a clever Disney favorite, "TaleSpin," the TV animated series featuring characters from The Jungle Book. Embark on the Sea Duck with Baloo and Kit Cloudkicker as you've never seen before: from Cape Suzette to Louies, through mountains, through jungles, to water, in volcanoes, in search of adventure, in search of Appreciate, looking for fun, all in an action packed cartoon adventure !!!!! <br /> <br /> This was a favorite with both me and my family. This took The Disney Afternoon the entire first half of the 90s, until the original cartoons moved to the Old Disney Channel in 1995, which I'd seen on holiday in 1996 before being cabled in March 1997. <br /> <br /> And good news: Today the DVDs are here !!!!! Experience the fun and excitement of "Dun, dun, dun, TaleSpin !!!!!" <br /> <br /> 10/10
