The "Shaolin Temple" by Chang Cheh may be the highlight of the Shaw Brothers martial arts film cycle. This rousing kung fu epic features an amazing cast - a true who's who of the Shaw stable. Although the plot is fairly normal and the fight choreography, as always, is superb, it is Cheh's handling of the theme that makes this movie remarkable and enjoyable. The sense of reverence for the history and traditions of the Shaolin Temple is perceptible in every setting. Not unlike William Keighley's legendary Fighting 69th in the same self-titled film, or John Ford's greeting to West Point in The Long Gray Line. "Cheh's" Shaolin Temple "is a lovingly crafted ode in the same style <br /> The cultural correlation I try to try is to compare the Shaolin Temple to the Alamo. If you watch this movie, you will Experience the same admiring and nostalgic feelings you experienced in school history many years ago, when you learned of the courage and sacrifice of these convicted Alamo heroes, and you may also be tempted to call "Remember the Shaolin Temple" at the end of the movie !
