I first read Pearl S Bock's great novel in my ninth grade in history lessons, and I enjoyed every exciting side of it. It was almost inevitable that Hollywood would access it, and considering it was made in 1937, the results are excellent. <br /> <br /> Certain Things Must Be Accepted: In 1937, it was not a question of Asian casting actors in a major Hollywood movie. In a sense, the end product becomes more interesting than if it had been possible to use a more authentic cast. With this obstacle to be overcome, executive producer Irving Thalberg and director Sidney Franklin (among others) have taken the trouble to hand-pick a magnificent and outstanding cast. Paul Muni plays Wang Lung. Muni was at this time at the height of his powers as an actor and could play almost everything, where he got involved. Once you've overcome make-up (it's good, but nobody will really mistake it for a Chinese), its performance has all the accuracy of its best work. <br /> <br /> Then there is Luise Rainer. After winning an Oscar last year for her performance in THE GREAT ZIEGFELD, the star of the Viennese actress was on the rise and despite her lack of experience in Hollywood, she was given the role of O-lan. Her appearance won her a second consecutive Oscar, the first time in history that happened. <br /> <br /> There was a lot of criticism of Rainer's performance and her Oscar wins here. It was referred to as wood and one-note. Therein lies a small piece of truth. HOWEVER, all you have to do is go back to the book. For Rainer, though not Chinese, O-lan played pretty much as Buck wrote her; It's indeed a great achievement and one of the best book to screen transfers I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> As for the rest of the cast, this was MGM. They had the largest number of stars and character actors in Hollywood and a big budget to pay for the best, and in the end they got the best. <br /> <br /> The film gives way to Wang Lung's marriage O-Lan something. In the novel, with wealth comes the greed of the flesh and he assumes a concubine, a movement that destroys his wife, but her feelings as a mere wife do not affect him. In the film, an angry Wang Lung returns to his wife on the deathbed, who recognizes two beads he had taken from her years earlier and too late that she was his true love. Corny, yes. But that's Hollywood. Given the obstacles they faced, the movie might have opened for laughter. But despite the noticeable lack of real Asians in the cast, this film has developed remarkably well at seventy-three years. In fact, the most amazing thing about this film is how good it is when it could easily have been a disaster.
