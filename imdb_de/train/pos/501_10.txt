I think that has the potential to be the best Star Trek series, I say POTENTIAL. For those who have not seen it .. SEE IT! It could be cool without the annoying "PRIME DIRECTIVE" that hovers over their heads every time they race. I've given this a full 10 ... it blows ALL other serial openers away. I hope this lasts more than 7 years ...
