It is so gratifying to have transformed a great work of art into another without distortion or curiosity. I had no idea how such an extraordinary piece of literature could be restored as a worth seeing film. Understandably, if you loved Bulgakov's book, you would be scared to see more misleading interpretations for an art film project than to bring the deeper meaning of the story to the screen. There are a few examples of this with Master and Margarita. As complex and far-fetched as the story is, the film does not mind. It's as if the filmmaker read Bulgakov's work the way an orchestra conductor reads a score - without missing a note. Why can not we find such a talent here in the US? Now my favorite book and movie have the same title.
