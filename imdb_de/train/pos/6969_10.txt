For starters, this is an excellent series, though we have some kind of James Bond effect. What I mean by that is that while the new Casino Royale will take place in 2006, it's chronologically the first adventure of 007. No (1962) is the second, while in Golden Eye the first movie with Pierce Brosnan, Judi Dench, is mentioned as a new replacement for the male "M", as it could initially be used before Bond became a double-0 from the fact that she is obviously 14 years older? This is more or less a "poetic" license to thrill. We need to turn our heads back a bit if we want to talk. No, the new Star Trek movie does not have the primitive electronics of the original series of almost half a century ago. In the 1960s, communicators were fancy. (we now call them mobile phones) and instead of buttons there were sliders. OMG, do you think that in 400 years you would have perfected Rogaine for Jean-Luc Picard? So, please, let's give the producers some leeway. <br /> <br /> But to be consistent, just let us think about Cylon creation 60 years before the end of Battlestar Galactica. If so, where did all the Cylons colonize the original Earth come from? We know that the technology exists for spontaneous jumps through space. Well, what happened when one of the Cyclon ships that were at war with the Caprica fleet was fired, or there was a sunspot or whatever, and not just a ship loaded with human-looking Cylons? the universe jumped but through time, back a thousand or ten thousand years with a crippled ship near Earth One. They populated it, found they could repopulate it, and finally destroyed themselves, but not before sending out a "ragtag" fleet to look for the legendary Caprica, just a habitable but uninhabited one To find planets that they populated to become humans, who eventually invented the Cylons. Temporal paradox? Of course. Which came first, the chicken or the road? Who cares? It's fraking entertaining!
