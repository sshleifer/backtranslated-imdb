FORBIDDEN PLANET is one of the best examples of Hollywood SF movies. Their influence has been felt for more than a decade. Some elements relating to how this widescreen entertainment program was intended for a mid-fifties audience are now quite old, and the film's sometimes slow tempo does not help. But the convincing basic idea of ​​the story, which includes the old, dying Krell civilization and "Id" monsters, has not lost its appeal and continues to make this film a relevant "must see" movie. What I'm most interested in here is that the current DVD for this movie is awful. The movie has never looked so good on home videos and its elements are in dire need of restoration. I hope that will happen soon and we get a special edition of this SF classic.
