I searched for a copy of this movie for years (16mm, dvd, vhs) so I could show it to my kids. The movie is funny, and Spike and its members show why they were the best musicians in the industry. They had to be good enough to play that way. I like it and recommend it to movie lovers of all ages. <br /> <br /> The film is about a century-old fire station with a crew of outsiders who are firefighters and the departmental band (if they do not fight the fires). There are the usual running gags and the chaos of Spike Jones and his orchestra. Also comedy, which was supplied by comedians Buddy Hackett and Hugh O'Brien.
