If you rewind the terrible song, you'll find a classic fairy tale under it. Christopher Walken is very humorous and surprisingly good at the role. His typical acting style is well suited for the smart puss in Boots. The other actors are good for their role. I did not find anything terribly wrong or awkward. Especially the king seems to be a real fool, and I wonder if he really should be. I can not remember the original story. The special effects are typical of the eighties, but at least they are not overly fake like some of the computer generated fares we see today. Overall, I recommend this movie for children and adults who are a kid at heart.
