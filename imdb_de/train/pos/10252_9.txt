After seeing "Guinea Pig," two questions come to mind (besides "Am I really a psychopath to see that?"): "Is it a snuff?" The answer is no; Although that's what comes closest to a snuff movie I've ever seen. And then: Where did you find the girl? Because she is being tortured for 45 minutes without giving any reason (in fact, this film is nothing else!): Fingernails demolished, with hands, feet, tools, attacked by maggots, and many more the last scene (I'm still not sure how they did that). Since it belongs to the Japanese underground scene, it is obvious that she did not get much money. What were your motivations? <br /> <br /> I saw it in Japanese without subtitles, but it's not a problem (no real dialogues, the boys insult them only in a few scenes). I have not seen all the series yet, but the first "Guinea Pig" is not known to be the best. I still rated 8, because if people think this is a snuff, the topic is pretty good (ask for Charlie Sheen, the actor). But I think they could have gone further, what they did in the following. <br /> <br /> Another movie that I hide from my parents. <br /> <br /> 8/10
