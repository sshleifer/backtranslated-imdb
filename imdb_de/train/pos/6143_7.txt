I've never seen this 1971 movie and was very entertained by this great production of Walt Disney Studios and great animation creations. Angela Lansbury (Eglantine Price) played a prominent role as a woman who had completed a course in witchcraft and was an apprentice who started flying on a broom and had some difficulty starting. Eglantine discovered many tricks and was able to move a bed to different parts of the world. Eglantine, however, missed her final exams to become an accomplished witch. Mr. Emerlius Browne (David Tomlinson) was the one who sold Eglantine in this course in witchcraft. He tries to help her in every possible way to find her solution. Eglantine has a sense of her madness and should stop the Nazis from eluding England. Great family entertainment and we need more movies today.
