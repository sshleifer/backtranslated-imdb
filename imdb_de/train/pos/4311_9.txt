This work is less about Steve Martin's character Davis than Kline (Mack) and Glover (Simon) and Kline and McDonnell (Claire), but Davis's dialogue is a contemplative, almost poetic existentialism at its best. He is witty, intelligent and thoughtful in terms of dialogue delivery and content. The authors deserve an Oscar. <br /> <br /> The performances are simple, relaxed and natural; just what to expect from "A List" actors. Martin contributes to the performance that leads to his younger shopgirl, guiding you through life, love, and the pursuit of wisdom, if not luck. Kline is the straight - the suit - the conformist of the movie, and so his performance is crisp and refreshing. <br /> <br /> This work deals with life in all its aspects. It creates a real emotional investment in your characters, and lets you hope that humanity is not destined to fail, no matter WHAT you believe, deep inside. <br /> <br /> All in all? This is adorable, with one or two pithy moments and a simple natural dialogue that attracts you and helps the audience have a great deal of fun in this work. It's definitely worth your time, even if it's not an entertaining conversation every Friday / Saturday. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed the intelligence shown here. It is not typical and was an unexpected surprise. Another wonderful surprise was the honesty shown here. The couples and friends have in-depth conversations that feel and sound completely honest and (again) natural. I was very impressed with this work and will soon be adding it to the DVD collection. <br /> <br /> There is a rating of 9.1 / 10 from ... Fiend :.
