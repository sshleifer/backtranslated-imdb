"Dragonlord" sees Chan return to "Dragon" from "The Young Master". Not much has changed from the first film. "Tiger," his older brother, is nowhere to be seen; Even the Marshall, his daughter or his son were not played outstanding by Yuen Biao in the original film. Although Dragon has the same master - probably all other students have moved to other things. (The laziness of the kite during training is heavily portrayed in this movie, so maybe he is still studying!) <br /> <br /> Originally titled "Young Master In Love", this movie sees Dragon (at least for the first sixty minutes ) a village girl in various idiotic and slapstick ways. His rival for her affection is his friend (nicknamed "cowboy"), who is strangely played by longtime Chan stunt team member Mars. We see various scenes in which their silly plans backfire. It's one of those scenes where we (fortunately) find "Dragon" over his head. <br /> <br /> This movie is notorious for missing out on box office expectations. I'm sure the expectations were pretty high, and I believe this movie never got a fair verdict for its own merits. But even if I try, I still have the problem that the movie has a problem. It seems rather blurry, sometimes rushed, and I think the action is too sporadic and not as brilliant as Chan's other work from that time. <br /> <br /> What really saves the movie is the end sequence. Like in "The Young Master", there's a fantastic final role that's filled with unbelievably exhausting action - you can feel every beat. And again, Chan acts against the same rival from "The Young Master" (is it the same character?), And the timing and energy here are brilliant. Chan's style, with which he uses his last piece of his environment to defeat his opponent - and not just rely on pure physical abilities - is as obvious here as elsewhere. The barn they fight in is full of clever little props and improvisations. This is an absolute highlight of the movie and one of Chan's incredible career. <br /> <br /> It is not necessary to see the prequel before you see "Dragonlord", it might raise more questions than hoped for. However, it must be said that the original movie is the superior movie, and "Dragonlord" with its focus on girl hunting and team sports seems amazing. Fortunately, the few fighting scenes (and a fantastic shuttle cock scene) make it an indispensable movie in the genre.
