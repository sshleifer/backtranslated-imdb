Rene Clair's groundbreaking musical. If you want to see where the songs first made a story, this is the place. This is the story of a hungry young artist who has found out that he has won the lottery just as his creditors are calling. Unfortunately, his ticket is in his coat, which is in the apartment of his girlfriend, and was sentenced while fleeing to a convict, who then ... oh, but that would say. <br /> <br /> This is a light and frothy story in which much of the dialogue is sung (most people believe that this was not done before Oklahoma or Andrew Lloyd Webber). It's the kind of movie they do not do anymore, and rarely if they did. His sound is a film from the early days, which is played like a movie five or six years later. Clair moves his camera in a way that not even Busby Berkeley did (though the comparison between the two filmmakers is honest, it's unfair since Berkeley essentially had staged dance numbers and Clair moved the camera through the "real world"). It's an amazing little movie. and it's a charming movie that makes you smile. It's just a fluffy treat. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, I can not say more. It's just a nice little movie and that's really all you need to know.
