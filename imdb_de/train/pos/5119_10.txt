All I have to say is that one of my favorite movies of all time. I can not even count how many times I've seen it. I was already in love with John Travolta, but when the camera swung his body up for the first time, after shaving clean and looking gorgeous for his first trip to Gilley's, I was overwhelmed. Debra Winger delivers as always a perfect performance as a young, na√Øve wife of Bud, but with the necessary attitude to be married to a stubborn and hard-working cowboy. If you're not a country musician, which I was not, this is a soundtrack that lets you sing along with every word. If you have a chance, watch this movie that will not disappoint.
