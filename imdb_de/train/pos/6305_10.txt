Welcome to Collinwood is one of the most beautiful movies I have ever seen. An excellent ensemble cast, tight editing and wonderful directing. A caper film that does not jam in the standard tricks. <br /> <br /> Not much can be said about this film without spoiling it. The tagline says it all - 5 guys. 1 sure. No brains. <br /> <br /> William H Macy and Sam Rockwell perform an amazing cast. George Clooney should be congratulated for making this gemstone. <br /> <br />
