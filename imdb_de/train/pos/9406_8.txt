Other commentators have described the storyline and social parables as well as comments (or better) that I could, but I would like to admire this little gem of a movie. It is indeed good in every category for more than 50 years - screenplay, drama, photography, stage design, sound design ... it really is a classic. This was my first encounter with the "young" Alec Guinness, and it was obvious from the start that made him so special that he finally received an accolade. <br /> <br /> I only rate it as "8" because it's basically a rather light parabola that examines human nature but does not really impale it; and because the conspiracy ends up finding the easy way out instead of actually resolving conflicts between the inventor and the millers and industrialists who are persecuting him all over the city. A few minutes of thought also reveal the fundamental flaw in the script's logic - wear and tear is barely the deciding factor in buying new clothes (especially garments). Children grow up, people change their size, they go up and down, they are always in the latest fashion and have as long as looms are woven. And if not otherwise, the manufacturer would make a fortune by providing indestructible material for military uniforms (especially BDUs). <br /> <br /> This is still a great movie. If you have the chance to see it in a classic movie channel, you should do so.
