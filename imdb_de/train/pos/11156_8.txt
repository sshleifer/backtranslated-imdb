I do not usually like reality shows, especially those that benefit from the success of American Idol. But I can live with that. <br /> <br /> Comedians from all over the world are running a short routine for celebrities, and if they like them, these guys are sent to perform a routine for a real audience. Then select ten or twelve comics that live together in one house and perform survival-style contests using comedic tactics. Then one is defined as "Last Comic Standing". I like stand-up comedy, so this is the reality show that needs to thrill my interests. Usually some pretty funny comics are selected. It started the career of talents like Alonzo Bodden, Ralphie May and Josh Blue. <br /> <br /> My negative criticism is the fact that there is a possibility that many of these comics were selected for their contribution to reality drama show. First they lived together in a house like "Big Brother", but now they have stopped, thank God. <br /> <br /> And there are a lot of comedians that I felt were not selected just because they are funny, but because of race, ethnicity, attitude, gender, etc., when other comics clearly defeated them should have. But overall, it's a well-made reality show. These are two terms that I have previously considered an oxymoron.
