One of the best movies I've seen in the last five years! The cast is spectacular in a story about young love and bravado on the Lower East Side of New York City, with the two main roles being superstars. Funny, charming, sad and inspiring, this is a totally refreshing interpretation of the urban youth that brings Larry Clark's often disgusting joke into the gutter where he belongs ... though I have to admit that Bully was above his normal price. Raising Victor Vargas is a movie you'll be missing for ... so do not miss it!
