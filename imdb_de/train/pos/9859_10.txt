Ice Age is not just an animation of the year (in my eyes), it's also the best animated feature I've ever seen website. Scrat is cool! And so is the rest of the Sub Zero Heroes. <br /> <br /> The animation is outstanding. Your heart really goes out the characters in this movie. They have good dialogue lines and are well developed. It's hard to say which really steals the picture. <br /> <br /> I have experienced their journey with laughter, tears and amazement. Nothing was forced or done. The emotion was real, especially in the dramatic second half. The last movie that touched me so deeply was Anastasia in 1997, also a Fox production. And before that it was The Land Before Time 1988. All have real charm and try to entertain the entire audience, not just the cynics. 10/10 <br /> <br />
