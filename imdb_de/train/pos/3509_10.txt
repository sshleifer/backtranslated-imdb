I saw this movie some time ago and it's still at the top of my list of favorite movies. It's amazingly composed, and what makes the movie really special is the detailed tidbits (like the "Cafe Bustelo" coffee box used as a cup to wash the grandchildren's hair) that people do not see because you do not understand this movie IF YOU ARE HISPANIC. This is just one of those films that is very cultural and specific. Do not build this movie if you do not know on what basis it is built. I fully understand what the author / director was up to, and he hit the mark perfectly! This movie deserves a better rating.
