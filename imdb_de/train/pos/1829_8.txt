What a funny movie is St. Ives. It reminds me of the movie type of the 40s. Classic story, rounded off with characters and an action that is neither dramatic nor too complicated. In fact it is not over. Robert Lewis Stevenson's story - adapted here for the screen - reads like Jane Austen for Men. We have a story that has a romance at heart, but there is also a lot of fun: fighting scenes (kind of), prison outbreaks, false identities, swordplay and the funniest line I've heard in years: "Only in Scotland would guests stay at one "There is a lot of joy, hardship and no small heartache as St. Ives tries to fight back to a family and a life he barely knew. <br /> <br /> The cast is absolutely second to none, Jean Marc Barr has been absolutely perfect in the title role. Anna Friel is a refreshing treat as the resourceful Flora and Miranda Richardson walk the movie almost as their wise and worldly husband and saw and saw Aunt Susan there. Richard Grant offers funny relief at the highest level. <br /> <br /> This is not going to be the greatest movie anyone has ever seen, but its charms are undeniable, and the whole movie is pretty much alive with an energy plummeting.
