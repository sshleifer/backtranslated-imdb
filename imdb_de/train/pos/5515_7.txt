I learned a little about Che before he saw this movie, and you want to know something, he was a true hero to the people because he just wanted to see everyone equal and he hated what the oppressive powers did to his people as well as all other Latin Americans in general! Well, I know nothing about others, but for me he did the right thing by wanting socialism so everyone would have to pay his fair share. The powerful elite obviously did not want that. Instead of understanding what Che Guevera wanted, they had to kill him to quell the revolution. It did not work because there were too many of his other followers who only continued where he left off. A good example of this was when Castro continued his leadership in Cuba. As for me, and as Che himself said before he died, "If you kill me, that's fine, but you kill only one man, you'll NEVER kill it!" I could not have said it better myself. <br /> <br /> But ... definitely ... that's why I give this movie a 7 out of 10 points.
