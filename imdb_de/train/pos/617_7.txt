The plot is a bit strange and the whole thing with the wall is never really explained, but the execution is fine and even builds up strong tension. Charlie Cox plays Tristan, who falls in love with the fake girl (Sienna) Miller) and agrees to bring her a fallen star ... which happens to be played by the stunning Claire Danes. It's not very exciting what happens to these two, but the exciting part comes with the evil witch played by Michelle Pfeiffer and the prince son of King Peter O'Toole, who wants to reclaim the ruby ​​chain of our "star" , Much bad in the hunt for the good. <br /> <br /> On the way you meet the strangest pirate you will see (also from the Caribbean). Robert Deniro plays Captain Shakespeare - tough inside, and we'll get in touch with his female side. Another encounter involves the brilliant Ricky Gervais as a fast-talking trader, and that's good for a few laughs Cake ") Effort deserves an audience Unfortunately, the bad marketing campaign will probably prevent it from making any money, I think it will be a great success to have on video.
