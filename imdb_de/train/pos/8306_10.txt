Actually, they could not have chosen a better diversified actor to portray Little Richard than Leon did. He captures Little Richard to a highly credible essence. The outfits are wonderful and anyone who watches this movie will definitely keep a smile on their faces. Although the movie is a bit long, it keeps your eye on the personality and outfits of Little Richard. The end should have been a direction in which Little Richard was brought more into the present where one could see him when he had aged into this new millennium. He will always be the King of Rock-N-Roll for me, regardless of what the other media say.
