Over the years, I've seen a few cold-case episodes that started with season 1 episodes from 2003-2004. And though most were good, this particular episode was not only the best of the best, but has few rivals in the Emmy categories. Although some disagree with the content of the story (eg, the romantic relationship between men and men), I doubt anyone can observe this without moving deeply in their minds. <br /> <br /> The story is essentially about a case reopened based on the statements of a dying drug trafficker. The two main protagonists are two police officers in the 1960s named Sean Coop (aka Kaltfallopfer, who calls his surname Coop) and his partner Jimmy Bruno. <br /> <br /> In the story is Coop Single, a Vietnamese war veterinarian with a deeply worried past. Jimmy, however, is married and has no fewer children. Both are partners of the police and form not only a friendship, but also a secret romantic relationship that must hide both of them from a deeply and obviously homophobic culture that was prevalent at the time. <br /> <br /> The flashback scenes of her life are mostly in black and white, sometimes with spots of color. Examples include her red patrol car, the yellow curtains that blew gently through the window into Jimmy's bedroom, where Jimmy's wife watched Coop and Jimmy drink, fight and then kiss while in an alcoholic state. I found it interesting that only selected objects in the Flashback scenes were in color, everything else in black and white. I still have not figured out the color scheme and the reasons for it. <br /> <br /> The clearly homophobic tension between the patrolmen and the two main actors only increases the intensity of the episode. An important emotional scene was when Coop was confronted by his father after the baptism of Jimmy's baby. In this scene, Coop's father, Sarge, a respected officer of the troop, confronts Coop with the rumors about Coop's relationship with Jimmy. Coop can apologize at this point, when the shame and shame of Coop's father were piled on Coop: "They will not berate our family ... and you are not my son either." - a clear indication of the hostile views of same-sex relations of the time. <br /> <br /> Additional tensions can also be seen in the police locker room, where Coop and another officer after Coop and Jimmy point out. "Batman and Robin Homos". <br /> <br /> As for the relationship between Coop and Jimmy, it's obvious that Coop wanted more from Jimmy in his life. Once you can see the tension in Jimmy's face as he has to choose between his commitment to his wife and children, his church and his undying devotion to Coop. <br /> <br /> In the end, Jimmy leaves Coop. He realizes that he can not have Coop and his family at the same time. Sadly, Coop is being killed, perhaps because of his relationship with Jimmy, but Coop may also have been killed for his knowledge of drug money and police corruption, which was higher in power. <br /> <br /> The most moving scene Throughout the episode, when Coop died of gunshot wounds in his patrol car, he spoke his last words about his police radio with his partner: "Jimmy ... we were the ones Lucky ones, do not forget that. "<br /> <br /> The soundtrack selection was superb throughout the episode. I enjoyed the final scene with actor Chad Everett, who played the still sad Jimmy, who is now much older, and obviously still misses his former partner Coop. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this episode and consider it the best. It's without a doubt the best-written, well-made, and successful of all Cold Case episodes I've ever seen.
