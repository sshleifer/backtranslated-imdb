I loved this movie, seen this evening on a movie screen! The audience laughed aloud at some very interesting things and the fast pace was very enjoyable. <br /> <br /> As a singer and musical director, I question a part of Roby Keeler's vocals in "By a Waterfall." The key modulated, and she suddenly sang a lot deeper, with a very gentle voice, that with the somewhat tin-like higher Twitter voice that she used in all her other vocals, was not this dubbed by another singer? It sounds to me. I would like to know. <br /> <br /> Thank you.
