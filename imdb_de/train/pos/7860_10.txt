I had never seen a silent movie until July 24, 2005. I had never seen a movie with Mary Pickford in it. I have seen thousands of films. Very few are hypnotic to me. I found the last piece of Mohawk and the Unforgettable (Ray Liotta) hypnotic. Look at the source as you read this. I started seeing Tess of the Storm Country on TCM, just to see who that Mary Pickford was, which was recognized by many as the start of Hollywood. I had no idea what I wanted. Two hours later, I pulled away from it and noticed that I had seen one of the most beautiful women I had ever seen and played a role that suited her perfectly. Imagine a movie fan from 1922 when you've never seen anyone so beautiful and expressive. You would have to see her again and again. The setting was perfect for a girl who was expressive. She was a poor squatter, she could not speak English, but she had to be admired. What a movie ... time to start my Mary Pickford movie collection!
