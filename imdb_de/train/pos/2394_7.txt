Nice, pleasant and funny, but not shocking. It does a good job showing the world of theater groups behind the scenes and the lives of the actors. The three witches are great both on and off the stage. I would assume that the film works wonderfully (many obvious insider jokes) if you were involved in the theater (which I am not).
