Those who love the book of Jane Eyre as much as I do (it's my eternal favorite, and I read it at least once a year) will love this version. Timothy Dalton is only a bit too good to be Mr. Rochester, but besides, he does a wonderful job of portraying the brooding Lord of Thornfield. Zelah Clarke may have been just a bit too old to play the 18-year-old Jane, but when I watch this movie, I do not think about the age of the characters. The dialogue from the film is almost literally taken from the book, which was very smart. Sure, this movie may seem a little long, but it's the only version I've seen that includes part 3 of the story. I wish the people who made this movie would have been involved in the newer Zeferelli version, as it would have helped the clutter of a movie. <br /> <br /> The last time I saw this video, I realized that Judy Cornwell is playing "Aunt Reed"! She is so versatile that I did not recognize her. She plays Daisy in Keeping Up Appearances and also played in 1995 in Persuasion (another wonderful adaptation) Mrs. Musgrove. UPDATE: Got the DVD this week, and it's wonderful to see the original unedited version. There are many more in the beginning (Young Jane in Gateshead and Lowood.) And in the end they have restored many things. (I've always wondered why St. John had a slip of paper when he revealed he knows who Jane is - because the part he tears it out of her picture is from the US VHS version was issued!). Rosamund Oliver is there ... She was completely cut out of the VHS. As far as I could tell, they had not cut any part of Timothy Dalton, so nothing new, but it's great to see the whole miniseries after all those years of VHS. Thanks, BBC (PS ... I would have paid more for a Special Edition DVD ... maybe with some interviews with the stars ... or a making-of-show)
