A true story about a true revolution, April 25; a revolution against a 41-year repressive regime that imposed a colonial war on its military to maintain an empire (Angola, Mozambique, Guinea-Bissau, Cabo Verde, S. Tom√©, and Principe), the first and last of the Great Colonial Empires in Europe) of 600 years since it began in 1415 with the conquest of Ceuta; a revolution of the army for the people and for a democratic Portugal; The most surprising fact in this revolution is that no people were killed in this revolution (except those who were killed in the hands of PIDE, the state police force, during a brutal rifle fire against an unarmed crowd outside their headquarters in The Fortress protested Revolution Day, April 25, 1974, it has a show in the movie.) And all revolutions have their heroes. One of them was Captain Salgueiro Maia, a soldier returned from the war whose convictions, along with the rest of the army, were that they (since 1961) waged a futile war and that sometimes a soldier does not have to obey his country.
