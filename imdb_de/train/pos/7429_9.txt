She is such an extraordinary singer who cares about everything else !!!! This final scene is one of the best moments in showbiz - bar none !! I'm glad she took the camera for ten minutes - she deserves this legendary status - that's the power of the voice. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie for the first time when I was five and it had a big impact on me. I see it today and yes, I can see some of the mistakes (eg if Esther wants to leave the rights of the Grammy, as her award is announced). <br /> <br /> But some of the other user comments are just wrong - I mean, where's the groundless nudity - maybe we've seen different movies ??? <br /> <br /> Streisands singing ability is monumental and if she has a big ego - all right! <br /> <br /> She deserves it.
