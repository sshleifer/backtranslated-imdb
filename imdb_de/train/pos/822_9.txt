The last movie in Lucas' saga is a lavish, spectacular-looking production. It's often thought of as the ugly duckling of the original trilogy, but I think it's one stage above the fourth episode (and just one stage below episodes III and V). I think it's the third best movie in the 6-part saga. For me, it's still a terrific entertaining movie. It is not a film with beginning, climax and end; The mechanism of the film works with only one goal: to close Lucas' universe. The whole thing has a touch of finality, which makes the film a bit too sentimental, but emotionally rewarding. It's also a lot of fun. New characters are introduced and old ones face new, unexpected challenges. C3PO and R2D2 offer (as usual) a great comic relief. Leia and Solo are a wonderful romantic duo, and Luke is still a great personality to identify with. Again it is the inner conflict of Luke (and Vader) that gives the saga its backbone. Lucas' aggressive imagination is still evident, and the themes of loyalty, hope and redemption resonate with the film. I am glad that Lucas finally dropped the idea of ​​shooting Episodes VII, VIII and IX, because this film is a great bookend for a long, fascinating and fascinating saga. Not a perfect movie, but fun in the best matinee style.
