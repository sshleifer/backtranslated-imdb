A gripping (albeit repetitive and rather didactic) analysis of exploitation and despair in a situation where there is no way forward or up, where the attempt to feel better is hurt by the one who is under you dejected, seems to be the only option. But even here, in this deserted desert of lost dreams and no future, that does not work, and when one seeks something or someone to comfort and share, a simple act of charity gives some reward, even if it only makes the present bearable, through memories to be revived to the past. <br /> <br /> Although there is little violence on the screen, this is a tough and brutal film about the littleness of oppression (political and personal) that does not allow easy conversation. A broader relationship with the general social and political framework, which is clearly based on a play with a small cast, could possibly have given the film a bigger audience.
