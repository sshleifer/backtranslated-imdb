I saw this movie for the first time here in the UK in December 1989, when Central TV broadcasted it. I still have the videotape, though it's worn out (over the years, many friends and family members have lent it and been chilled as a result!). <br /> <br /> I remember coming home that night, grabbing a Christmas drink, switching off the lights and watching what was heralded as the "Christmas ghost story". Even now I remember certain scenes that still left the hair on my neck ... <br /> <br /> I've seen some comments on the movie that say it's not this and not that ... I think These people are afraid of Friday, the 13th and the like, Stem and Slash Rammel, who are laughable. This is a "traditional" ghost story; There are no big budget actions or special effects ... no cursing, no blood, no unnecessary sex scenes, no chainsaws or pistols etc. ... How refreshing !!!! It is atmospheric. If you like chilling horror, well written, well played and with a really scary atmosphere, this is the movie for you. I like the original horrors. I only saw the original Haunting last night and that's a great movie. Very atmospheric again - and so is The Woman In Black. The end of the film is different from book to book but is still very good. I recommend it. Try it ... you * will * like it if you like traditional ghost stories ... SO ... turn off the lights, turn on the fire, close the doors, have a drink ... and enjoy ...: )
