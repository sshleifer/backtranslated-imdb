I have to say, the worst part of the movie was the first half hour. I was really confused who was who. For example, Bill Paxson's character had long hair and wore a jacket. When all the men arrived at the camp, it turned out that there was a character who looked like Bill Paxson but was not. I said, where is Bill Paxson? Then there was a man with his girlfriend. He said she was 21 years old. This should be a 20-year reunion of the most memorable of the camp leader (Alan Arkin). Later, the same girl interacted and talked about his camp experience. That did not make sense. She would have been one year old. The movie turned out to be pretty good. Kevin Pollak was the nice guy who was always teased. One guy was an absolute narcissism and ended up losing his beautiful girlfriend. Alan Arkin was interesting as a camp director in the old style, and he admits that he has not come into contact with modern youth. Best of all, none of the adult campers had any success in life. None of them had a very good career. That seemed very real. The movie was compared to The Big Chill. In a way, it was not as exciting as the big chill, but it was much more realistic. Although the beginning is not promising, the film became a pretty good movie.
