I have just read the latest comments on this film and would like to respond. You probably are not familiar with the original story of the rap group N.W.A. familiar. In 1988, Ice Cube left the band to go solo, and in 1991 the band was disbanded when Dr. Drew left. This resulted in a lot of beef, which began in 1991 with the departure of Ice Cube and Dr. Dre. This story was based on that. <br /> <br /> Also, this movie was a 90-minute laugh, by the way, you said that the booties juice song was a political statement that was hilarious. Not to mention the delicious "love song". and when Vanilla Sherbert kicked his ass, the boss of the record company is also weird and also has the managers who get shot every time. People who did not enjoy this movie probably did not do it. Get it or you were perfect idiots, my opinion
