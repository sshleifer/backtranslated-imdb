Best of the Zorro series and one of my favorite series, period. This is a period set right after the birth of Mexico. The new nation expects the gold produced by this one city to sustain the republic. Don del Oro is a gold god who stirs up the Indians and steals the gold. It is Zorro and his group of men to the rescue. Reed Hadley is a winning Zorro and he cuts a dashing figure when he gets a nice selection of scraps (most of which were used by the later Zorro series as well as other series) Who is the real evil? There's a reason I've seen this most of all the series I've seen, it's just a great action adventure movie. The only thing I can compare to is Zorro's time with Tyrone Power or one of the other swashbucklers of the time. It is great and highly recommended.
