This is one of the best ensemble comedy / musical "B" movies I've ever seen (and now that I'm in my 40s and just now seeing it, I'm not an expert, but I have all the well-known movies there seen outside). When a ton of actors play the main role for minutes, the comedy usually intervenes in the musical pieces, and often the music breaks the comedy flow. Call me in a crazy mood, but when I saw that at TCM Europe, I laughed out loud with joy! So who delivered the laughs for me? No doubt Mischa brought me to a terrific madness, he even steals the end, it was great! By the way, I think why this movie works is because L & H is a selling point (and why I was addicted to watching this movie (she and Hal Roach), I love them in their early Hal Roach stuff), but that remains you are at least on the ADULT tariff (in the 1930s and not far from today's standards if you read between the lines). Jack Haley is also great to watch, I admit that I only knew him from W O OZ and I loved him there, and I also laughed aloud at his waiter prayer. Patsy Kelly is the only "ugly" femme in the 30s who really appeals to me (something tells me she was a Spitfire in real life); and the musical numbers have a really professional production (Busby Berkley'ish) that I'm used to from what I'm used to in this genre. I could go on and on, but I assure you that I really enjoyed this movie. I saw it at TCM Europe and will see it again with my wife at TCM USA. Good stuff!
