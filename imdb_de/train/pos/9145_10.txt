Prince plays in this semi-autobiographical film "The Kid" by a talented but narcissistic young musician who has a less than outstanding home. Acting leaves a little to be desired (apart from Morris Day and especially Clarence Williams, both of which are perfect), but the movie is still great and one of the best in the 80s. It has the best soundtrack of EVERY movie in the last 50 years, highly clichable lines, and the dumpster scene is HILARIOUS !! Plus, Apollonia is just breathtaking. When unrelated to an unrelated when I saw Prince in concert in 2004, he blew up the stadium. He is an experienced showman and it was one of the best concerts I have ever experienced. <br /> <br /> My Note: A <br /> <br /> DVD Extras: Disc 1) Commentary with Director Albert Magnoli, Producer Robert Cavallo & Director of Photography Donald Thorin; Theatrical trailer; Trailer for "Under the Cherry Moon" and "Grafitti Bridge" Disc 2) A 12-minute feature on the First Avenue Club; "Purple Rain: Bachstage Pass (in the movie for half an hour, which I will discuss later);" Riffs, Raffs and Revolution: The Impact and Influence of Purple Rain "10 minutes long, 30 minutes MTV's premiere footage (when MTV sucked no ass balls); 5 music videos from Prince (Let's go crazy, take me with you when pigeons cry, me would die 4 U / baby, I'm a star and purple rain); 2 videos of The Time (Jungle Love and The Bird) and a music video to "Sex Shooter" by Apollonia 6 Eye Candy: Apollonia shows off her fine ass-tits
