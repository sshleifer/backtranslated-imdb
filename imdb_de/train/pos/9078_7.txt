In general, the plot was much better than I expected. The laughter was sometimes a bit annoying and disturbed rather in the way; There was enough chuckle in this episode to make up for it. My biggest surprise was that some of the best lines were found and situations were not shown in the trailers. Spade, in particular, was not presented in the best light during the previous promotions, but his character shows in the pilot quite well. There is enough eye candy to satisfy almost everyone, and all normal characters seem to be up to the task ahead of them. Well, if the authors can live only what they started.
