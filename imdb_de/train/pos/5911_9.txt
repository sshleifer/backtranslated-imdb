Do you remember Ralph Bakshi? The guy who was animated at Terrytoons, then at Paramount Cartoon Studios. After that he was a director at Fritz the Cat 1 & 2 and Heavy Traffic. Well, that's Coonskin. And it's actually pretty good. Racist, but good. The film plays in Harlem Nights (No, well, it was a working title.), But with a twist that becomes a Lampoon of a Disney movie, Song of the South. <br /> <br /> It's about Sampson (Barry) White) and the Preacherman (Charles Gordone) hurry to help their friend Randy (Philip Michael Thomas) escape from jail, but are turned off by a roadblock stopped and land in a shootout with the police. While waiting for her, Randy involuntarily listens to escape mate Pappy (Scatman Crothers) as he begins to tell Randy a story about "Three Guys I Knew Once, Just Like You and Your Friends." Pappy's story is told in animations with live action background photos and footage. Brother Rabbit (vote of Thomas), Brother Bear (voice of White) and Preacher Fox (vote of Gordone) decide to pack and leave their southern settings after the bank has mortgaged their house and sell it to one Man making a brothel out of it. When you arrive in Harlem, Rabbit, Bear and Fox, you realize that it's not all that's made of it. They meet a scam named Simple Savior, a fake revolutionary leader who claims to be the "cousin" of Black Jesus, and that he "gives his followers" the power to kill the whites. " In an eye-catching stage show in his "church", Savior is brutalized by symbols of black oppression - portrayed by images of John Wayne, Elvis Presley and Richard Nixon, before he asks his parishioners for "donations". <br /> <Rabbit goes first against Madigan, a virulent racist and homophobic white police officer, and the mafia sackman, who demonstrates his contempt for African Americans in various ways, including refusing to bathe before an expected encounter with them (he believes that they are not worth it). When Madigan discovers that Rabbit has paid off, he and his cohorts Ruby and Bobby are taken to a nightclub called The Cottontail. <br /> <br /> A black stripper distracts him while he has a sugar cube with LSD effect dropped into his drink. Madigan is then maneuvered under the influence of his spit into a sexual bond with a stereotypical moronic man and then put into clothes, that women were representative of the racist archetype, adorned something racist and finally expelled the back of the club, where he discovers that Ruby and Bobby are dead. Then, as he recovers from his delirium of drug use, he accidentally shoots his weapon around and is shot dead by the police after he has shot one of them. <br /> <br /> Rabbit, Bear, Fox and the opponent's boxer fall out of the boxing arena as it explodes. The live action story ends with Randy and Pappy escaping while being shot at by various white policemen, but having managed to bring them to life. <br /> <br /> This film was controversial at the time and was edited several times under the title Street Fight, which is obvious since Street Fight is a documentary about racism in the streets of 2005. In fact, this film has the same theme as the documentary. <br /> <br /> This has led Bryanston Pictures, the distributor of this film and the original Tobe Hopper classic, the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, to go out of business. Because Paramount wanted to produce and distribute this film, Bryanston inherited the production of Bakshi due to racism. Despite the controversy, it was worth the conversation. The animation was fantastic at this time, the plot makes sense and is also funny. <br /> <br /> FINAL VERDICT: 9/10
