I really like this show. I can easily see how it has achieved cult status. It is original and thought-provoking. For some reason, I have never felt the kind of resonance I could have had. It's not the kind of open door, wintry coldness that was of such a great premise. Every time I watch an episode, I come across it and urge it to answer some nameless, informal questions. Before we proceed, let me anticipate this and say that the following are mine and my opinion is only opinion Different strikes for different people. <br /> <br /> I would have liked to see more scenes in the "American Gothic" that were filmed at night. There is too much natural light on this show, and I think it has a tendency to counteract tension. After all, we are not afraid of the light of day. We worry about what lies in the shade. The devil is not always in the details. What we do not see is often the most frightening. Second - and this will probably lead to tar and feathers: Gary Cole is a hugely talented actor ... a character actor. I've been following his career from the Brady Bunch movies, so it hurts to say that he's probably been misunderstood as Lucas Buck. He is almost too petro-angelic, too sympathetic to be the embodiment of evil even by biblical standards. Lucas Buck is a narcotic. He is heroin. He buys in a kitchen lab next to a gallon of Drain-O. You always go back, even though you know that the end will be madness and death. He should be like the ultimate loan shark. He is a bookmaker, but also an unspeakable condemnation. For sure. You have the money and soon you will have broken your finger. a severed hand, a decapitated head, and finally a damned soul. Turning to Buck is an act of despair, and whenever he is around, there should be an immediate finality of the environment - with daily increasing interest - in the air. <br /> <br /> And if you realize that, you know it's too late. <br /> <br /> Which leads me to three: They showed Buck a little too often. He's actually in most of the scenes, which could have resulted in him losing his edge. The sheriff would be like the mythology next door. He is the apocryphal acquaintance. Many would know him, but few would really know him. He would be the stuff of flashbacks and cryptic conversations, and the perfect person to deliver this plot exhibition would have been the vicarious character Nick Searcy portrayed. Four, the show could be very awesome - a mistake, you could say - and that's typical of the whistle of "meet me at the fishing hole" in a production pilot. I think we've already established that Cassidy and Raimi were the anti-Andy Taylor. We probably did not need the Fed-Ex-delivered concept. I found that within the first five minutes, the piano on my head was unnecessary for me. <br /> <br /> These comments are all about what FOR ME could have done a good show. I also understand that the producers had their own unique style and that there were many hands in the soup. In their eternal search for LCD programs, the network played a crucial role in the demise of this series. <br /> <br /> The least that these jerkin suits could have done was air the episodes in turn. > <br /> become real. <br /> <br /> In any case, it's a heavy loss for both genre fans and occasional viewers.
