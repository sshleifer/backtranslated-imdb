If you have not seen this, you will not know what you are missing. The first time you do this, you will be able to have pain that is lying on the floor, laughing, and probably getting wet yourself. <br /> <br /> It's so funny. There has not been a single comedy performance I've seen that surpasses or even comes close. So many classic one-liners, stories and segways .. <br /> <br /> The drunken uncle on the grill Gi Joe, Mr. T, go ice goo, ice cream seller, say all these things for everyone, has seen this achievement and me Bet that you will have dollars for donuts, they will not be able to keep a straight face and will burst out laughing or recite the rest of the dialogue from the act. <br /> <br /> Pure classic !! Too bad that you can not get it on DVD. <br /> <br /> Rating 10+ out of 10
