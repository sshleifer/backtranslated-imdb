Noteworthy is the notorious scene in which the beautiful Maruschka Detmers takes the penis of her young lover out of his pants and into his mouth. Even without this moment, the movie is a magnificent, if somewhat disturbing, passionate and incredibly sexy ride. Detmers does a great job as the partially confused, insatiable joy wanders over her flat nude. Dressed, partially clothed and naked, she steals most of the film about love, sexual passion, philosophy and politics. For me, the last two are a little lost and the end is most confusing when her fianc√© is released while other terrorists are released. She does not seem to be sure who she wants, and the young lover seems to think more of his exams than anything else, of course!
