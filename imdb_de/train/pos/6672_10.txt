I've seen Mystery Men sticking to a stick in the press and in the public eye (like imdb, for example), but overall, I think Mystery Men is more fun than most movies, and definitely funnier as most so-called comedy films and almost "clever". <br /> <br /> The cast is outstanding. Greg Kinnear is excellent, as are Geoffrey Rush and Tom Waits. Kinnear's soda scene with Ricky Jay is a perfect "spoiled movie star" and he gives his character the right balance between comic quality and realism to get him going. <br /> <br /> I admit that the tempo is a little bit outlandish in places and in visuals it's certainly a blitz, possibly at the expense of further characterization, but at the end of the day this is a high concept movie concept - it is about the little moments "What's Up Tiger Lily?" - and there are so many great in this movie that it pays to look at it repeatedly.
