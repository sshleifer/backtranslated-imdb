Man, I love the new DVD Universal released. I've never seen THE SENTINEL look so good ever since I've struggled with crappy, grainy VHS tapes for years. Unfortunately, there are no extras except a trailer that looks pretty bad for the wear. And avoid the Goodtimes DVD at all costs. It's shit. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the disturbed model Alison Parker (Cristina Raines) moves to hip New York's Brownstone, but it's more than just a ghost. It's also a gateway to hell and the Vatican keeps an old, blind priest (John Carradine) looking after it, making sure the devils and archangels do not run away. <br /> <br /> This is a star-star ensemble full of old actors like Ava Gardner, Arthur Kennedy, Jose Ferrer, etc., as well as cameos from 80's stars, including Christopher Walken, Jeff Goldblum (whose voice) was mysteriously overwritten ) and Tom Berenger. And you do not even recognize Jerry Orbach from LAW & ORDER. I had to make a double take when I was not exactly where I had seen him before. <br /> <br /> Beautiful scenes in which Alison cuts her eyes and nose from her dead father's possessed corpse to the devil And there's a neat ending where disfigured, deformed people try to make Alison commit suicide so she can will not be the next to guard the portal. It seems that Alison's difficult past makes her a first-rate Vatican candidate to become the next Sentinel. <br /> <br /> An excellent, scary 70's classic by director Michael Winner, which should not be missed. I also recommend it for those who want something more imaginative than the usual stupid teen slashers and horror comedy. <br /> <br /> 7 of 10 points <br /> <br /> -
