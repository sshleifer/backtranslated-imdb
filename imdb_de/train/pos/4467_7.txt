Absolutely enjoyable singing and dancing film with Frank Sinatra and Gen Kelly as well as Kathryn Grayson. <br /> <br /> The film won and the Oscar for George E. Stoll's score, and nominations for Best Picture, Best Actor for Kelly and Best Cinematography, and a Best Son nomination for "I Fall in Love Too Easily," sung by Sinatra. <br /> <br /> It was a nice story about Kelly helping his buddy Sinatra to fall in love with a girl and falling in love with her. The lovely Grayson (New Orleans toast) blinded us with her singing and we had many great songs and dance routines by Kelly and Sinatra and the art of pianist-conductor Jos√© Iturbi. <br /> <br /> A classic Hollywood music from a bygone era.
