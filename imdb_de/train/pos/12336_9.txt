An excellent murder melodrama from the days when Fontaine effectively played against her former naive wallflower type, in a role that Olivia DeHavilland had allegedly rejected. That's fine, because Fontaine is wonderful. Screenplay by Charles Bennett, who wrote for Hitchcock in the 1930s and later also wrote the award-winning screenplay for the classic British horror movie Night of the Demon. The opening scene, in which Ivy visits a sinister fortune teller played by the wonderful Una O'Connor (the screamer of James Whale), is a tour de force, and the film holds interest during the numerous sinister machinations. I hope I can see this movie on DVD someday, but desperate that this ever happened, because it seems to be an undeservedly obscure movie. Luckily I saw it on AMC seven or eight years ago, but have not seen it since. Catch it if you can!
