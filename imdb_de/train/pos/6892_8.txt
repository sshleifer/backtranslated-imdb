The next thing I ever saw was a clip that was shown about two years ago at a Gerard Philippe exhibition in Paris. I had no interest in the remake, and having obtained the original just over half a century after its completion, I can only conclude that improper fencing was intentional and aimed at an outdated target. Hollywood had been practicing realistic sword fights since the 1930s, when the biggest of them, Basil Rathbone, had crossed movies with Errol Flynn and others, so the technology was available and only satire remained. After a while you notice the Henri Jeanson dialogue, reminiscent of Prisoner Of Zenda, in both versions. Gerard Philippe certainly had the presence to play such a role, and Gina Lollabrigida was probably a bit better than Martine Carol, the other obvious candidate at the time. The pressure I saw was particularly bad and at one point completely collapsed so maybe a DVD version would improve it.
