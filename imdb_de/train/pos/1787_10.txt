The Danish character finally lets Buddy have the terrible truth. "Leave me alone, kiss men, if you want," she screams self - righteously in front of all people and destroys the man who has been in love with her for so long, nice girl, here you could rethink everything The gigantic charm, the The Danes pour into this character is a good reason to have sympathy for them, who is lying in bed and dies, but hey, remember that there are no mistakes, except, perhaps, to watch this movie, wait a minute, that irony This is actually a masterpiece of the ironic joke, yes! But somehow I doubt that the creators of this film have thought sadly Maybe there are a few mistakes.
