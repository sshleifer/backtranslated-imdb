When I read the plot of this drama for the first time, I assumed it would be like Sex and the City, but this drama is nothing like that. The stories of the characters seem more real and you feel more in the situations. The concept of the drama is similar, twenty-four women lead us through friendships and relationships to problems and conflicts. Katie, the GP, is a dark and brooding character, which is also hard to describe and the best friend of Trudi, a widow. Trudi's character is heartwarming, because one can relate to the difficulties she has, along with the fact that she is the only mother of the four. Jessica is the party girl who is very sincere and knows what she wants and how to get it. She is a sympathetic figure and closest to Siobhan, the newlywed woman who, while she loves her husband, can not help her look to her workmate. Overall, the drama is surprisingly addictive and if the BBC continues to produce the series, it could work well. It's different from other female actors like Sex and the City or Desperate Housewives. If played correctly, these could be the next cold feet. Plus the male cast are not bad for the eyes either.
