My favorite movie! I've seen a lot of movies, but this beats them all! Excellent acting, wonderful story. You will start as a "normal" caring person to love George. Although he is an actor, he is also himself and a very lovely person. And most importantly, you'll learn to see people with Down syndrome differently and look different.
