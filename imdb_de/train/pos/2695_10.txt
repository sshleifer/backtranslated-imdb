What keeps us alive - or at least what I believe the writer wanted us to be together at an early stage is our desire to know if Martinaud did the dirty act. Without spoiling so much, of course, there's a red herring and a twist. But then we discover that this is the story of Martinaud's imperfections and his difficulty in dealing with them. If there is a revelation, we begin to sympathize with it and have compassion, for throughout the story we are led to think that he is the sick, perverse pedophiliac we remember. One of the things he has to deal with is the distance between him and his wife, even though they live on the same roof. Of course, these problems are in the shocking finale of the film. This movie requires your patience and he has certainly tried those of the restless teenagers sitting in the back. Obviously they were tormented because they are not involved in "centrally located" films. Although there is a bit of traveling when we come to the forest and the beach. And we realize that Gaul is not as smart as we think he is. <br /> <br /> The Inquisitor is 5/5
