Long before "Brokeback Mountain" (about 23 years ago) "Deathtrap" was the first time I saw two men kissing passionately on the screen, and frankly I was shocked. I understood it in terms of the plot, and it did not really bother my feelings (not much), but it was the first time I saw it at least in a "mainstream" movie. I thought it was a brave move for his time and took the courage to try, especially Christopher Reeve, in the midst of his time as PG Superman Superman. The male bisexuality on screen may have gone one step further with "Brokeback," but it's interesting to notice this much earlier incarnation.
