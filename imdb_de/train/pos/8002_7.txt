I've seen Maslin Beach a few times - both on free-to-air television in Brisbane. I will not say whether it's good, bad or different, as others have treated it well and really. <br /> <br /> I'll say it's so Australian. Only in Australia can we make a film about the relationships between people who spend the day as naked as the day they were born and watch them on commercial television. <br /> <br /> I have a friend from the USA who is constantly amazed at what we have shown on free TV compared to their home country. Sex and the CIty and Huff are just examples. <br /> <br /> Although our government has been trying to turn us into the 51st state, it's good to know that at least some things really remain Aussie
