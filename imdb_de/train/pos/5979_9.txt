Undoubtedly the best heavy metal horror element made in the manic headbangins of the '80s, which admittedly does not sound that much, considering how many other entries in this weird little frightening subgenre like Hard Rock Zombies, "Blood Tracks," Terror on Tour "and the especially godless Jon-Mikl Thor stinker" Rock'n'Roll Nightmare "tended to do that, as well as this one still deserves props to downplay the excessive splatter and be unnecessarily obtrusive to focus on adolescent high school characters portrayed with more sharpness and plausibility than the norm for a mid-80s teenager targeted Scarefest, and the film's spiky sardonic parody of both the ridiculously exaggerated 80s Heavy Metal Stupidity as well as the disgusting self-righteousness of the persistent Killjoy conservatives, who claim it is the music of Te ufels, very smart and funny on the money (famous greedy-decade heavy metal god Ozzy Osbourne has a weird bit as smarmy anti-metal TV evangelist!). <br /> <br /> Marc Price (the hopelessly dweeby skippy on "Family Ties") gives Eddie "Ragman" winemaker a surprisingly strong and winning performance, a geeky, socially awkward and severely persecuted heavy metal lover who is constantly being attacked by the stinking idiots that make up the majority of students at Lakeridge High School (the cruelty and meanness of high school students is nailed with painfully credible accuracy). Eddie's life is deteriorating as his rock star idol Sammi Curr (a strikingly beaten Tony Fields act) dies in a hotel fire. Renowned local disc jockey Nuke (KISS frontman Gene Simmons in a cool cameo) captivates Eddie with Sammi's latest unreleased album, which, when played backwards, revives Curr's malevolent spirit from the dead. Sammi encourages Eddie to overthrow him for all the vile dunderheads that make poor Eddie a proverbial hell, but Eddie proves to be a very hesitant accomplice. It's up to Eddie, supported by the cute girl Leslie Graham (lovingly worked up by the lovely Lisa Orgolini) to stop Sammi before things get out of hand. <br /> <br /> Friendly with commendable thoughtfulness and sensitivity for character, actor Charles Martin Smith (who also briefly appears as a nerdy schoolteacher), who was written and able to write by Michael S. Murphy, Joel Soisson and Rhet Topham was to play a uniform cast on the snuff cast, this surefire sleeper is even complete with a handful of nimble "jump moments" (an outrageous assault of a grotesque, boring, brave thing in the back of the wagon as the definitive highlight), a rousing "Carrie" Style high school dance battle sequence, a neat Halloween that shows revenge is properly shown as a really ugly business, and a solid core message that you should not necessarily make a certain overheated person your hero because of the anti-establishment stance the guy is doing to qualify for the qualification for this particular Sta tus.
