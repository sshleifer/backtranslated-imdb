I agree with other comments that there was not much story talk in the movie, but it was not a documentary! It should be entertaining and I think it has done a great job. <br /> <br /> I agree with the black family. The scenes with them seemed out of place. All of a sudden it would be thrown in, but later on I dealt with the history and the connection between the families and found it pretty good. Nevertheless, it was not a reenactment of In the 60s, it brought to light very large and important milestones of the decade. I found it very entertaining and worth it to see.
