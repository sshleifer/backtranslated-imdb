I just watched this movie on HBO and it was really good ... a tragic love story! I have appreciated the fact that the man in the heart of history has lost the use of his legs in an accident. It is rare to see a love story with someone who is physically disabled. The love that developed between this character and the woman who comes into his life beautifully shows how I would think that love can heal someone's heart. Laura Leighton ... all 27 when she made this movie ... was great because the woman is so full of life that she can revive that guy's heart. Since his family is wealthy and she is not, "problems" arise. <br /> <br /> It's playing HBO several times this month. Check the schedule here - http://www.hbo.com/apps/schedule/ ScheduleServlet?
