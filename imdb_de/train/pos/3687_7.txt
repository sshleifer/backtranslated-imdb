Greetings from the darkness. 18 directors of 18 seemingly independent vignettes on love in the city of lights. A very unusual format that can be adapted to a few segments as a viewer. We're so used to character development in a 2-hour movie that it's a little disarming that it happens in an 8-minute segment. <br /> <br /> The idea consists of 18 love / relationship stories in 18 different neighborhoods marvelous city. Of course, some stand out better than others and others prefer comedy, while others focus on dramatic emotions. Some well-known directors are involved, including: The Coen Brothers, Wes Craven, Alfonso Cuaron, Alexander Payne, Gus Van Sant and Gurinda Chadha. Many well-known faces also appear: Steve Buscemi, Barbet Schroeder, Catalina Sandino Moreno, Ben Gazzara, Gena Rowlands, Gerard Depardieu, Juliette Binoche, Willem Dafoe, Nick Nolte, Maggie Gyllenhaal, and Bob Hoskins One of the best segments involves a pantomime and then another pantomime and the nerdy but happy young son of the two pantomimes. Also playing a key role are a red trench coat, cancer, divorce, sexual fantasy, the death of a child, and many other topics. Do not miss Alexander Payne (director of "Sideways") as Oscar Wilde. <br /> <br /> The variety of segments makes this interesting, but as a film it can not be described as great. Nevertheless, it is very well visible and a good change for the frequent cinema visitors.
