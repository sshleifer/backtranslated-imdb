This is my fourth Joe McDoakes shorts I've ever seen, and so far the funniest. In this case, Joe takes singing lessons from a record that mimics Charles Boyer and Ronald Colman. When he goes to Warner Bros. Studio (the company behind this series, by the way), he asks Jack Carson for directions that both confuse. Then he meets actor George O'Hanlon (who is also McDoakes), who speaks in his more normal voice, not too far removed from his later Geroge Jetson, and arrives at the set where he automatically excites the director. I stop there and just say how funny I found the whole thing and was fascinated by the movie stars that were about to end. The last scene was above all a scream. So go to YouTube if you want to see So You Want Be Be in Picutres!
