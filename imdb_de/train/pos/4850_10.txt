So your bairns are on a sleepover? The woman visits the mother-in-law? You are at home. It is a dark and stormy night and there is no football on TV and the dishwasher has to be stacked? So, what are you doing now? <br /> <br /> I will tell you! <br /> <br /> Make an old-fashioned cocoa (Frys is best!) Take some ginger nuts and sit in front of the DVD. Now go and select Arthur Askey's World War II thriller / horror, The Ghost Train. Return to this comfortable sofa and enjoy the night in it! <br /> <br /> The Ghost Train is a true British wartime classic! Arthur Askey with his sidekick, Stinker Murdoch, entertains you and I suspect the cast has come to a high octane, thrill, spy thriller and spy thriller. The focus is on a colorful group of people who have to stay overnight in an old waiting room haunted by an old train. The environment is tracked by an old train. <br /> <br /> The plot unfolds neatly and accurately and is a merit of the entire cast, it is sometimes humorous and sometimes really scary! <br /> <br /> (The story was written by the old boy Godfrey of Dad's Army Fame and is smart) Arthur Askey is entertaining and is very at home to sculpt his routines for you and your children the cast shows also that he can act a bit! The actors are never staged, even the railway porter and the parrot help to give the film the necessary gravitas. Oh, and when it ends, remember to stack the dishwasher!
