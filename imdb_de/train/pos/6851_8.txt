De Palma's technique had reached a high level of sophistication at the time of this film, which is a wonderful showcase of its classic techniques, although unfortunately, as with many of De Palma's own films, the Meta's history serves more than the interests of an emotionally captivating story. <br /> <br /> The story begins with a CRAZY scene in which Angie Dickinson masturbates in the shower while she looks at her husband. She is then seized and raped while his husband is inadvertently nearby? and the whole thing becomes Angie's fantasy when the husband pumps her away in bed senselessly. She has a short scene with her son, a dead wrestler for Harry Potter, who ends with a joke that "she'll tell grandma to play with his Peter". Then she goes to her therapy session where she complains about her dead marriage before trying to seduce her therapist Michael Caine. He refuses and she is hurt and feels unsightly and unfulfilled. Then begins a brave, 22-minute, almost wordless sequence, perhaps the highlight of the film. Among the many things De Palma has won from Hitchcock is the understanding of film as a purely visual medium to tell stories. and in typical De Palma fashion he makes it a way to show off his impressive abilities. The problem for me is that in this case, one has the feeling that scenes are unnecessarily tedious, just to further demonstrate the skills of the director. <br /> <br /> The sequence begins with Angie in an art museum. She watches strangers who are all involved in sexual or family activities and then becomes a man sitting next to her. De Palma skilfully narrates an extremely complicated narrative without a single word about Angie's attraction, embarrassment, retreat, and finally finding and submitting to the stranger in the back of a taxi hired by Pino Donaggio, who also has a wonderfully lush score Carrie. <br /> <br /> In the second part of the sequence, Angie slept with the man and gets up to return to her husband. Again, De Palma pushes in a ton of tales, without uttering a word of dialogue, when Angie realizes that she has no panties, that her husband is already at home and no doubt asks where she is, that she is probably ill with a venereal disease and that she lost her engagement ring somewhere in the shuffle. It's all very admirable, but it makes you feel a little bit upset as we're forced to take a long elevator that moves up from the seventh floor and then almost in real time. <br /> <br /> ... Spoilers out of here! When Angie reaches the seventh floor, she is killed by a tall blond-haired woman. The woman hugs her until she reaches the ground floor when the door opens and Nancy Allen sees her there. There's a wonderful slow-motion sequence as Nancy grabs the elevator, Angie reaches up to her, and the killer's blade is held to cut Nancy's hands. Then some electrifying shots follow as Nancy looks up and sees the killer in the convex mirror of the elevators. It's all fine, and when we have dialogue again, you think; "Woah, that was just 22 minutes of purely visual narration!" Or maybe not, but I do. <br /> <br /> A younger Dennis Franz has a great role as a sloppy and tough New York detective who would rather have everyone work for him. He questions Michael Caine, making the monstrous hint that Angie wanted to be killed. Angie's son is also there and he joins in with Nancy, and they set out to spy on Caines therapists and find out who the killer is. <br /> <br /> Once again there is a strong connection to a movie by Hitchcock, in this case Psycho (just as Obsession is a reworking of Vertigo). You have a woman we should understand is secretly a slut who is killed in a closed room for the first 30 minutes, in this case more of a lift than a shower. Then, the relatives of the deceased carry out an investigation to show that the murderer is a man disguising himself as a woman to kill him. In the end De Palma even throws in a doctor who explains the psychology of the whole thing. <br /> <br /> It's very interesting, but at the same time a viewer can feel a bit fooled around, and that's my primary reservation to this movie. It's definitely necessary to look at and present some of De Palma's best set pieces, but the feeling that the story leaves a good third place behind the need for De Palma, and its somewhat unsightly sexual fantasies make it hard to look back on Affection from the bottom of my heart. <br /> <br /> --- You can find more reviews on my website about bad and cheesy movies, Cinema de Merde, cinemademerde.com
