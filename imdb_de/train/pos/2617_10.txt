I have seen King of Lion more often than all my friends have put together. Having a little sister ... you know how it is. In the meantime I have saved both the plot and the lines. After Lion King 2 came out, it was all right, let me see ... the second was much weaker ... then I saw an ad for Lion King 1 and 1/2 ... I was alright, we go again . After I had looked at the 1 1/2, I was like wow. All my expectations (regarding repetition) were broken. A really nice and original plot keeps you in the seat all the time. I've noticed that the cartoon was filled with so many weird moments that ROFlmao is 100% used here. <br /> <br /> I definitely recommend to see the cartoon.
