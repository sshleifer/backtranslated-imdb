This obscure de Sica delivers the goods. And it says, "The meek will inherit the earth." This narrative of classes on the surface, but really an allegory for all the homeless people who populated Europe after the Great War. They are homeless but happy, in societies that are too poor and too selfish to care for or acknowledge them, doormats for the Italian carpet excavators. de Sica tells it as a fairytale, as a Cinderella story. I have not read the book on which it is based, so I can not foresee whether Deus ex machina is the construct of the writer or of Vittorio. It begins with the words "Once upon a time ..." to illustrate the timelessness of his story, because the story could be played everywhere and everywhere. Caricature sketches of the aristocracy cut to the bone, bizarre nature of the homeless, especially when they begin to fulfill their desires, and an ending ending in a Spielberg image, make this boulange a joy for all. The best picture of De Sica is also one of his best. He renounced Neorealism and turned away again and again between this and the good old filmmaking. He creates a film that breaks the heart and at the same time fulfills it with the longing of hope that one must leave in this world. Gracias Vittorio! Gracias! Gracias !!! Gracias !!!!!!!!!!!!
