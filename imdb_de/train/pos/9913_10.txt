Apart from being an extremely funny movie, I may add that the costumes and scenery were wonderful. This friendly, fun-loving woman had a lot of money. Unfortunately, she also had two greedy daughters, who were anxious to get their money in their hands. This woman was lonely since the death of her husband. He had proposed her in a theater that was to be demolished. To prevent that, she bought it. Their daughters were afraid that they would "throw away" their money and decided to do something. The character actors in this film were also a big plus. I would give almost anything to have a copy of this movie in my video library, but so far it has never been released. Sad.
