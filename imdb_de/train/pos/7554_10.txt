First of all, this movie is 34 minutes long, which means that you can watch it three times in a row and still spend less time than most other movies. Second, you have to do that. This sensational short film explores the potential of animation through a world of playful or terrifying but always powerful images. Cats that ride into and drink from a water elephant, a circus with a bird that has consumed the sky, and pigs eat their own flesh - that's just the beginning. The extraordinary scenes and images flow together without obvious causal connections in a way that requires a second glance. In addition, the DVD contains an amazing director commentary, which only improves the display in view of the extremely economical dialogue. The commentary contains some interpretations of the scenes, but also provides priceless quotes about making cat soup, such as, "Well, the artists asked what we should do in this scene, but I did not know it myself. It's hard to say why has developed so "(by the way, a bad transcription). In addition, the sound throughout the film is of very high quality, very precise and very moody. Overall, the absolute minimum reception experience should look like this: First view: Watch the DVD without comment. Second visit: Watch the DVD WITH the comment. Third sight: Rewatch without comment. <br /> <br /> If you have looked at it three times, you will not stop there ...
