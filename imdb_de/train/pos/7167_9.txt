I could not help but comment after reading the very short comment "Not bad". This movie is much better than just not bad. The acting is outstanding, even by the children in the cast, who do not play cute or anything, but behave like my son's friends. The film is smart and expects the audience to be good too. The dual-background Flash stories are resourceful and contribute to the story rather than acting as a time filler. I saw this movie with my children and saw it again a few days later. If you have children and are sick of films that inspire a diabetic coma with their syrupy sweetness, then look at "holes". My 6 year old enjoyed it as much as my 11 year old, and my husband and I enjoyed it as much as they did. How many movies can you say that?
