This movie is pure Elvira and shows her on her chest ... I mean best! The story (co-written by Cassandra Peterson, Elvira's alter ego) is inspiring and intriguing, brought to life by Elvira's wit and charm. The viewer gets the opportunity to see Elvira in a whole new light as she struggles with the prejudices of the people in Fallwell, Massachusetts (where she came from Los Angeles to read her will of her great aunt Morgannas). At the same time she tries Helping the long-lived teenagers who did not enjoy the matriarchal chastity bug Pariah and the rest of the city council. She also has to appeal to Bob Redding, the owner of the local movie theater, and another woman (Patty), who also has Bob in mind, but does not earn his love nearly as well as Elvira. Later in the film, she also faces the complications of having to descend from a "great metaphysical celebrity" and the accusation of witchcraft being raised against her, meaning she is burned at the stake. Elvira manages to be sexy and vulnerable, streetwise, and naive as he cracks jumbled jokes and double-meaning off-beat lines. Give yourself up and always try to follow your dreams. In the end, Elvira's dreams have finally come true, which is the best thing that can happen to this wonderfully unique and determined woman. <br /> <br /> I've seen this movie countless times and never get tired! There are no unnecessary scenes and I was fascinated throughout the movie. A review does not do justice to the actual movie, so I can just tell you to PLEASE watch the movie because it's one of the best movies ever made! In the meantime, I wish you "unpleasant dreams!"
