One word: suPURRRRb! I do not think I have seen such a long time on the network or cable TV. The look of this show was like a breath amidst television programs full of reality shows and boring repeats. <br /> <br /> I have to say I had my reservations. After all, the critics were almost in agreement that they were screaming badly and downgrading the show. But when half an hour was over (by the way, thank you, NBC, for conducting an ad-free show), I felt instant love, love at first sight, the true love you feel inside. Everything about this show has roared EXCELLENCE. <br /> <br /> The graphics in this show were at least as good as Finding Nemo and Shrek. It was no trifle, considering that these films took years. <br /> <br /> The cast was wonderful. I agree with John Goodman's voice, but the rest of the team was certainly on par with John. Special mention: Lisa Kudrow's guest appearance. She was at the forefront of the game, creating a neurotic, chubby and lovable panda with a Jewish trail inside her. (Panda from Brooklyn, just in this show.) <br /> <br /> The script was funny, with lots of insider and adult jokes that were spicy but not cheesy. A note for all parents: This is NOT for children. This show has never been advertised as such, and there is a reason why it is set to 9 o'clock instead of 8 o'clock. So if you want to complain about "unpleasant context", you can save your breath. Adults deserve a comedy that was made just for them, and the father of pride is it. <br /> <br /> Not everything was perfect. I was a bit confused by the characters of Siegfried and Roy. Do I feel "stereotype" when it comes to them? Yes, they are gay. Yes, they are extravagant. Yes, they speak German accents. But these are the news from yesterday. Give us something new, something fresh, something funny. Placing the old jokes in a new show is definitely the wrong approach. I understand that the creators of this show wanted to use the "Star Power" of these guys. That's OK for me. But please do not go into something that everyone already knows by heart. Hopefully the rest of the show will not play the same old record again and again. <br /> <br /> Generally, the show is definitely a must-see TV. Funny, funny, with a few unexpected turns here and there - since Seinfeld there is no such good comedy. I'm really looking forward to the next episode.
