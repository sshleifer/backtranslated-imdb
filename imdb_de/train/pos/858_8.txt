This film has a rotting core of flexible morality and yet a quirky sense of justice. Many of the regular Joe's among us would love to "keep the man." The "MAN" is represented in this case by several different characters. Mr. Keller, in which Carla answers in her office. Later, Paul owes Mr. Marchand, the owner of the club, 70 large sums. And then there is Paul Parole Officer. There seems to be so much question about the side story of this last character. Reviewers point out that the otherwise well thought-out ping-pong game between our two protagonists is a weak point, and it escalates so fast that their lives change dramatically. They are committed to every agent of the "MAN". One or both could be fired, killed or imprisoned if they did not do as they were told. <br /> <br /> In the end, the movie looks relieved. Carla is finally laid. Your boss is forced as a jerk. Mr. Club Owner is a mushy mess in his own bathroom. They get the money $. And ... they do not need to worry about reporting to the Parole Officer because his moral weakness has led him to dump his wandering wife in the basement (or whatever the police have found to arrest him) , It is a critical subconscious trigger for the sluice-driller who has hurt us so badly. It does not matter that someone else gets Paul's file later to supervise his release; At the moment they are free! You could even get away! <br /> <br /> Woohoo ... <br /> <br /> YOU DRESS IT TO THE MAN!
