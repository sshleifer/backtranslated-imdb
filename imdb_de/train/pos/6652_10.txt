I saw the movie and really could not stop my tears. It is tragic that after liberty India has no such leaders who dare to do justice to their own children if they do not behave properly. In the current generation, politicians bring their children into politics without measuring their caliber and abilities Gandhi's dialogue "What kind of society do we want to create with such people (via Harilal)?" No wonder it will be a dream that India will hardly have such a leader in this or the next generation. Einstein was right when he said of Gandhi, "After 50 years, this person with body, soul and spirit (Mahatma) would hardly believe Gandhi) had ever lived on this earth. 'I want to thank Anil Kapoor, Feroze Khan and all the movie actors / actresses for this wonderful movie about a great person and relationship with his son. All father and son should watch this movie once and take lessons for both roles.
