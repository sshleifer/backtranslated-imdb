I seldom came out of a movie with such a warm, happy feeling. I felt as if I had been traveling with really good friends and had a wonderful time! I really enjoyed this movie. The show was great, although I had to mention Bill Nye as a totally flawless performance. Bill is a great actor and would like to see him in other films. Timothy Spall and Jimmy Nail are also favorites and love to see them as they perform well. And Billy Connolly, as always, totally stunning. It was a wonderful ensemble performance by all involved. Such a refreshing experience to see a well written, well written and good looking movie.
