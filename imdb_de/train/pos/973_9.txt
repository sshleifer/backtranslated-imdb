Impressive! So much fun! Probably a bit much for ordinary American kids, and it's really child's play to call this movie childrens movie. This movie reminded me a bit of Time Bandits - all Terry Gilliam. While the general narrative is fairly straightforward, Miike still poses MUCH surreal and Bunuel-tormenting moments. The entire first act is violently confronted from scene to scene with the normal family life of the main child / hero, with the spirit world and the evil that arises in it. And while the ending is a somewhat ambiguous aspect common to Miike's work, the levels of meaning and metaphor, especially the anti-war / revenge message of human folly, are pretty damn moving. As manic and imaginative as other great Miike films, instead of just excessive torture and bruising, he gives us endless monsters and yokai of Japanese folk art, creatively crafted through CG and puppetry and wrapped in an imaginative, multi-faceted adventure. F'n rad and one of Miikes best!
