This movie was made in Hungary, I think. The landscape is beautiful, the people who play the farmers were totally fascinating. Her riding art is great. I've been more involved with the natives, with farm life, and how heroically they tried to hide Brady from the evil Nazis who sought these parachutists. They even sacrificed their lives in several cases. The young orphan Brady makes friends with was a sweet kid. You will be amazed at what I think and how you try to escape the Nazis. It is entertaining and funny in some places and very tragic in others. Ladies have handkerchiefs on hand because in the end they will be devastated. I own it and have watched it several times. in other words, not just a one-time movement. it is a keeper ....
