I really thought that they were doing an * excellent * job, there was nothing wrong with that, I do not know how the first comment could have said it was awful, it moved me to tears (I think it moved everyone Tears) but I try not to cry in a movie because it is embarrassing, but that got me. It was so good! I hope they will be released on DVD, because I will definitely buy a copy! I think it has renewed my faith and gave me the hope that I can not explain it. I wanted me to strive to be a better person. They've been through so much and we take that for granted, I think. By comparison, I think that our own exams are nothing. Not nothing, but they barely fit what they had to go through. I loved it. Who played Emma?!
