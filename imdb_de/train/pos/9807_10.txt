I remember this series well. It was excellent - such strong and compelling characters, stylish and sexy ... and so unlike anything currently available - and now ... I'm sure it inspired the equally acclaimed Canadian drama "Traders." <br /> <br /> Both season 1 and season 2 are available on DVD Region 2 in the UK. It's a pleasure to watch the show again. <br /> <br /> Season 1 has 13 episodes and Season 2 seems to have 10 episodes. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, she seems to be over after two seasons. <br /> <br /> This series was a lot of fun. <br /> <br /> Sometimes you can get them on Amazon.de specifically
