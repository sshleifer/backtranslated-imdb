1.) This movie was incredible! I saw it when I was in town next to the one he grew up in! I went and saw the buildings in which the story took place. Overall, I loved this movie, one of Jake Gyllenhaal's best !! Also my favorite parts were the Science Fair and all the time with his dad. They were as sad as it seemed. Homer wanted to follow his dream and his father did not seem to be interested in one way or another. This tag line is true. "Sometimes One Dream is bright enough to make the sky shine." 2.) The way this movie was filmed was impeccable, it was all so believable that it could have been shot in the fifties. The dress was accurate and they also had their slang. Definitely recommend this movie!
