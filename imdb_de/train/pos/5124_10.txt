This is a great movie that I do not think deserves enough as Saturday Night Fever or Grease in John Travolta's career. He plays a man who is in love with a girl but too dizzy to admit his feelings. Instead, he wants to devote himself to mechanical bull riding because he believes it will show his masculinity. Although it was made in 1980, it is still up to date today. The great country soundtrack is great. 10/10
