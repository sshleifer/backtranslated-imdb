I leaned back and looked at "Read My Lips" a plate of Freedom Fries in front of me. The food was quickly forgotten as I fell under the spell of Jacques Audiard's original and great thriller of director and co-author. Carla (Emmanuelle Devos) is a secretary in a company that develops large-scale construction projects. She does, indeed, have some important responsibilities that are not often with secretaries, and she is capable and ambitious. And thwarted by a male hierarchy that will exploit them but will not reward them. <br /> <br /> If the work heaps up faster than she can handle it, Carla should hire a secretary. Enter the ex-con and the general layman about Paul (Vincent Cassel). He lies about his abilities and actually has none that could require a legitimate business. After an initial serious misunderstanding by Paul regarding Carla's interest in him, Paul becomes an ally. A quirky friendship begins. In a stunt that would have made a real Carla a great contender for "The Apprentice," she trumps her selfish male adversary while working with Paul's compassion. Leave the rival. <br /> <br /> Carla is virtually deaf without her hearing aid. With that she hears almost normal. She turns off the hearing aid to protect against unpleasant noises and annoying people. She is also very lonely. She was heroically made to make her seem simple, but she is really beautiful. She has no boyfriend. She babysits for a friend to have a connection (it's a French movie). Worse and humiliating, she admits to a friend's request that she is somewhere, while the married girlfriend is in bed with Carla. Not nice. <br /> <br /> As Carla and Paul get to know each other better, the barely repressed, vile side of the not-so-old criminal emerges. Incidentally, there is a side story of Paul's relationship with his probation officer who neatly complements the main story and has his own big surprise ending. <br /> <br /> "Read My Lips?" Ingenious Paul realizes that Carla's ability to read his lips, even from a distance, is more than the amusing salon-trick he seems to be first. From there, a caper develops. Enough said. <br /> <br /> Paul and Carla are a real gangster. She wants love, but also accepts money. He wants her, but the business must face a possible erotic satisfaction. Together, Cassel and Devos are strong actors who convincingly complete an unusual crime story. Rent or buy it, but if you enjoy a good crime story, choose Read My Lips. You may want to see it several times: I do it. <br /> <br /> 9/10
