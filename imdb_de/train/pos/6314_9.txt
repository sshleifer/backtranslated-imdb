I went to the movies with two of my friends and chose this film without knowing what to expect. And it turns out to be a very enjoyable, laughing experience! It's an excellent movie with a very unexpected story, very good dialogue and crazy humor. All characters are obviously in the "Alan Ford" style (Italian satirical comic style) made, but did not bother me for a second. In fact, this kind of loser-bum cast made a movie unique and interesting. Sam Rockwell gave a very good and convincing role, even Willian Macy, Clooney is barely recognizable and brilliant. But a real star is actually Guzman. He played a role in his life in this movie! The scene in which his character Cosimo dies in the movie is so funny that I had to suffocate and almost die with him! Highly recommended for all "Alan Ford" fans!
