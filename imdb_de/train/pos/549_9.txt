It's the year 1896. Jeff Webster (James Stewart) does not like people. There is only one friend he has and he is Ben Tatum (Walter Brennan), an old sympathetic man. They drive with them a herd of cattle your key to wealth. In Skagway, they get into trouble when Sheriff Gannon (John McIntire) takes the cattle. Now Jeff just has to get it back and drive it across the border between the US and Canada to Dawson. Now they have a group of other people you, like the ladies Ronda Castle (Ruth Roman) and Renee Vallon (Corinne Calvet). There, the two men go to the gold industry. The fourth collaboration between Anthony Mann and James Stewart, The Far Country (1954), is indeed a fine western. The acting is great. Walter Brennan makes a fantastic buddy to Stewart.Ruth's novel is brilliant and Corinne Calvet's adorable figure. Jay C. Flippen is very good as Dawson Marshal Rube Morris. The big Jack Elam and Kathleen Freeman can be seen in smaller roles. It's awesome to see Jimmy Stewart overcome everything The problems on his way. There is only the man and his gun. But he too is vulnerable.
