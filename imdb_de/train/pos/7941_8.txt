This little seen movie is a dull and relaxed giallo. It deviates from some clich√©s of the genre and is looser. It's about a woman who is looking for her missing lover; a psychiatrist who suddenly disappeared for no apparent reason. Her search leads her to a villa inhabited by a group of eccentric individuals. Murder is never far away in true Giallo style. <br /> <br /> The cast is really pretty good. We have Aldofo Celi (thunder-ball), Alida Valli (suspiria), Horst Frank (cat of the nine tails) and a very young Sybil Danning (80's cry queen). The lead actress is Rosemary Dexter, and although I'm not familiar with her, she does a good job of managing the picture. <br /> <br /> One of the defining features of Eye in the maze is its music. Atypical for a Giallo is a jazz-rock fusion soundtrack. This score, written by Roberto Nicolosi, is reminiscent of Miles Davis, especially In A Silent Way. It's an excellent soundtrack and really gives this movie a different feel than most Gialli's. The Fusion Groove accentuates the bleak atmosphere and complements the sunny seascape that makes up the movie. <br /> <br /> This is a giallo, so we really need to talk about the murder sets. Well, this movie is a little too short in that respect. It's certainly not free of them, but they are few and far between. The opening dream murder is probably the best deal and a memorable burning car sequence. But that's really not a particularly violent movie. However, I do not think that it should disappoint too many experienced fans of the genre. The mystery is quite captivating and it has enough eccentric characters (the idiot boy Saro and THIS uncomfortably uncomfortable accent?) And moments of bizarre to satisfy them; The sleaze factor is consistently confirmed with a small amount of nudity. <br/> <br /> Eye in the Labyrinth plays like a Giallo version of an Agatha Christie mystery as it presents a group of unsympathetic characters in a villa on suspicion of murder; We have compulsory flashbacks describing their connections to the last hours of the (most unsympathetic) murder victim. While this may not be a prime example of the genre, it certainly makes an appealing difference, as it does not borrow too much from other films in the sub-genre. For giallo enthusiasts I give a thumbs up and hope that one day there will be a nice DVD broadcast. It certainly deserves the treatment.
