I always have some suspicions before watching the British films because I usually find bland and boring scripts (like Vanity Fair or The Other Boleyn Girl), but with a great production design, European landscapes and those fat ones British accents that make the film suggest an artistic value that they do not really have. Luckily, the excellent film The Young Victoria does not cope with this situation, and due to its intriguing story, it earns an excellent buzz from performances by Emily Blunt, Paul Bettany, and Jim Broadbent, as well as the costumes and settings that make the movie unexpectedly rich. And I say "unexpected" because I do not usually pay much attention to these details. <br /> <br /> "Victorian Era" was (in my humble opinion) one of the key points in contemporary civilization, not only in the social field, but also in the scientific, artistic and cultural fields. But I honestly did not know much about the origins of that time, and perhaps that is why I enjoyed this simplification of the political and economic events that so heavily conditioned the landing of modern times. I also like the way Queen Victoria is portrayed, which is considered a young and intelligent monarch whose decisions were not always good, but at least they were inspired by good intentions. I also found the depiction of romance between Victoria and Prince Albert very interesting because she is equally interested in the combination. The only flaw I've found in this movie is that scriptwriter Julian Fellowes has some clichÃ©s of romantic cinema in the love story What I think is a little out of place in his screenplay /> <br /> The Young Victoria really liked it and I really did make a very nice surprise with myself. I hope that more period films follow the example of this film: the costumes and the landscapes should work so support an interesting story and not as a substitute for it.
