are highlights of this 1917 feature. The pride of the clan tells the story of a young girl who becomes a clan chief after the death of her father. On an island off the coast of Scotland, the villagers live the simple life of "fisherfolk". My copy is very dark and sometimes hard to read, but the film has breathtaking seascape and camera work on boats is great. Maurice Tourneur led Pickford in this pleasant movie. Pickford was already a big star in 1917, and this film seems to have been written just for her: happy young woman succeeds in misfortune. Pickford whip beating lazy villagers towards church is very funny. And the last scenes on the sinking ship are very well done. Not a great Picford movie, but still worth seeing. Matt Moore (Pickford was married to his brother Owen Moore) is the love interest and is well suited as the strapping island boy. Leatrice Joy is one of the villagers, but I could not see her either. My copy infiltrates many bells and gongs and adds an eerie feeling when the warning bells of the village are rung. Very effective.
