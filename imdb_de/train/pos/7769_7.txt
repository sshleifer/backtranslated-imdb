Lauren Bacall experienced the illness and death of her husband Humprey Bogart when she made this film. Rock Hudson was near 50 years of fame. Dorothy Malone is in excellent shape and wins an Oscar for support. Robert Stack is nominated and is short because of his role. <br /> <br /> The story is a bit soapy from another time, but just as rewarding as most dramas. Amazing how well drunk can drive in this movie and how fast sobers stack in a few of the first sequences of the movie. <br /> <br /> You can see why the cast is so good and the film is really good in production. One can say that Bacall is distracted during this film, because while she plays well, she seems emotionally drained in some sequences. The sexual references in this film are so bleak that many of today's young audiences would not do so Realizing what they are. Film does a good job and tells a story and ends up leaving a sequel, even though nothing has ever been done - although Written Beyond the the Wind would be a good title.
