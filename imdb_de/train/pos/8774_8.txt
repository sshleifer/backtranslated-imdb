In the late 19th century in San Francisco, poor, well-dressed Errol Flynn (as James J. Corbett) works in a bank and enjoys participating in local "boxing" with his colleague and drinking buddy Jack Carson (as Walter Lowrie) , One day handsome Alexis Smith (as Victoria Ware) goes to the "Comstock Bank" where Mr. Flynn works. Fascinated by Ms. Smith's elegant beauty, Flynn offers to take her wallet with her. Smith is secretly taken with the pretty Flynn, but is deterred by his force. <br /> <br /> Flynns good deed (actually a pickup attempt) brings him a free membership in the crappy "Olympic Club" with it contains a gym (with boxing equipment). Flynn's presumptuous manner and practical jokes (tickling men at the bars) irritate "Club" members. When an English boxing champ visits the club, members try to get Flynn to fight the man. They are hopeful, Flynn will resign, humbled by his defeat - but Flynn wins! <br /> <br /> First producer Robert Buckner is putting together a nice package for Warner Brothers and director Raoul Walsh. Mr. Buckner has certainly dealt with the success of his contribution (screenplay) for the brilliant studio "Yankee Doodle Dandy" of the studio. Unfortunately, this story is ridiculous. There was a "gentleman Jim" - this story is probably the filming of the autobiography of the real James J. Corbett "The Roar of the Crowd" - but this film has to be essentially fictionalized. Flynn is a very responsive leading man; he maneuvers the script easily and should have been recognized by the early 1940s as an outstanding actor. Many of Flynn's characterizations have been overlooked as a great achievement, and this is one of them. Smith does well as a female interest and skillfully transmits her emotions to the viewer. Director Walsh makes stupidity look smooth and extravagant. The minor cast is a treasure trove, from Alan Hale (as Pat Corbett) to Lon McCallister ("Paging Mr. Corbett"). <br /> <br /> ******** Gentleman Jim (1942) Raoul Walsh - Errol Flynn, Alexis Smith, Alan Hale
