CB4 was awful, but Cundieff might have understood better. Rather like Spinal Tap than anything else, the movie is smart from the start. Surprisingly everyone who saw it in the mid-nineties. The performances are laughable, but not so much that they are cartoon characters, more like Marx brothers. These guys are real and a bit varied. They react to situations like each of us. Well, we're not allowed to make a tantrum when our performance hats come out too late or pull off weapons and beat a record company man, but you have a picture. N (n *** as) W (with) H (hats) takes it seriously enough to pull you in, then you're addicted. Rent or get it at any cost, even if you do not really like rap music, it will still make you shout loudly. Compare that to CB4 and compare George Lucas 'Star Wars with Gil Gerards' Buck Rogers. I think you see my point
