Richard Dix decided to retire, so Michael Duane took over his role as Ted Nichols, who meets a young French girl named Alice Dupres Barkley (Lenore Aubert). This couple only knew each other for two days and they decided to marry a Justice of the Peace (Judge) and it rains when they arrive at the judge's home and find that he is away from home and will not return until the next day. When the couple is in the house, you see someone lifting the bonnet and taking a car part off the engine. As soon as you see this event, you'll find that this couple is in for a big surprise, and the story reveals a very mysterious event that surrounds Alice Barkley, and poor Ted Nichols begins with much trouble and no marriage. Good riddle, but I missed Richard Dix. Enjoy.
