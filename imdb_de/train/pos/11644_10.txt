This show is great! I've been a fan since the premiere, and I just have to watch ... I've seen some horrible things here that I wish I had not done, BUT, it really shows you how addiction affects everyone involved, not just those addicted You can see all sorts of different dependencies, from drugs and alcohol to shopaholics or eating disorders. And actually it is really sad to see some of the famous faces that have come through too. We have seen accomplished musicians, an NBA player and even young people who really need help. And since they showed some follow-ups, that was great too. Now you can see them being aired long after their EP. If you have not checked this, please do so. It's on A & E and it's awesome! The new eps is Sunday evening at 10 pm EST, if I remember right ... so set your TiVo!
