This movie can be interpreted on many different levels. Do not listen to the other comments that beat up the movie and say it's a replayed story and that it's just a drug. It has very obvious superficial metaphors about drugs; But the rest of the movie (and why I think it was done personally) is not really that way. It's really a derided psychology and the conditioning of society. For a fraction of a second, it shows that the brother of the main character is watching these sick videos online. Why? My interpretation is that it has to be proved that it is easier for all of us to face this cruelty that we are exposed to be mechanical in our occupations than to see people as human beings. As far as the logic scene is concerned, it is also addressed to the people who were in the state-mandated 1% intelligent classes and are confused and frustrated because life is not as predictable and mathematical and logical as it appears at the macroscopic level. You do not just have to apply Heisenberg's Blur Principle (along with all the other laws and principles of uncertainty) to physics, but you also have to leave it to life and space to change your plans and adapt along the way. One of the best movies I have ever seen. It could just go over your head; It's not for you, it's for the people who have trouble coping with life that does not work like a math problem. If you critically analyze a movie or write your critical reviews, do not read the back cover first (written by marketers and parapsychologists).
