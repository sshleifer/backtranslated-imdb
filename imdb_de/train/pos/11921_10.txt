This movie was one of the best Disney movies I have ever seen. great for the whole family. The ideas may be a bit far-fetched, but it's a feel-good comedy and the acting is great. I love the little boy. and the part of Academy Award winner Adrien Brody may have been very short, but very memorable. highly recommended.
