A must for every punk rocker. This is the film that made The Ramones a household name in the early '80s (when it first appeared on premium cable stations). This was one of the first and best of American punk rock movies, with the Rocky Horror Picture Show giving it a cult classic. Originally the producers wanted Cheap Trick as stars, but the release of the album "Live At Budakon" had just turned them into superstars and hot items to be in a low-budget movie. Good luck for the Ramones who wanted to break out of the underground punk rock world into the mainstream market (which unfortunately did not happen until after the end of the band). The band, especially Dee Dee, did not like the movie in the '80s, but the fans always loved it and could recite most of the movie while waiting for Ramone's shows. This film, like most classics, makes silly pleasure with classic Ramones material in its heyday. Do not expect any more, you will not find it. It's great fun, so enjoy it. Another classic by Allan Arkush in a similar way is Get Crazy with Lee Ving from the legendary hardcore punk band Fear.
