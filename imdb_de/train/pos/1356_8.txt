I started watching The Apprentice about 5 years ago (maybe 5) and I really liked it. The first thing that strikes you is the refreshing format, which is similar to many other reality shows but is still very entertaining. Donald Trump is wonderful as a presenter and main judge of the show. The cast-coup with smart, good-looking people chosen as participants is also appreciated. But the best part of the show is New York City. Mark Burnett may have done a lot of crap in his time, but his handling of cinematography is excellent as he makes NYC look like a character to himself. The jazz melodies combined with great camerawork make New York spectacular. <br /> <br /> The apprentice will easily always make my top 3 reality shows of all time (The Amazing Race is No. 1). But just like the fantastic race, this show is always viewed in moderation. If you look at it for a while, the originality of the show will quickly subside (the same as TAR). Star World, the broadcasters in this country, did a good job of presenting the show. The first three seasons were shown in a row, after two years, the next two seasons were shown, which kept the concept fresh. <br /> <br /> Finally you will love this show, especially the first two seasons. However, if you watch the show all the time, the charm will gradually decrease.
