Not really a big box office, but I was positively surprised with this movie. James "I did some things to Farrah Fawcett" Orr <br /> <br /> wrote and directed this movie about a common average man named Larry Burrows who believes his life would have been <br /> <br /> Unbelievably different when he met a homerun in a baseball baseball game at the age of fifteen. <br /> <br /> when he was 15. But thanks to the mysterious and magical bartender Mike Larry gets his wish, but soon realizes that his new life is not exactly what he hoped. <br /> <br /> I have to say, this movie really impressed me. Critics have mixed <br /> <br />, and I have to say the concept is really interesting and <br /> <br /> well done. Yeah, it's a bit standard, but it packs enough <br /> <br /> funny moments, drama, and outstanding acting to do it really well. James Belushi (I think) was worthy of Oscar for his role. Jon <br /> <br /> Lovitz is perfect, and Linda Hamilton and Renee Russo shine in <br /> <br /> roles. Michael Caine is perfect as a bartender. It's just a good movie with a good lesson. If you've never seen it, I strongly recommend that you check it
