First of all, remember that this movie is almost fifty years old! Still, it's still one of the greatest movies of all time. I wonder how many of today's disposable celluloid productions will be talked about in 2050? <br /> <br /> The story is simple but sound enough and the impact is phenomenal for the day. I can still remember the first time I saw it as a kid, when the monster invaded the forcefield protecting the ship and you could see its outlines for the first (and only) time. If I was shaking with fear, I can tell you. Looks dated today, but is still more than effective enough. <br /> <br /> The scenes with the tiger now show their age. You can see the outlines where the tiger was matted with Altaira into the settings, but they are only visible. <br /> <br /> Likewise, the effect that the creature melts through the Krell Doors is made wonderful. It's also amazing Leslie Nielsen (better for the Airplane and Naked Gun films) than young, but still mature man to see. He was 30 when this movie came out! Almost 80 now! <br /> <br /> All in all, a good movie that will surely be a favorite in the years to come. Timeless.
