This movie was excellent, a bit scary, but excellent at that. For those of you who have heard of Columbin and know the story, get an idea of ​​what and why these kids did, what they did. In the back of your mind, you know people think of this stuff, but you never know how bad it is, and this movie makes you realize. It's really that good. It also makes you think twice before making fun of someone who is safe. I read a book about the massacre in Colombia and it made me think. This movie worries me and scares me to death. One downside is that you can kill someone for serial killers. I received a threat recently, and I blew it away when I did not think about it, but after this movie you should take everything seriously. Some people are crazy and you never really know what they are, so take it seriously and do not underestimate anyone.
