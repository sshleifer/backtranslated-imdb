World At War is perhaps the largest documentary series of all time. Historical research is virtually flawless. Even after a quarter of a century, it is the most accurate and definitive documentary about World War II. An invaluable historical work that includes interviews with some of the most important and intriguing characters of the war. I highly recommend it as a learning experience.
