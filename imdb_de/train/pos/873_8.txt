I saw that this movie did not expect much and did not know anything about it. I loved it. A very good, tight action, a fascinating catch in the form of the ugly, fat, deaf girl and ex-con, and a tempo that kept things flowing without hurrying. <br /> <br /> A much, much better movie than De Batre mon coeur s'est arret√© of the same director, who was boring and unbelievable. <br /> <br /> The only thing that did not work out The supposedly ugly, fat girl was neither ugly nor fat: firm, safe and far away from conventional beauty, but with so much character in her face that she was the canvas always took over when she was on it. Outstanding. I wish she was in more movies and better than she normally is. I saw a bit of Gilles' wife and a bit of The Mustache, and they both looked like rubbish, and I saw everything about De battre mon coeur s'est arrete, and that's definitely garbage. She seems to have a few, so I'll keep my fingers crossed.
