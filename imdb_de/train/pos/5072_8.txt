Pierce Brosnan is probably the only one known in Richard Attenborough's new biopic. The rest is new to the international audience: Canadian history and First Nations culture. <br /> <br /> "Gray Owl" is an easy exploration of the way a man was taken into the Ojibway in northern Ontario decades ago, it became politically correct to do so. The film contains a love story, a moral message and a man tortured by his past. However, this torture is not always brought to life with the dramatic effects. Nonetheless, it is a movie that holds its audience without any violence. It gives deep respect to the Canadian First Nations and presents them in a dignified and non-stereotypical way. Brosnan's performance is somewhat stiff, but I suspect Lord Attenborough wanted that from him. <br /> <br /> Thank you from a proud Canadian.
