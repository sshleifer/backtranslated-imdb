While the main story is set to take place in Morocco, this film was shot in foggy Romania in 18 days on a very tight budget. As broken as their cards may be, the actors and the crew play them with remarkable skill and commitment, so I ended up finding the result both touching and graceful. Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau offers an excellent performance as a villain. The script and instructions provide some jewels. However, whether you like the movie or not will probably depend on your attitude towards Alexandra Staden in the title role. Other critics have called Stadens inadequacies as Modesty Blaise. They may have a point, but I found their interpretation appealing and very fitting. Modesty manages to overcome terrible adversity through discipline, innate talents and courage. Staden seems to do the same here.
