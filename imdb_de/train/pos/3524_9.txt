For the attention of Chuck Davis and Emefy: I saw PHANTOM LADY many years ago when I was not yet a jazz fan. The MUSEE DU QUAI BRANLY exhibition in Paris called LE SIECLE DU JAZZ, which will take place until the end of June, can not be ignored. NINE Excerpts from jazz films, including the famous drum sequence by PHANTOM LADY, are a special treat. I've seen Gene Krupa - and Elisha Cook Jr - on almost all of her movie appearances, and I can confirm the following: 1. Elisha Cook Jr was DUBBED in the movie. This was an improvement as he was KILLED in most of his other appearances (mainly in Howard Hawks 'THE BIG SLEEP'). 2. Krupa was probably called Cook in PL. I recognized his style, having already completed (and abused) Tom Tom studies (and abused) at the beginning of his career - at the Hollywood hotels SING, SING, SING 1937 - and finally got everything that was possible to call it French "la caisse claire". 3. The sequence from PL, at least as shown in the museum, is not censored. Harry Carasso, Paris, France
