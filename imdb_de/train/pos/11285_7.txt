Like Tarzan, the ape-man (1932), only more so. There's more of everything, more animals, more diversified African tribes, and scenes in which the thought must be that if this was good with three or four lions, forty would be better. Tarzan wrestles with crocodiles - the crocodile machine turns around in the water like a rolling pin and the pine clap. Tarzan can kill it with his omnipresent knife if the damned dinosaur would stand still. Tarzan kills lions and rhinos and more and more animals. His friends are real chimpanzees, people wearing bigger monkey costumes, and elephants. In fact, they use Indian elephants - far more friendly and trainable than African - with costume ears on their heads. Human History: Another white man, worse than the rest, appears to meet Holt to follow the ivory from the Elephant Cemetery. Tarzan will not show them the way, so the villain shoots an elephant so he can follow him to his deathbed. Tarzan intervenes and the villain shoots him - but of course he survives and returns to rescue Jane. Everyone else dies, Holt and the evil and every one of their "boys". People are expendable, especially Africans, and there does not seem to be much difference between the black men who die because they work for the white men who travel through the taboo land and the black men who kill them. This must be the last Tarzan movie before Jane wore more clothes after the Hays code. There are a number of underwater scenes in which Jane floats naked, and though the light flickers, the movement and insights are very appealing. Apparently one of Weismuller's friends from the Olympic swimming team made the nude scenes, not Maureen O'Sullivan. However, she runs through the film and wears the same type of loincloth that Weism√ºller wears (plus a bikini top), and shows a magnificent view of thighs and hips. You still do not have much to talk about. They sleep together and hang around with cool animals and stay away from cities. No wonder they are happy.
