I saw this movie for the first time when he was drunk in a motel in Canada. Leafing through channels, the Easy Lube section came open. My friend continued to freak, but I told him to go back. Something about the name easy lube just did not sound right. I saw the rest of the movie, it was damn funny. He wrote down a few names from the credits and came home to check. It turned out to be the first movie by Chevy Chase. I could not remember him. I did not remember much, so I rented it and gave it a second look. It's pretty funny and pretty graphic. It's like Kentucky Fried Movie, just not so funny. I love the fingers, easy lubricant, and I am the President of the Presidency. Dealer's sketch is also pretty cool. I give 6.5 or 7 out of 10 points
