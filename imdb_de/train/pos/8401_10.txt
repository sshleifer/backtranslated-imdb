Love Trap is a must see independent movie. As I sat down to watch the movie, I came in with low expectations, but left with a blessing. The story is poetic, factual and creative. The author draws you farther and farther into each scene so that you can relate to the realistic characters that everyone can identify with. The movie allowed me to think about my life and my love. The film showed what love really is, action not emotion. I was also impressed with the quality of the film's cinematography and soundtrack. The entire presentation exceeded my expectations. I give the film two big thumbs and recommend it to all ages and backgrounds.
