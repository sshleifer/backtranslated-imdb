I can honestly say, I never thought that this movie is good. I do not like family movies. I'm not a fan of Shahid Kapoor. The director's last movie (MPKDH was completely stupid) and the music was boring and boring, but there was Amrita Rao, who became my favorite after Main Hoon Na, and also Seema Biswas, Alok Nath and Anupam Kher who were very much I love the talent, so a few pluses. <br /> <br /> I finally saw the movie and was very impressed: It brings the young MPK lovers with a pinch of HAHK wedding, and we have a winner The plot The story is similar to that of HAHK, in the beginning to a serious mode with a light heart.The director also made a character to identify with.What I did not like about HAHK was that the characters were too eccentric to perfection.Shahid Kapoor surprised me with a good performance, which is an important improvement, and most of all, he fits in. The best part is easily Amrita Rao, which is indeed her best performance, so her screen presence is so electrifying end will love their performance. Sameer Soni, Amrutha Prakash, An upam Kher, Alok Nath and Seema Biswas are terribly busy. Not a single actor feels out of place. <br /> <br /> The songs were pretty disappointing, but they will sound better after watching. Mujhe Haq Hai and Do Anjaane Ajnabi are beautiful ballads. Milan Abhi Aada Adhura Hai looks good too. The songs are not colorful and dancing and they are more like ballads. The exception is Hamari Shaadi Mein, which reminds you of HSSH and HAHK. So what was the mistake in the movie? The movie gets pretty slow and the end is pretty stretched. But the movie is still running at a good pace, making it a perfect family movie.
