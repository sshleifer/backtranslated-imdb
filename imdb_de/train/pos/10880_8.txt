A fun somewhere. An enjoyable, well-built place. <br /> <br /> You do not have to say "do not take it seriously" or "it's that bad" or "it was not scary". None of these comments is relevant. <br /> <br /> Cut has atmosphere. It is this atmosphere, which is actually very unique, and the really original aspect of the film that is personally the film to me.
