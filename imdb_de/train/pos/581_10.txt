A River Flows Through It's one of those movies that deserves to be seen in the theater so that the majesty of their cinematography can really be appreciated. The spectacle is wonderful and unobtrusive, with every gesture and every smile and nod that carry meaning. Brad Pitt offers a radiant performance and Tom Skerrit is powerful as a preacher father. The movie moves like a river, you have to be ready to follow it by ebb and flow, but it's worth it in the end.
