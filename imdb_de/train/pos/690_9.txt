I had no idea what this movie was about, or did not know it existed until I stumbled about a month ago, looking for other films staring at Dominic Monaghan. I thought that this movie was a strange insight into the mind of a no-sleeper and what he / she could go through in the hours when they are awake when the rest of the world sleeps around them, it was an interesting movie and a movie Good match was played by Dom ....... I think although you can not buy this movie anywhere (well, I have not seen it anywhere), you have to see it, if you ever get the chance, because it really does Think about the people around us who can not sleep and have to suffer night after night because they did not sleep or only got about 1 hour of sleep every night, so overall it was an interesting movie with good substance.
