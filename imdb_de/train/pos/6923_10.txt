CONTAINS SPOILER With the possible exception of John Wayne, no other actor in Westerns sat in the saddle than James Stewart, and this movie proves it. This great revenge story about a Winchester rifle has only one weak point to think about: the casting of Will Geer as a very unlike Wyatt Earp. The casting of the bad guys was good: Stephen McNally, as gloomy Dutch Henry, Dan Duryea as Waco Johnny Dean and John McIntire (versatile in good and evil) as a smooth cannon runner. The showdown between Stewart and McNally on the cliffs is great! I would stack this Western for all the western crop that was made today. They would not stand a chance!
