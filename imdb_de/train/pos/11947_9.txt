Just fine writing, directing and acting ... Woody's best of the 2000s, if not his best since the 80s !! Hugh Jackman was the perfect choice for his role. Scarlett Johansson's joke with Woody proves how well an actress became round who she has become. <br /> <br /> It's refreshing not to see a romance on screen with the leading actress. He plays the perfect hummeligen magician. <br /> <br /> There are a few reviews that have spoiled this movie. Do not let that stop you from seeing the wonderfully made movie. The people in the crowd with whom I saw this laughed so loud at some lines that I missed the next line. If you like 70's Woody Allen movies, you'll regret missing this movie. <br /> <br /> I suggest you watch this movie with an open mind.
