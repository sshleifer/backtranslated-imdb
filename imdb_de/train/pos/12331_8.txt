As someone who places Night of the Living Dead third in the top five most popular films of all time and at the same time loves this student movie parody, I feel I must defend this film against the previously published scathing reviews. This short but sweet opus has always been a crowd pleaser in horror and science fiction film marathons, where those present have a preference for the genre and do not take zombie films too seriously. This film is a tribute to the original, not an insult. It's supposed to be funny, and many others I've heard chanting for, and I agree that it's successful. Especially for those of us who have seen NOTLD 50+ times. Watch the director's cameo as news reporter Jeff Drexel and also, if you have the opportunity, to catch his alien spoof Loaf.
