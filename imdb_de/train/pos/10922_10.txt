When I was very young, they were showing kung fu movies of all kinds on a local TV station. I saw a lot of kung fu movies on Saturdays. I remember many of them. I've seen great movies like Crippled Masters or Blind Fist by Bruce, Kung Fu Zombie, Shaolin Drunken Monk, Master's Rage, Tattoe Dragon and ... Five Deadly Venoms. I still remember the day. My dad and I had just had lunch at Burger King. See what a movie this Saturday would be like. We ran into the house and jumped on the couch, turned on the unit and flicked it to 56. The usual intro of many kung fu movie clips in the background with the words Kung Fu Saturday over Under this was the title of the movie. He said, Five Deadly Venoms. Then the movie started. I bit into my burger amused with the pre-credit sequence. I loved this movie the minute it came. My favorite character was the Toad Venom. The plot was hard to track at this age, but that did not lure me ... it was fighting. The fights were so ... startling I groaned every time a commercial appeared and soon ended the 2 hours of the best movie I've ever seen.
