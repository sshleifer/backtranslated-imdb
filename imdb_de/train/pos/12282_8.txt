At first I did not like it that much, although I did. The third Trueba generation was not one of them, the love between Blanca and Pedro could not be explained well, and some actors were too different from what I had imagined. Later I realized that this would have been the film more faithful to the book, it would have taken five hours and would be pretty boring. Now I like it very much, because my favorite characters are there when I portray them. Clara really looks like an angel in live, and her introduction to the story at the beginning of the film was fantastic, loyal and short. Glenn Close is Ferula. I just imagined them like that, just not in sorrow for the whole thing. Esteban is enough to find. I never really liked his character and although I was interested in him, I hated him very much, especially when he met Clara. As in the book, the last part is the most exciting part, and he has a real story there as well. <br /> <br /> The movie is really good, especially considering it's a gringo movie based on a Latin American movie book. It's amazing how many famous stars there are, do not you think?
