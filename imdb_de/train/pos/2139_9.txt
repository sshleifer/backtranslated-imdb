I approached this film with low expectations, but was very pleasantly surprised. It is very well done and surpasses the dance films of recent years, especially "Strictly Ballroom". While the music is beautiful and the dancing is colorful, the film does not revolve around dancing. It is a very Japanese facility that gives male office workers long walks to work and leisure after work for entertainment that does not involve their families. Here we have the man with the whole family and the big mortgage and dizzying joie de vivre. He attracts the attractive image of a young woman in a dance studio, which he goes through on his way. This leads him to try the ballroom dance. Japanese is also the fact that the hot motives that triggered his new passion, made clear, but at least ultimately accepted by the family and the public. The ballroom approach, as conveyed in the film, is definitely not Western, although discipline and music are clearly cultural imports to Japan. The cultural opposites are therefore fascinating. Even without the cultural insights, color, dance and enthusiasm of the players, this makes a fun movie.
