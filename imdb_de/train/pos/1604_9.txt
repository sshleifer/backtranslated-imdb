I am really surprised that the movie did not get a higher rating in IMDB. It's one of those movies that could easily be found by someone, but for the romantic comedy "Moonstruck" is really in a class of its own. It is the environment and the ethnic charm that people take for granted. Alone the casting makes it a nearly perfect movie. In the 80s, only a few films were as good as "Moonstruck" and it is also funny. **** out *****
