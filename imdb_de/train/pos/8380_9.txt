Now I have always been a fan of Full Moon's puppetry. But I have to say that Robot Jox is one of the better projects. Yes, you heard me. The story works wonderfully, the atmosphere really works and the actors do a first class job. Gary Graham, who takes his mark on TV in shows such as ALIEN NATION THE SERIES and STAR TREK ENTERPRISE, shows he can be an action star kicking his ass and making a name for himself. The stop-motion effects could have been a bit better. The color was wrong, they look plastic to me, rather than the metal they should accept. But that's a minor complaint compared to the whole Robot Jox. If you like Gary Graham or other Full Moon movies then you will like this movie. 9 STARS OF 10.
