I was not sure what to expect from this movie. I love Brosnan in every movie, he's always good, but that was totally different. He is a mess and plays very well. In fact, he has already reminded me of me a few times. So yes, there is not much violence, there is not much action, but the dialogue is cracking, the acting is great and very refreshing and pretty funny I do not think you're from the movies and "wow! I was blown away" go, but you come out smiling, after you've enjoyed a good movie. Can not ask for more. <br /> <br /> Oh, and if you're lucky, some idiot will put the ad in the wrong way, and you'll be reversed, upside down, vice versa (with reverse sound reproduction)) Advertising !! Brilliant. There is nothing better than an advertisement by Jack Daniels, with the drink returning from the glass to the bottle, with a grumpy, American "Twin Peaks" comment :)
