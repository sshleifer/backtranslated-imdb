This is a great movie you can see with your girlfriend. My boyfriend and I love the dance and came across this movie in the video store. We had to get it. Without violence and such a warming history, it is a great movie where you can relax and enjoy the night. I would recommend this movie to any family or just a bunch of girls looking for a cute movie.
