Why on earth should you explore the fascinating nature documentary "Earth"? How much time do you have on earth for me to explain this to you? OK, I will not extend my survey on Earth to infinity, but I have to argue why this is a must. The documentary takes a nature walk on the trails of three animal families: a polar bear and her boy with the true side swing of the father manage to search for food on his isolated path, a whale mum with her baby whale taking a hike because of its prey, and an elephant mom with her little (maybe not so small, they are elephants) offspring wandering in Africa. The directors Alastair Forthegill & Mark Linfield have done "alien" work and captured not only the magnetic shots of our three protagonists, but also the survival skills of many other species. The cinematographic team of Richard Brooks Burton, Mike Holding, Adam Ravetch, and Andrew Shillabeer were on Camera's front to photograph the wondrous natural and instinctive behavior of the animals. not to mention, the slo-mo animal drop shots were different. "Earth" is also a lesson for the global warming of animals. The daddy polar bear in the doc is the figurehead boy to this episode. So, other Earthman, it's time to visit the documentary today to visit "Earth"! **** Well
