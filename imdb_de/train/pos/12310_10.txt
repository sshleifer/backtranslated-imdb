Just read the original story written by Pu in the 18th century. It is noteworthy that the film rejects the original spirit very well, although the plot has been changed enormously. The cinematic language, the rhythm and the special effect all come from Hollywood, but there is still a Chinese core. It is amazing how Hark Tsui has managed to combine them. The result is pure beauty.
