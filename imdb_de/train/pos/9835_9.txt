Let me just say that I'm a big fan of zombies, so I do not say such statements easily. Secondly, I would say that this is an Italian zombie movie, and Fulci directed only 15 minutes before being handed over to Bruno (Rats, Night of Terror), to Mattei. This is not a Dawn of the Dead people. <br /> <br /> That said, this is easily one of the most entertaining zombie movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The script is wonderfully awful. Look at the two scientists who are trying to find an antidote ("Let's try putting these two molecules together"). <br /> <br /> The zombies are available in all variations. From groaning shufflers to machetes with madness and birds! <br /> <br /> The Gore is plentiful. The legs are bitten off, the arms are amputated, the stomach springs open. <br /> <br /> The pace is fast and flies from one zombie attack to the next. <br /> <br /> Then the head is in the fridge. Oh the head in the fridge! One of the biggest moments of horror since Ash took his hand in Evil Dead 2. Get some friends and a beer and you will spend a fun night. <br /> <br /> Did I mention my head in the fridge?!?!?
