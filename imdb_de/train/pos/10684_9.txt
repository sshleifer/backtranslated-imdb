Looking back at this early DeMille work, I was once again reassured that early DeMille is far superior to late DeMille. Noteworthy is his attention to the use of light in scenes. His pace is very good, so much to say within an hour. It's a pity he was not as intuitive with the style of his later feature films as he was in his silent movies. <br /> <br /> This was the first movie I saw Cleo Ridgely in. It was remarkable, rather reserved, and yet offered a wide range of emotions. <br /> <br /> The end is wonderful.
