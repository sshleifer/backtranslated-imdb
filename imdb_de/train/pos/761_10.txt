I just want to say that among all the so-called classic hip-hop movies I've seen, like Wild Style, KrushGroove, Breakin ', Style Wars etc ... IMO BEAT STREET is the best among the others. Whenever I ask other people about their favorite, it seems that BEAT STREET jumps out the most. But it is still the lowest of them all. 4.3 is just a beat "under the belt" (If about 5 points is the belt). I love the music performances, the breakdance makes me spin, RAMO lets me throw a piece ... come on, it's a classic !!!
