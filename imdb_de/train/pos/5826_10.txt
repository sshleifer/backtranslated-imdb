I remember when I saw this short for the first time, I really laughed so hard that like many other movies I've seen, no sound came out! Curly is really great at "singing" the opera in this one. I am surprised that he did not consider a career as a professional singer because he was really good! <br /> <br /> If you noticed that this was filmed as Stooge at the end of Curly's career, you really realized that he had changed because he had lost weight and was thinner, his voice deepened, his face he was covered in wrinkles, though he could still pull it through, he looked as if he were fifty, at the age of forty. This was because he suffered a lot of small punches before his big punch, which ended his career. He still managed to make it in his last! <br /> <br /> If you do not mind that Curly got really sick at this point, this is one of her funniest shorts. I know I did not mind that Curly really changed because I still thought he was great! <br /> <br /> 10/10
