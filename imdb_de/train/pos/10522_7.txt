This is a good adaptation of Austen's novel. Good, but not brilliant. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is imaginative and at times goes beyond the bounds of gimmicks, but it certainly avoids the trap of looking like a boring television soap in costumes, when looking at the whole story is dialogue-driven. <br /> <br /> Trading is competent. Ms. Paltrow is aloof as her character demands, but the required distance to the other characters is accompanied by a much less appropriate distance to her own actions. In other words, she does not seem to care enough about the results of her match-making efforts. Some of the supporting performers are guilty of overblown acting - much in the style that is appreciated on stage, but inappropriate in movie images. Personally, I've had problems accepting Alan Cumming as Mr. Elton - by no fault of his own, except that in "The High Life" I left the impression of a gay trolley dolly that it's now hard to take him seriously. The acting award goes to Toni Collette, who radiates warmth, and Jeremy Northam, who takes his character to the right level.
