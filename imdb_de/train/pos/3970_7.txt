This is a movie that seems to be all about J. Edgar Hoover slapping himself on the back to fight Klansmen, persecuting Indian murderers, chasing the famous 1930s gangsters, and Nazis in the US and in the South to fight America during World War II and commies in New York in the early fifties. Of course, in 1959, we did not know that Mr. Hoover was obsessed with keeping secret records of honest Americans and people like Rev. Martin Luther King jr. To hear, but worst of all, his secret love affair with Deputy Director Clyde Tolson (If you'd like to know more about this topic, I suggest seeing the movie Citizen Cohn.) Hoover aside: This story of a life in the FBI, like her Jimmy Stewart tells a decent but dated film, Vera Miles as his devoted wife is also good, but Jimmy is the film, as much as Hoover controlled the production and made sure the FBI was seen without error, Jimmy Stewart said It's a humane side of the movie, quite a feat, considering Hoover has always looked over his shoulder, and the background note is also pleasing, as I've recently read online articles that say this is a forgotten movie, Jimmy Stewart was one of the greatest movie stars of all time, and none of his films should be forgotten, TCM was the last network that showed it a long time ago and I hope they show it again.
