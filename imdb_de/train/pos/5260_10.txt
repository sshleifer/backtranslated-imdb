Yeah, maybe it's stupid and may not seem as funny as many high budget comedies, but this movie is really weird if you really look at it. Tim Meadows has always felt strange about the Saturday Night Live Show. Whenever he would make that character on the show, I had to start laughing. After seeing that this was going to happen one evening on Comedy Central, I decided to give it a try. All in all, I was very impressed with this movie because it was not supposed to win an Oscar or become a comedy of the year, but it did entertain the Saturday Night Live fans who love the Ladies Man character. This film also contains some highly quoted lines that can be recited over years.
