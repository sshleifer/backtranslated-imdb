In the panic in the streets, Richard Widmark plays a US doctor who rudely interrupted his week with a plague-containing corpse. As police officer Paul Douglas correctly points out, the guy died from two bullets in his chest. This is not the problem here, the two become reluctant partners to find the killers and all the other people exposed to the disease. <br /> <br /> As has been pointed out by a number of people, for some reason, director, Elia Kazan has not bothered to throw the small pieces with someone who sounds like they're from Louisiana , I was in New Orleans where the story takes place, which I personally attest. Richard Widmark and his wife Barbara Bel Geddes can be excused because he could serve as a Navy doctor there, but it does not work for the natives. <br /> <br /> But with the plague out there and the news The New Orleans PD gets confused by the underworld of the city. The dead man came from a ship from Europe and had connections to the underworld. A New Orleans-wise guy, played by Jack Palance, jumps to a whole raft of false conclusions and begins bothering a cousin of the dead who begins to show epileptic symptoms. Palance received rave reviews in the first film in which he received a message. <br /> <br /> Personally, my favorite in this movie is Zero Mostel. This happened just before Mostel was blacklisted and at that time he made a specialty of playing, tough guys that are really toadies. He plays the same role in the Humphrey Bogart movie The Enforcer. Unfortunately, in this last scene of persecution, I identify with Mostel, in which he and Palance are persecuted by Widmark, Douglas, and half of the New Orleans Police. Seeing how hard Zero could keep up with Palance was something else because I'm now in the league of Zero in the League for Forces. <br /> <br /> Kazan kept the action on a good clip, there is very little downtime in this movie. If there were less, it would be an Indiana Jones movie. Panic In The Streets won an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay this year. <br /> <br /> Kazan also took advantage of the New Orleans Waterfront and the French Quarter. Some of the same footage will be used later in On the Waterfront. In fact, Panic In The Streets is about people not squeaking when they really want to be in their own interest. Again very similar to On the Waterfront. <br /> <br /> Panic In The Streets makes everyone proud of who they are. Why could not Elia Kazan find decent New Orleans people in the small roles?
