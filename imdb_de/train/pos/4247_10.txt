THE GIRL OF MISSOURI arrives in New York City and knows exactly what she wants: to achieve something solid by marrying a millionaire - without losing her virginity. With her distinctive look she quickly looks up to the eyes of the Playboy son of a tycoon, but if she stays true to her virtue, will she discover true love as well? Jean Harlow sizzles in this excellent little comedy. She is dazzling with her platinum hair and her gorgeous outfits. However, her beauty should not hide the fact that she was also a very good actress. She has rightly earned her place at the top of the Hollywood Pantheon. <br /> <br /> An excellent cast gives Harlow good support: Lionel Barrymore as a smart old tycoon, wise Harlow's way; handsome Franchot Tone as his son, in love with love; the rough Patsy Kelly stealing her scenes as Harlow's buddy; debonair Alan Mowbray as a well-bred English Lord; the elder Clara Blandick as notorious secretary of Barrymore; heartfelt Hale Hamilton as a rich man with an eye for the ladies; muscular Nat Pendleton as a lifeguard catching Kelly's coquettish look; and Lewis Stone, memorable in a small role as a bankrupt businessman. <br /> <br /> It should be noted that this movie was produced shortly after the introduction of Hollywood's Production Code. A comparison with RED-HEADED WOMAN made two years ago would be intriguing - Harlow's character is about the same goals, but very different means are used.
