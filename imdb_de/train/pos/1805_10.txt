I just saw this movie, I saw it for the first time at the age of 7 and I remembered the end. So I looked at it 10 minutes ago, and (I can look like a baby since I am 12 ha-ha) I started crying in the end, I forgot how sad it was. I think I was mainly sad for Anne-Marie because she said, "I love you, Charlie" and also, "I'll miss you, Charlie," really made me cry, ha-ha. It has to be one of my favorite movies of all time, it's just a movie worth seeing. WATCH IT ha-ha, that's all I can say XD <br /> <br /> but I love this movie, it's a real classic. <br /> <br /> xx Maverick xx 10/10
