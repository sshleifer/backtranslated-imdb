I've never been very big with IMAX movies. They're cool, but once you've gotten over the first onslaught of "Whoa," it feels like you're flying! The films themselves are usually pretty cheesy and ordinary. <br /> <br /> The exceptions were the mighty Everest, the thrilling Wild California and now the BBC's The Human Body, an oversized view of the insides of our bodies. <br /> <br /> Our bodies are machines with a complexity that is simply unthinkable. This 50-minute movie could be 10 hours long and still would not get to all systems working in tandem, just as I write this review and listen to my radio. Most of us take that for granted. <br /> <br /> Here you can see the inside of a heart (looks like an alien spaceship), the inside of your lungs, the tiny hairs in your eardrum, the sounds processing, the development of a baby in a mother's womb and Surprisingly, a few of the ... um, less attractive features that I thought would scare you off (pimples, the mess of acids in your stomach ...). <br /> <br /> This movie also has a pretty funny style that sets it apart from other IMAX documentaries. For example, we've all seen sperm find their way to the egg, but have you ever seen Marvin Gaye's "Let's Get It On" adjust? These are creative moments in which "The Human Body" is not only a health lesson, but also fun.
