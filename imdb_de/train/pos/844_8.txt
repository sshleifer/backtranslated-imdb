A chance encounter between a salesman and a batsman changes their lives. This is a weird film that works, an impressive effort for director Shepard. In a daring role far removed from James Bond, Brosnan is surprisingly effective as the lone killer who begins to bend under the stress of his job but is unable to emotionally connect with anyone to join him help. Kinnear is as good as the salesman, a decent guy with a void in his life. Davis is doing well as Kinnear's flirting wife. Mainly a character study, the movie is rewarding because it feels fresh and unpredictable, an extremely dark comedy.
