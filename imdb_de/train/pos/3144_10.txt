This is one of the better comedies ever seen on television. The first season was funny, like most of the following seasons. The only reason I give this show a 9/10 is because of the unfortunate last season. The only good part of last season was the final. My favorite part of this show was the scenes that fit people's ideas and often portray the characters in famous 70's TV shows or movies. It's a rare show that I liked every character (except the last season ... too late to develop a new character, and Fez was not nearly as funny). Red's foot in her ass comments never got old and Kelso's stupidity was not. Bravo to fox, because he has held such a good show for so long, too long even.
