The cast really helps make this a pleasant surprise, and is beyond the normal man-versus-woman dispute of the all-time-but-wind-up-in-love of Hollywood screwball romance / comedy. <br /> I do not usually go for these kind of movies and this boring act, but it was refreshing, funny to look at and exudes charm. <br /> <br /> Jimmy Stewart and Margaret Sullavan are both good on each other and make a very nice couple. The side cast is outstanding - from the always sympathetic Felix Bressart to the villain Joseph Schildkraut. <br /> <br /> Frank Morgan also plays one of the most interesting characters I've ever seen in his career. He takes the movie and turns it into a different mood for a while, when something dramatic happens to him. This "twist" is another reason why this movie rises above others of its kind. <br /> <br /> If a movie has a good mix of categories, it usually succeeds. This is a great example of this. In this movie it's romance, comedy and drama and it's well done. I take this every day in the new edition of "You Have Got Mail". No comparison.
