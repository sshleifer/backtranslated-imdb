In my opinion, this is a pretty good celebrity sketch show. I enjoyed seeing Greg Kinnear as the host. There are many reasons why I said that. Although Hal Sparks was a good host, sometimes I wished Greg Kinnear had not left. If you ask me, it seems like nobody is left with a TV show throughout the run. Still, I enjoyed watching the different hosts and other celebrities fake it. If you ask me, that was damn funny. Before I summarize that, I have to say that I somehow miss this show. Finally, I recommend this show to all fans of die-hard sketch shows. You will really enjoy it.
