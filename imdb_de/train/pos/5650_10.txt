"Someone at the door". OHHH how much I miss this show ... but we're fortunate to have "Invasion" now. Thank you, Shawn Cassidy. American Gothic, had everything. If I had to pick one thing that I liked the most on the show, then it has to be their "unpredictable plotlines". Favorite actor was Lucas Black .. I love this southern accent. I bought the DVD as soon as possible and my kids are also fans. There are some hot and steamy scenes. Some diabolical too. So if kiddos are on display, you may want to edit (fast forward / skip). It has humor, on a level of Joss Wheedon, who lacks so many shows. Adult joke and adult situation treated with fine effects. The DVD has some extras, but I wish she had a lot more. If you want to be thrilled and enjoy a great show, look at "American Gothic"!
