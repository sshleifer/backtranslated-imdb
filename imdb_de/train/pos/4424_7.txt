As incredible as it may be, Gojoe is an anime and Hong Kong inspired samurai action film with a pacifist message. This ankle of the movie is effectively portrayed by the protagonist (a great acting work by Daisuke Ryu), a murderer who has become the Boddhist monk Benkei. Benkei has vowed never to kill again, but he still holds the sword to fight what he considers a demon invasion. The visual images are amazingly beautiful and artistic, but it requires too many tricks (rotating camera and high-speed drives, expressionistic shots, vacuumed colors, digital effects, etc.). The beginning and the end of the film, however, are both elegant and powerful. If only director Sogo Ishii had been smart enough not to overstrain his bag of tricks. <br /> <br /> Another problem with Gojoe is the amount of violence. For a movie with such a non-violent message, Gojoe wastes too much energy and screen time to depict the endless battle scenes. Also, the way violence is presented is always on the verge of selfishness; In fact, a blood shower against the night sky seems to be one of the movie's signature images. Fortunately, Ishii is smart enough to show the ugly, tragic side of violence. Still, it seems that Ishii is not sure if he is making a traditional action film or a deeply moral allegory. The audience can not be sure until the end of the movie. The mighty (albeit cynical) end saves Gojoe; It becomes clear that this film is more than just a party.
