Without a doubt, Super Mario 64 is the best game ever developed. It's so addictive that you can play it for hours without taking a break. I've beaten the game four times, but I've never received all 120 stars ... (I've received 111), but I hope to reach them sometime. Although I did not officially play this game until I was seven, I enjoyed watching my sisters watch it. Now I'm 13 and I still play it, delete games and start all over again. <br /> <br /> The graphics are incredible for an early N64 game. The gameplay is addictive. The controls are great. The levels are tough, but not impossible. The Bowser bouts are challenging. <br /> <br /> I would like to tell you more, but why do not you just get it for yourself? Put away the X-BOX 360, PS3 and the Wii and find a Nintendo 64 and play this amazing, wonderful game.
