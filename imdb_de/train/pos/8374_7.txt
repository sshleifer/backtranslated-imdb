OK, this movie was cool. I do not think it was the best movie ever made, but it sure was fun. My brother and I still play scenes from time to time and occasionally pull the film out of the closet, blow off the dust and put it inside. Pleasant to the end. This is a movie that you have to forget critique together and just enjoy. Verdict is a victory for Robot Jox.
