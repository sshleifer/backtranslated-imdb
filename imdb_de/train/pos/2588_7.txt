Brothers with psychokinetic powers (yes, really) are not just dueling for Debra Winger's affection, but a mystery from their childhood that left them in a fight over their powers. <br /> <br /> There are surreal touches (the firefighters look like a singing Greek choir), but there is also humor and romance. The soundtrack is great, much like American Werewolf in London used every great wolf song they could get but with fire and I do not think I'll ever forget Dennis Quaid (mmmmm Dennis Quaid) making his own trailer one Rockin makes' to 'She's a lady' 'invaluable;) <br /> <br /> Best line is missing in quote section btw ~' Once you've had a clown, never go back! <br /> <br /> I love this movie (I ordered the DVD from the US) and if the comments written by people who are happier with Legally Blond 3 do not scare you, then give it a try out :)
