Robert De Niro, Cuba Gooding Jr., Hal Holbrook and all the other actors and actresses in "Men of Honor" have put together a beautiful movie. Mark Isham wrote the movie, so you know the music is really good too. <br /> <br /> But: After seeing a lot of fags, loopholes and overly dramatic heart-pattering from the beginning, I had to make a vow to ignore her and leaned back to enjoy the movie. If you can do that, it's really good. <br /> <br /> The story of Carl Brashear, a true-life hero, is inspirational enough to last a lifetime. Check the Internet ... The whole story is more amazing than the movie, as the director acknowledged in his comments. During World War II, there were only three African-American US Navy divers. None, however, achieved the status of a US Navy Master Diver. Carl Brashear was the first African American US Navy master diver. AND he was the first amputee ever to be certified or recertified as a US Navy diver. (Cheer). <br /> <br /> On the negative side of the Ledger book: Should I just name one of the many "loopholes"? Yes, I will tag this commentary as a "spoiler" and do so ... The early, pivotal scene where the helicopter hits the radio mast and sinks into the sea: they never had the time to fully equip themselves. Mark V-Diver, even if he were the legendary Master Chief Billy Sunday, in time to be just "... a few minutes late" and save the pilot. <br /> <br /> So for loopholes, fools and overdramatization, I've reduced "Men of Honor" from a perfect 10 to a 7. Will Hollywood NEVER realize that unalloyed truth is so much better than its over-dramatic approach to telling stories? I doubt that. Too bad!
