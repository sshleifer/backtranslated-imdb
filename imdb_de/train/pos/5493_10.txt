It's really rare that you get a glimpse of a media illusion that has been reported as official "truth" so far and has caught so many "news agencies" with their pants down. This film, in my opinion, deserves every award journalism has - it is objective (yes!), Brave and a real "shovel". It can do without commentary, simulate scenes or ask questions - anyone, including Chavez, can make a fool of himself with his own words. The filmmakers "only" had to follow the events and keep their cameras going. <br /> <br /> The Venezuelan elite teaches us "How to depose a president and sell him as a victory for democracy". It's amazing that they lost in the end - so far. To my knowledge, the largest television station has only withdrawn its terrestrial license, it still transmits over cable and satellite. I doubt strongly if George W. or Barack Obama would be so tolerant after a coup attempt. But you do not have to worry. <br /> <br /> The fact that the scam "Chavez supporters killed innocent civilians" was so voluntarily repeated around the world shows how biased the so-called "free" is (established) media have really just become more or always have been. An important lesson for those who are interested in what is really going on in the world. <br /> <br /> The famous challenge of "objectivity" occurs whenever journalists dare to oppose the mainstream viewpoint or uncover undesirable facts that accuse "us" - with the effects of the atomic bomb, The secret US history of spreading "democracy" around the world or the Iraq war, which according to John Hopkins has meanwhile not killed 1.3 million Iraquis, is true to mention the 60,000 Afghans (2003), who never mentioned were. To be objective, Saddam Hussein did less harm to his people than the US. And the US is willing and willing to do more harm to the Iranians than it was. <br /> <br /> I am quite curious about the upcoming lawsuit against some Khmer Rouge leaders before the International Tribunal in The Hague mentioning "our" commitment to supporting and training Pol Pot's guerrillas in the 80's these were largely defeated by the Vietnamese. Probably not. <br /> <br /> Reason enough to go for the balance to the independent media, if not fraud.
