Overall, the movie was pretty good, a good action plot with lots of explosions and battle scenes, but Chuck Norris has done very little to disarm the bomb and shoot a few characters. The film was very similar to the events of September 11th. A terrorist, who is like a container full of cargo, sent a video to the president (Urich) threatening to explode it. Judson Mills had some great action roles. He had defeated Rashid's compound and various kick-butt roles, but Chuck Norris was missing. Judson took over most of the action, leaving Joshua (Queu) with Que on her computer. But overall, it was realistic and not lacking in the action, only Mr. Norris. I gave the movie 7/10.
