How can the viewer rating for this movie be just 5.4 ?! Only the handsome young Alisan Porter should automatically start you with 6 when you set your rating. James Belushi is also good in this regard, his first good, serious role. I had not liked him until about this time in anything other than About Last Night. He was doing pretty well Related to Tupac. Kelly Lynch, you have to love her. Well, I do. I'm just wondering what happened to Miss Porter. <br /> <br /> I gave Curly Sue a 7
