Emma is a real romance. If you love the soppy stuff charged with wit and folly, you will love this movie! It's true for the novel, which is very important, with a few twists for pleasure. Gwen is not one of my favorite actresses, but she does justice to a role that demands everything she has to offer in spades. She shines in a role that I believe could not have been done by any other actress. <br /> <br /> Jeremy Northam as a hero. how shocked you are I have never considered him as obviously pretty, but the hell! What can the right role do for you? He looks as handsome as the reasonable, royal Mr. K., that I literally look at him in a new light. He makes an excellent romantic trail. The charm and character he brings to his role is wonderful! <br /> <br /> Ewan McGregor, Greta Sacchi brings the rest. a good cast A good movie. If you're a fan of Jane Austen, watch this movie with Pride and Prejudice - AND MOST IMPORTANT, buy the books. It raises the movie to extraordinary heights
