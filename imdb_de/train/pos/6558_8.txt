I disagree with the previous comment on this movie. I think it was cute and funny and it was a good message for young girls like my daughter. You do not have to dress like a cheap hooker to be cool. You can be both smart and pretty and stylish at the same time. <br /> <br /> I think the cast was good and the story was good for the target audience. All in all, my wife, my daughter (10) and I all found a good movie. I definitely recommend it. It also encouraged my daughter to read the original secrets of Nancy Drew, which she will surely love as much as I loved the Hardy Boys. <br /> <br /> It was a struggle to get her to sleep tonight because she was about to start reading. I can not imagine a better result for this film than to arouse interest in this classic series.
