Diamantino Costa is one of the best Portuguese directors alongside Fernando Fragata, João Mário Grilo, Abi Feijó, Leonel Vieira and other commercial directors. "O Lampião da Estrela" was his first movie (Diamantino Costa) before he made several successful commercials. This title is shown by one of the best Portuguese comedians of all time. Herman José and José Pedro Gomes are great. It is a very funny movie !! (28/07/2000) <br /> <br /> BOA SORT DIAMANTINO ...
