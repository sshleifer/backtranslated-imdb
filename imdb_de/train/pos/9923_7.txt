I have read several mixed reviews and some of them have literally thrown the movie in the bin. Originally, I was interested in this project because it was directed by Tony Scott, and I'm very interested in his work after Man On Fire affected me so deeply. Before I start my review, let me first say: It's wonderful to see that this film could have been told in a boring and ordinary way, but the authors and Scott opted for a different approach. <br /> <br /> Content: <br /> <br /> Simply put, it's not boring. Most Hollywood movies have "proven" actions that they know are in contact with people, which often ensures audience acceptance of the film and creates a higher probability of winning. This conspiracy was one of the more interesting I had seen for some time. For reference only, I have recently seen 'The Weather Man' and 'Lord of War' and although I want to say that these films are excellent, and I have both enjoyed them very much, both acts in these films are boring and they get it exactly said how you would expect them to be told something. You take no chances and they are extremely predictable after seeing a whole host of American films. Domino's plot is both interesting and told in a way that makes you think, "Oh man, they're screwed up now." And I think that was missing in many current films too short. In my opinion, it has a lot of depth and gives you many things that you should question when looking at it. All in all, I was so interested in the movie. <br /> <br /> Characters: <br /> <br /> I felt that the characters were correct. Knightley did a wonderful job of portraying a beautiful woman who was anything but inside and wanted to be considered what she was. It was obvious that she wanted to prove herself, and she took all the means to achieve that. Choco was also very credible, his handling of Spanish in inappropriate situations, his reaction to Domino's lack of affection, and his jealousy in the team ... they were all loyal to me, which made me feel that his character was far more realistic. <br /> <br /> Rourke's character was the least interesting to me, but it still rang for me. He seemed like an ordinary guy trying to make ends meet. I hope that's what the filmmakers wanted to achieve with him, because that's what I got out of it. He has done a very good job of showing Ed in a way in which he has made his mistakes. Still, he still tries to live. Claremont / Ladies: I believe they provided the much needed heart to the story. It was not just people who made money to buy a Bentley, but real people who had a real problem, and they were looking for others who wanted to achieve that goal. They could empathize with her because for them the child's illness was a problem that had no other solution. These characters should show real people who are less fortunate who have fallen into this mess because they needed help. <br /> <br /> The gangsters: They made the story seem sinister in a way that only the mob can do. And I really liked that part. They also filled in the story with subtleties that made the plot much more interesting. <br /> <br /> Christopher Walken / 90210 People: <br /> <br /> They gave the comic relief in an otherwise very serious movie. From Walken's clumsy remarks to the incessant clues to the 90210 guys who behaved. Their involvement in the movie just made it much more enjoyable. <br /> <br /> Cinematography .... yes .... the cinematography. Here, this film seems to have lost many potential fans. But in my opinion, I thought it was brilliant, the use of the camera to implement the current situation was in my opinion extremely effective. I thought it was a method that was properly realized, but which, like everything else, could use improvements. I greet and congratulate Scott, the editor, the cameraman and the cameraman on the real opportunities of this film. Not only did they make great progress with their presentation, they also went much further. The use of extremely dark and extremely dark colors gave the film an eerie and grungy look, depicting the lives of the mob, the bounty hunter and the less fortunate in a way that shows their lives are not. t as peachy or "clean" as everyone else. If you notice that in times of less stress or conflict, there were very few camera ticks, if any. This shows that Scott and his crew wanted to achieve something with this look and did not just do it. I know most of the people watching this movie did not expect that, and many of them are turned off for this movie, but I think it's great that Scott chose this approach. Hollywood movies have become predictable and boring. Most of them are shot in the same way with the same twists and turns. And I'm glad Scott tried to do something different. Granted, this movie is not for everyone, but to say it's garbage and has nothing to offer, lets miss the point completely. I really enjoyed this movie and I'm glad I spent the money on it. I would recommend it to everyone, but I'm sure it will only make a few chords. I must agree with an earlier poster when he said that many of those who refuse to see outside the MTV sphere do not appreciate this movie, but I think many will. We should all try to please ourselves that Scott and Co. took some chances and tried to deliver something that was different and unique. And in that sense, I think he was enormously successful.
