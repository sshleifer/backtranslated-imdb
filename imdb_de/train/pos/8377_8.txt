My girlfriend and I have something for robots. So I try to search movies with robots. And this movie has robots. Size. They beat the shouts and beat each other, with the fate of the nations hanging in the balance. It's really cool. They must forgive this film of its many shortcomings and try to understand what the director and his technician crew were able to work with on an apparently tight budget. It's very hard not to like this movie. Because of these big robots. They looked like Transformers and fought like professional wrestlers! It made my girlfriend smile. And that's good enough for me. Particularly noteworthy is the experienced character actor Paul Koslo: As a crazy Russian villain, whether he ruthlessly stomps on his helpless opponents after they have already surrendered, or complains that his proximity to him in a bar caused his vodka taste "like blood "(a line he delivers with a delicately-camping sub-Bela Lugosi accent) he clearly has a ball and the movie benefits tremendously when he appears on the screen. This is a skilful little movie that deserves its cult reputation.
