I really can not say much more about the plot of the movie that has not been said yet. I have not seen the movie for about 25 years and the memory has never left me. I searched everywhere. I did net searches in the past, but I ran empty. Last night I thought about the movie again and tried to remember who was there. The last time I saw him, I was only 10 or 12 years old and I was not sure if I had the right movie name for another search and I finally found that sight. I was right. If anyone knows where I can share a copy of this wonderful movie with my family, please contact me at tawnyteel@yahoo.com. I would really appreciate it. And for anyone who has not seen this movie and has the chance, it is worth it.
