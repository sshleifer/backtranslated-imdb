This is a movie that should be seen by anyone who suffers from, is affected by or is suffering from an eating disorder. It is a surprisingly accurate and sensitive illustration of bulimia in a girl, its causes and symptoms. The girl is played by one of the most brilliant young actresses working in the cinema today, Alison Lohman, who was later so spectacular in 'Where the Truth Lies'. I would recommend that this movie be shown in all schools as you will never see a better one on this subject. Alison Lohman is absolutely outstanding and one wonders about her ability to convey the fear of a girl suffering from this obsessive-compulsive disorder. When barometers tell us about atmospheric pressure, Alison Lohman says the same thing about emotional pressure. Their emotional range is so precise that each scene can be measured microscopically for their gradations of trauma, on a scale of rising hysteria and despair reaching an unbearable intensity. Mare Winningham is the perfect choice for her mother and does so with immense sympathy and a range of emotions that are as finely tuned as those of Lohman. Together, they form a pair of sensitive emotional oscillators that resonate with each other. This film is truly an amazing feat and director Katt Shea should be proud of it. The only reason you do not see it is if you are not interested in people. But even if you like nature movies best, this is animal behavior in the sharpness. Bulimia is an extreme version of how a tormented soul can destroy its own body in a rush of despair. And if we do not sympathize with people who are in the depths of despair, then we are dead inside.
