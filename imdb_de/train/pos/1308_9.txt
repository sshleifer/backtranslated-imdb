I have to say that I really had no idea that I wanted to sit down and watch this movie. I suspect it was the fact that I had nothing better to do between classes. But once a television movie aroused my interest. More importantly, Helen Hunt caught my eye. I really was not a big fan of her before this movie. Sure, I liked Twister and as much as possible. But something about this movie really did it for me. I would now consider myself a big fan. This movie has good grades of ... me. Give him a chance, he will not let you down.
