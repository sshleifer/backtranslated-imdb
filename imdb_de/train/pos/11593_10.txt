I remembered watching this movie one day when I was a kid in the wonderful world of Disney. This movie has been in my memory for over 30 years and I have searched for it. I would say that out of all the children's movies I saw back then, this movie stands out more than anyone else, and after seeing it only once, I really hoped that I would see it again. The story and images of this movie were branded in my memory. To this day I have not seen it after this day in the 70s. In fact, I never remembered the title until I got an internet research posted today. I loved it and want my kids to see it. Does anyone know where I can find it?
