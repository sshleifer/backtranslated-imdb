Hamlet is by far my favorite among all Shakespeare works. Branaugh is a true actor. His portrayal of it was just incredible. His monologues were breathtaking. As long as it was like that, it's rare for a movie to catch my interest, but I was engrossed in this piece. I would recommend it to anyone who is both a Shakespearean fan and those who are not that enthusiastic. This has everything the modern world seeks in its films: murder, betrayal and fraud. In order not to beat Mel Gibson's version, Branaughs touches all the work. So no stone is left on the other. When you finish the movie, it will feel like you are reading the piece yourself. As you say "two thumbs up".
