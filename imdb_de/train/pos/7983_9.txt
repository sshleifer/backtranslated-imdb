It's hard to beat this movie in different ways. Everything works really well here. Casting, drama, script and cinematography are all first class. For the moviegoer, it is a moving, violent story of love and salvation through people. For the film critic there is a lot of sharp technique and technical value. There are some tactical mistakes, and as discussed on the boards, the end is realistic when you're strictly formal with the CIA agent training angle. However, I took the ending as more moving as Creasy does not pursue his soul in the pragmatic approach of the CIA agent, but basically recommends his soul to the Ultimate without taking the consequences into account. Like Jesus Himself, Creasy becomes superhuman through his sacrifice, whether or not it actually makes a pragmatic sense. In any case, I appreciated the fact that Creasy rejects conventional bourgeois morality and only covers the baddies one by one in his methodical quest for justice, which actually leads to redemption for both oneself and innocents. <br /> <br /> In any case, it's worth watching this movie if you're interested in the genre at all. An excellent soundtrack, great writing, flawless casting and solid performance across the board make this movie a Top 100 movie (or better).
