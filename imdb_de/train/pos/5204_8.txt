I do not watch a lot of porn, but I love porn stars. And I love gory movies. When I heard about a porno movie Gore movie, I was really excited. Of course, that was years ago, and when I heard about all the difficulties in creating and finishing the film, I never thought I would actually see it. But I did it and I'm not ashamed to admit that I loved it, even with all its mistakes. <br /> <br /> First the shortcomings. The story is set in Ireland and is called Samhain, but the story she wanted to tell relates to the Sawney Beane clan from Scotland. So why not just pretend and skip the third class report on Samhain / Irish immigrants / Halloween? It also violates its own rules by telling you that you are safe on the trails, but then the cannibal mutants simply run amuck everywhere. It's never clear how many cannibals we're dealing with. There is a big flintlock that is obviously ancient, but nobody has noticed it before. The self-confident horror movie references are annoying and the characters too. The heroine has a flashback montage of all her dead friends, including a character she has never met. The end makes no sense. <br /> <br /> So what works? The Blood Sure, I would have liked more, but it was refreshing to see such a nasty movie that was not afraid to be nothing but a bloody movie. Two murders are exaggerated and Taylor Hayes has a nice disgusting scene. The two wild murders are even extended on the DVD. I've always thought Gore can overcome a stupid story, and Evil Breed has reinforced that.
