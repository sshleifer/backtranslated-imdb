Jesse and Celine (Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy) are two strangers on a European train. The two come from very different backgrounds, he is American and she is French after having a little talk on the train. Jesse manages to make Celine get off the train and explore Vienna with him. In the next few hours, the two wander through Vienna, picking up everything the city has to offer and enchanting each other. But this new relationship will last beyond the sunrise. <br /> <br /> This wonderful romance comedy is a breath of fresh air for a genre that's decaying. "Before Sunrise" was written and directed by Richard (Dazed and Confused) Linklater. In fact, it thrives on the clues that make you love your characters and have a wonderful aura between the two. Thanks to the intelligent dialogue, this is a must for romantics.
