I have not seen a major cartoon on Spongebob Squarepants. The colors are great, the voices could not be better, the characters are so original, great cartoon. Hope Nickolodean continues to develop this cartoon. Hope the season DVD is coming soon !!! I love cartoons like these and I hope more people will choose this great cartoon. It's very hard to find the season DVD. So if someone finds a shop that sells them, let me know. The only Catscratch merchandise available in the Nick Shop is a great Lookin shirt, but very, very, very expensive !!! If you love Spongebob; and who does not? you will love Catscratch too!
