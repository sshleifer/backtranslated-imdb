This is one of the best animated family movies of all time. In addition, virtually all serious competitors for this title came from Hiyao Miyazaki and his studio Ghibli. Other great films include My Neighbor Totoro and Kikkis Delivery Service. Spirited Away is pretty good, but a bit too scary for typical family dishes - better for teenagers and adults. One thing that differentiates "Laputa: Castle in the Sky" from other films by Miyazaki is the much more exciting adventure journey. <br /> <br /> Why is this movie so good? Because it's a complete package: The animation is very well done and the story is really captivating and captivating. <br /> <br /> Most Japanese anime are imaginative, but extremely dark or cynical or violent; and the animation itself is often jerky, stylized and youthful. None of these problems affects Castle in the Sky. It has imagination to burn, and the characters are well drawn, albeit slightly exaggerated versions of realistic people. (None of these trench coats wears Posers) There are many adventures, but not blood and blood. The animation is fluid, detailed and cinematic allied - not many shallow shots. The backgrounds are wonderful. <br /> <br /> The voice in the English dubbed version is first class, in particular the two main roles Pazo (James Van der Beek) and Sheeta (Anna Paquin). The sound engineering is great too. Use your studio sound if you have it. <br /> <br /> One aspect that I especially enjoyed is that much of the back story remains unexplained. Laputa was once inhabited and is now abandoned. Why? We never know. We know as much as we need to know, and then we just have to accept the rest, which is simple, because the invented world is so fully realized. Indeed, it is true to say that the world is more fully realized than most minor characters, which are mostly one-dimensional fonts (eg, rough general, stupid sidekick, crazy old miner, etc.) for people from 6 to 60 years!
