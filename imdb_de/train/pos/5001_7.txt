Aardman does it again. Next to Pixar, Aardman Animation proves again and again how to do animations properly. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed watching the first episode of Creature Comforts. I thought it was well translated for the American audience. My only worry is that most viewers will not get the subtle humor on this show. <br /> <br /> After I was a fan of the BBC version and the short film, I knew what I was aiming for when I sat down to see this. The animators have done a great job in matching pre-recorded voices into a perfectly matched animal. Look at the first episode with the goat that sounds stoned and the dogs on the street who constantly call themselves "dawg". <br /> <br /> Is this for everyone? By far not. In fact, I would be happy if the show would last a full season. But as I said, the audience will not get it.
