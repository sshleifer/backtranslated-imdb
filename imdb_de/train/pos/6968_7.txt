Just as the new BSG was not what fans of the original series expected, Caprica may not deliver what fans of the new BSG have expected (for the most part). It's a very interesting, if not something stand-alone show, or at least the pilot. If you're looking for the big CGI thrill of the (new) BSG, you'll be very disappointed. If you've liked the drama, you'll probably find something that you like and maybe even identify with. <br /> <br /> The story explores how the Cylons were developed, why Adama hates them, and the origins of a monotheistic society. The authors also manage to help people play God, and create or re-create "human" life. It will be interesting to see how this works out. <br /> <br /> I found it to be over-preaching in some places and elsewhere, but all in all, it was promising. A small part of me wishes (or hopes) that there is some slight idea of ​​BSG there (apart from the back story I mentioned), but that would probably confuse the plot too much. Like BSG, I have to wait and see if Caprica will grow on me, but it's too early to say so. <br /> <br /> It would be really easy to acknowledge this as a mistake if you compare it to the previous series, but I am willing to give it a try. Overall, I found it interesting enough to see what the actual series is before it throws the (proverbial) towel.
