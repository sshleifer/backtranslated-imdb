I loved this miniseries. Tara Fitzgerald has done an incredible job and portrayed Helen Graham, a beautiful young woman hiding from a mysterious past with her young son. As an Anglophile who loves romances, this film was just my cup of tea and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to escape for a few hours to 19th-century England. I must also mention that Toby Stephens, who portrays the very magnetic Gilbert Markham, is reason enough to see this wonderful production.
