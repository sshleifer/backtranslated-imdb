When we started watching this series via cable, I did not know how addictive it would be. Even if you hate a character, hold back because it's so well developed. You can almost understand why he responds to frustration, fear, greed or temptation the way he does. It's almost as if the viewer is experiencing one of Christopher's learning curves. <br /> <br /> I can not understand why Adriana would verbally, physically and emotionally accept the abuse of Christopher through her, but I just have to read the newspaper to see how many women can tolerate such behavior. Carmella has a dream home, endless supplies of expensive things, but I'm sure she would give it up for a loving and faithful husband - or maybe not. That's why I look. <br /> <br /> It does not matter how many times you see an episode, you can find something that you missed the first five times. We even watch episodes out of sequence (Season 1 with ads, but all languages, A & E with censored language, repeats in the Movie Network) - wherever they are, we're there. We were totally spoiled now. <br /> <br /> I also love Malaprop's. "An albacore around my neck" is my favorite of Johnny Boy. If these jewels have entered our family vocabulary, this is a sign that I should be given a life. I'll do it when the show ends, and I've collected all the DVDs and added the collection to my will.
