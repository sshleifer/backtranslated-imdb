Audiard made a very interesting film here. It begins with the description of an almost deaf young woman in her working life as a secretary; She is being ignored, frustrated, rejected ... Recruitment of an intern as an assistant seems to be a way for her to find someone in her life. But the guy's just out of jail. Their two, rejected by society, unite them step by step. The description of the characters is rich, goes into detail ... both help each other; because she can read on the lips, which turns out to be very useful to him ... She will gradually develop, far from what she was at first. <br /> <br /> It is beautifully filmed; the whole thing is very convincing, even if it turns into a noir film in the end. In the filming of Audiard, the gesture is particularly well observed. Emmanuelle Devos was to be nominated for her Best Actess Cesar Awards Magistral. An action towards the end of the film prevents it from being a simple "Etude de Moeurs". It's actually surprisingly entertaining: 8/10.
