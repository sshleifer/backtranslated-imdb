I saw this movie twice with my teens who love it. This should be a cultfave! The best line "Your dress is really cool!" says the prince to Cinderella. Kathleen Turner shines as stepmother. I also like cars and motorcycles of the 50s. The melancholy prince is a great departure from the typical swashbuckler. He tries to stay cool, but does not hide his love for the fairytale princess. Her slipper is not a jar (more like the original story), but Cinderella loses, but still came back from the heir to the throne. My only complaint is that it is no longer shown and is almost impossible to get. Hopefully Blockbuster or Amazon will soon start storing them.
