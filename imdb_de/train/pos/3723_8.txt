There is an inexhaustible hunger for "Basic Training" films, so it is surprising that this film received so little attention at the first appearance. It seems that there is a well deserved second life on DVD / VHS. Tigerland is by no means equally great, there are some awfully cliched characters (especially the depiction of NCOs makes you long.) For the return of Lee 'Full Metal Jacket' (Ermey), but the main achievement of Colin Farrell is the stuff for the instant Star. Burning charisma and a role that every actor would kill.
