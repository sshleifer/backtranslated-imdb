From the mind of Robert Bloch, "Psycho," four tales of curious terror have arisen in this Amicus anthology film, which is not as fun or frightening as I would have wished for proper genre entertainment. <br /> <br /> It's all about the all-around story of a very skeptical Scotland Yard detective (John Bennett) who is investigating the disappearance of a prominent actor. He has advised that this case is linked to a few others by the house where they all took place, and that our movie is on. <br /> <br /> "Method for Murder" author Charles Hillyer (always charming Denholm) Elliott) was haunted by his latest fictional creation, which has apparently come to life. This sequence has some good surreal and quite exciting moments and is limited by reasonably entertaining revelation and resolution. <br /> <br /> "Waxworks" stars horror icon Peter Cushing as retired stockbroker Philip Grayson playing with his old friend Neville Rogers (Joss Ackland) is obsessed with the image of a beautiful woman who is in a macabre wax museum is located. In this episode, the dream sequence is most effective, although as always, seeing Cushing is great. The last pictures presented to us in this story are pretty shocking. <br /> <br /> "Sweets to the Sweet" features another popular horror star, Christopher Lee, as John Reid, who does not treat a delightful moppet child Jane (Chloe Franks) with too much kindness, and it's up to you new companion Ann Norton (Nyree Dawn Porter), to find out the reason. The mystery of this episode is treated excellently. The filmmakers do not tilt their hands, so it's a real shock as we experience the full truth of this unfortunate family. The "dying" moments are especially terrible. <br /> <br /> "The Cloak" has the most sincere comedy of the four; Jon Pertwee, one of many actors who plays the role of Dr. have played. Whoever has a lot of fun over the years as a vain, spirited horror movie (which is actually the highlight of this story) and who is mad at the lack in his latest low-budget movie, he goes out and buys his own coat. The coat has strange powers that I can not reveal here. Sexy Ingrid Pitt is a welcome presence as a companion to Pertwees. A wonderful example of humor here is a knowing Jab with none other than Christopher Lee! The concluding story ends in a predictable yet effective way, as Detective Inspector Holloway finds out that he should have something all the warnings taken seriously. <br /> <br /> Underlined by Michael Dress's unusual, distinctive and scary score, "The House That Dripped Blood" is a fun mix of stories. Although I do not like it so much as "tomb stories", it's still fun. Directed by Peter Duffell, he moves slowly but surely towards his deterrent conclusions and is certainly a good movie of its kind. <br /> <br /> 7/10
