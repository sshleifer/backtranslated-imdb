There may be a special reason why the fox and the child have hit a special note in my heart. After I had just said goodbye to my new fiancee - one day - for an unknown period of time, I was overwhelmed with different emotions and suffered from the consequences of the brave face she had to see /> <br /> I have a few movies and But I became interested in what I had left behind, what was out there and what I did not see. I owe this movie for that. <br /> <br /> As a nature lover and when I heard about the movie, I was sure that I would like it anyway. But I did not just like it, I loved it. <br /> <br /> The technical mastery is amazing. How did you do that? How did you catch the animals like that? It's just wonderful. <br /> <br /> The moral of the story is good, and while the end oh is so French and ambiguous, it's a happy / sad one. Again it caught me a bit unprepared. As a man who normally keeps his feelings to himself, the end was a hard end while he was in a plane full of people that I would see in the next 15 hours! Maybe it's because the end has made me think about what I've left. <br /> <br /> But for those few hours on the plane, I was glad to see something new and original. And that is life. Sure, there are things that you love and feel good about ... but nature holds many secrets. Next time I see something out of the ordinary when I'm outside. I will explore it, observe and hug it. That's what happens in this movie and that's exactly what you should do with this damn good movie / nature doctor. 8/10 <br /> <br /> P.S. It is two months after the plane trip. We still do not know when we will meet again, but we will do it.
