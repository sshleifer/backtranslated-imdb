This is the kind of movie that if made today would probably be Sandra Bullock and Hugh Grant; Now that I think about it, it's probably going to come back someday. It is pleasant, but without any depth. It suffers from James Stewart's nearly fatal misconduct in a role for which he is about 20 years old, so there is no chemistry between him and the beautiful Kim Novak. Ernie Kovacs is the only actor in the film in the small supporting role of an aspiring writer whose performance approaches what one might call a "joke". (** 1/2)
