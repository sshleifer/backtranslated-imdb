The summer was so full of blockbusters and comebacks of movies and not to mention the disappointment of these comebacks that I had to find a movie that I could just sit down and enjoy. <br /> <br /> If you do not want to read further down the page (there are no spoilers), I'll summarize it here: It's more mature than Ella Enchanted (there are some questionable acts of violence.) Parts, lots of death and a handful of scenes with some blood, not for small children), but do not try to be cocky or to go beyond their limits. Think of it as a more serious, slightly magical Princess Bride, and you'll be very close. <br /> <br /> ------------------------------------------ ------------------- <br /> <br /> I may not be as wonderful a movie viewer as others ... maybe once or twice a month, if I am feeling active I'm also a big sci-fi / fantasy fan. I'm getting bored with making repetitive storylines and movies with more flash than filling faster than you can count to 10, and this movie is the diamond in the rough. <br /> <br /> By the end of this (August), I was tired of the broken expectations of the big hits I had averted when I saw Bourne's ultimatum in favor of Stardust. After my hopes for Transformers fouled my fiction addiction, Stardust's previews seemed appealing, but I was careful anyway. <br /> <br /> Like many others, I was very surprised. I had thought of seeing another generic fantasy movie from here for breakfast. Do not be fooled, it's definitely a fairy tale, and it does have witches, magic and absolutely requires the lifting of unbelief ... But the most refreshing thing I've found is that it's NOT based on anything I do 'I've seen or read for the past 15 years, and it's really a really good movie. <br /> <br /> ((Unlike 90% of the other films that seem seemingly stubborn like thorns in a page, maybe one I could read a book this year, and in two years the movie would be different "epic fantasy story, like that of LotR and the rest" came out so the NYT and so and so and so I doubt.)) <br /> <br /> Stardust had not screwed me to my seat every turn, and I also did not sweat bullets, because a plotting hook around plotting hooks threatened dramatic tension and echo throughout the theater in a loud boom. Not even huge sounds were used to draw my attention to what is happening on the screen (Transformers, I'm looking at you). I did not try to showcase the latest CGI techniques, and it also failed my intelligence with dialog windows and storylines so simple I could have figured them out in 3rd grade (boy, I hate them). <br /> <br /> I just ... watched. Seen and enjoyed a refreshingly creative story in front of my eyes. Sure, I may have known what would happen during most of the movie, but that makes you forget that. I even puked my heart down in some places, but the most important thing I noticed is that I felt the theater better than if I had gone in there. <br /> <br /> It really is a gem. After so much slush this summer with so many remakes and movies that did not live up to my expectations, it was like a cold, sweet cup of tea to get through all the hard work I had done and to sit down with the others who try to get out of them My money is worth it. <br /> <br /> Probably not for everyone, but do yourself a favor. If you enjoy fantasy movies that alone are the time (Princess Bride, Black Cauldron, The Dark Crystal, etc.), you should really see this movie. This little diamond finds its way into my DVD collection as soon as it goes on sale. You can trust me for that. <br /> <br /> Just wonderful.
