"Fear of a black hat" is all that should be the (much weaker) "CB-4". The satirical eye of Rusty Cundieff is reckless as he folds, spindles and mutilates every aspect of hip-hop trends and culture. Does "FoaBH" correspond to the "Spinal Tap"? Yes a little. Is it derived from Spinal Tap? No not true. The goal is more focused, the satire is more focused and, to be honest, it's funnier.
