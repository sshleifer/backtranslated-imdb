More like a psychological analysis of movies, but as a headline Psycho sounds better. The film director (the narrator, if you like) shows films in his own way. Most of them are classics, but they are all listed here on the IMDb, and I would strongly advise you to see them (especially the Hitchcock movies, Solyaris, Conversation, and the Lynch films) because Slavoj Zizek will refer to them ! <br /> <br /> Or in other words, he could spoil it for you. I can not remember if he has spoiled more than the ones I've listed (I think the Chaplin movies too), but while I wrote it would be best if you all look at each other before! The IMDb list lacks a movie I've reported to you so it could be there soon. It's a Meg Ryan movie, but it's just a short excerpt, but not very big. <br /> <br /> Zizek's views and opinions are crazy and it's fun to listen to them when you're open to look through things a different perspective (even if it does destroy your favorite movie a bit ... does not mean that that he will do that, but he could do it)!
