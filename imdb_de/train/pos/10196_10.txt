Kudos to Cesar Montano for reviving the Cebuano movie! Panaghoy sa Suba is very good - it has the drama, the action, the romance and the scene that will make you laugh. <br /> <br /> While the story is not so original (a love triangle - or make) A square love, Japanese occupation, rebellion, Americans as rulers, their presentation is something cool, especially their original language - Bisaya for the Filipino, Nipongo for Japanese and English for the American. <br /> <br /> This movie is considered one of the best Pinoy films of the year. <br /> <br />
