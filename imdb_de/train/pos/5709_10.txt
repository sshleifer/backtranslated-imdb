This foreign film was made in 1931 and was to be seen and enjoyed more often. <br /> <br /> We open a quiet little French village and scan the roofs of the sleeping citizens. Then we hear something that sounds like a party. In the investigation of the riot, two neighboring men learn the story of two men, allegedly friends, who have chosen two numbers for the lottery. <br /> <br /> Our star of the picture has his number and his friend his. If he asks his friend, he would divide half of the dough, if his ticket is the winning number, his friend promptly says no. In fact, H.E. Double hockey sticks no! is the way he acts against it. <br /> <br /> So if our husband discovers that he has the winning card and lost, he is not guilty and he is desperate. Everyone is looking for this ticket for themselves in a kind of precursor to "The Great Race". Although all of this is just a flashback, I was in the stick all the time and was so angry about everything that was shown in the bank's all-for-me-show-me-the-money movie. Take a look at Le Million today!
