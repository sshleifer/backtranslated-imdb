Do not confuse "War Inc." for a sharp-cut satire or a clever comedy full of insider jokes for news fans. It is not. <br /> <br /> This is an old-fashioned screwball comedy with ridiculously random plot changes, camp characters (in some fun performances by John Cusack, Joan Cusack, Marisa Tomei and Hillary Duff). and a straightforward approach to the political content. <br /> <br /> You see, the political aspects of the filmmakers are things that almost the whole country knows is true. Yes, we understand that the companies benefiting from the war are corrupt, inappropriate pigs, that the responsible political leaders are even more incompetent antics, and that American imperialism never looked more blatant and uninteresting than now - but that is not Point. <br /> <br /> Here is all the noise that she - sometimes ingeniously - uses as a backdrop for a silly trump like John Cusack's character (the hit) to wipe out his life (with heart) of the journalist who does not trust him (Tomei) and the young star from the Middle East who wants to cancel their marriage (Duff). Cusack's sister Joan plays his assistant with almost cartoonish enthusiasm. Ben Kingsley seemed to me wasted in his smaller part as a reckless CIA boss. <br /> <br /> That's it, and it works. It's just fun, but if you somehow can not see reality and you think the war is going well and everyone is doing a good job and there is no corruption and the people in the Middle East are wishing, our Western culture would replace you may not find it so funny. <br /> <br /> For everyone else it was a light comedy with a political edge.
