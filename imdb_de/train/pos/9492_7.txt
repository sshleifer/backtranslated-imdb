This movie was fun, but for the wrong reasons. The coordination of the action sequences is ridiculous and lets the movie have some funny pops. Robert Ginty and Fred Williamson end up with a memorable scene in which Williamson tells Ginty, "You're sure to be around dude boys!" I enjoyed this movie only for Ginty and Williamson, but not for the plot, which must be written on the back of a napkin in four lines and the rest most likely ad-libbed. A movie with over 30 parts only has a credit list for about 10. It seems strange that nobody else in the movie has a loan. Maybe they had insight into the finished product. The only thing that this movie promises is that it's pretty violent, so Fred Williamson and Robert Ginty tripled for a worth watching movie.
