I do not know why the critics ruined this movie. I hardly agree with them anyway. <br /> <br /> The movie could have been a bit scary - I do not usually go to horror movies! I even had to cheer up to see it during the day. I would not have bothered! ;) (The cinema was also full of kids, heh !;) ... Liam was great as always. I also liked Catharine Zeta Jones (Theo) and Lili Taylor (Eleanor-Nell). <br /> <br /> The house was very gothic and beautiful in an eerie way. The special and the sound effects were great. I also loved the music score, especially the soft melodies for Eleanor and her journey to save the children, how she has outgrown her stagnant routine and her life and finally gains strength, peace and freedom.
