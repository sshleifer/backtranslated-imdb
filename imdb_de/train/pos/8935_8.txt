"The Intruder (L'Intrus)" is a visual pilgrimage through a mysterious life. <br /> <br /> Grizzled Michel Subor plays "Louis Trebor" like Jason Bourne as an old man with a hidden past and, for legitimate paranoid reasons, simply lives in an isolated cabin in the woods (but attracts pretty young women who can be ) useful for him). We learn more about him through dreams, flashbacks and a journey that can unfold chronologically or not, as well as through his brusque interaction with family, lovers, business associates and a striking nemesis. Like "The Limey," the film resonates with parent / child regrets, and a suspicious past is revealed through excerpts from an old movie with the same actor as a young man (here, the 1965 adventure film "Le Reflux" by Paul Gégauff) <br /> In a perfect contrast of moods, we meet his son Sidney (Grégoire Colin), who must be the sexiest housewife in the world as he sweetly and seductively carries out home repairs and looks after a baby, a toddler and everyone needs his working Mrs. The director / co-author Claire Denis must have created him as a female fantasy, if there has ever been another lesson for other filmmakers. There is another extended scene in which he seeks his father in the woods while he carefully carries his angel baby in a bag. He is everything his father is not and has every relationship that his father can not sustain. No wonder he thinks his father is "a madman". I spent the rest of the film for fear that something bad would happen to him, as the true nature of the heart of his estranged father is played very slowly before our eyes. <br /> <br /> The film is a mystery, but Subor is relentlessly intrigued as we watch him cross countries and negotiate nefarious deals, and the voice of Denis' "Beau Travail" was annoying anyway. Skylines and accidental signs tell us that he is traveling to Geneva, Korea, and the South Pacific. Time passes when the seasons change and scars develop and heal. There are many pictures of water for cleaning and removal. <br /> <br /> In order to continue her fascination with the transformation of colonialism into globalization and play some of the stereotypes of the mysterious Orient and Russian criminals, Denis has incorporated elements of Robert Louis Stevenson, Paul Gauguin and Marathon Brandos Tahiti into idylls and a 40-page memoir by the French philosopher Jean-Luc Nancy, the last for the title and the heart transplant plot used for an ironic theme of limited immortality that has consequences. <br /> <br /> While "Louis" thinks he has managed to move beyond boundaries, rules and morals, there is a merriment in the last act as the locals do not know exactly what to do with him and trying to help him solve his quixotic odyssey, even when he is in isolation again. <br /> <br /> Several people in the audience left the elliptical but strikingly beautiful narrative method. The unconventional narrative raises many details.
