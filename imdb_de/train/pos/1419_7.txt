This is an ordinary nature porn movie. I do not mean sex with porn. By that I mean free pictures of (eg) thousands of birds together or of hundreds of walruses or a huge waterfall or iceberg. Some of the footage in the movie seems to be just to get into the trailer to get viewers into theaters for ten seconds before disappearing to never be seen again for the rest of the movie. <Br /> <br /> There is almost no action in this film. A story of three animal families, "better than the march of the penguins", should not be provided by the film. The blame lies in three key areas: (1) the authors who gave James Earl Jones some of the worst lines in nature film history, (2) the music team that over-motivated everything to tell you how to feel. even if the film does not motivate, and finally (3) the editors, who had the story without rhyme or reason without rhyme or reason, no continuity, no flow that sucks the life of the entire film - a film about life. When we arrived halfway to the whales, I sank back into my seat in fear, hoping against the hope that the movie was more than half of the movie and I would survive the long endurance test with the animals screen. <br /> <br /> There was almost no science in the movie either. They attributed hot and cold (everything, not just the seasons) to Earth's inclination alone, ignoring the fact that from spot to spot we had even greater extremes when there was no inclination, as the poles would never warm. And it would be worst if we did not have rotation (relative to the revolution) like Mercury, because half of the planet would bake and the other half would freeze. In the end, they used the term "humans and animals" as if humans were not animals that were somehow liberated from the laws of nature. So much for science. <br /> <br /> But I have to credit the camera and that's why I call it natural pornography. Everything from super-slow motion to finely-tuned, mechanically-controlled time-lapse photography has been used for some (and I only warned "some") of breathtaking moments that set the bar higher compared to other nature films. That said, I'm not convinced that everything on screen was natural. Some of the footage showing the big water hole in Africa as it changed from season to season seemed to me to be CGI. A director would have expected such a suspicion and incorporated other shots to show that everything is natural, but they did not. <br /> <br /> For a movie about the earth I had shown much more of the earth awaiting. What we saw was immaculate. We had to accept the narrator's word that some species are endangered by climate change. They have not shown us any evidence. They did not show us how Alberta saw the poisonous retention basins from outer space. They did not show us the great Pacific waste. They did not show us a nocturnal image of light pollution by people all over the world. That's as much earth as anything else. Why should you cover it up for a feel-good whitewash? <br /> <br /> My last criticism of the content is raiding. Each time a predator was shown on the screen actually hunting for prey, the music became almost to this Mt Doom scene of Lord of the Rings, depicting the predator as a kind of ultra-dark Sauron character. But predators are not evil. They provide a necessary service to ensure that the best prey animals survive. We are predators ourselves. Each time the predator caught the prey, we immediately set out to pretend that death and food did not really happen. The last insult was the "father" polar bear, who had to die after he dared to eat. "Bad bear! Bad!", You almost hear them say. <br /> <br /> Continue to the presentation. Maybe my theater is guilty of it, but maybe not. I expected to see something clearer than I could see on my own HDTV LCD at home. But the picture was blurry and was presented at the same 16: 9 ratio I could get at home, rather than the larger ratio that many films nowadays appear. And during an action-packed scene at the end of the movie, the movie (I can not imagine that it's digital, it looks like it) was damaged, and we lost some of the colors and finally disappeared. This was repeated about three times. <br /> <br /> If they actually plant a tree for me, it was worth it. But how should I know?
