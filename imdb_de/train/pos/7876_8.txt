I did not like Chandni Bar from the same director. <br /> <br /> I have not seen his other films. They came and went. <br /> <br /> But page-3 is nicely done. Seems legit. Like Satya from RGV. <br /> <br /> The mental illness of so-called high society is the summary of the movie. In the midst of all illnesses, it is difficult to lead a normal life that the protagonist Konkana Sen does. Serious movie, not seen with children or wives expected. Page 3 of the Newspapers is the usual place to report on the activities that are going on in the parties of the rich and elite, who give themselves much more dirt than is reported. This film also shows how this page 3 is a business project. Event management firms are paid to hold parties and make famous and famous celebrities overnight by clicking on photos with celebrities invited to the party. Western culture has crept deep into the high society of Mumabi. The film shows it boldly, no barriers. <br/> <br/> Madhur Bhandarkar starts a new journey from here.
