I have to say that the Grand Canyon is one of the most impressive movies I have ever seen. I have seen it several times now and still feel the same as the first time. that this film alone could make up the entire curriculum of a postgraduate course in film direction. <br /> <br /> A long time ago movie trailers promised: "It makes you laugh, it makes you cry." This is a very banal way to describe what the Grand Canyon is doing. It leads you to the best places of human experience and the next moment to the gates of hell. <br /> <br /> Much of the film is geared to move back and forth between people close to luck and the same people who are close to the horror. It's always a small step, too. Just to master this momentum with grace and without making it look wrong or exaggerated is the directorial genius. Spoiler (kind) comes up. After the audience becomes accustomed to rocking through the emotional spectrum, the film throws a curve with a sequence that does not go from good to bad and not back, but from a normal marriage attempt by a random, self-induced one Messer escalates wound, which may or may not require stitches, to an earthquake in which the figures run out of the house. In the moment of relief, forgetting arguments, forgetting fingerprints, the earthquake survived, a neighbor calls that her older man has collapsed. The couple rushes to his aid. I cried when I saw this sequence. I cried every time I saw it. I'm crying now. It's not a sadness that does that to me. It is not a particularly sad episode. What upset me is that those few minutes were PERFECT. That's perfect! Amazing. (End of spoiler) <br /> <br /> There's a lot to say about the Grand Canyon. It portrays relatively ordinary people experiencing epiphanies, allowing the viewer to experience them vicariously. They are neither conspicuous nor exaggerated, and there is not a long pause to scrutinize the moment. The movie moves at the pace of life. Even when the characters try to understand what happened, they are not sure what to draw from their experience. <br /> <br /> Grand Canyon is a very human movie.
