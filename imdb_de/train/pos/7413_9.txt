The shower holds in many ways in itself. Almost the entire film is set in an old-time bathhouse, with residents providing humor, pathos and emotional touch. The love and friendship between the owner and his retarded son is deep and moving. The way the older brother is drawn into this little world seems casual and convincing. The plot is meandering, full of surprises and ironies, and touched by a sense of what I must call a neighborhood in the relationships and conflicts of the interpreters. This is a movie that I extract if I want to believe in the world again.
