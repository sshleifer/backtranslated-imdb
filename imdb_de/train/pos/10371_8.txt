This is an extremely powerful movie based on a true story and can be annoying for viewing. I say that because a brutal press can be so brutal for people, in this case an innocent Australian couple accused of killing their baby, but I also found Sam Neill as good. Let's just say that both of them were outstanding, but the role was a bit more difficult for Streep because she had to learn an Australian accent. (She learned it so well that I had difficulty understanding it in part.) <br /> <br /> Without revealing anything, I can only say that this movie makes you emotionally exhausting.
