"Saving Grace" is never excitingly funny, but there are some good laughs, and I really enjoyed it. Brenda Blethyn is an outstanding actress, well portrayed by widower Grace, who breeds marijuana to pay her massive debts. The minor occupation also does a good job. The French actor Tchecky Karyo has a funny little role. The premise alone is appealing. The idea of ​​a woman growing and smoking over the hill sounds strange. And the movie plays with the premise from time to time smart. Of course, there are shallow moments when two elderly women hold grace marijuana leaves for tea leaves and start to take on childish antics in the shop they work in. That was a pointless gag that did not quite decrease. The tone of the film is depressed and occasionally boring, but I have laughed enough to give this English import a recommendation. <br /> <br /> My score: 7 (out of 10)
