I've always said that the animated Batman movies are much better than the live action movies. <br /> <br /> I've seen all the animated films, but this is the poorest and most disappointing of all. <br /> <br /> "Mask of the Phantasm" would be classified as best, then "World's Finest", then "Sub Zero", then "Return of the Joker", and finally this remains the last place. <br /> <br /> In this latest animated film, there's a mysterious new Batgirl in Gotham, and Batman wants to find out if she's a friend or an enemy while she's looking for revenge. But so Bruce He engages with three young women, begins to investigate them and discovers who the new Batgirl is. <br /> <br /> The tone in this film is uncommonly light, considering that most of the movies are dark and bleak, which was rather disappointing. Bruce looks strangely out of character most of the time, the villains are reused from recent movies, and although the action scenes are exciting, they're really nothing new. It also lacks the dramatic influence that other films have, especially that of "Sub-Zero," which was heavy in drama and character development. Everything in the film feels pretty recycled and the supporting characters are charming No one is worth rooting for. <br /> <br /> All the time I really enjoyed it, I had a great time and the identity of the new Batgirl is surprising, but that was not as exciting as mine. I hoped. <br /> <br /> (** half of ****)
