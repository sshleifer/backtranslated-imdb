Stories from the Vault: And All Through the House begins on Christmas Eve, when Elizabeth (Mary Ellen Trainor) kills her husband Joseph (Marshall Bell), pulling his body out and preparing them to knock down a well, but escapes them an important bulletin on the radio stating that a Santa Claus disguised (Larry Drake) escaped from a local madhouse and has already killed several women with Elizabeth next on his list, but she has other ideas and tries the seemingly dangerous situation to turn your advantage ... <br /> <br /> This story from the crypt story was Episode 2 from the first season, by one of the show's regular executive producers, Robert Zemeckis and All Through the House, was conducted, is a decent clock. The script by Fred Dekker was based on a story that appeared in the comic 'The Vault of Horror'. Originally it was an episode of the Britsih horror anthology movie Tales from the Crypt (1972) starring Joan Collins as a murderer woman character played here by Ellen Trainor. This particular version is good enough, but does not do anything else or special & is a bit too linear and predictable to be considered a classic. At just 25 minutes in length, it certainly moves at a good pace, the story is almost macabre enough and generally offers decent entertainment. I really liked the downbeat end. This time, there are Christmas themes to open and close Crypt Keeper (John Kassir) segments with the usual puns. <br /> <br /> Director Zemeckis does a good job and there is a wintry atmosphere with a touch of Christmas. There is not much going on here, someone has a poker in their head, someone has an icicle on their face, someone has an ax in their arms and there is some blood spatter, but in general it is not the graphics. Acting through a small cast is pretty good. <br /> <br /> And All Through the House is not the best story out of the tomb, but it's still a decent story, but worth the comic book story. Original 1972, we really needed it or wanted it ?
