Sometimes the movie feels a bit long, but it's worth it. Gordon conducts a style reminiscent of Vonnegut's writing styles. Ruthless, thoughtful, ironic, quirky and dark. This is a movie that will stay with you for a while, asking for answers to impossible questions. Nolte, Goodman and Arkin are all incredible. Sheryl Lee is also wonderful in a role that will remind Lynch fans of their Laura / Maddy days. Do not miss these!
