Much was written about Mamet's The House of Games; most good. I decided to revisit the movie to see how he felt after 17 years, and was amazed at how much fun I felt to see him again. The success and durability of the film probably has a lot to do with two main ingredients that are always fun in the movie. a good story and a good scam. Mamet manages to bring his unmistakable whimsy and obvious histrionics to the film while cheating on us, the audience and the brand at the same time. Then he explains the art of conning, just to do it again, and so on, as he builds the story. "The House of Games", now a free article on cable, is worth a look for first-time visitors and a proper repeat for Mamet fans. (B +)
