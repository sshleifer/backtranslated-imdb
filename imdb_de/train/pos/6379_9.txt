The movie "Atlantis: The Lost Empire" is a shining jewel in the rubble of the films recently produced by the Disney Studios. Parents who had to play The Jungle Book 2 or even a Pokemon movie will surely appreciate this movie. <br /> <br /> The previous feature films were just narratives of existing stories. Films like "Toy Story", "Finding Nemo" and "Monsters Inc." Everyone does the same thing, but it's worth noting that all were made by Pixar and distributed only by Disney. For the most part, current Disney studio films are being released directly on video and are a continuation of an already successful film. The quality of these films has given way to profitability. With "Atlantis" a new era began: "Mulan", "Lilo & Stitch" and finally "Open Range". The authors have all created original storylines instead of fairytales of the past. <br /> <br /> A good part of the movie is dedicated to finding Atlantis hundreds of years ago. Including the young Milo Thatch, voiced by Michael J. Fox. Milo is employed in a museum in Washington DC. His grandfather was a renowned archaeologist who dedicated his life to the discovery of Atlantis. This was viewed by his colleagues as a waste and they want Milo not to follow in his footsteps. After Milo failed to convince the museum's directorate to sponsor his expedition, Milo comes home to find a woman in his dark apartment. She brings him to her employer, Mr Whitmore. Whitmore was a close friend of Milo's grandfather and wants to send Milo to Atlantis with a team. Mr. Whitmore is very rich and has paid the best of everything. The crew accompanying him is the same as his grandfathers. The journey has many obstacles to overcome and is fun to watch. The viewer is trapped when he reaches Atlantis. The plot takes an unexpected turn after the discovery of Atlantis, not just the discovery of humans. It is enough to keep the interest of the older audience. <br /> <br /> The animators did a wonderful job in the depth of the animation. The film mixes traditional animations with computer generated images. A feat that is not easy to achieve. Most viewers quickly realize the difference between the two. The characters are believably human. There are some nice chases with a lot of action. A few lulls are filled with jokes that the kids just can not get. <br /> <br /> The creativity of the writers really seems to go through. The culture of Atlantis is richly developed, including a whole language. The film uses references to Atlantis from historical sources such as Plato. The disappearance of Atlantis from the world is explained. Credible, if from a younger audience this magic really exists. The powers of the people in Atlantis are not represented as magical, but can best be described in this way. <br /> <br /> Although the prior art is discontinued 1914, it is unrealistic. The voyage is in a submarine reminiscent of Captain Nemos Nautilus, complete with submarines firing torpedoes. The gigantic dredgers are powered by steam boilers, so they've decided on an era technology. The female characters are empowered in a way that women of that age would not have had, even if they take on leadership roles. That's not a bad thing. It is a good role model for my daughter, not for an exclusively male cast. <br /> <br /> One reason why this movie is my favorite compared to other Disney movies is that there is not a single song. ever. A tradition that began with the first feature film "Snow White" and lasted until "The Lion King". Almost every Disney movie is full of optimistic songs. That's great and all, what would the seven dwarfs be without "Hi HO!"? After the millionth time it would be almost no better, but this spares the parents. Not once did any person on the screen suddenly hear the words of a song that no one has heard before, and burst into song. I'm thankfull. <br /> <br /> The plot and the depth of the animation will surely keep the attention of parents and children. It's a movie that I want to see again and again with my children.
