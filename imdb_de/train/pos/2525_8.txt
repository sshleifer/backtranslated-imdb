Tony Hawk Underground came at a point when the series really began to lose its shine. Tony Hawk Pro Skater 4 did not live up to expectations and really left the series in the air, which Neversoft and Activision could do with this series Be different and interesting. <br /> <br /> Underground introduced storymode, which was very cool because it created a whole new world for fans of Tony Hawk Pro skaters. Another feature was introduced, for which the fans spoke quite strong and could leave the skateboard. That's nice, because now you can actually climb, run and do all sorts of new things. <br /> <br /> The levels are good, Neversoft also improved a problem that started with Pro Skater 3 and was the length of the level design. The first two games for the PS1, N64 and Dreamcast were great, as the levels were nice and long and some were hidden. Pro Skater 3 and 4 were shortened because of a handful of features that were added and really pushed the systems to their limits. In this version, they have shortened these features, there are not that many people wondering on the streets, in fact, there are almost none on some levels, and the graphics and skating physics are somewhat toned down, but not much. <Br /> <br /> This game has a drawback, storymode is a bit short, of course it's Neversoft's doing this for the first time with Tony Hawk Pro Skater, so that's understandable. However, if you assume, you will definitely finish this game within a day. <br /> <br /> Overall, a great addition that was very refreshing.
