I was about 7 when I first saw this movie. It was not that special at the time, but a few years later I saw it again and this time it was a lot of fun :) <br /> <br /> I think the best parts of the movie are: Yeti's body language and the 'special effects ' also. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch this movie, do not wait for a Hollywood-built blockbuster, even this movie was worth about $ 1,000 :) <br /> <br /> I have a copy of it. Film and video version (but I do not think she has ever been shown in cinemas). <br /> <br /> View it, enjoy it !!! Yeti forever !!!
