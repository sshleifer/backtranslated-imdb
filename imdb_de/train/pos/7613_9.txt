/ The first episode I saw of Lost made me think. I thought, what kind of people are those who have crashed and are being chased by a huge monster. But it is not so, it is much more than that, because there is no monster at all and every episode you see of Lost is getting better and better. a deserted island with an underground bunker and above all the connection between the people who crossed each other before they crashed. That's the real secret. <br /> <br /> This series rules and I can not wait to know what's really going on there. I hope they do not direct the last two episodes in theaters, this series deserves a 9 out of 10
