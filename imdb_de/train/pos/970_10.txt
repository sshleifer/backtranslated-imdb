Now I've seen a lot of movies in my time, but there were a few very few of each, who were really good for me. And I'm a 19 year old man who is impressed with this movie, which is aimed at a younger audience. This is a very underrated gem for those watching foreign films. Almost all the acting is credible, the graphics are decent (which you do not have to worry about watching the movie, trust me, the chirping of the graphics would be a stupid thing), the story is well written It's a movie everyone enjoys not just the kids. <br /> <br /> Here's basically what I got used to in this movie. The one made me laugh ... much, secondly, I got to feel the characters as you suspect, and third, it is a very uplifting story. At the end of this movie you feel good. Sure, what an anime out there has not been, how a young boy became a great warrior and whatever, to defeat a great evil. It is a formula that is used frequently. In this case, though, it's forgivable because although they use puppets for some characters and average graphics that you would see five years ago, the doll's appearance is unpredictable. It is very touching, the ending is original and keeps you in the movie as it is supposed to. However, if you try to compare this with other movies like "The Neverending Story" or whatever it is going to be, your opinion will be different. See it as it is and you will enjoy it. <br /> <br /> It has been a long time since I was so impressed. The only other movie in which I have this feeling is when I saw TMNT when it came out. There is something in this movie that I felt about TMNT that really got me excited. Over-analyze or do not take this movie too seriously, just enjoy it.
