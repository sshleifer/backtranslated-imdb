Strangely, this version of OPEN YOUR EYES is more mature and nuanced. In retrospect Crowe's script is much stricter and more sophisticated than the original by Amenabar. The Spanish filmmaker should first come to grips with the story, but there is no doubt that Crowe has improved it - if only a little bit. Note that you have no idea what the lead did in OPEN YOUR EYES, but you know almost everything about the lead in VANILLA SKY. That's what I mean by "sophisticated".
