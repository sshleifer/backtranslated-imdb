That was a really cool movie. It just proves that you do not need stupid little things like continuity and scripts to make a movie. It crosses continents in seconds, people are shot and nothing happens to them, swords set on fire, Samuari fight on sinking galleons, David Essex is the epitome of slimy villains and John Rhys Davies is just the guy. I enjoyed this movie, but I like sex movies. This is the perfect example of a very s ** t movie that is just KICKS ASS. If you like Battlefield Earth, you'll love this movie. His movie is fast, stupid, samuaraitastic !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br /> <br /> It looks like it was made in 1972
