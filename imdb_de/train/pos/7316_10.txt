This movie is one of the best of all times, certainly in the horror genre. The claustrophobic atmosphere is superb, the music is as good as the movie and the killer is as scary as possible! Actors are awesome, RIP Donald Pleasance They were fantastic as Dr. Loomis, he made the movie even better. Without him, the film would lack a vital ingredient. Jamie Lee Curtis is also outstanding as our beloved Screaming Queen! Her innocence does not make her aware of the real evil until she finds her friends murdered in the house, which of course is one of the best scenes of the movie. She gives an incredible performance. I've loved this movie since it first met in the early 80's, and I still watch it today as it's a wonderful movie that will take you to this world where you might be disappointed like a fish every turn! The fact that it is a simple format of a crazy man in a mask, who has fled a lunatic asylum and is ready to kill anyone in sight, unaware that he is there, is shockingly frightening and spoils you even more film than the events, though fiction could easily come true. We all know that there is evil in this world, and a crazy man with a knife is certainly not uncommon, a very disturbing fear of all this. Death on every corner. Halloween, of course, shows that in a terrible way. Horror should be believable and that makes the movie enjoyable. It's just a simple story that turns into an excellent and scary atmosphere. In addition to the great story of psycho that I adore, I believe formats are the best horror has to offer. For me, Halloween and Psycho are the best movies I have ever seen and I will see them all my life and never get tired. Halloween is undoubtedly one of the best films of all time.
