The fourth in the "Dirty Harry" series, this one shows one of the most despicable, ugly, unlikely, profane, and disgusting women I've ever seen in the movie, "Ray Perkins," played by Audrie Neenan. She is the modern, nasty low-life version of the "Detour" character of 1945, "Ann Savage". <br /> <br /> Her mouthfeelings and runches so distracted me that I never saw this movie again until I bought her a mundane filter that silenced her ... and at least some of her! Then I could enjoy the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> Everywhere "Harry Callahan" (Clint Eastwood) leaves, violence follows immediately ... within minutes! It happens so often that it's almost ridiculous, but it's a fast paced, entertaining movie with a satisfying ending, as all the foolish villains are eliminated one at a time. <br /> <br /> This is a very complicated movie appeals to our basic instincts ..... and joins, sad to say. Most of us want these dirt balls to end up, and who does it better than Dirty Harry?
