It's unusual to see a movie where the performance of a single actor is so good that you get the feeling that the film would be of little interest, if any, without its presence. <br /> <br /> In spite of a disparate focus - in fact, there are many scenes that seem to have been filmed too quickly and negligently - a seemingly low budget, a curious conspiracy over a man replacing a Procked Priest And another week, the presence of Pierre Fresnay is so impressive that you are shocked from the first to the horrible end. <br /> <br /> I have never seen a better performance, nor can I imagine Paul Scofield acting in "One Man For All Seasons". <br /> <br /> Actually, the ending might be considered ridiculous if Fresnay does not play the transtorned priest who returns to the church through a crime. <br /> <br /> "Je suis Maurice Morand, prètre catholique" (I am Maurice Morand, a Catholic priest ") is said with such brilliance that one can forget the madman. This has led to this. <br /> <br /> The other impressive thing that this movie has is a single scene in which Morand - who, though he is a stoned man, is still a priest - preserves a large amount of grape vines in a cabaret Transforming Christ's blood. <br/> <br/> Gérard - the man who wants to bring Morand back to church or replace him - has to drink it if he does not want to be in the cabaret, and he does so in the midst of applause and applause from people who think he just drinks three out of four litter wines. <br /> <br /> In the next scene, the dialock between Morand and a garbage collector is also noteworthy. "Do you also carry men?" Morand asks hates himself for what he has just done. "That would be too much l work, "is the clever answer. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie is not worth commenting on, but definitely worth a visit, as the atmosphere is very strong and strangely emotional. <br /> <br /> I think "Le défroqué" is a very strange movie, but it has to be seen by all viewers. If they are good Catholics, this is mandatory because it is a very rare gem in movie history. <br /> <br />
