The most agile fat guy in martial arts does it again. An early Sammo film in which he imitates the hero of his character Bruce Lee, Sammo is amazingly leeike as in his actions and struggles. The way he fits in with Bruce's style and then returns to his own, more familiar Kung Fu is a joy to behold and shows how good and adaptable he is to his art. Take some slapstick humor, which is so popular for this kind of movie, and this is a movie that offers everything - comedy (some unintentionally, like the black fake), action and some incredible fight scenes. <br /> <br /> A great beer and buddies movie worth one and a half hours.
