THE VAN is a simple Teensploitation picture designed specifically for the driveway, where you feel comfortable and have many opportunities to laugh and cry with your friends. Danny Devito has a small but abundant role as a car wash manager and is almost stealing the show! All leads are well played, the characters are complex, and the direction is quite suitable for this type of picture. An international publication by Crown.
