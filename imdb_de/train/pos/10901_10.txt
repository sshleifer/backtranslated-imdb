This is probably the best documentary I have seen in a long time. Jonny Kennedy was and is a tragically beautiful inspiration. Not only was he a survivor of one of the most painful illnesses, but he used his beauty to show the world that there is a life after death and never give up, reach people and spread his love. Watching the minutes of his lifelong battle was heartbreaking. Listening to his smart butt and seeing his delightful gestures was heartwarming. And to see him smile was indescribable. I feel blessed to have been touched by this little giant. If you ever have a chance to watch this movie, be happy to meet Jonny Kennedy.
