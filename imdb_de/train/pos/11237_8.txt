Star Trek: Hidden Frontier is a longtime fan movie dedicated exclusively to the love of the show and is a must for fans of Trek. The production quality for a fan movie is extremely high, although you can sometimes find out that it is a green screen. However, this does not diminish the overall experience. The CGI ships are awesome, as well as the space combat scenes ... On the negative side, in the earlier episodes (and occasionally in the newer ones), I've noticed that some of the actors do not feel comfortable, but this in turn does not the general experience of the new interpretations of Star Trek. The cast and crew have come up with something really special, and overall, I would highly recommend this series to fans of The Next Generation and Deep Space 9.
