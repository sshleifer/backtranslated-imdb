I'm so upset that ABC is giving up another show that has the chance to be a real winner. This show is so good, the writing and the story were great, an original idea for a show instead of another boring reality show. The casting was spectacular! Not only the characters and actors were on the right track, but also very talented actors. The concept and the idea are really a new and cool idea for a TV show. Many of us share this whole idea of ​​"connections". I love the characters of Steven, Laura, Whitney and Damien. But to be honest, there is no person associated with this show that I did not like, even those who had only a few episodes (Sheri Appleby, for example). Acting and characters are so easy to like and so talented !!. I wish ABC had given this show more of a chance, and the show did not stop halfway. Really unfair !! to all!!. This show was promising. I'll let ABC know how I feel and will keep sending e-mails to keep this show alive. Please join in, I know we can do it. It worked for Jerico. (By the way, where is episode 13? I want the last show!). Please support this show and send emails to ABC, we can do it !!! This show is worth it !!!
