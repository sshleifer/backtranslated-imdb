A prison cell. Four prisoners - Carrere, a young corporate director accused of fraud, the 35-year-old transsexual, Daisy, a 20-year-old deranged idiot, and the sixty-year-old intellectual Lassalle, who was murdered by his wife. Behind a stone slab in the cell, which had mysteriously dissolved, they discovered a book: the diary of a former inmate, Danvers, who occupied the cell at the beginning of the century. The diary contains magic formulas that allegedly empower prisoners to escape. "Malefique" is one of the scariest and most intelligent horror movies I've seen this year. The film has a dirty, shadowy feel, influenced by the work of HP Lovecraft, creating a very eerie and disturbing atmosphere. Some imaginative and brutal death scenes are quite large, and the characters of four prisoners are surprisingly well developed. It's a shame that Eric Valette has made a really terrible remake of "One Missed Call" after his impressive debut 9 out of 10.
