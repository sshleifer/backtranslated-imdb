This movie was great and I would like to buy it. The boy goes with his grandfather to a young eagle. The boy must feed and care for the eagle until he is old enough to be sacrificed for the harvest. The boy saves the eagle from killing and runs away from the trunk. The eagle helps him feed by catching a duck from a small pond that the boy terrifies. Later, the boy shoots a deer, which a tyrant child had alleged, because his arrows were marked very similar. Only until they check the thickness of the red lines, they determine who actually got the deer. However, this was unfortunate because the other boys became even more cruel, and in the end he is chased to a cliff, but when he thinks he will fall off his pure love for the eagle, he turns into a golden eagle with just a necklace as a reminder of who he was. Please, if anyone knows where to buy this movie, please let me know. I have not seen him for over 30 years, but still remember parts of movie.deniselacey2000@yahoo.com
