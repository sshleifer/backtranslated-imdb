William Powell is a doctor who deals with a murder and is an ex-wife in "The Ex-Mrs Bradford," which also features Jean Arthur, Eric Blore, and James Gleason. It seems that Powell had chemistry with almost every woman he worked with. Although he and Myrna Loy were the perfect couple, the actor shot a few other "Thin Man" films, one with Ginger Rogers and this one with Arthur, both very well. <br /> <br /> Somehow one never gets tired of seeing Powell as a witty, ambitious professional, and "The Ex-Mrs Bradford" is no exception. The ex-wife. B served Mr B with a subpoena for hinterland entertainment and then goes back to help him solve a mystery into which she has drawn him. And that's not the first time she's done that! It almost seems as though there was a "Bradford" movie before this or that this should be the first of a series of films - Mr. B. complains that his mysterywriter ex is constantly bringing him into cases. This time, a jockey riding a favorite horse in a raise mysteriously falls off his horse and dies just before the finish line. <br /> <br /> The solution to the case is a little outlandish, but it does not matter. The point is the joke between the couple and the ex-wife's interference. B. Jean Arthur is pretty glamorous and very funny. With an actress who sounds as smart as Arthur, the humor seems deliberate rather than callous. I suspect the writer had something else in mind - like the crazy side of Carole Lombard. When Arthur hears the police arrive, she says, "Ah, it's probably my maintenance, I was waiting for the police to be there." It's more of a rib for Powell than a serious statement. It still works well and shows how a good actress can make a part of her own. Definitely worth a look, as William Powell and Jean Arthur have always been.
