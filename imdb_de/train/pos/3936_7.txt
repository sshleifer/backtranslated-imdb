This is an evocative and idealized portrait of Lincoln's early life (born in 1809 in Hodgensville-Kentucky and died in 1865 in Washington). Ford's brilliant film draws Abraham Lincoln (Fonda) from his youth. He studied Law and Common Law and began his law practice in 1837. This Hollywood biography follows Lincoln from his log cabins, his first relationship with Mary Todd (Weaver), after the couple's first ball and departure for the Congressional candidate. However, the main focus is on brothers (Richard Cromwell, Eddie Quillan) charged with murder, the back court proceedings with amusing court debates and the protection of their mother (Alice Brady). The Lincoln-Fonda defense lawyer and Donald Meek prosecutor are downright brilliant. <br /> <br /> Outstanding performance by Henry Fonda as an idealistic, traveling Springfield lawyer. He should regularly star for Ford in this movie Â¨ Anger of Wrath, my beloved Clementine and Fort Apache ". In addition to Alice Brady acting as a saddened mother, she was a great actress from the silent movie, but this film is her last film because she died of cancer early. Lincoln's evolving deeds make for skillfully engaging nostalgic yearning for old and old values, and describe his kindness, sincerity, and individuality. Lincoln, like John Ford, was a straightforward man who never changed the ideals of his youth. This American masterpiece is correct on both counts, as a splendid biography and as a great drama. <br /> <br /> Further biographies of Abraham Lincoln include: 1) "Abraham Lincoln" (1930) by DW Griffith with Walter Huston, Una Merkel, who speaks from his birth until his murder; 2) "Abe Lincoln in Illinois" (1940) by John Cromwell with Raymond Massey and Ruth Gordon on similar events to Ford's film through his career as a lawyer. 3) TV version titled "Gore Vidals Lincoln" with Sam Waterston and Mary Tyler Moore Mary Todd
