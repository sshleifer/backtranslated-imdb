Each of the big studios released jazzy One-Reelers in the 1930s and 1940s (with Universal taking the lead). Most looked as cheap on the screen as they should be made, but Warner Bros. (who abruptly stopped producing them in 1946) often distinguished them by unusual camera angles, mirrors, and visual effects, thanks to some creative directors like Jean Negulesco , It's fitting that the best of this genre should come from this studio. <br /> <br /> What distinguishes "Jammin 'The Blues" from the others is that it resembles an avant-garde experiment rather than a Hollywood musical. Shot in July 1944, it transforms an ordinary jam session into a "trippy" dream escape from the wartime issues highlighted by the tune of "On The Sunny Side Of The Street." Gjon Mili and cinematographer Robert Burkes (later to work with Hitchcock) had much artistic freedom, perhaps because Lester Young was not Glenn Miller and the studio did not care how he and his fellow musicians were presented. The optical printer is well used, with multiple images of the same actor appearing simultaneously. (Norman McLaren really milked this process two decades later in "Pas De Deux", while Linwood Dunn's team in Citizen Kane had different effects.) The emphasis on silhouettes and burning cigarette smoke was also ahead of its time; In a way, this was before the psychedelic sixties, but with a decidedly '40s film noir style.
