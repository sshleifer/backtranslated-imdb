If you like "Othello", you will love this movie, because half of the movie revolves around the stage production of the piece. <br /> <br /> The film has a great cast with Signe Hasso and Shelley Winters as women Colman's life, while Edmond O'Brien plays the up-and-coming press agent. <br /> <br /> A few of the supportive players I particularly liked were Millard Mitchell as a notorious reporter who finds an angle, and Joe Sawyer, the answer of the forties to Drew Carey, the cop on the case plays. <br /> <br /> Great moments in this with noir realism.
