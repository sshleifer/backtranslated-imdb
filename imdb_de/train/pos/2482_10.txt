The actors play wonderfully, especially Kenneth Branagh himself. It's good that Robin Williams got the comedy role of Osiric, otherwise it might be weird to see him in such a production. It's really great that Kenneth opted for the fullest version of the text, this definitely does not happen very often ... Thanks to that, viewers can see the whole thing, not the parts selected by the director. Also - thank goodness that the movie has a classic form; NO to surrealistic fanfaberies! Although "Tytus Andronicus" was impressive, Hamlet is a different story, at least that's my point of view.
