As a fan of the first Lion King, I was definitely looking forward to this movie, but I knew there was really no way to be as good as the original. I know that many Disney fans are suspicious of direct-to-video movies because I have mixed feelings as well. <br /> <br /> While I was watching The Lion King 1 ½, I tried to figure out what my own point of view was on this movie. In relation to The Lion King, am I so pious that I engage in picnics in certain scenes, or am I just accepting this movie as another glimpse of the Lion King story? Most of the time I hugged the latter. <br /> <br /> The Lion King 1 ½ definitely has his cute and funny moments. Timon and Pumbaa stole the show in the first movie and definitely deserved a movie that turned on them. People love these characters! My favorite parts of the film are the montage of Timon & Pumbaa, who takes care of the young Simba, and the surprising ending with some great cameos. <br /> <br /> I could have done without the many bathing moves, like the real reason everybody bowed down to Lion King at the beginning of Lion King. I think this kind of joke is for the younger set (which is the target audience, after all, I do not think many kids really care about Disney's profit margin -to-video.) <br /> <br /> I'll however, say that I was a little annoyed when they directly linked scenes from the original movie to this film. I am only too well acquainted with the original that these scenes stand out for me like sore thumbs. The music or the voices would be different, which would just distract me. <br /> <br /> As for the music, it was not so bad, but do not expect classics from this movie. At least LK2 had the beautiful ballad "Love Will Find A Way". As for the voicework, it was done well in this movie. Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella were as great as ever, and the new cast, Jerry Stiller and Julie Kavner (known as Marge Simpson), did a great job. You can enjoy these great vocal talents even more by watching the virtual safari on Disc 2 of the DVD. This feature is definitely fun! <br /> <br /> All in all, the Lion King is not a perfect movie, but it's cute and entertaining. I think many Lion King fans will enjoy and appreciate what it is - an entertaining, carefree look at the Lion King masterpiece from the perspective of our fun friends. <br /> <br /> My IMDb rating: 7/10. My Yahoo! Grade: B (good)
