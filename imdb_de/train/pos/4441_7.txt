Okay, before we repeat the meeting, I have to ask, why is not it listed individually? It may have been just a TV article in Italy, but for international Lamberto Bava fans, this is a separate FILM. In America, this movie is distributed as "The Ogre" or "Demons 3" on VHS and DVD. Yeah, I know, it has nothing to do with "Demons," except for a cast member and the crew. But yes, personally, I was upset that this website was so hard to find, which is otherwise so useful. <br /> <br /> Finally, "The Ogre". I often watched the trailer on YouTube and thought it was rather scary. The movie itself (it's a feature length that turns it into a movie) has many strong parts and scares it. I did not like the last act, but on the whole, I do not regret buying the DVD before I saw it (available on Shriek Show). I think the origins of the film explain the last act. I will not spend any spoilers. <br /> <br /> The plot is a little familiar: An American horror writer who goes on vacation in an old, eerie castle with husband and son, to be exact, resembles the environment of her nightmares in her childhood. There are faint echoes of "The Shining," but this is another kind of supernatural horror. The woman (Virginia Bryant) finds more and more evidence that this is the true habitat of her nightmares, but her husband does not believe her. Great atmosphere and horror follow. <br /> <br /> The many nightmare sequences were pretty crazy. The Ogre Cocoon effect was good, it reminded me a bit of Uncle Frank's resurrection from the first Hellraiser. There are also a few good shocks and a successful underwater scene. I give them props that the movie has never stooped to imitate American films with similar concepts, namely, "A Nightmare on Elm Street." "The Ogre" is an original. And the monster itself was scary when it was properly presented. <br /> <br /> The Shriek Show DVD features an interview with Lamberto Bava, in which he carefully states that this is not part of his classic. "Demons" series. He also gives great credit to the real castle where the film was shot. In fact, this attitude contributes a lot to the film. The music of Simon Boswell also helps. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of good stuff here. "The Ogre" is not perfect, but it is well worth seeing. Suppose it is a lesser achievement of Lamberto Bava.
