Fascinating downer on a suspected male robber in New York City who was forced to live in a convicted building with a crippled Con-Man. Extremely gloomy view of the moral and social decline of today, extremely well directed by John Schlesinger (who has never surpassed his work here) and was superbly played by Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman. All in all, quite a punch, but the "fantasy" scenes, some of which are played for a giggle, are slightly intrusive, as is the "mod" drug party. The relationship that develops between the two men is sentimental, but the filmmakers are careful not to get muddied, and this gives the picture an advantage it would not have had with a lesser director than Schlesinger. Originally 1969 X-Rated and winner of the Best Picture Oscar. Screenwriter Waldo Salt (who adapted James Leo Herilhy's book) and Schlesinger also won statues. *** 1/2 of ****
