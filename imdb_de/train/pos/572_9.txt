In response to the person who made the commentary on how the film is drawing and who believed that the role of Jess' brother had no purpose, here's my answer: <br /> <br /> The role of Jess's brother is a form of dramatic irony in the story. Craig Sheffer / Norman could have completely foreseen the problems that had to do with life when they looked at how Jess's brother turned out. There are several instances in which Brad Pitt and his life run in parallel, for example, when Jess' brother brings Craig Sheffer to a disjointed bar and then finds Brad Pitt there a few days later. The dramatic irony was there, so Craig Sheffer's character had a major emotional uproar at his brother's death, knowing he could have done more to prevent it, and creating a compelling mood in the film.
