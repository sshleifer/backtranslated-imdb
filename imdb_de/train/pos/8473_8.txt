This charmingly pleasing and tender sequel to the hugely successful "The Legend of Boggy Creek" is just a name change. There are countless stories in a sleepy, self-contained fishing community of a supposedly evil Bigfoot creature called "Big Bay Ty," nestled deep in the inviting Boggy Creek wetlands. Two brave brothers and their older, more sensible Tomboy sister (a sweet, stubborn notion of cute future "Different Strokes" sitcom star Dana Plato) embark on the treacherous swamp to find out if the creature of the local legend is actually one Being is real life. The trio lose themselves hopelessly in a violent storm and the furry, bear-like, humongous, but very gentle and kind Sasquatch comes to the rescue of the children. <br /> <br /> Tom Moore's casual, straightforward style narrates this simple story at a leisurely pace that captures the everyday minutiae of the rural city in hauntingly accurate detail, drawing the various country characters with great warmth and affection, and thankfully the feeling The adorable Dawn Wells (Mary Ann on "Gilligan's Island") shows a tantalizing and courageous depiction of the loving single mother of the children, while Jim Wilson and John Hofeus make a tempting and courageous statement Provide sexy support when it comes to a few spasmodic, old hay curls. Robert Bethard's capable, sunny cinematography shows the woody environment in its luxurious tranquility, painfully pure and fragile, untouched by the glories of civilization. Darrell Deck's score cleverly blends flesh-scoring synthesizer shudders and cheering banjo-pluckin 'country bluegrass to a sonorous sound. In addition, this picture is a special praise for the unpredictable prediction of the 90s kid's feature Bigfoot in good 15 years in advance.
