Best animated movie ever. This film explores not only the vast world of modern animation with absolutely fluctuating effects, but also the branches of the human mind, soul and philosophy. The story reveals a cat family where the younger brother sees it in the big sister and saves her body, but when she awakens, she remains without a soul. The two sibling cats go on a journey to find them. I have linked this journey with many things. The world history, the Bible, the life cycle and every time I see it, I discover more and more hidden topics and metaphors. If you do not like the physiological aspect, you will still love it. The animation is superb and the creative scenes will append you to the screen. For example, the ocean freezes in time, God eats soup out of the earth, a strange and slightly SNM retelling of Hansel and Gretel. Finally, Cat Soup is an absolute treat for everyone. <br /> <br /> PS- Not for kids, including violence.
