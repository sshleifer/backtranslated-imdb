"Twelve Monkeys" has all the elements to become the masterpiece of Terry Gilliam. An excellent script, a sustained rhythm, clever, sometimes ironic dialogues. He also had a good nose for the cast. "Twelve Monkeys" is also the first film in which Bruce Willis differs from the kind of character he used in his previous films. Here was a desiccated and hopeless character who could be called a prisoner, a fearless and invincible hero (as in Die Hard). No matter how he tries, he is a prisoner of the time. The film also contains a very exciting ending. It has a really dramatic power. But this great movie is also a reflection on humans, the dangers that they fear (especially those that could cause the end of the world, and these are viruses that can cause disease). Regardless of how long it will take, "twelve monkeys" are valued for their true value: one of the masterpieces of the nineties.
