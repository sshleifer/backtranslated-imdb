I've searched for the name of this movie for years. I was 14 when I think it was televised in 1983. All I can remember was a teenage girl who survived a plane crash ONLY AND survived the Amazon. I remember that people were looking for her (family) and that she knew how to take care of herself - she tells the story and I vividly remember her knowing that bugs were under her skin. I can not remember this movie and want to see it again - if it's the same - and if one of you has a copy, can you email me at horsecoach4hire@hotmail.com? I would be curious to get a copy to see if it really is the same movie that I remember. It was aired in Thanksgiving (USA) in 1983, and I've been through issues myself, and this movie really did affect me. Thank you in advance!
