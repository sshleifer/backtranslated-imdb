This is a brilliant political satire. No wonder why it was largely ignored in the US: It makes our murderous foreign policy what it really is. <br /> <br /> Another good film from that time, Rendition, has also been completely rejected, simply because it has clearly shown that the US is a war machine designed to torture civilians in their quest for total world domination to kill and mutilate. <br /> <br /> Marisa Tomei Anyone else?) And some scenes of amusement should have made this movie a hit. Unfortunately, Americans do not like to hear the truth about themselves, especially when they are complicit in mass murder.
