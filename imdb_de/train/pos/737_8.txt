It's amazing that actress P. J. Soles did not become a big star after playing Riff Randall, the # 1 fan of punk rock group Ramones, at Rock 'n' Roll High School. Soles is so effusive that it does not bother you that she's obviously too old to be in high school (this fact is offset by the fact that all the kids look 24). The film is a fast-paced joke that does not distract; In the end, everything is torn to pieces, and that's exactly how it should be. Mary Woronov, a naturally perverse and witty Nazi-style rector, gets a great, unique piece at the beginning, where frisbees fly dangerously close to her head (how many takes did she use, or was it a coincidence?) and Dey Young is very appealing as Soles best Kate Rambeau. Ironically, the weakest link in this "high school" chain is the Ramones. They can not act, they are not funny and their concert segment takes too long. A Ramones song "I Want You Around" is treated as a fantasy and is well captured; other random songs are good, especially a rare Paul McCartney ballad heard at the beginning ("Have we met anywhere before?"). Have fun! *** from ****
