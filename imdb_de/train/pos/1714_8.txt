I was in a very light mood and this movie is easy too, but the end of the movie is just unexpected, remembering a long memory. <br /> <br /> The film begins with Abhay and his profession of being a witness during marriage. Soha does not get married and his friend does. He leaves Soha alone on the street she can not return home, and she has no business here in this situation. Abahy turns out to be an assistant to her The basis of the story. <br /> <br /> The rest can only be seen and the end of the story is bitterly sweet that Abhay has to face what keeps you at the edge of the seat. <br /> <br /> Dialogues and music are good songs. The direction is good, and as the script is, the movie is slow, but if you look at the story's requirements, everything is alright. I enjoyed it at home with coke and peanuts. My rating for this is 8/10
