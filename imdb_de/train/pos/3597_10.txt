(Spoiler) <br /> <br /> This movie blew me away. I rented a bit on movielink and decided to watch this movie. Many boxing movies seem to overflow the blood. In this movie it is shown on the Amature level. I hope that perhaps more attention has been paid to improving their grades. The film highlights the issues some families face with gender. <br /> <br /> I was a bit worried about the end. But the end was not a disappointment. <br /> <br /> I think the title made it clear that she would win. Unexpected was that the two came together again in the end. <br /> <br /> The score for some scenes was very good. We recommend. <br /> <br /> 10/10 <br /> <br /> Quality: 9/10 <br /> <br /> Entertainment: 10/10 <br /> <br /> Playable: 10/10
