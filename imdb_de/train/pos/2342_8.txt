Yesterday I saw the pie-lette and the word that comes to my mind is "original". It's a word that's not much used on TV, as everyone tends to copy what the other network is doing, and you have seven nights of crime shows, listless comedies, and reality shit that hit me like a brick was the presence by Jim Dale. Those unfamiliar with the British "Carry On ..." series or who have not heard a Harry Potter book may not be familiar with Dale. I am not sure if his presence as a narrator adds or distracts anything. I'll have to turn more on, but the show gets a "Harry Potter" atmosphere. Maybe that's a good thing. Lee Pace (Infamous, The White Countess) has a gift. It never explains where he got it, but he can bring someone back from the dead for a minute. He collaborates with Chi McBride ("Boston Public", Roll Bounce) to solve murders with this talent. Everything is good and funny until he comes across a childhood love, Anna Friel (Aim! The Dream Begins, Timeline) and things get really complicated. He can not send her back and he can never touch her. Boy, that would make a relationship difficult. <br /> <br /> I will turn myself on to see where this series is going, in the expectation that it will continue to entertain.
