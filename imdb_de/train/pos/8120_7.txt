Things to Come is an early sci-fi movie that depicts an imaginary world or "everytown" over 100 years. You can split it into about 4 different scenes or parts. The film spans from 1940 to 2036, and focuses on how this ruler or "boss" wanted to fly back in planes after Everytown was bombed and the war broke out had about 3 bugs: the audio is muddy and the video had a few quirks, the characters are not deep at all and the overall picture is not quite solid. The plot lacks something I can not afford to finger ... it just seems a bit 'fluffy'. But if you love Sci-Fi and are interested in what H. G. Wells could happen in the next hundred years, this is a must. It is worth seeing what everyone feared: a long, protracted war, because they were on the verge of going to war with Germany, and there was a danger of biological weapons and everything. > Things to Come is a pretty good movie that most people have to see.
