TACHIGUI: THE AMAZING LIFE OF FAST-FOOD GRIFTERS Japanese Title: Tachiguishi Retsuden <br /> <br /> Director: Mamoru Oshii With: Toshio Suzuki, Mako Hyodo, Kenji Kawai, Shinji Higuchi, Katsuya Terada By Koichi Yamadera --- ----------------------------------- <br /> <br /> Back in 1995, Mamoru Oshii unleashed his dazzling animation feature "Ghost In The Shell", which he used to consolidate the international acceptance of anime - and also dug into the overall concept of Andy and Larry Wachowski for The Matrix. <br /> <br /> The sequel to the movie Innocence (2004)), was the first Japanese animated film to be contested for the Palme d'Or in Cannes, and aroused both style and innovative effects as well as its often unfathomable Action a big role. <br /> <br /> Always the trendsetter, Oshii has now introduced us to Tachigui: The Amazing Life of Fast Food Grippers? which has absolutely nothing to do with Ghost In The Shell, nor with a Japanese anime. <br /> <br /> Say to Oshiis creation "Superlivemation": Not an animation or live action. Instead, the cast was somewhere close to 30,000 snapshots, digitally processed and reconstituted in a deceptively simple form of a paper cut reminiscent of Balinese puppetry. The movement itself is a stilted stop-motion style that repeats sequences from Shinya Tsukamoto's experimental Tetsuo: Iron Man (1988). "I can not think of any other method than this," Oshii recently said in an interview with The Daily Yomiuri. "I realized that this project is not suitable for traditional animations." <br /> <br /> The cast selection is just as puzzling. Kenji Kawai - who also composed the superlative soundtrack - appears as an avid burger fanatic while renowned studio Ghibli producer Toshio Suzuki has bizarrely murdered his on-screen time. Others are Katsuya Terada, who explored Oshii for Blood: The Last Vampire, and Shinji Higuchi - a special effect who worked on Godzilla films. Koichi Yamadera's story sounds like a dry NHK documentation ?? which disregards the comic undertone here as well as the expansive career of Yamadera stoic anime characters like Spike Siegel in Cowboy Bebop. <br /> <br /> And the plot itself is a bizarre remake of post-World War II Japan in the context of various fast food off-shoots - from soba ramen shops to Gyudon standbars; American dogs in heat trays from convenience stores to McDonalds-inspired burger restaurants. "Food is a primal root of desire," Oshii explained. <br /> <br /> The mix includes a new kind of consumer: the fast-food breeders of the title, people who do not like to pay for their tucker and constantly refine their sophisticated scams to earn points free munchies < br /> <br /> Oshii said his ulterior motive pays homage to the "art" of eating on the streets? Something that is still considered taboo in this country and the title explains the use of "Tachigui". <br /> <br /> The Director of Live Action Movies (Avalon, Stray Dog) In addition to animation, Oshii has often blurred the definition between the two media. The celluloid result is somewhere in the gray area between the two formats. <br /> <br /> Sometimes the visual experiment here is as exciting as it can be irritating. Just do not ask what everything should mean. Oshiis' films, which are equally cerebral and innovative, are often not very clear in terms of history. Where does Oshii succeed with a liberal dose of black humor? Here's Kentucky Fried Rat, Death by Hula-Hoop, the world's fastest samurai burger chef. and in the nature of the film of surrealism. <br /> <br /> This is a man who shifts away from the influence of filmmakers like Godard and Truffaut, possibly owing Andrei Tarkovsky as much as David Lynch. So it should come as no surprise that a B-52 bomber once flies through a Yoshinoya-like franchise. The 54-year-old director seemed to take it for granted. "The Japan that I have portrayed in the film is not necessarily true to reality," he suggested. <br /> <br /> Of course. -------------- <br /> <br /> From Andrez mountains
