If you have heart and compassion for the people, this is a difficult movie, at least in the second half. <br /> <br /> It is in this segment where we see a small child being beaten up and then a retarded (mentally handicapped) man walking out of the deep end after seeing this brutal act against the child. It is not a pleasant material. <br /> <br /> However, it is a good movie and the acting is good too. The story will sit with you for a while. <br /> <br /> "Dominick" is the mentally handicapped and is played by Tom Hulce. I think this is Hulce's best role ever. He is supervised by a medical student "Eugene" played by Ray Liotta, who became a star with Kevin Costner's "Field Of Dreams" the following year. Dominick is a kind-hearted garbage man who reads. Hulk's comics and love wrestling, he's the type of "slower" guy that you can not help but love and live to lead a happy life, if he freaks out, there are several good reasons and ... well, watch the movie for the full story, it's well worth your time, but get ready to go on a real emotional roller coaster and possibly get excited about some things you see.
