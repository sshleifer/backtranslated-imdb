I've never understood why the MacDonald Eddy Swan song has always been banned so mercilessly - not just by its critics, but by virtually everyone. For me, "I Married an Angel" is more vivid and imaginative than all the duo's celebrated tours. The sets and costumes are as elaborate as in an MGM musical. The script comes from the reliable Anita Loos ("San Francisco", "The Women", "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes", etc.), the Rodgers and Hart tunes (albeit a bit modified by MacDonald Eddy tribe members Bob Wright and Chet Forrest ) are celestially treated by Herbert Stothart (Oscar winner for "The Wizard of Oz"), and best of all, the "singing darlings" look great in their contemporary clothes and seem to enjoy the bizarre procedures. Try to show the uninitiated today "Rose Marie" or "Sweethearts" and may find it hard to sit still, but this unconventional, fast-paced fantasy is irresistible.
