A well-made movie with a tragic ending. Pluses: The way the story moves - begins with Soorya fighting for life, followed by a long flashback of why he's there. The music. A disinterested look at the lives of the police. Minuses: The violence and the blood, but I think they contribute to the realistic effects. However, it could have been avoided that the heads of the people were cut off and boxes and sacks were sent. <br /> <br /> No complaints - 7/10
