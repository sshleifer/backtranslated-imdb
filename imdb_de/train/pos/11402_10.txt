I saw "An American in Paris" on his first release when I was still at school and instantly fell in love with her. I saw it again the next day and did not count how many times I've seen it since, both in the movies and on TV. Some of the best tunes and songs of the greatest popular composer of the twentieth century (George Gershwin) are used fantastically and the greatest dancers (Gene Kelly) and dancers (Leslie Caron) of Hollywood history are introduced. The understudy of Oscar Levant (as quirky as ever), Georges Guetary (why did not he make more movies?) And Nina Foch (brilliant in an unsympathetic role) are at the top of their form. The final ballet, which was excellently choreographed to the theme music, exploits the sights and sounds of Paris as well as the images of impressionist and post-impressionist artists. All the Gershwin songs are beautifully staged, but the most memorable ones are "It's Very Clear" (Caron and Kelly on the banks of the Seine) and "I Got Rhythm" (The Children of Paris, Gene Kelly in "Une Chanson Americaine" have connected). , If you love Paris, you will see this movie. If you've never been to Paris in your life, look at it. But see it!
