Old People Show ???? I'm 15 and watch the show since I was 12 years old and have recorded it every day from Hallmark and BBC 1 in my Sky + Box. I really wish they had not canceled them, they did not even have a proper farewell. But what an adventure, all those episodes, I think I've seen them all, and it does not occur to me that I did not like and enjoyed the murder and "murder she wrote" - I've never seen it and do not intend it either. In any case, the characters in Diagnoses Murder are so profound and the chemistry between the actors is amazing. It was really a sad day when they canceled the show ...
