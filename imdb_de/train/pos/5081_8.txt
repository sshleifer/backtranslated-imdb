This movie was great and even with a less than convincing ending it is still worth watching. The movie begins when Claudette Colbert marries Robert Ryan. When the minister asks if anyone has any objections, a man jumps up and announces that Colbert can NOT marry because she is already married !! Colbert insists that this is not true, but if they investigate, they find that peace justice and many others remember their wedding and even have a signed wedding license! Slowly it becomes clear that Claudette's mind wanes and the people around her seriously doubt her reason. Then, when the alleged first husband is murdered, all evidence and suspicions fall on Colbert. <br /> <br /> The movie is an exciting mystery suspense movie, as I've only described the first half of the movie so far. What follows is amazingly intelligent and captivating. Unfortunately, the conclusion is a little disappointing as it turns out that the leader is behind "everything from the left field" - and it's confusing because it was so unexpected and impossible to guess the information given to the viewer. Still, the movie was so good that I can even apologize for the flimsy end. Above all, Robert Ryan did a great job as a fianc√©, who also rendered the other services next to him.
