I must confess I have not read the original story of M R James, though I've read many of his other supernatural stories. I have also seen most of the BBC Christmas Ghost Stories, and in my opinion, most of them surpass them, they just correspond to The Signalman - The direction and the "mood" is perfect, as well as the spectacle, the light and of course the story and the writing. I really enjoyed that and can only hope for more quality from the same director and production team. I understand that the BBC is going to do more (which is not necessarily based on the stories of Mr James). That's promising. <br /> <br /> 10/10
