So we made a compromise. This was a pretty charming movie, I liked the art direction (it felt a lot "more real" than most children's movies), and the costumes were not too cute. The children actors were not bad looking (the adult appearances were too cheesy). It was great to show how a bullied child harasses others as well as children who oppose bullying. <br /> <br /> I do not know how many adults want to see this for themselves, but it's great movie to take a kid. And since "Barnyard" seems to have been visited by more than 100 children at the same time, I'm REALLY glad we chose the sparsely visited exhibition of "worms" instead.
