When I rented this movie to watch it, I knew it would not be a Mindbender movie. Instead, I found it a disbelief in reality where someone is severely beaten. And you know what it works. Kurt Russel did a remarkable job in what I thought when he showed the emotionless soldier he was. I recommend this movie if you are traveling with the guys and want to watch a good action movie.
