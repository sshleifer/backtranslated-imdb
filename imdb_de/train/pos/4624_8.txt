Believe it or not, Inspector Gadgets last case is what fascinated me about the whole gadget thing. <br /> <br /> My name is Miriam and I'm 12 years old so obviously I was not near Inspector Gadget at the top of his career. Sure, I had heard of him, but I did not really know him. <br /> <br /> As you read, note that I've never seen the original series (I would if they came!). This is pretty much the only gadget I've ever seen (though I'm obsessed now) and I'll focus on what I liked because everyone else is so negative. For all pessimists I have a few disadvantages as well. = P First of all, for a childish sense of humor, this movie could be considered quite funny. I thought it would be so, sue me. I also thought that the animations and character designs were good, and I am also glad that there are more gadgets in them because it is my favorite character. (I do NOT like Penny.) Then there was Claw (but his voice was awful) and the Madcat. I thought they were pretty well done too. Gadgets nonsense seemed pretty good, though not over the top (ie thumb bathing on the hat of the hand but would take a good screenshot = P) Oh, and I liked the song that was in the credits. Yes, I'm funny. <br /> <br /> And as with all films, there are also some negatives. <br /> <br /> Cars talk? What about it? It can be said that this was aimed at younger boys. That would not bother me so much if the cars did not save the day. I would have preferred it if Penny and Brain had taken their place. And apparently Gadget loved his car more than you would call it natural. A little weird, to say the least. <br /> <br /> Oh, and the Chief was downright mean for Gadget. I mean, gosh, yes, he was not always the happiest guy, but he did not hate gadget, which I've read. Like the Inspector, his personality was exaggerated. Well, that's pretty much all I have to say about this movie. I found the animation to compensate for the auto-centered plot and pretty decent overall. more than the live action gadget movies (butchered, slaughtered, BUTCHERED!). Maybe I'm just biased because I've got into gadget in the first place, or maybe my mind is twisted or maybe I'm just weird, but I really liked this movie, even though I'm the oldest one recommended.
