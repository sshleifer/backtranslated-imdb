For those of you who have read the highly acclaimed novel by Rohinton Mistry, this movie will definitely impress you because it is an honorable adaptation. With the exception of a small subplot Sturla Gunnarson's feature film debut is a nearly total reissue of the book (except for the last line). For those of you who have not read the novel, this movie might be a bit tricky. It's certainly not a big movie drama story. Instead, it has a strong element of realism, but I could not help it. The best way to describe such a long journey for movie fans would be to say that this is a small Hindu version of 'Fiddler On The Roof'. Instead of a Jewish-Russian milkman is the protagonist Gustad Noble banker in the 70s-Bombay during the Muslim / Hindi war with Pakistan. He is forced to deal with a series of unexpected problems in his life, including his sick daughter, his eldest son, a distant friend, who brings him to an unhealthy neighborhood with some dirty money. The end is neither happy nor sad, but that's essentially what realism implies. <br /> <br /> Such a long journey is a nice little movie, but if you want to see it, then good luck with the search. Unlike the novel, it has released very little.
