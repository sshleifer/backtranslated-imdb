I watched the movie today and it just blew me away. It's a true masterpiece of art and I do not understand why most people think it's rubbish. The main idea of ​​the movie - take your ego and then you will have real power! This was the main battle at the end of the film, and Guy Ritchie has shown it in a great way. "The biggest enemy will hide in the last place you'll ever look at" - remember the movie? Because our true enemy is in us - it is our ego ... The voice that always tells us that we are important, that gives us our pride, that tells us not to give, but only to take away, what our aggression creates want to have control, that creates all negative feelings and thoughts. GR has amazingly expressed this idea and has shown that the only way to gain real control is to lose control and let go of your personal meaning. A great movie!
