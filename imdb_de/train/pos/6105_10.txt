All Kira Reed fans MUST see this. The premise of the film has made Roma novelist Kira hard to come up with any new ideas. She also has a divorce behind her. However, she meets this guy in a restaurant and he helps her out of her bowl (and clothes). They go into a corner room and do it. Fortunately, Kira gets a condom out (never tell me these Playboy movies are worthless piles of soft fluff.) Think of kids, safe sex). Later, she wonders how great it was with her publisher, but she did not get his name. Nevertheless, the guy finds them and they continue their kinky games. But eventually she gets tired of his cunning and wants to know more. When she does, hell breaks loose and I leave it at that. This is by far the best of these softcore playboys movies I've ever seen. Take a look at this and marvel at the size of Kira.
