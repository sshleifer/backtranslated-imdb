A well-made film that plays in communist Yugoslavia in the early 1960s. The five young actors who put the teenagers at the heart of the story give strong, sincere and emotionally deep performances. A clear illustration of how teenagers' natural confidence and naivety can be easily manipulated and how it has affected the rest of their lives. Highly recommended.
