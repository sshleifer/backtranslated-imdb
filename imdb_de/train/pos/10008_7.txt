You know, Robin Williams, god bless him, has been shooting himself in the foot lately, with all the stupid comedies he's done this decade (with the exception of "Death To Smoochy") that exploded on the show, but now a cult classic). The dramas he has done lately have been fantastic, especially "Insomnia" and "One Hour Photo". "The Night Listener" is one of his best works despite mediocre reviews and a quick DVD release. It's a very daunting story, even though there's no serial killer or anyone else physically dangerous for that matter. The concept of the film is based on an actual fraud case that has not yet been officially confirmed. In high school, I read an autobiography of a child named Anthony Godby Johnson, who suffered terrible abuse and eventually AIDS. I was touched by the story until I read online reports that Johnson may not really exist. When I saw this movie, the confused feelings that Robin Williams portrayed so brilliantly appeared in my mind. Toni Collette probably also gives her best dramatic performance as the ultimately sociopathic "caretaker". Her role was far removed from those she had in films like "Little Miss Sunshine". Sometimes she looked at the camera, where I thought she was staring right at me. It takes a good actress to play that kind of role and it's this unobtrusive (but well-proven) role that makes Toni Collette one of the best actresses of this generation, not even nominated for an Oscar (from 2008) , , It is unbelievable that there is at least one woman in this world who is like that and it is also scary. <br /> <br /> This is a good, dark movie that I highly recommend. Be prepared, however, to feel insecure, because this movie gives you a weird feeling in the end.
