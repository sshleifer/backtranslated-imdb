Author / director John Hughes covered (as usual) all the basics with this bittersweet "Sunday Afternoon" family movie. "Curly Sue" is a sweet, precocious orphan cared for by "childhood" Bill. The two live off their brains as they travel through the magnificent USA of A. Fate compares her to a "very pretty" yuppie lawyer, and the rest is predictable. <br /> <br /> Kids will love this movie as they can relate to the heroine, played by the 9-year-old Alisan Poter (who became the "you go girl!" of Pepsi commercials). The character should be about 6 or 7, as she is urged to think about the school. Part of her vocabulary suggests that she is nine years or older every day. <br /> <br /> Similar to "Home Alone", there are a lot of slap sticks and little fists that beat big, fat chin-strokes. Again, this is a "formula" movie production aimed at a young audience. Entertaining and heartwarming. Do not look for surprises, but be prepared to shed one or two tears.
