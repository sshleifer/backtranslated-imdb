My observations: Vamp outfit in the end is gorgeous and wonderful, exotic and fantastic. Jeanette wore it well and got on with the naive Nelson. The boat that crashed onto his balcony was right for him. The costume outfits of his female mafia were designed surprisingly well, especially by today's standards. In 1942 the costume designer did an excellent job. Majorong theme simply lovely. Beware of negative posters: 1942 was time of World War II; Pearl Harbor happened a year ago. The US has just come out of the Great Depression. I had to get out and spend so hard earned money for the distraction of song, dance and fantastic imagination. Despotic dictators tried out there in RL to rule and extinguish the freedoms. Luckily, the audience had to watch these fantastic feature films. The movie was a privileged treat in these depressing times. When you turn negative posters into actors or even movie stars, YOU have room for conversation and criticism. Jeanette and Nelson's films pass the test of time. <br /> <br /> angel wings wonderful, to the true angel. RL Wings on the costume party not so hot, but great on Jeanette, considering the SL. <br /> <br /> Beautiful vocals by Jeanette and Nelson as always. Jeanette dancing was a real pleasure. <br /> <br /> 15/10
