The most moving and truly eye-open documentation ever created. I cried all the way from beginning to end. When you look at the show, you are immediately struck by the struggle of a man without living in pain and living a life that we take for granted. When I first heard the title, I was almost afraid to see the program. It was hard for me to live in agony every day of my life. I really felt for him. The saddest part of the documentary is when Jonny picks his casket. Could you imagine that? All the more, even though he was in agonizing and unbearable pain, he still opened his own charity. (DEBRA) Jonny is one of the few people who deserve real respect and admiration. He is the definition of a role model. What a true and indisputable hero he was!
