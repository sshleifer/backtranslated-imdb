What is included on this disk is a first class show of a first frequency band. This CD is NOT for the faint of heart ... the music is incredibly intense and very cool. Watching this movie will tell you why The Who was so tall for so long. It's true that their records were great, but their shows were at the top of the pile. When this concert was shot in 1969, the screaming teen boppers who threw gummy bears at the Beatles had disappeared, and the bands (and audiences) had established themselves as long and often amazing musical virtuosos - something that only a few of them could have intellectual curiosity in the age of canned music by Britney and Christina. What you learn here in particular is the amazing things that can happen when gifted musicians are encouraged to improvise. Try the concert, it's really amazing.
