Why does a good actress like Elizabeth Berkley play in this movie? !!! The cast provides some good performances (Elizabeth Berkley as a Barbie girl, Ele Keats as a girl without a mother and Justin Whalin, a man eternally relieved of his troubles), but the direction is extremely boring and the story is NOT so interesting and original. I can not believe that a movie like this was produced for the big screen! Julie Corman (the producer): Are you crazy ??? !!!
