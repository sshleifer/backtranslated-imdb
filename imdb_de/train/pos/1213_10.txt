This film contradicts the first in terms of the origins of Care Bears and Care Bear cousins. I will not deny that. However, if you consider "Part II" as a separate movie, this is a very good movie. I remember seeing it in the early '80s (and fitting into the target audience at the time) and absolutely loved it more than the first movie (not that I did not enjoy it either, it just seemed like this one) had something extra). Sure, it's darker than the first, but maybe that's why it's so good. And it's also darker in a deeper, more subtle way (the kids may not quite understand, but they could still be a little scared because of the atmosphere it sets off, and watching adults will certainly get faster as I watch this movie again twenty), where you basically complete a young girl with a bad spirit / demon in exchange for something else. Understand? But watching as a kid, as I said before, was maybe a bit scary, but nothing traumatic. If anything, it gave me another fantasy game that I could play when I was that age. I can not tell you how many times I pretend Dark Heart wanted to lock me up, I'd help him catch the Care Bears, turn me to his dark side, and so on. The movie was also good for my imagination. And it also has a great emotional depth. I saw it at least once a week. <br /> <br /> Also Hadley Kay was the perfect choice for the voice of Dark Heart (I always thought so and always will). <br /> <br /> It's a pity they never released a soundtrack. Sometimes I just want to hear Growing Up without watching the movie, as good as it gets. <br /> <br /> "What is love and care when it can not save her?"
