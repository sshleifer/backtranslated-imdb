This movie shows the life and times of William Castle. In the 1950s / 1960s, he made a series of low-budget horror films, which he sold with gimmicks. In "13 ghosts" you need spectators to see the ghosts (they were in color, the movie was in black and white). "The Tingler" had theater seats that were equipped with a buzzer that shook the audience as a monster escapes into a movie theater. "Marabre" has given all members a life insurance in the event that they were scared to death! The films themselves were pretty bad, but the gimmicks made people rush to see them. In this document, there are interviews with Castle-inspired directors, actors in his films, and his daughter. It also comes into his domestic life and the kind of man he was (he was a great guy). The documentation is lovely, very funny and absolutely fascinating. It's very short (under 90 minutes) and it never gets boring. A must for Castle fans and horror movie fans. My only complaint - very few sequences of his pictures were shown. That being said, that's just great.
