I grew up in southwest Virginia. I'm about the same age as Homer Hickam (or a year older than), author of The Rocket Boys, the book that is the true story of this heartwarming movie. <br /> <br /> So I'm closely related to the coal mining issue in West Virginia and the amazing effect that Sputnik had on us back then (October 4, 1957). The Rocket Boys made a great life for themselves. I then graduated in physics and computer science. All because Sputnik had woken up many young people to the "science gap" the US government had in the days of the Cold War in the US ... <br /> <br /> This is a wonderful movie for all ages. But if you grew up in West Virginia in the late fifties, that touches your core. <br /> <br /> Everyone: Get it; look at it; Recommend it to your friends ... who will often thank you.
