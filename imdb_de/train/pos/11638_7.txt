I had fun seeing Red Eye. It's not a masterpiece, but it's well-directed and structured. Cillian Murphy and Rachel McAdams are perfect in the role. Yes, it's the same old story with a different attitude, but Wes Craven set a good pace. At least not another scream with the usual college killer. It's nice to see a clean, coherent thriller, even if originality does not stand out as a main character. Especially from a filmmaker like Craven, who has brought so many innovative ideas into the thriller and horror genre in the past, and who is now well suited to bringing home a good TV movie that would not be screened in the movies , Well done!
