I am 14 years old and I love this cartoon. Burt Reynolds and Dom Deluise are a great couple. This movie is really funny and I love the songs. My favorite songs are "You Can not Keep a Good Dog" and this song about sharing, I think it means "What belongs to me is yours". This was the last movie with Judith Barsi, who played the voice of Anne-Marie. My favorite character is Charlie, but I think Itchy's voice is so much fun. Although I found some scenes really dreadful, I still find it hard to see the scene with Charlie's dream, and Carface scares me. Other characters like King Gator I found very funny. The end was adorable and actually sad, I had to cry a little bit. I give this movie 7/10.
