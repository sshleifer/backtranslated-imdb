The only flaw missing in this film is Shue's role as a daughter who wants to follow in her "aunt's" footsteps as a soap star on the day. Otherwise it would be a perfect 10. <br /> <br /> It seems every actor has enjoyed his roles and played too much to fulfill both his own enjoyment and the script. it takes place in parts. It was well staffed and there are some classic lines that will stay with you. <br /> <br /> It's a fantastic movie everyone should see at least once. I would recommend not to drink anything that would sting your nose. <br /> <br /> You'll definitely want to watch the last scene closely, 'Sister Nan' has a little secret that she would rather not have shared with you. <br /> <br /> If you love or despise soaps during the day, this exercise is fun in the right places.
