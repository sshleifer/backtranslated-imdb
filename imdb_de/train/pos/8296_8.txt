In Suburbia, everything is idyllic when the small family moves in, as the father has gotten a new job in a computer company there. But no paradise would be perfect without its serpent. Strange things happen when the family is taken to the local country club without a husband, as it certainly holds secrets. The father is not a carpenter, but he is under pressure because everyone who is in the neighborhood and in the workplace is a member. Robert Urich's good part is a bit lukewarm, but Joanna Cassidy is a good-natured housewife who does uncomfortable sizzles. Exciting and well-made chiller with the bitchy Susan Lucci as club leader. Look out for cult favorite Michael Berryman, who acts in some ways as valet. The film captures the feeling of paranoia and the finale of special effects is well worth the wait. I've seen this movie a few times already.
