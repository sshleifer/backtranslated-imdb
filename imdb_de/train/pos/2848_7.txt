New York, I Love You is a collective work of eleven short films, each lasting about 10 minutes. The shorts are not accurate, but they all have something in common, love. Every short film is about finding love. Either a couple or two strangers chatting with each other. The film features cast members such as Shia LaBeouf, Natalie Portman, Hayden Christensen, Orlando Bloom, Chris Cooper, Andy Garcia, Christina Ricci and Irrfan Khan, Robin Wright Penn, Julie Christie, Ethan Hawke, Bradley Cooper, Rachel Bilson and Anton Yelchin. With such a great cast and such an interesting premise, I expected a great movie; The problem is New York, I love you does not count. It remains the sum of its parts. Some of the segments are funny, original and interesting, but others are so meaningless (Orlando Bloom / Christina Ricci and Ethan Hawke / Maggie Q segments) that it's appalling. The movie is definitely bumpy and has a very experimental sound. In terms of story, it seems like some film students could be put together. However, the movie also has some great moments. One of the best is the section on an old couple, played by Eli Wallach and Cloris Leachman, who were walking on their 67th anniversary in Brooklyn. And there are moments like these that wish me as a spectator, the film would be more stable, because there is a lot of potential here. As unsatisfactory as the whole story may be, film and soundtrack saved everything for me. The cut was perfect, the way the movie was shot was very impressive and the ethereal soundtrack could not be more appropriate. In the end, New York I Love You feels like an experimental movie, and like most experiences, there are ups and downs. It's how you look at the movie as a whole that determines whether you enjoy it or not. It may be worthwhile for some and for other wasting time. <br /> <br /> 7/10
