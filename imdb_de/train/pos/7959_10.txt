This is a really cool movie! I remember the first time I saw it when I was very young, and I've seen it like once a week ... Shadow was my favorite character in the movie. Homeward Bound is really fun and it's really cool how they train the animals to do all these things. However, parts of the movie are sad (for example, when Sassy, ​​the cat, falls down the waterfall, and when Shadow falls into the hole at the end). I saw the second Homeward Bound, but I have to say it's not so good like that first. Shadow is the smart one, Sassy is good, Sassy and Chance is the funny idiot. I recommend this movie to anyone who likes comedy or talks animals. This is one of my ten favorite movies!
