I did not have many expectations in the movie, but I thought it was fantastic. Pierce Brosnan is outstanding in a very different role. He dumped the sleek Armani suits for a ridiculous look and shows he's a great actor. Pierce and Greg Kinnear are great and have long been one of the better partner couples. The humor is dark, the performances of Brosnan, Kinnear and Hope Davis are great. Mix this with a touching element in the story about friendship and you have a great movie. This is probably one of the best buddy comedies in a long time. This is a film that clearly shows that we can expect great things in Brosnan's career after the Bond era.
