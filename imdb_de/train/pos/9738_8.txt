Oh dear, we do not like it when our superhero love interest develops a brain, are we doing something? Story / comedy? Kirsten Dunst is a revelation - funny, sexy and real. I laughed aloud at least five times, and I'm not ashamed to say that I also had tears in my eyes a few times. The cast, the acting and the script are great, I watch a lot of movies down the line and have never seen anyone in the genre so successful. Those who disagree, please tell me where to find some! I'm sure the book is good too, but I think you have to judge it by your own merit.
