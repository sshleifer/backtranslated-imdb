"Nothing". There's nothing in Room 237. "But you have nothing to do anyway, so stay outside, you understand, stay out." <br /> <br /> There has never been so much psychological horror as this movie. This is the top rated horror movie of all and rightly so. Jack Nicholson is a great actor, and this is one of the biggest performances in the cinema. It's about a family that moves to a secluded and deserted hotel for 5 months in the winter. Then the father (Jack) is almost obsessed with the horrors in the hotel. <br /> <br /> Kubrick's direction is nothing but perfect. The tense tracking footage, agonizing music, mystical messages and confusing acts make this movie the best horror movie ever made. <br /> <br /> Throughout the film, there is constant evidence of danger, death and horror. Red is used in each scene. Is the red intentionally used by Kubrick? Naturally !. <br /> <br /> This is a definite Kubrick classic and this is the third of his films I rated 10/10. He is a perfectionist in his direction and you can see it in all his films. He loves to amaze his viewers in any of his films. <br /> <br /> I will talk about this movie for months. It has an infinite depth. <br /> <br /> In summary, this is the foundation for horror and suspense. A masterpiece of terror 10/10
