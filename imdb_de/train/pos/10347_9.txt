Adorable little movie, juggling comedy and detective, romance and drama genre, as nimble as Lt Kenny Williams's devotion to his girl Maxine Carroll and his duty to the troupe as Ace detective Hodge-Podge may not be appealing to all viewers today, but at the time it had something to offer every member of the movie family, and the solution to the rather weary sense-duty plot is original and refreshing, and well worth the wait. <br /> <br /> "The Amazing Mr. Williams" contains probably the most outrageous blind dates in film history, and his cheerful comic book sparkles. Melvyn Douglas delivers some of the best proverbs dressed in disgust: "I would walk down Main Street in a Turkish towel before allowing a woman to control my life!" And the bubbly Joan Blondell lets her barbs fly with the typical Aplomb: "Mourning, you look like my Aunt Nellie!" <br /> <br /> The solution to the crime is a standard rate, although a fine cast of character actors helps bring the material to life. <br /> <br /> From today's point of view "The Amazing Mr. Williams." "Perhaps most interesting for his insightful commentary on gender as a socially defined construct that is all the more malleable for its seemingly rigid boundaries." While much of the sex commentary takes place in a superficial battle of the sexes, it is sometimes subtle yet subtle-pervading, playing itself not only in some of the finer details of the film, but also in the battle of the genres, which reached its peak in the final scene.
