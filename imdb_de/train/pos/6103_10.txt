I recently watched the movie at the Boston Film Festival. The movie was very entertaining and in my opinion it is the world and black America is ready to see. It has comedy, drama, the soundtrack is great. It's a really good movie. The characters were well-developed and the film had a variety of prominent actors, such as Wood Harris (Remember the Titains, fully paid), Brian J. White (Trois 3, Mr 3000) and the wonderful Zoe Saldana (Drumline), Pirates of the Caribbean) , The film deals with many relevant topics in today's society in a short time, with class and grace. This is not just a story about life in the hospital, but also a story about people and their personal way to find out who they are or who they will be.
