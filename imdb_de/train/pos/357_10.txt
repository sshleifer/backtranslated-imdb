The film is very pleasing with a great cast and a great directing by James Eves. The film is entertaining with a very charismatic performance by Stephanie Beecham and all are perfectly staffed. James Eves has a good eye for casting and directs like a conductor who knows exactly when to turn the action, then fall and then ascend to climax. He does so with an element of humor, lots of twists, thrills and blood. This is a return of the old vampire movie with a lot of blood, blood and screams. The movie is going very fast and the characters are taking you on a horrible adventure, but what makes the movie special is that the movie does not take itself too seriously with a lot of tongue-ghosting. Great!
