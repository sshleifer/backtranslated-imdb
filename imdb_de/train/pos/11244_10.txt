One of my best films ever, maybe because I was good at the punk scene in the late '70s and attended many hazel concerts, but the movie was a good story and very good drama by Hazel and an up and coming Phil Daniels not sure about his latest project Eastenders! ! Outstanding performance by many unknown actors who, if you keep your eyes peeled, will see them in many British soaps today: Carver out the Bill, the more I look at it, the more of them I see if you have not seen it Have another night with the video. Do not forget to rip out the safety pin for your nose and heavy black eye makeup and shave your Mochanian-style head
