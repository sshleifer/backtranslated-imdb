An excellent movie. Outstanding show by Mary Alice, Phillip M. Thomas and the young Irene Cara. Tony King was very realistic in his role as satin. This movie was one of the last predominantly black films of the 70s and in contrast to the "Blaxploitation" films of that time, this movie actually had an action and was very well done. The film soundtrack sung by Aretha Franklin was popular on the R & B charts at the time.
