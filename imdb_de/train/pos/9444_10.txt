*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** Deliverance tells the story of four guys who are packed with memorable moments (like the quote immortalized by Primus above) and away from the big city for a while just to find out that their fun will soon turn badly. This is not a Hollywood movie. There are virtually no special effects, the setting is extremely realistic and nothing is sugary or nicely done. The boys in town look like the boys in town, and even the tough guy Louis, portrayed with precision by Burt Reynolds, is clearly at the mercy of the wilderness on this journey. This is a perfect example of what-if movie. What if a few friends were feeding in a forest area that none of them knew, and in the end desperately trying not to be tried for murder and convicted for being forced to save their own lives? <Br /> <br /> There is clearly a very strong element of the film that deals with the social and class structure and the relationship (or lack of) between rural and urban peoples. When the four boys arrive in the forest at the beginning of the film, they obviously do not know exactly how to deal with the people who live out there, and they talk to them as if they were unsure whether they can understand or communicate , This communication block is most impressively illustrated in the dueling banjo scene in which they try to refuel the car and the truck and get someone to drive the vehicles downstream for them. While Drew and the obviously disheveled and probably mentally retarded boy on the porch are dueling with guitar and banjo (one of the best scenes in the movie), Louis has trouble buying gas, and Bobby is commenting on genetic deficits and how pathetic that is. As the boy turns away from Drew, who offered to shake his hand after her amazing jam session, Bobby tells him to give the child a few dollars, knowing that none of them are quite sure how to react should. <br /> <br That's what we see in liberation, which generates as much tension as it follows. This great scene, which was a lot of fun (including the funniest "redneck dance" scene to O Brother, Where Art Thou?), Ended with everyone awkwardly unsure what to do in the area. These people are apples and oranges and they live according to completely different rules of life. The people that Louis, Bobby, Drew and Ed encounter in the hills are disconnected from modern society and modern laws and live by the rules of nature, which does not mean you should not kill. Confused of her awkward behavior, the four friends set out on the river, hoping the craziness would end and the adventure begin. (Spoilers) When they are briefly separated and Ed and Ed Bobby run into the hillbilly by the river, which quickly becomes uncomfortable. The uncertainty about the way these people live - as noted by the scene above - comes into play and creates the greatest tension during the scene. I think a good sign of a quality thriller like this is that the tragic element of the movie, the abuses and the actual murders, takes very little time, but still remains some of the most memorable parts of the movie. There is no unfounded power, it is all there for an obvious purpose and produces a surprisingly strong impact. <br /> <br /> This step is about the violent collision of two very different types of people, and what happens if you are unintentionally at war with each other. The ride over the rest of the river after the attack, which takes up most of the film, creates spectacular-looking suspense and keeps you at the edge of your seat, without bombarding you with so many events that you'll become numb. It is surprisingly effective to find out that Ed could have killed the wrong man up there on the cliff, and the tension in the movie does not diminish when the three surviving members of the team reach the bottom of the river because they give the police one questionable explanation of what happened up there on the river and why the deputy's brother-in-law is missing. <br /> <br /> This is a very disturbing movie that is proof of its success, because it's pretty obvious that a movie like this one should shake people up a bit. The Hillbillies are the human version of the subhuman rednecks seen in childlike but rather similar films like Gator Bait and Gator Bait 2, both of which can never be compared to a timeless movie like Deliverance. As we follow these four men through their fateful weekend in the forest, the natural element is so real and we get to know the men so well and subtly that it is almost as if we were a fifth member of the audience as individuals of the audience team. It's not often that a movie can show up this way.
