Although I agree that this is a good but not great movie, I still enjoy it for many reasons mentioned by other posters. One reason is the music: I would like to draw attention to the very cool performance of the brothers Candoli - Conte and Pete - in a well-staged scene in the nightclub. These guys were two of the best jazz trumpeters of their time, and manage to convince Jimmy Stewart's minds by playing a hysterical trumpet duo with a trumpet in each of Stewart's ears. The Candolis also played really well, although I suspect that the actual music for this scene was later synced by the two. I do not know much about George Duning, who has the honor for the music (apart from the fact that he seems to have worked with the Three Stooges more than once), but the casting of the Candoli brothers as jazz-playing warlocks was a really nice touch.
