The jokes are obvious, the gags are hackneyed, and the characters are walking characters - but I could not stop laughing at his extremely entertaining movie. No matter how many times I see it, I still get a kick out of it and recommend it to all lovers of mindless entertainment. It contains many quotable moments and some of the best visual goggles I have seen so far. If you had a bad week and need a giggle, rent them on the way back home to get your weekend off to a good start.
