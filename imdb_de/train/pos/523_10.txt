Why is not this movie among the 250 best? 56 years after its production, this film still looks surprisingly fresh, but could not be shot until after W.W.II because of the perception of death. People were more aware that life could be stopped at an unexpected moment. And what about life? I liked the scene in the end with the judgment and all people of all nations gathered. The phlegmatic judge (Abraham Sofaer - a typical British judge), Doctor Reeves, who defends Peter Carter, and also June (Kim Hunter) against US Attorney Abraham Farlan (Raymond Massey I.) - gives one reason for it being an American). It's all so imaginative! Michael Powell wrote, directed and produced this amazing movie, which is a real "tour-de-force". The message of the film is clear: In the universe, the law is the most important, but on earth nothing is beyond the love between people. The way this beautiful story is told is far more interesting than any Hollywood movie ever could.
