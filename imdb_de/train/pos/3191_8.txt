Director Edward Sedgwick, an old hand at Visual Comedy, successfully leads the Hal Roach Road Show, which aims for a fast-paced and skilful scenario and superb casting with a large number of reliable performers from Roach. Although the film was originally planned as a vehicle for Patsy Kelly, the sunny Jack Haley plays as Joe Jenkins, a young Kansan who sells his car repair business and travels to Hollywood, where he tries to cast a screen role for the girl he loves. to play a role Cecilia (Rosina Lawrence) beaten. Sedgwick, who prefers the entire MGM studio as a set, does so here, as Cecilia, who is always ready for a prelude, is treated to a behind-the-scenes action by a would-be movie star Rinaldo Lopez (Mischa Auer) musical comedy starring Broadway headliner Lyda Roberti. Laurel and Hardy offer several entertaining interludes, including the familiar sketch with a tiny harmonica, and we watch the fine sweeps of Joyce Compton, Russell Hicks and Walter Long. All in all, you have to give Mischa Auer the bays that steal the picture clearly as an emotional movie star, a role he largely creates, and the director for his clever tribute to Busby Berkeley's movie spectacle.
