There are so many reasons why I appreciate the sopranos so much. One of her greatest achievements is the casting and character building. Each character unfolds more and more in each series. In addition, each series contains a number of different 'small time signs' as well as the main group. A good example of a character (who has only been in three episodes) you can feel for is David, the obsessive player who is brilliantly played by Robert Patrick. Every little detail forms the perfect TV series. The show revolves around mob boss Tony Soprano (James Gandolfini), who seeks to balance his crime life with his role as the father of two children. The show is not afraid to be bold and powerful with their dialogue and imagery, and that makes them so credible. While Tony is working with Capos, Paulie (Tony Sirico) and Silvio (Steve Van Zant) are looking for his nephew Christopher (Michael Imperioli) looking for a promotion. Each episode also features Tony's other family, which includes his children and wife Carmela Soprano (Edie Falco). In addition to these issues, his uncle junior soprano (Dominic Chianese), although under house arrest, is trying to get Tony's business out of what he can. The whole drama is powerful and the characters complex, but the two that stand out the most are; James Gandolfini, who is "Tony Soprano". Michael Imperioli, who plays Christopher, represents the younger (20-30) generation in crime. If David Chase had not created this masterpiece, modern television dramas of this magnitude, such as The Wire and Dexter, might not have existed. The sopranos are definitely the godfather, goodfellas and pulp fiction of television
