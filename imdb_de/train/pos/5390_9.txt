Life Begins is a wonderful pre-code movie with some of the best of its time. It is in the maternity ward of a hospital, especially in the room where the women will have difficulties. In it are an elderly woman, a hard, unmarried mother (Glenda Farrell), a frail young woman, an Italian and the main character (Loretta Young), who spent 20 years in prison for murder. Her husband (Eric Linden) is in the hospital every second and longs to know that everything will be alright. Aline MacMahone plays the nurse who does her job great. <br /> <br /> This movie is very interesting and entertaining. It's not terribly shocking in any way, but it's interesting to see such a neglected subject on the canvas. Acting is all around brilliant. Loretta Young is beautiful here in her best form. Eric Linden comes out of nowhere and is sincere as it can be. His innocence is reminiscent of Michael J. Fox. Glenda Farrell is as always great, a staple of pre-codes and for a good reason.
