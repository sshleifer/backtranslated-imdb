I've seen virtually all of Cynthia Rothrock's films, and for me that's the funniest. It reminds me of early Jackie Chan movies. Although Mrs. Rothrock is not the best actress, she is very good as a martial artist as well as a very sweet young lady. This movie was not the best of the movies, but the most entertaining.
