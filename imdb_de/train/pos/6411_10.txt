This is one of the best military films ever made. And it's great because it's important. It is a great story that is of great interest to people who are committed to honor, loyalty, love and determination. <br /> <br /> Gooding and DeNiro are outstanding in the lead roles. It's wonderful to see Master Chief's racism move toward respect and love, through Carl Brashear's determination, drive and honor. The title indicates the source of their bond. I have never noticed until the last time how brilliant Carl Lumbly's portrayal of Carl's father, MacBrashear, was. In a way, it is a cornerstone of the movie that it is Carl's memory of his father that helps him endure difficult times. <br /> <br /> I choose which movies I buy. This is one of the rare ones that I would like to have on my shelf. I'm sure it will be seen many times in the future.
