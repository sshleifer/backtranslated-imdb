I thought the original of this movie was quaint and charming, and I sat on the edge of the seat trying to figure it out. <br /> <br /> Since I had already seen the original when I saw the sci-fi channel - I do not know if this remake was intentionally made for sci-fi - I knew what it was in the first few minutes was. Since I like Richard Burgi as a character actor, I wanted to see how he does it. <br /> <br /> The authors / producers etc. modernized the film a bit by trying to explain the plight of the "aliens" (they could no longer reproduce their own species and needed help), with the same pseudoscience that was stuffed in our ears in the 90s, maybe it added some polish to the film or not. <br /> <br /> This movie, movie? This production has a scarier edge than the original Original ended with a confrontation between the young woman and the alien, and an understanding of the species took place, although no solution to the alien problem was found I somehow remember that the woman in this remake is rather hostile to the Burgi / alien mind you - I think it could have ended better, but the end is just the end, and the yarn is a source yarn from the 1958 Science Fiction Pulp Stock, many great sci-fi genres Ways were written in the 1950s, and some of them even managed to film. <br /> <br /> This is a great thing to watch like a rainy day or something similar. I guess it's much appreciated by all remakes of the 50s sci-fi. I really enjoyed that a lot. <br /> <br /> But if anyone really wants this story to tell WELL, then I propose the original 1958 version with Tom Tyron and Gloria Talbott produced by Gene Fowler jr.
