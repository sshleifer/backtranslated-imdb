Although I only started reading the "classics" in literature at the age of 47, it's never too late. Jane Eyre is a favorite for many reasons, especially because there is no part of the book that I like less, but only parts that I enjoy more. The television miniseries of 1983 with Zelah Clarke and Timothy Dalton was everything I had hoped for. I saw it in 2006 as a feature film. Daltons' Mr. Rochester 'was very good, but I absolutely loved Zelah's' Jane Eyre'. In another "Classics" movie that I saw recently, I was disappointed with production, directing, and dialogue. It was only true to the stinginess and arrogance of Hollywood. The artistic license for the great works of literature is nothing less than a plagiarism. The use of the title after such a license is fraud. Leave it to the British to get this right (among others) right. You can not read the book again without re-experiencing the movie with its proper context and spirit. Well done, BBC.
