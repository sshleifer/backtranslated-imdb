Peter Falk is a versatile and accomplished actor. The film is well written and acting looks like in real life. For all lovers of Columbo this is an excellent job. Because it shows what kind of talent Peter Falk is. He plays no detective, he plays a retired carpet dealer. When the credits start, you want to see them again. The interesting part of the movie is that the message is for every person who sees it. the depth of its relevance will be the only thing that varies. It's a shame that the liberals in Hollywood only promote dirt and skin, because this is the kind of movie people should be proud of in the business. This would be a great movie to turn it into a live stage play.
