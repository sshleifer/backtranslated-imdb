This movie is so cheap, it is adorable !!! With Ron Liebmann (Major Vaughn) he delivered the most entertaining Diatribes in film history. I have 2 copies of this movie on video ... Ralph Macchio is actually cracked in the background with Major Vaugn while he rages on "hash". Obviously, they forgot to remove this mistake from the movie, but it shows how funny the movie is, when the actors themselves can not have a clear face !!!
