As a kid, I preferred the first Care Bear movie because this movie looked so dark. I always sat down and looked at the first one. As I grew older, I learned to favor it. I think this movie is too dark for kids, but as you get older, you learn to appreciate it, because you understand it more, it does not look as dark as it did when you were a kid. <Br /> <br /> This movie is better than the first one in my opinion, everything is much deeper. It may contradict the first movie, but you must ignore the first movie to watch this movie. The boys are just too adorable, I rewind the scene of 'Flying My Colors'. I tend to annoy anyone by singing it. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is great! A big hand at Carol and Dean Parks. I love every song in this movie, I downloaded them all and everything is what I hear. I hear "Our Beginning", at the moment called "Recalling". I've always preferred this soundtrack to the first, though I love Carol Kings song in the first movie 'Care-A-Lot'. <br /> <br /> I think the animation is great, the animation in both films is fantastic. I was surprised when I sat down about ten years later and saw that the animation was outstanding for that time. It was really surprising. <br /> <br /> There is not much support from other people who say this movie is great, but it is. I do not think it's weird. I think it's a wonderful movie. <br /> <br /> Basically, this movie is about how the Care Bears came to be and how to defeat the Dark Heart demon. The end is surprising and once again beats every "Pokemon movie" with Care Bear's morality issues. It leaves an effect on you. Again, this film can teach anyone at any age about morality.
