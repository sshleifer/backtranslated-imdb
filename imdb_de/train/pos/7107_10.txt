You can call it a mystery, maybe a little thriller or an intelligent movie. <br /> <br /> The story takes you through the life of a person who has lost his life and wants to win back. <Br /> <br /> I have to say, I was pretty surprised that I really enjoyed this movie. It's not usually the genre I'm interested in, but the characters quickly became people for me and I wanted to know what it was all about and what would happen to them. <br /> <br /> Just as many French films are made in English, we can learn much more about the character and influence of their environment on their person. This movie is character driven and will not disappoint!
