I like this movie, even though I do not like James Belushi very much. In fact, in this movie you can see several big names, Linda Hamilton and Courteney Cox; Caine was big, of course. The plot in this movie is simple; It's just like this sliding dice. However, it was told carefree and I like the moments of the comedy. I had to try to re-live my own important moments in life. For example, what if I took the girl out for one movie and not the other, etc. It tells us that the people around us could play different roles in our lives, if some tiny details change. It also reminds us to be careful what we want. Life, on the other hand, is not always as good as we think; Maybe what we have now is the best for us, all in all.
