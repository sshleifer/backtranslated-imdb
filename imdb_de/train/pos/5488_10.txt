A case of being in the right place at the right time. What a fascinating movie. It's easy to see why Chavez is so popular with his people. He has things done. He is reachable. It's also easy to see why the West hates him so much. He has control over the resources of his country and returns the profit to the people. Mostly the poor. And it's easy to see how television networks can present misleading images to prove it. Just like the Iraq war or the war on terror. Or the missing weapons of mass destruction. Or how about the axis of evil? People have to wake up. And get different views. Stop the neo-enemies that rule the world. Watch this movie with an open mind. And decide for yourself. Then I suggest you see Aaron Russos: America: Freedom to Fascism. The problem is not the people of America. It is the government.
