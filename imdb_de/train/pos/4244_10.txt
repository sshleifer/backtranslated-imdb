This film has slipped through the cracks in film history. It is far better than some other New York films of the same era, such as "The French Connection" or "The Taking of Pelham 1-2-3". This film has a bizarre reality that also manages to use humor effectively to promote the plot. It is appealing from beginning to end and has not tarnished with age, as is the case with the two examples above. Ron Liebman presents himself in a bravura performance as "Batman". As a result of this project, it can not start. <br /> <br /> Gordon Parks directing, and as it is after "Shaft" the case, it seems at first glance to be a strange choice. However, it is the downside of this earlier effort and has been tackled with just as much in your face machismo. Unfortunately, this film has not been made available on DVD or VHS in the United States. United Artists really have a gem in their hands and it's a shame they do not care.
