A powerfully wonderful movie. If you get involved in the story, you will be kept in a death struggle. A successful dentist, Alan Johnson (Don Cheadle), finds himself in a life crisis in which he balances his career with his family. He notices his former college roommate Charlie Fineman (Adam Sandler) and wants to touch the base. He finds out that Charlie, who lost his wife and family through the Sept. 11 attack on America, is no longer connected to reality. He decides to combine his thoughts with his favorite music from the past and video games. The former roommates spark their friendship and strengthen their former bond. Johnson has his girlfriend Angela Oakhurts (Liv Tyler), a psychiatrist trying to get Charlie out of his grief ... But it's Alan who gets his boyfriend out of his dark darkness. Jada Pinkett Smith plays Johnson's wife. Author and director Mike Binder plays the role of Charlie's lawyer / guardian. With in the cast: Saffron Burrows, Donald Sutherland, Adell Model and Robert Klein. Excellent soundtrack like Bruce Springsteen, Graham Nash, Pear Jam and The Pretenders. <br /> <br /> NOTE: I've never been a Sandler fan before. but I found him outstanding in this role. In some scenes, I thought aloud ... why was he never made to play the singer / songwriter Bob Dylan in a biography.
