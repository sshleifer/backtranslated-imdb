While Rome is angry and celebrating Hitler's visit - uniforms, bands, parades - two outsiders stay at home, in a big building, and meet. She is Sofia Loren, the wife of a brutal official and mother of six children. He is Mastroianni, a radio announcer who was fired for his homosexuality. Both need company and understanding, both find each other. <br /> <br /> The movie lasts for a few hours. The colors are faded and everything plays out with a soundtrack of military marches and hysterical broadcasters. Strangely, the Nazi anthem - the Horst Wessel song - becomes a romantic music theme. <br /> <br /> Nice movie, a great reflection of a special epoch of Italian history and a touching, sad story. Mastroianni is as good as we expected, and Sofia Loren is doing an excellent job, far away from her usual pin-up rider, the Neapolitan fishwife characters. Do not miss it.
