Peter M. Cohen has shot and turned a winning satire for the mating game. The critical examination of the film in mainstream media publications as "offensive" and "slippery" only emphasizes its intensity as a refreshing and focused exploration of the sexual activities and passions of the people. It is in the tradition of so-called "reality-based" satire following in the footsteps of "The Company of Men", "Chasing Amy", "Your Friends and Neighbors" and "Two Girls and a Guy". Cohen's dialogue is hilarious and I was always fascinated by how perfectly he captured the true pace of today's talks. Brian Van Holt, Zorie Barber and Jonathan Abrahams are three different, relentless, sex-obsessed predators that are turned upside down by a female enemy (Amanda), along with the foil of their recently married buddy (played by Judah Domke) Peet). Below the satirical surface lurks a romantic comedy that is far more satisfying than most sugar-coated studio products.
