This is an exciting, old-fashioned adventure yarn. I understand that the treatment of the Indians was unacceptable by today's political standards. But this move is not about politics. It's about action, dialogue, camaraderie, acting, directing, music and photography, and it's amazing what all these factors are. Grant, Fairbanks and McLaglen are electric together, and Jaffe is great. This is the ultimate buddy movie.
