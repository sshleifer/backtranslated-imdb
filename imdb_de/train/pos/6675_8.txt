The director behind this movie was fantastic for a comedy. Many of the scenes seem to be from a comic book and much darker (visually - not in terms of story) than I expected. Granted, this may not be the funniest movie ever shot, especially if you're looking forward to very gross sexist jokes, as it has very little of it (compared to others like Something About Mary or American Pie). As you watch it again, some jokes will turn up and become funnier. If you've ever read a comic book or seen and liked a comic-like movie (Batman, X-Men, etc.), you'll probably enjoy the subtle humor that continues throughout the movie. If you did not like them, you may like the respectful ridicule this movie has for them. If you liked this movie, the DVD offers some cool extras. (8/10)
