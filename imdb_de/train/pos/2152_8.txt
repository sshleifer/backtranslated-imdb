There were some great moments of reality in which modern life was portrayed (not just in Japan but everywhere). It shows how stifling the culture can be and how to break out of the mold that it has created for you. <br /> <br /> Dancing was just a means to say, "Do what you love, even if it's against the norm." Rather Billy Elliot, as I would say. I also liked this movie. <br /> <br /> The humor was well tuned and the touching moments felt so real that you could feel the clumsiness between Sugiyama and his wife, the tantrums in the dance hall. I loved Aoki - he and this wig and his excess on the dance floor just made me howl! <br /> <br /> The actors did a wonderful job, the story was well written. I have looked at it a second time and discovered some small nuances that I missed when I first looked at it. Good entertainment!
