Another silent triangle from Hitchcock, no mystery, but very English, well maintained and photographed. The slick boxer Bob Corby (Ian Hunter) recruits the circus boxer "One Round" Jack Sander (Carl Brisson) as his sparring partner, in part to keep the pretty but fickle Mabel (Lilian Hall-Davis) nearby. There are many character actors and grotesques. At Jack and Mabel's wedding, the Verger standing in the doorway is shock at the sight of the very tall and very short men, the fat woman, the twins connected, of course arguing over which side of the aisle to sit, and the wedding party is amusing. In the rest of the movie, Jack loses Mabel and returns to her heart or something like that. It was a very different era, with the crowd dressed in evening gowns and the boxers dressing up outside the ring as well. The camera angles, the tempo, the use of symbols, the cutting - all very stylish and masterful. The camera work and the editing of the last boxing match is very moving. Brisson's good looks are well used in this case. His smile is not fully aware of what's going on around him, as he is in Hitchcock's The Manxman, so he's not annoyed. But can boxers have such dimples?
