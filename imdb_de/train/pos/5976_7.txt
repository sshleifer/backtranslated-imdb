Trick or Treat, Quickie Review This crazy trumpet of a movie revolves around the culture of heavy metal and the horror movie of the 80s - two things that I love very much. As you can imagine, this movie has pretty easily appealed to me. In addition, Ozzy Osbourne plays a preacher for no apparent reason. <br /> <br /> This film is about an unpopular high school student who, like us all losers, has found himself in a world of "bad" heavy metal. His darling Metaldude dies and is miraculously revived - by playing his last unreleased album backwards. This allows the fallen singer to kill and help people with demons. <br /> <br /> Okay, it's kind of cheesy at times, but you know what? It has surprisingly many good qualities. Discreet drama (including Gene Simmons as a radio DJ), pretty good special effects, very short nudity, decent atmosphere ... All in all, it's a decent horror movie. But what's really shitty is the music. Ironically, right? Well, this "over-the-top" Metal guy is one of the most disgusting, angry, wistful Motley Crue on the planet - and "Metal" is little more than lazy 80s pop / hair metal. He meets all the clich√©s here, from dancing like a gay fairy to looking mean, "Rock and Roll !!!" to scream. at a pitch high enough to strangle King Diamond. Apart from this gruesome musical representation, she is actually pretty good. 7/10 <br /> <br /> www.ResidentHazard.com
