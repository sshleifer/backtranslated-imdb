This is one of those milestones that must be settled in the context of time. The district in Tallinn was made in 1993. It was a time of chaos, confusion and gross disorder, not only for ordinary citizens of Estonia, but also for many citizens of other former nations that were part of the powerful Soviet empire. In such a tense climate, a young country called Estonia was born. As newly-established governments are known to have teething problems, Estonia has also had many problems, with some corrupt officials manipulating the state. This is one of the core themes of this film. Darkness in Tallinn appears as an Estonian film, but was made by the Finnish director Ilka JÃ¤rvilaturi. He tried his best to administer as many Estonian doses as possible. Therefore, it can be described as a comedy film with political undertones. Since ordinary people are involved in this film, we can say that this film is good versus evil. It is not a new concept, as it is readily available in most religious books of various faiths. Talness in Talinn shows us how ordinary governments can be overthrown by corrupt people. A beautiful movie that can be seen on a sunny day.
