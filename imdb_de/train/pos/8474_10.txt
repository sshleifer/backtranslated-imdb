I saw this movie when I was 13, and I really liked Dana Plato, who later appeared in various punches as Kimberley Drummond. I do not think it's rubbish. It was also not intended as a continuation of the documentary. It's just a cute kids movie about 3 kids looking for men who are trying to find the swampy Bach monster. The men are injured and the children rescue them with the help of the creature. The hunt for the Arkansas swamp and the landscape were neat. This is a good movie for kids, no real violence, a few mild scares but a lot of fun for the little kids.
