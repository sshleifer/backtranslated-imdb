This is probably John Thaw's best performance, where he successfully shakes off all the features of his Inspector Morse character and brings a perfect adaptation of Tom from the book pages to the TV screen. This is a well-crafted production that, despite some very mature themes such as the outbreak of World War II and the physical abuse suffered by the child, maintains its familiar atmosphere. Young Willie is the heart and soul of this story. It is touching and beautiful to see this connection between the boy evacuated from London and the grumpy old man with whom he has to develop - a real connection between grandfather and grandson. Not made with a bigger budget with a more established director, as he is on The big screen belongs and is not shown once or twice every ten years on a Sunday afternoon. With the right guidance, John Thaw would be celebrated all over the world and won numerous awards for his brilliant performance in this film. A great actor and a great role to be honored more than it was then.
