Long before Tim LaHaye and Jerry B. Jenkins shook the Christian subculture with the LEFT BEHIND books (earning millions), MARK IV Pictures, the Christian film distribution company of the Billy Graham Evangelization Association, gave us this masterpiece. What I love most about this genre is the incredible attention to detail that sits in a living room. Instead of mourning the dramatic scenes of this "after-rapture", we sit in the living room and hear about it on the news because the filmmakers can not afford to show it. The premise of the film is based on the pre-millenium pre-tribulation charter, believing that Christ once comes to the secret capture of the true church and then returns to earth at the end of the seven years of hell. What scared me earlier in junior high makes me laugh. The intriguing adventures of Patty and her journey through tribulation (and two of the film's three episodes) tell her remarkable story of unbelief and ultimately damnation. I do not like to admit it, but I still enjoy seeing it. It even has the SAME EXACT rating of Monty Python and the Holy Grail. I think I'm the only person in history to make that observation.
