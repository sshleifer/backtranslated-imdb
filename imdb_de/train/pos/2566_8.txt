Any movie that is positive about bigotry is a film that should still hold true for the current audience, as the message and moral of the story will always be relevant as long as we have a world of bigotry. <br /> <br Besides that, the movie is really an old-fashioned love story. The boy meets the girl. The boy loses the girl ... The boy gets the girl back. The weakest role goes to the late Kent Smith as Lieutenant-General Webster (Riccardo Montalban is just behind) ... my question would be how could he ever become a 3-star general ... the character is a weakling woman in his presence and military subordinates, it's a wonder they show respect for him. <br /> <br /> Brando's southern accent is a little over the top, and some scenes have some holes, but overall, I like the movie every time I see it. <br /> <br /> Red buttons are great ... I always love seeing comedians in dramatic roles ... As in Button's case, a comedian can often portray a person's tragedy better than a more traditional d Ramatian actor ,
