This is a powerful film from a historical and epic perspective. While the story is simple, it is pure and straightforward. In fact, this is the standard story of a simple, honorable man whose honor comes into conflict with the educated and wealthier men of that time. <br /> <br /> Poor versus rich, honorable against dishonest, a classic but well told story without much of the glamor of Hollywood stinking on the screen. <br /> <br /> Extra points just because you can almost smell the people on the screen. :)
