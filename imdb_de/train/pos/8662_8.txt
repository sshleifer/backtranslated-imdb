I really liked that. In fact, when I see it again (and I plan it), I just love it. I want to tell other reviewers that this movie is really growing with you. It starts slowly, but the way is very natural and has a good mood. You just have to deal with it. <br /> <br /> I really liked the summer atmosphere of the movie and found the movie very touching. The characters have a strong element of realism, and the movie slowly and gently casts a spell as you get involved in the various interactions between them and know how it will ultimately turn out and which ways the characters will choose. <br /> <br /> I am very surprised that there are less than a dozen comments. There are obscure TV movies that contain more comments than Rich In Love. <br /> <br /> One thing I want to say I say I've missed the end that drives me crazy, and I have to take a look again to see that. This is a movie that may not be for everyone, but in my opinion it is severely underestimated (even some of my purestest friends, who have seen almost every movie, who has seen almost every movie, have not seen this) and it seems not even having much of a message board, but I really liked it, and those who love family dramas, who are familiar with landscape, atmosphere, and a slow, slow pace, should probably look at it. Particularly noteworthy is that it takes place in South Carolina. For those (like me) who love the South, and for movies that take place there, this is a gem. Unfortunately, I add my voice to a few comments and recommend these little-known strips.
