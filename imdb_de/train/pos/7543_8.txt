This is a visual adaptation of the manga with very little dialogue. Which dialogue is there, appears in word balloons as in the manga. The plot of it is present, but only vaguely considered. There is an edition of the manga available in English in the Blastbook collection "Comics Underground Japan". It also contains a dialog with subtitles that explains the plot a bit more than here. I recommend checking this volume if you like, as this explains some of the film's "plots" that are otherwise inexplicable. This is pretty decent animation, good unobtrusive use of computers and the pictures are for the most part well realized. It jumps into and out of the episodes as the characters, a cat and its brain-dead older sister cat wander up and down in a series of strange images: a boat, a circus, a desert. For only half an hour, they go through a series of actions and attitudes, leading me to believe that the director has chosen a number of problems with the long-standing manga to adapt to arbitrary, but primarily visually selected. Knowing what's going on can increase your appreciation. This reminds me of the things they have played in the mtv show, cartoon sushi, especially shorts with a cat following the severed ass cheek of a guy in the house. Only in this case are the cats more like Hello Kitty, and their adventures are extended to include death and reincarnation and a number of other themes (though not so easy to see what's going on). the dvd of this one has the director's comment and a "making of" feature, but I can not comment on it because I did not come to them. I give this one now 8/10, here is not much to compare with anime, and I hope for more of it.
