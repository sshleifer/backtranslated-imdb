I thought Mr. Dreyfuss was perfect for his role as an actor and dictator. His teammate, Mr. Julia, played his part as well. It was interesting to see how hesitantly Richard Dreyfuss replaced the dictator against his will. Over time, however, he became more confident and familiar with the role. Since everything happens for a reason in life, I think he had to replace the dictator because he wanted to stay there all year long. I suspect he stayed because he wanted to see how good his life was compared to the poverty he saw in Parador. I think he took too many things for granted and he had to get a serious reality check by staying in this country as long as he did. ... anyway ........... That's why I gave this movie a 7 out of 10 points.
