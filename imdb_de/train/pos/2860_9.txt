It ran from 1959 to 1973. It's more than its longevity, which says a lot for this series. It is also that it has survived changes in fashion and taste of the 50s, psychedelic 60s and was popular in the 70s. It was a successful combination of all the elements of stories, cast and productions that made it extraordinary. Lorne Green had his defining iconic character from this series. Her charm was for generations. All family members could enjoy this. It balanced morality with violence, humor with seriousness. A comic series emerged as a result of this as an impact. The shame is that this series is not repeated and many do not know their meaning.
