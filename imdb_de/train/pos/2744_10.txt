Remarkable, disturbing film about the senseless, brutal murder of a small-town family in the truest of life, along with the aftermath and an investigation into the lives of the killers, Dick Hickok and Perry Smith. <br /> <br /> No matter how much time passes or how outdated this film may look, it still resonates with the total incomprehensibility of such criminal acts as this one. <br /> <br /> This is truly a tribute to several tragedies: the tragedy, brutality, and futility of murdering the Clutter family, a decent farm family in the small town of Holcomb, Kansas; and the wasted, brutal and sad life of Hickok and Smith. <br /> <br /> In the movie, an interesting point is raised: None of these two immature, timid, little criminals would ever have considered going through this alone. Together, they created a dangerous, murderous collective personality. one that nurtured the needs and the pathology of each one of them. They push along a street where they "prove" each other. That they were man enough to do it to carry it out; no one wants to be considered too cowardly to complete his big "score"; an unhappy and dangerous remnant of the barren life that led them. They were two grown-up children living in the world of a criminal and not shrinking from the brave. who constantly have to prove masculinity and toughness. In this case, these needs continued until the murder of the Clutters. <br /> <br /> The film contains a somewhat sentimentalized view of the Clutter family, but it is pointed out. They were respected, law-abiding small townsfolk who did not deserve this terrible fate. The film also gives us a sense of the young life of Hickok and Smith. Perry Smith, whose early life was full of security and love, but he watched in horror as alcohol brought his family on a tragic path. Hickok, poor and quite on his own, could not see how he fit in, and used his intelligence and charm to meet anyone he came in contact with. <br /> <br /> An interesting and perhaps the first, look at the death penalty and what goals we want to achieve. Is this nothing more than a revenge for a murder that shook a nation at a time when we did not fully understand that such predators could be among us, or is it really daunting to have these people at the bottom of a rope? to position? on the childlike and brutal attitude of men like this? Can men who live a life of deception be deterred from acting under the radar and believing that they deceive anyone they come into contact with? To be deterred, you have to believe that you might get caught. Can you stop these men from thinking that they are too smart to get caught? Who committed hundreds of small crimes and got away with them? This should be a "child's play", "no witnesses". <br /> <br /> When Hickok gets caught, he can not enchant and trouble the agents as he had merchants in a department store. Smith, who thinks he deserved such a fate, who seemed to be the only one who had realized the severity of his act, willingly tells the story when he learns that Hickok has stepped in a cowardly manner. Hickok blinked first. A stupid chicken between two immature, emotionally damaged, dangerous men. Fascinating psychological thriller that tells the story of a terrible crime in the history of this nation. Stunning depictions of Robert Blake and Scott Wilson. These roles made her career.
