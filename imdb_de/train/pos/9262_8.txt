Offside is the story of teenage girls trying to sneak into the stadium to see the last qualifying football match in Tehran that could lead Iran to the 2006 World Cup in Germany. Women are forbidden by law to visit a stadium in Iran, although many of them dress like boys and creep in. No girl comes in. <br /> <br /> Like most of Panahi's work, the performance of his Armature Cast was superb. You actually think that you see a documentary. The dialogues between the girls and the private people were carefully and surprisingly credible. The film shows the interactions between the prisoners and the retired guards, who themselves serve their family and friends in a fun way. In the end, the audience realizes that there is not much difference between the girls and the guards who have just followed orders.
