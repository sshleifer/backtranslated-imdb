A featherweight plot and dubious characterizations make no difference when a movie is as funny as this movie. Lively action and spectacular stunts - for your day - give this movie a real zipper. And between the two main roles, there is a real comedy from the tearing chemistry. Quinn is also a good villain, though his role is completely overshadowed. <br /> <br /> But do not be fooled by Maureen O'Hara's tough, broad role, this is as sexist as any Hollywood movie of the time. You may be able to forgive this because of the time it was made, but it's still hard to get past it. With all the heroism and cruel situations that adults do not see on screen, it's still a little more than a youthful good time.
