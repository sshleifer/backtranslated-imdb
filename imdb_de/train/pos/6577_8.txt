With few exceptions, most of George Bernard Shaw's plays have practically disappeared from the theater these days. To filed, too much seems to be the general verdict. This BBC version of one of Shaw's funniest pieces does not refute this verdict. It is certainly arched and talkative, but it is also wonderful. And because of the quality of British theater, it's perfectly staffed with actors, most of us - with the exception of Helena Bonham Carter - probably never heard of. Carter is outstanding as a Bulgarian girl, who houses the professional "chocolate soldier" (Pip Torrens) and later falls in love with him. One could argue with the particularly ridiculous interpretation of Sergius (Patrick Ryecart), the Bulgarian cavalry officer who led the charge to the enemy lines, and be successful only because the enemy had the wrong ammunition for his machine guns. The role, however, invites excessive acting, and Ryecart was obviously told to act too much. The other players are perfect letters. Carter as a self-dramatical Bulgarian "aristocrat" and Torrens as a Swiss lucky soldier are of course at the center of the play and they are wonderful. Yes, "Arms and the Man" looks like a movie. However, it is unlikely that you will ever see a Shaw movie that does not reveal its origin. The actions are generally smart. Shaw is all about dialogue. The action is minimal (even in St. Joan) and the sets are negligible. Enjoy what it is.
