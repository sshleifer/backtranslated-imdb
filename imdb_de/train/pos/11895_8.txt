Tea Leoni plays Nora Wilde, a serious photographer who has a bad divorce behind her. She wants her freedom, but it costs something. She wants to legitimize photography, but is hired as a paparazzi for the tabloids. Her boss is played by the wonderful and divine Holland Taylor. The show was well written most of the time. TEa's Nora slowly became a memorable character, but the network just did not support comedy and they still do not. Even when they brought in George Wendt from Cheers, they changed the cast and characters unnecessarily. The show was initially okay and the audience got used to it, but the network messes it up like a bad plastic surgery.
