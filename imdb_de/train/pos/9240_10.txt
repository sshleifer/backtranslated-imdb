Found this movie in a video store, it cost $ 2 to buy. The whole movie really stinks bad! The so-called Colonel, who would be the hero here if you could trust the cover, must be in his eighties and can barely walk. Nevertheless, he manages to shoot some of the stupidest ninja in the world. Then the story leaves the Colonel, which makes sense given the old man's inability to do anything worth mentioning. Now, two scary eighty-looking men take control of what must have been a kind of story. I lost a hundred times, but I did not mind, because the movie is so bad and it's really fun to watch it. Zero-budget garbage with actors who do not deserve this name. Go and see it!
