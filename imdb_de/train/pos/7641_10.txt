Everyone plays their part pretty well in this "little nice movie". Belushi gets the chance to live a part of his life differently, but in the end it becomes clear that what he had was just as good or even better. The film shows us that we should use our opportunities, not those we do not or can not have. If you can get this movie for about $ 10 as a video, this would be an investment!
