Sandler is great again ... I've already become a Sandler fan. This movie is the saddest Sandler story. His expression is fantastic. I cried more when clicking Click, but there are some similar points. To test the value of the family before losing it, and to say that I love you, are some of the most impressive truths in life. Owners of this success, Binder. I do not think another director could convey that emotion in this way. <br /> <br /> Cheadle and Burrows are also amazing ... Cheadle has been one of my favorites since Crash. Do not expect laughter or a lot of positive atmosphere ... If you are ready to face the realities of life, you should not miss this movie.
