This is my first comment! This is a fantastic movie! I saw it on TV one night. For the first five minutes, I thought it was a B-movie, but then I understood what an amazing product it was. <br /> <br /> I suggested to some friends to watch the movie, just to tell me that it was bad B movie. How wrong Superficial criticism. <br /> <br /> I think the movie is almost a genius! The well-known director has done an excellent job here and it is a shame to say that he was out of the game all the time.
