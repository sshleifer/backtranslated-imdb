This is not 'Bonnie and Clyde' or 'Thelma and Louise', but a good road movie. It sets its two main characters in a gentle and easy way. Viewers quickly learn the underlying tensions, which pays tribute to the director. There is the young, French (and English) speaking son, who wants to assert himself well in France, has a French girlfriend and drinks alcohol, parties like young men. And there is his Moroccan-Arabic (and French) speaking father who follows his Muslim faith with devotion and wisdom to the elders and rejects the new culture that surrounds him (like cell phones). The film could explore a very powerful policy - the odd couple travels through the former Yugoslavia, through Turkey and then through the Middle East to get to Mecca. These are areas in which the Muslim population was involved in wars, repression and ethnic cleansing. where dictators enforce torture and executions to hold power, and where religious communities are constantly fatal. But the film moves through these places and possibilities with hints of such agendas. The relationship between the two is the key to this film, and the belief that politics is the background. It seems to say that we are all human and need to understand and care for one another in order to be able to cope well in this world. It's certainly not "Natural Born Killers" and it's all the better.
