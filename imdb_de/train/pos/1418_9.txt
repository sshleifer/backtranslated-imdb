I almost did not see this movie because I remember that the penguin's march was not particularly exciting. I went mainly because Disney promised to plant a tree when I visit him on the opening weekend, but after seeing him, it was just unbelievable. The fact that photographers can capture impossible pictures is simply worth the money. You will also see different habitats, different vegetation, animals and natural phenomena that will not only shock you - just because you would never expect nature to be so magical and dynamic - but also touch your souls and raise the question of humanity against humans World, how our life has deviated so far from nature that we take for granted the natural beauty and wonders that characterize our biosphere. You do not have to be a lover of the earth or a tree-loving environmentalist to appreciate the simplicity of this documentary. You just have to be a curious soul that questions the value and wonder of life. Enjoy!
