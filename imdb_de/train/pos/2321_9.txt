Here is the love story I like to watch. And mostly for two reasons. First, it focuses on young people, very young people. People who are still teenagers and experience love for the first time, or at least think that it is them. We have all been in our lives and "The Man in the Moon" is a great reflection of our memories, which may add a few details and enhance them further than we have ever experienced. The second reason is that it is a love triangle. And I think it's the most dramatic thing as a teenager. And the story is so well-developed that you think the characters could really be in love or that they're so new that they just believe that they are and that they're after a tragedy or something for the rest to believe in their lives. <br /> <br /> The cast of "The Man in the Moon" is full of talented names. It shows Sam Waterston, a truly versatile actor who is able to play both strict district attorneys and strict but caring and intelligent fathers like in this movie. There is also Tess Harper, Jason London and a young, young Reese Witherspoon. You look at the young, talented actress when she is 14 years old and think she will win the Academy Award about ten years later. All members of the cast do great performances, and with the dialogue of the compelling script, they become real people in real situations. As if everything had really happened. This is the movie I would like to see more often. Love story or not. I would like to see films that are all real and in no way wrong or unbelievable.
