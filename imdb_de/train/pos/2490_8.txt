Those of the "instant gratification" era of horror films will undoubtedly complain about the pace of this film and the lack of unfounded effects and body counting. The fact is, "The Empty Acre" is a good example of how independent horror films should be made. <br /> <br /> If you avoid the indie racks because you're tired of annoying teens or being killed twenty, a baddie whose backstory could come from the back of a Count Chocula box, "The Empty Acre "is the movie for you. <br /> <br /> In the decaying remnants of the rural American dream, "The Empty Acre" is the story of a young couple struggling with the disappearance of their six-month-old baby while the couple's feeble relationship falls apart In the night, a shapeless dark mass cooks out of a sun-burnt, barren field on her farm and apparently devours everything on her way, leaving no sign that she has ever been there. > <br /> The film is full of enigmatic characters, visual clues to what's happening, and ends with a well-executed ending that's just left enough to validate the writer's / director's belief in an intellectual audience. <br / > <br /> There seems to be a subtext, text about the death of the American dream, but I would hardly call it an allegory. "The Empty Acre" i I'ma fantastic little indie that thinking horror fans should love.
