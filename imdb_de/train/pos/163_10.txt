First-time director Tom Kiesche shoots a winning movie with the spirit of dark, dark comedy. Filmed on a tight budget, but had the taste of the early Coen-brother movie Blood Simple ... and added Monty Python flavors! Must be seen more than once to recognize all the elements that carry one scene to the next. Expect more good things from this author-director-actor.
