Before I saw Show People, my impression of mute comedy was essentially slapstick and just slapstick. I could not imagine how screen comedy could be possible without relying heavily on spoken words or numerous Pratfalls. But this masterful movie misunderstood me. Davies was, in my opinion, probably the greatest comedian to come before Lucille Ball. I mention Lucy above all because Davie's manners and facial expressions reminded me so much that I wondered if Davies was not one of Ball's main influences. This comes from a 21-year-old who has never seen silent comedy, and I have to say that no matter how many of the period-specific cues you actually got (I obviously did not do that), you will not get bored with film. You'll probably laugh even more than most talkie comedies. This is not only my favorite silent comedy, but also slightly among my ten favorite comedies of all time.
