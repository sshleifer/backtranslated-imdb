Another comedy about a small, brave country that struggles through the jungle of the modern (1940s) global world and has only local wit to guide it, this is a good introduction to the Ealing cannon. Terry-Thomas sparkles as usual in the lead role, as a feckless ministry staff came to the brink of disaster, as a nation for which he is supposed to be responsible, attracting the world's interest, makes Ian Bannen a great romantic trail, so Peter Sellers one of his quieter achievements as a corrupt politician and the arrogant John Le Mesurier plays as a robust revolutionary leader against the type. Everyone has a lot of fun, especially the viewer; Maybe not in the top season of the Ealing classics, but pretty high.
