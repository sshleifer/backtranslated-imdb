An unusual film by Ringo Lam and one that is strangely underrated. The mix of fantasy kung-fu with a more realistic depiction of corpse-driven swords and spears is particularly surprising in the first ten minutes. A horseman is hacked in two parts and his waist and legs continue riding. Several horses are hacked. It is very unexpected. <br /> <br /> The story is very simple. Fong and his Shaolin brothers are captured by a mad crazy general and locked up in the Red Lotus Temple, which seems to be a torture chamber rather than a temple. The general bears a resemblance to Kurtz in Apocalypse Now, as he spits out the distorted philosophy and paints frightening images with human blood. <br /> <br /> The production is very impressive and the environment is bleak. Blood is everywhere. The action is very well done and, unlike many HK action scenes from that time, is mostly coherent. Sometimes the film turns into absurdity or the effects are cheesy, but it's never bad enough to ruin the movie. <br /> <br /> Find this one, it's one of the best HK kung fu movies from the early nineties. Remember that it is not kid friendly.
