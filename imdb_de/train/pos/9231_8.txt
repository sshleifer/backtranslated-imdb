FLAVIA THE HERETIC is a strange entry into the genre of Nunsploit - equally sleaze, feminist travel, and "history" as we follow Flavia on her weird journey. <br /> <br /> We start with Flavia in a monastery. She is not too happy because she does not believe in all the male-dominated "rules" and machoism of the world around her and escapes from the convent with her Jewish friend Abraham. Both are eventually caught and Flavia is returned to the convent, where she joins another "non-believing" nun to expedite a Muslim invasion. Flavia is connected to the Muslims who take over the monastery and "deal" with the nuns in a strange scene. Eventually, the Muslims will be unrolled and Flavia will be punished as a traitor to Christianity in another brutal scene ... <br /> <br /> This movie has pretty much everything I want to see in a 70's exploit movie - some good gore, including nipple removal, and a nice leg skin scene, some decent nudity - including the required frontal and a decent storyline. I'll say that it somehow got some points, but not enough to get really boring. I would definitely recommend it to Nonsploit / 70's Exploit fans ... 8/10
