Of course, the average "Sci-Fi" Battle Star Gallactica fan will hate that. That makes me happy. I do not like those cheesy sci-fi shows, especially Battle-Star-Gallactica, and that's why I like this show. <br /> <br /> The creators of the show got a lot of warmth for it (the unconventional Sci-fi-way) and it was worth it. I read on the wiki that they want to appeal to everyone, including women, not just sci-fi nerds. <br /> <br /> This is probably the most promising show since Lost. It has the most interesting, cleverest and deepest script of a show in a long time and it is truly unique. <br /> <br /> What I love most about the show is that it behaves like a great anime! From young teenagers shooting around, to a very well-balanced and complex script, to robots, it reminds me of something that came from Japan, except a little better (most anime are too confusing).
