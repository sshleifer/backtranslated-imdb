This last Voyager episode starts 23 years in the future. Voyager has made it home again. In the many years it took to return, the mind of the Tuvok volcano was destroyed. He had an illness that came home too late to be cured. Captain Janeway encounters foreigners with time travel technology. She notes there's a warp conduit in the Delta Quadrant that could bring Voyager home right away - if she could return in time and notify Voyager. There is a problem. The Conduit is deep in Borg Space. Janeway visits Tuvok. He is like a child. He scribbles, obsesses, works on math problems or film reviews or something he believes is important. In the asylum Tuvok cries and asks for "Janeway". Please come back to him. Janeway decides to command a Federation shuttle and equip him with weapons technology 20 years before the Borg, hoping to travel back in time and use this new technology to lead Voyager to the Warp Conduit. <br /> <br /> As she returns to the past and connects to Voyager, Janeway meets her younger self. The two captains disagree and argue over the plan. The real captain visits Tuvok and asks him if it is true that he has a brain disorder. Tuvok admits that it is true, but it can not be cured by the facilities on the ship, so he kept it to himself. The young captain agrees with the plan of the older captains. To increase her chances of success, the older Janeway plans to distract the Borg with her shuttle ship. The Borg actually capture Janeway and her shuttle. The Borg Queen personally assimilates Captain Janeway. But Janeway expected that! The Borg Queen has taken in a virus that kills her. With the Borg Queen, Dead Voyager makes it through the Warp Conduit back to the Federation room.
