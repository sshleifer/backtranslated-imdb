A weird fun that combines a suitably far-fetched storyline with Adam and Burt and flashbacks of the original TV series. Most flashback scenes were taken directly from Burt Ward's book "Boy Wonder: My Life in Tights," and I imagine his book was the inspiration for this movie. Like the book, fans of the original series have been asking for more. <br /> <br /> If you've missed this show, it's definitely worth borrowing a volume from a friend who recorded it. I'm making a copy for my kids right now.
