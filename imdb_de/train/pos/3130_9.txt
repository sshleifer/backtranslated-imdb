I am Belgian and grew up in the sixties. Most of the US series were screened here (original language with subtitles) and Batman was one of the first that I loved most. Unfortunately, it caused a "panic hysteria" among the mothers because Batman was considered too violent. Gosh, compare the innocence of this series to the crap that kids see these days. Because of my cocky moms from the 60s, I only had the chance to see maybe two or three episodes! I was so frustrated that I started to collect the comic and bubblegum cards (still!) To compensate. I even got the View Master slides ... I had the urge to see the savvy Crusader. All children need a kind of hero. <br /> <br /> Years later, I finally got the chance to see the reruns as a teenager, and I loved it immensely. The winking acting would have escaped me when I saw it as a child, but I understood it at the age of 17 episodes because they did not release the series on DVD (to my knowledge) <br /> <br /> Tonight I enjoyed "Return to the Bat Cave" ... it was a pleasure to see because it was full of little things and insider jokes. Seeing Adam and Burt was a pleasure and this TV movie is just fantastic in every way. They play themselves while playing their roles in the series. <br /> <br /> Congratulations to the people who produced this great nostalgic "feast" ... I'll take a look again. My advice to all Batman fans is: SEE IT !!! Rent it !!! Lend it from a friend !!! Buy it !!! I would never expect to rate this as 9/10 ... Very well done!
