There is no connection between Fortier and Profiler, only the fact that both are police series about violent crime. The profiler looks crispy, Fortier looks classic. Profiler plots are pretty simple. Fortier's plot is much more complicated ... Fortier looks more like Prime Suspect, if we have to recognize similarities ... The main character is weak and weird but has "clairvoyance". People like to compare, judge, evaluate. How about just enjoying? Funny is that people who write Fortier look American, on the other hand, they argue that they prefer American series (!!!). Maybe it's the language or the mind, but I think this series is more English than American. By the way, the actors are really good and funny. Acting is not superficial at all ...
