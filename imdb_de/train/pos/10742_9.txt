Difficult movie to comment on, how do you say it is bad? Well, that's not it, but it's just as hard to say that it's good. What it is is a fascinating view, it is as close as possible to destruction without being there. The photographs of the tsunami approaching the coast of Thailand have come to life. You know you want to turn away, but you have to watch. <br /> <br /> The Naudet brothers treat the comment very well, even in most cases tragic of the circumstances, there is a look at something that happens in another country neither shame nor insults. The facts refer to the cellulose, and the viewer needs little to understand or understand what's going on. <br /> <br /> You can not change history, and you should not want this movie to prove humanity in its darkest hour.
