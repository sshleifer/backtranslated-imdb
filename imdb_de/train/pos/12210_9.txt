People say it was funny, but they had to reduce it considerably in post-production. I got married as a professor at ucsd harry, and frankly, it's one of the best classes I've ever had. It's pretty funny to see here what happened because Harry made the movie because Harry is so animated. originally i saw "joy of life" for another class where harry had a voice in the movie, and i only started this movie after i started the class. Harry originally did some performance work and is truly sincere in creating moments that move you, especially if you need to rework things until you meet this moment, but it's something you'll see in this movie.
