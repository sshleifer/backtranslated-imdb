The sopranos (who are now preparing for their end) are the pinnacle of adult television and drama. When The Sopranos hits the mark, it really hits the mark. With great lyrics and great actors (most of them Goodfellas collaborators), the series can progress in a satisfying, unpredictable and extraordinary way. For the cast is James Gandolfini, who is Tony Soprano for all intensive purposes, and Edie Falco, who can certainly hold its own. The series also features a large collection of regulars to promote the plot by all means necessary (usually violence and bad language). Tony Sirico, Michael Imperioli and Steve Van Zandt are great secondary characters that make each episode more interesting. Seasonal extras are also worth mentioning, including names like Steve Buscemi (great!), Joe Pantoliano (great!), David Proval (good), Robert Patrick, Robert Loggia and Frank Vincent. <br /> <br /> The Sopranos is a great family drama and a realistic interpretation of modern mafia companies that create a unique television despite the rare bad storylines. Symbolism and simple storylines, dreams and shootings, and many other things create intertwined stories and relationships that lead to another perfect HBO package at the end of each season. Look at it ...
