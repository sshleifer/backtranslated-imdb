Sad story of a downed B-17 pilot. Brady is shot down over occupied territory. The local ranchers offered him friendliness and protection at the expense of their own lives. I had never heard of this movie and it got me two hours. After the movie, I'm glad I took my time. It's a whole story that explains how Brady would look like at the beginning of the movie.
