With this documentation you travel around the globe. It contains rare and stunning sequels from the wild. It shows you how varied and how fragile our planet can be. The future of the polar bear is highlighted at the beginning and at the end. After all, their bleak future is closely linked to the consequences of global warming. However, this documentary is a simplified approach to such a serious environmental problem. However, it is easy to see for young children as it remains mainly descriptive. Scientists may be disappointed, as this is not a remake of Al Gore's documentary "An Inconvenient Truth." Then one question could be asked: Is not it worth it to preserve the beauty of our world? Because this documentation proves that despite the different pollution in 2007, such a beauty is still present. When we live in cities, we often forget that we are part of this species. All in all, this documentary reminds us that we own a common treasure called "EARTH".
