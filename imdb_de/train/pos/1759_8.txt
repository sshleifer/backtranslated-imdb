I'm not sure if the term "serious comedy" applies to this movie. I'm not even sure if this can be applied. In recent years, the cinemas have become full of comedy films that are way too stupid to even make us smile. Therefore, I considered the films that do not meet these requirements as "serious comedies." <br /> <br /> Does the 40-year-old maiden fit in this guild? This is ultimately up to you, but in my opinion, this is a very funny movie. They laugh a lot, and it provides a social commentary through some really great characters and situations. <br /> <br /> I'm pretty, there's more than a 40-year-old maiden and even the people who do exist do not exactly match those specifications, they may feel identified by one of the characters in the movie, especially men , <br /> <br /> The story, as the title implies, is about Andy, a shy, silent man who gathers action figures, watches Survivor with his octogenarian neighbors and their favorite band is Asia. Kal is Andy's employee at SmartTech. He believes that Andy is a psychopath until Andy's secret is revealed. Kal is clearly a sexual pervert, but he still seems to get what he wants with the other genre. <br /> <br /> David is the passionate guy who is still in love with his ex-girlfriend who ran away with another guy. And Jay, a man in a relationship who seems to be affected by his uninterrupted fraud and his deceived actions. <br /> <br /> I'm pretty sure most kids between the ages of 13 and 21 have already seen this movie, but really has no age limit to enjoy it. In case you have not seen it and enjoy a little laugh with social commentary, go to your video library and rest from these deep and depressing independent films. <br /> <br /> This also includes DVD bonuses that you will really see from top to bottom.
