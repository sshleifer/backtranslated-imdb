This film has made me incomprehensible, he is and remains my favorite movie of all time, especially because he has rolled almost every emotion in his 157 minutes. The hardest part for me is that whenever I want to hear the amazing music and songs from the movie, I have to put them in my DVD player. I wonder if anyone knows anywhere who sings the songs in the movie and where to find them, as I've searched everywhere I can think sporadically in the last 5 years. My favorite quote from the film is when the lawyer says in court, "But your own words call for direct confrontation, is not that a straightforward call to violence?" Biko answers, "Well, you and I are in confrontation now, but I do not see any violence !!" <br /> <br /> CRAIG ROBERTSON Fife, Scotland
