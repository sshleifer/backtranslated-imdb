Midnight Cowboy is not for everyone. It's raw, painful and realistic, but very entertaining. Leading actors Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman, who would later become Oscar-winning actors, deliver amazing performances. Voight as Texas Hustler, Joe Buck, who moves from the small town of Texas to New York City to become a Hustler. He does not apologize for his job, but it's not that easy. The New York women like the rich lady, played by Georgeann Johnson and Cass, played by the Oscar nominee Sylvia Miles, are different from the women in Texas. Unfortunately, Buck tries to escape his previous life in Texas. He was raised by his grandmother Sally Buck, played by the wonderful actress Ruth White, who died of cancer in 1969. The filming locations in New York City are wonderful to watch, just as the relationship between Fatso, played by Hoffman and Bock's characters, develops into a moving friendship between men and men. The men fight to survive in New York City by not sticking to the rules like a real job. As the movie evolves, Buck's past comes to the surface and it's haunting, but not clear. The movie is not for kids, but compared to today's movies and TV programs, Midnight Cowboy could be tamer. I can not forget a young Brenda Vaccaro and a party that you can not forget. It's also a tear-maker of a movie, so get your handkerchiefs out too.
