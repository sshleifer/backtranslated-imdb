Henry Fonda brilliantly captures what we have long believed in Abraham Lincoln. It is a fool. Through the performance of Fonda, we believe (on the surface) that Abraham Lincoln was a country hump. But through his confrontation with the lynch mob, and especially during the trial, you can see that under the outer attitudes is a brilliant man who has a good command of what is going on around him and how he can influence the people around him. <br /> <br /> In this film, Henry Fonda shows that he understands how to portray humor very well. It is an aspect of him that has been lost over the years. When he tells stories and jokes, he has the timing perfect. There is a sequence in the study that made me laugh a lot. He shows this gift again in The Lady Eve in 1940. <br /> <br /> The end of John Ford is absolutely brilliant. Henry Fonda goes up a hill and in the distance a huge storm that symbolizes the Civil War. He goes on in history. The film is fiction, but the insight in Lincoln is enormous. Definitely worth seeing again.
