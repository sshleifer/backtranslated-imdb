I've seen the Thin Man series - Powell and Loy are definitely great, but Powell and Arthur's chemistry is a little sweet in this movie. Jean Arthur shines as she looks at Powell. Between them there is an unmistakable undercurrent. Although this film does not have the meaning of the Thin Man series, it certainly makes it appealing. As I saw it, I was sure that Powell had an off-screen affair with Arthur. My friends thought the same thing. This is a movie in which I wish I could go back to the past (pouting lips with Powell and holding my lips!). Powell's character Lawrence Bradford is probably what comes closest to the "perfect man." Okay, that sounds way too spritzig, but I can not help myself.
