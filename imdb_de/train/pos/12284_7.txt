I could not understand why Jeremy Irons felt it necessary to show a most disquieting accent spoken through the clenched teeth and back of his neck. In fact, it has rather spoiled the movie for me and distracted from his probably nice performance (very irritating). No other actor or actor seemed to have such a strong accent, and although I've always considered Jeremy Irons a good actor, I would not call this movie one of his best. The movie did, however, whet my appetite as some other comments were made about this film, which I found very interesting and now intends to read the book.
