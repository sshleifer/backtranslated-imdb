For most people watching the movie, this is not much of an interest, but among the many hundreds of films dealing with magic and occultism in some form, this movie is probably the best in many ways The Golem to The Craft seems to be the subject of endless interest to the film industry. The majority of the films they touch in any way do so childishly (for example "witchboard", in every sense a true piece of garbage), either by using the transcendental elements as cheap excuses for kitschy special effects or cardboard displays (see "Warlocks"). Often, the theme appears in a hysterical religious context (in the various Revelations-oriented films, the Antichrist is inevitably a proponent of a kind of New Age style practice.) In rare cases, a film may at least show some passing experience with magic, as it does is practiced in real life, but the portrayal of the occult in such films can at best be described as allegorical and not literal, symbolic or ... not quite right. <br /> <br /> I have this movie after many years again I've seen it on VHS, it's a dark, moody piece, and after watching it on DVD I would say, if you intend to watch this movie, watch on DVD, do not look on VHS. <br /> <br /> The darkness and whims overwhelm at VHS, but on DVD the movie gets a completely different sound. We think Weir deliberately pushed the dark aspects for the style, but when the movie is converted to the lower color medium of VHS, it goes over the edge. DVD brings the movie back to life and I saw it differently. Anyway, when I saw him for the first time, I realized that treating magic in this movie is extremely good. It is difficult to answer all the reasons why, I do not want to take the time for it. <br /> <br /> For anyone who is curious about seeing what life is like, this movie is just right on countless levels. <br /> <br /> And for anyone who is not, you've really spent a lot of time reading to this point.
