I remember that I did not like such an image when I first published it. James "Not Jim" Belushi, a hammy young actress, and a cheesy title in a formula by John Hughes. You could not have paid me for it 15 years ago. But I witnessed it on a Sunday afternoon when I wasted it, and it hits me on a few levels. The Fairy Tale (Part Pretty Woman, Part Reverse Pretty Woman), the very vulnerable Elizabeth_Perkins_in_Miracle_On_42nd_Street-like performance by Kelly Lynch, The Escapism. Overall, it gently pulls some very nice strings. It's pretty hard not to go down in history, fall in love with Kelly Lynch, identify with James Belushi, dislike the stiff, bad guy, and laugh at the Curley Sue lines. Has all the ups and downs, with a happy ending and the kind of message you want to hear. Waste your time with this movie, it's worth it.
