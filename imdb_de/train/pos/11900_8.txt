Both visually and musically stunning. A treat for the eyes and ears. The quintessence of the Victorian elements of the opening sequences was absolutely enchanting, helping to create a Christmas scene that Dickens himself would justifiably have been proud of. Technically, the staging is visually stimulating and the special effects are imaginatively conceived and creatively implemented in a traditional stage design. The dancing of many of the leading artists is breathtakingly good. The photography and the light are first class and the sound recording fits perfectly to the high technical level. A great movie for the whole family at Christmas time and a delightful discovery that withstands multiple viewing.
