Considering all the teenage movies like "The Breakfast Club" and "Pretty In Pink" that are being praised. It is surprising that this is ignored here. <br /> <br /> There is no sex, but sex is thought of, including the idea that what others think about it is important. The children do not always get along with their parents, but neither the parents nor the children are always considered right or wrong, and the parents are not seen as monsters. <br /> <br /> This is hero worship. How a girl does a dangerous thing that could have led to a really dusty thing before she realizes that she was wrong. <br /> <br /> The film is a bit ahead of its time. A child asks another child what kind of birth control they are using. She says she does nothing to need birth control. She answers (wrongly) "oral sex".
