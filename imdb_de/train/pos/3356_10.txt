Ettore Scola is one of the most important Italian directors. My parents and I together saw "C'eravamo tanto amati" on a summer night: We liked it, but we did not love it because we loved "a special day". I think Ettore Scola is pretty underrated: we often forget to remember him, maybe because his latest films were disappointing. Last night, my mother and I sat on our sofa to enjoy this masterpiece. The writing, the direction, the cinematography, the score and the production design were sober and precise, but I liked most the chemistry between Loren and Mastroianni. They are both excellent actors and play the lead roles of Antonietta and Gabriele. Antonietta is a housewife: married to a fanatical fascist, she has six children, but her husband wants to have another child to receive a prize for the big families. Gabriele is simply an antifascist. They spent a special day together, the special day of 1938, when Hitler traveled to Mussolini. I do not want to be pampered about the plot: look for this movie!
