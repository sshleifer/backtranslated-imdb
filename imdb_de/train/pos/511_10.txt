I saw this movie for the first time almost 21 years ago, when it was an ITV (before the days of cable and satellite) Matin√©e. I was with the mumps from school and was totally wrapped up in the movie. I've been buying it on video for about 10 years and want to get a DVD copy of it. David Niven is my eternal favorite actor and I think it's a travesty that he passed away so often when the Oscars passed. I also think that the Queen should have knighted him, as he did easily for the film industry, if not more than Sean Connery or Anthony Hopkins. The way the film goes from black and white to color and back again is well done, and the film has outstanding actors like Roger Livesy, Marius Goring, and an early Richard Attenborough performance.
