All Dogs Go To Heaven is, in my opinion, the best animated movie ever made. I'm not a big fan of animation, but there's something that makes it better than any other animated movie I've seen. The music is wonderful, as well as the performances of Burt Reynolds, Dom Deluise and especially Ken Page as King Gator. "Let's Make Music Together" is perhaps one of my favorite songs from all the movie scores I've ever seen. This is definitely a must for people of all ages.
