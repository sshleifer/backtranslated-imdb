Pop Quiz: You are a part of modern peacetime forces during routine maneuvers, and you are thrown back in the past and have a chance to change history. How are you? If you are a Hollywood studio, change the Japanese G.Is to G.I. Samurai (aka Timeslip) to the crew of an American aircraft carrier, they argue about stopping the attack on Pearl Harbor for 90 minutes, and then go home and hope that no one reminds Japan that first and with more Balls made this Sonny Chiba movie in 1979. However, unlike its counterpart in Hollywood, The Final Countdown, this is based on its premise: 400 years into the Japanese feudal war, soldiers in peacetime decide that their best hope of coming back is provoking history by trying to change them by joining a warlord conquer the land? Here you will find many tanks and helicopters against samurai action, including an impressive, relentless, 25-minute combat sequence in which thousands of performers do serious damage to each other. And yes, there are beheadings. <br /> <br /> Of course, things are not going according to plan, and even superior firepower will not hold up as well as thousands of soldiers had hoped for. Even before that, soldiers fall into those who want to go home, those who want to go to war and those who want to rape and plunder for hell. Impressively judged and surprisingly well thought out, Soft Rock and Country and Western songs are sometimes a distraction, especially if they contain English lyrics sung by Japanese singers who utter the words inaudible, let alone speak the language, but it's a forgivable mistake in a surprisingly good science fiction actioner. <br /> <br /> Optimum's UK DVD is a good transmission of the uncut 138-minute version.
