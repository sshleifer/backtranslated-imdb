I really enjoyed this episode. When I saw The Flash, Cyborg, Green Arrow, and Aquaman (though he was just swimming), my eyes grew big. Seeing most of the Justice League founders trying to topple Lex Luthor is what I've been waiting for. It sounds a bit off the topic, but if I do a live action Justice League show, I definitely would have a reason to push everything I normally do during the week into the abyss, just for one episode see. This is the thrill I got from watching this episode. I wish they had made this episode a bit longer, like a two-hour special, because I thought that one hour of the Justice League was not enough. Well, before I'm boring you (unless I've already done it with my hiking), all I'd say is that Smallville is cool again. As the show began to focus on Lana, she somehow lost contact. But I'm sure the writers will just fall back into this hole. :( So, enjoy this episode Who knows when a good person will come out? Catch this Thursday, February 22nd again, once you've missed the first air.
