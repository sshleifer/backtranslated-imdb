The worst movie ever? Wow, Whoa now. You can not be serious. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's just what you expect from a movie. I live in Oregon, so I was able to enjoy the beautifully filmed footage of familiar but still amazingly beautiful Smith Rocks and other areas in Central Oregon (as well as the cute cameo of our own Ken Kesey and Ken Babbs staring at Baby Sissy's cradle at the beginning of the film). These alone were enough to motivate me to give the film a better rating than "average". <br /> <br /> Or ... Maybe it's just about what your expectations are. After reading the book AGES and thinking for myself: "Gosh, nobody could ever make a movie out of this interesting, quirky, weird book ... especially 20 years later, when morals (MORAYS -) are not part of the book Accent Marks Online) Have Changed "- I was actually quite surprised when I saw the movie in 1994, when it came out, and today even liked it even more when I look at it again. <br /> <br /> Sissy was exquisitely staffed. and I do not care what you all say. I was also pleasantly surprised by Rain Phoenix and John Hurt. I am neither lesbian nor bi and trans not, but I have met a lot of people who are similar to the people they should portray - and these "real" people behaved just like these actors. Slightly stilted, stage eyes - always a bit "on". Gus Van Sant is a strange native Oregonian, but he got on very well with adapting this crazy IMHO book.
