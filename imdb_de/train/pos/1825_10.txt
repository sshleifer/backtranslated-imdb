I saw this movie when I was young, and I remembered the first movie I really liked, that was not an action movie or a comedy. In my later years, I decided to take another look and see if it was just nostalgia or if there really was something in that movie. To my surprise, the movie kept all my expectations. It's a great movie. Emotionally in the right amount, some jokes, nice songs (not great and that explains why I did not remember being a musical) and all in all a great use for my time. I was surprised because the last films I've revised from my childhood do not even have my minimal pretensions to a decent movie, and yet this movie, which I first saw in the second grade, made me cry today just as it made me cry then. Maybe it's because my dog ​​died recently and maybe not, but the most important thing is that I have the feeling, and that's why filmmakers make films (that and money, of course). Yes, there are continuity disorders. Yes, the script has holes, but it does not matter. The movie itself is fun and smart. So do not be fooled by cynical people who are always looking for the bad things in life, because nothing is perfect, and this movie gets a 10, not because it's perfect. It's getting 10, just because it made me feel.
