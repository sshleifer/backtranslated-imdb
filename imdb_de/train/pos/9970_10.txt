The brilliant use of exaggerated Technicolor illustrates the optimistic extremes of today's Christmas ceremonies. The voyeuristic element in the scenes (Santa & Pedro summarize the behavior of society through a telescope) is unique (and obviously Jean-Luc Godard, though subtle, stole this theme in his film Pierrot le-fou). Highly recommended!
