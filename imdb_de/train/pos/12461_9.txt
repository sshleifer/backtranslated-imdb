A clever script from the late SEBASTIAN JAPRISOT and clever performances by the two male lead roles - ALAIN DELON and CHARLES BRONSON (or should it be the other way around) lead to a thrilling and entertaining thriller. <br /> <br /> Add to The expert guidance of veteran JEAN HERMAN and a scanty but effective score by FRANCOIS DE ROUBAIX makes it easy to see why this film has a weird timeless quality. <br /> <br /> This is a friendly buddy or bonding story with two Disillusioned and world-weary loners probably returned from Algiers. Like the other colonial powers of the time (after the Second World War, which led to the 1960s), France had struggled to maintain its overseas presence. Losing Algiers was a big blow. <br /> <br /> ADIEU L'AMI (the original title) reports on the actions of our two (anti) heroes while struggling to give it a try after their release. <Br /> <br /> One thing happens after another, and the onlooker really needs to be careful, because JAPRISOT is lean and sparing with his script: if it's there, then there must be a reason. <br /> <br / Suffice to say that these two men are physically and psychologically competing on a long weekend. Their motivation is very different, their goals are different - their survival completely depends on each other. That ALAIN DELON and CHARLES BRONSON are so different on the outside - the first, probably a handsome boy, and the latter an ugly thug, adds to the chemistry. This search makes a great story, which, in turn, makes a great movie. <br /> <br /> So as not to forget that there are women in this film, and to be faithful to the Japrisot method, they too are memorable, if not nearly as pronounced; Much more could be said to spoil the joy of discovering its true nature. <br /> <br /> FAREWELL, FRIEND WAS LEFT IN UK. AN ANAMORPHIC IMAGE, 16.9 IMPROVED; ONLY in English (not even subtitles for the hard of hearing); A TIME OF 110 MINUTES; MONO SOUNDTRACK, but the music of DE ROUBAIX has a lot of punch! <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
