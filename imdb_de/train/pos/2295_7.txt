There is a very smart sense of humor in this film that is both a parody and a tribute to actors. After a while, however, it seems to be just a stylistic exercise (despite big gags like Balasko's sequel to Dussolier and very good acting by all involved). I wondered why Blier made this movie. Everything reveals itself in the end when Blier, who directs Claude Brasseur, receives a call from his father (Bernard Blier) - from heaven - and gets the chance to say how much he misses him. An effective emotional capper that obviously comes from the heart. However, there is not enough dramatic tension or emotional involvement to keep the rest of the movie interesting throughout its life. Some really nice scenes and sequences, and anyone who likes these "mosntres sacr√©s" of French cinema, should enjoy this movie to some extent.
