"The Shop Around the Corner" is one of the great films by director Ernst Lubitsch. In addition to the talents of James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan, it is filled with a great cast of top performers such as Frank Morgan and Felix Bressart. They are the kind of actors that Hollywood does not occupy anymore. In fact, the movie is the kind of movie that Hollywood does not do anymore. (The creators of "You've Got Mail" claim that their film is a remake, but that's just a lot of bloated self-praise.) If you have an affinity for romantic comedies of the 1940s, you'll find "The Shop Around." the Corner "is nothing short of wonderful. Just as well with repeated considerations. Enjoy!
