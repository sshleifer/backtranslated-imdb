What a great gem! It's an unusual story that's fun to watch. Yes, it has vocals, but it is beautifully incorporated into the story and it is very melodious to hear. It was so nice to see; I enjoyed it from start to finish! <br /> <br /> The film is set in England during the Second World War. It's about an apprentice witch who is looking for a missing part of a spell she needs. She uses her crude "magic" to transport her and three of her children to various destinations to find her. They are accompanied by their distance teacher, who is surprised to learn that teaching at his school actually works! <br /> <br /> Although the special effects may seem a bit dated at first glance, once you get used to them, they will become the charm of this movie. In fact, the film won an Oscar for these effects! <br /> <br /> The movie is innocent and fun - and it's hard not to like the melodic songs. The characters are wonderful to look at. I think that anyone of any age can find something for this movie.
