I saw this movie a few weeks ago, and it's gotten stuck in my head ever since. It plays two fascinating characters in unfortunately mediocre documentation. To learn the true story of the Beales, I had to go through all the bonus material and comments on the DVD and search the web. <br /> <br /> Although the Maysles and their fans (not to mention Edith and Edie themselves) bristle at the suggestion that this movie is exploitative, this is exploitation in the truest sense of the word. Little is done to explain the Beales or how they came to the state they were in. Maysle's approach seems to be to simply turn on the camera and wait until Edith and Edie say something outrageous. The sound even at the Criterion release is bad and difficult to follow. Although I know this film was filmed a little earlier in the history of the documentary, it is ironic to have him starring at Geraldo Rivera's (!) Far superior series on the sexual abuse of mentally disabled patients at Willowbrook State School in Staten Island four years ago compare Before Gray Gardens was filmed. <br /> <br /> To rewrite a New Yorker review, there were many things that Edith and Edie needed in their lives, and no documentation was one of them. <br /> <As for Edith and Edie, as I watched the movie, I always thought, "Where the hell is her family?" They lived in dangerous, unhealthy and unsafe conditions. How could it be that Jackie O, who was married to one of Earth's richest men (or the wealthy Bouvier family herself), could not afford Edith and Edie a decent home? Or at least hire a part-time housekeeper or a caregiver to come in and keep an eye on them? It is shameful and a permanent disgrace to the entire Bouvier family. <br /> <br /> Although this review may sound negative, I would recommend Gray Gardens to anyone who likes documentary films. Maybe someday someone will come along and make a documentary about this documentary - the rich back story (and post-story) of the Beales and the entire Hamptons society in the 70s.
