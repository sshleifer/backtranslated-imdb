After finding it for half a year, I finally found a copy and was not disappointed. <br /> <br /> Not disappointing because I'm one of the die-hard SMAP fans who have to see all their works and me finally see Goro's so-called hot movie. But I could not believe that Goro had to make a film as such. I'm sure he filmed the movie in this decent self. Still, they found the perfect person to look embarrassed, uncomfortable, and half-depressed. Man, I still can not believe he made this movie ... I had to cover my movie Do not believe eyes in many places that he really made such a movie .... hahahaha .... <br / > <br /> But I'm glad I saw him. Thank God he is grown ...
