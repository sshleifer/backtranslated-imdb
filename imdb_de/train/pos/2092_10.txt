I have seen this movie with some curiosity. I wanted to see if 1) Paul Muni could play Chinese and 2) Luise Rainer earned her Oscar. I got away from the movie and thought YES! After seeing Muni in a single movie, in which he was pretty hammy, I expected the same kind of performance here. Fortunately, I proved wrong. Although some have criticized him in the Hollywood idea of ​​Asians as too childlike and stereotypical, I thought he was just right in the role. Keye Luke would have played him in the same way if he got the chance to play a starring role. <br /> <br /> I was particularly impressed by the camera work and the use of crowd scenes. especially during the plundering of the palace, where O-Lan once was a slave. The graphic and gloomy atmosphere of the firing squad and the drought made the whole thing an epic that differs from the others at the same time when everything glittered and glittered. I loved this movie from beginning to end. I can not say the same for the epics of today.
