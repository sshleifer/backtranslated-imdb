Nina Foch insists that "My Name is Julia Ross" plays the main role in this film noir from 1945 starring Dame May Witty and George Macready. It's short, and because it does, the movie suffers. It could have taken fifteen minutes to half an hour longer. <br /> <br /> When I was growing up, Foch was a regular on TV, playing a neurotic woman, the wife with the cheating husband. The Nervous Wreck She became one of the great acting teachers in Los Angeles. Here she is a pretty young expert who plays the title role. Julia answers an ad for a secretary and is immediately hired by Mrs. Hughes and her son Ralph. Little does she know - although we learn right away - that the recruitment agency is a front prepared to get just the right woman for the job, a woman without a family and a boyfriend in the situation; Once Julia is in the house, she is drugged, and when she wakes up, she has said that she is Mrs. Hughes and is not allowed to go. <br /> <br /> The acting is very good. Low budget, but still entertaining - some things, especially at the end, run off too fast, so I said the movie was too short. Nevertheless, I recommend it.
