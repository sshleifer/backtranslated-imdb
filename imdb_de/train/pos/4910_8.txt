This very good film crackles with tension. The stakes are of course high - will the police and Widmark, the public health doctor, arrest the criminals who do not know they are carrying the plague before a major epidemic breaks out? However, minor plot elements lead to tensions in every scene - between Widmark and the police captain, between the villains played by Palance and Mostel, between Palance and a dying, plague-stricken man Palance mistakenly claims to be involved in a manhunt smuggled a valuable asset between Widmark and his wife and with the underlying question of whether the public can be better served by informing them of the danger or hiding the situation in order to avoid a major panic. The film is beautifully filmed by Kazan, in exceptionally well-choreographed long shots shot on-site in New Orleans, and ends in a breathtaking climax as Palance flees like a rat from his pursuers through the city's docks and warehouses. The comment is great, probably the best I've ever heard. It includes cinematography, shot-setting and lighting, production design, audition of non-professional actors in small roles, and irony and parallels in the plot, such as a revealing seminar on 1950's film techniques and film noir in general. Take a look at the movie to enjoy the movie yourself and, if you are interested in filming, a second time with the commentary on learning.
