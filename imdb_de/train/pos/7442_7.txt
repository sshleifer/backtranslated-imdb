I borrowed the movie (I do not think he has a theatrical release here), expecting the worst. The previews made the movie look awful. I was really surprised, it's worth it to see it; it was written loosely, almost like an ensemble movie piece. It had some very funny moments and though flawed, it is an effective satire on the show and people on the show without being too intrusive. It's flawed, especially because of the awful soundtrack of "comedy" effects, but on the whole it seems honest and generally a form of show in an old-Manesque or Larry Sanders way. Right now it's the fashion, Jerry Springer to be critical, he is also an easy target. Springer could have made Citizen Kane, and it would be called "the worst movie ever". I can recommend this movie to anyone who is interested in the show. A flawed, but innovative and interesting piece of film.
