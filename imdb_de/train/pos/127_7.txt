Zentropa has a lot in common with The Third Man, another noir-like movie that plays under the rubble of post-war Europe. As with TTM, there is a lot of imaginative camera work. There is an innocent American who deals emotionally with a woman he does not really understand, and whose naivety is all the more conspicuous, unlike the natives. <br /> The third man has a well-done action. Zentropa is a bit incoherent in this regard. Perhaps this is intentional: it is presented as a dream / nightmare and too coherent would affect the effect. <br /> <br /> This film is relentlessly grim - "noir" in more than one sense; you never see the sun shine. Grim, but fascinating and scary.
