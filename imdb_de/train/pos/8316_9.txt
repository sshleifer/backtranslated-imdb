I saw this movie every chance I got, back in the 1970s, when it came out via cable. It was my introduction to Harlem that fascinates me (and Bill Clinton) ever since. I was still very young and the movie made a big impression on me. It was great to watch a movie about other young girls growing up, trying to decide who they wanted to be, making some bad and good decisions. The beauty of Lonette McKee, the great clothes they could finally wear, and the brisk dialogues impressed me. As someone who was also raised by a single mother, I really identified with these girls and their lives. It's weird, these characters seem almost more real to me than Beyonce Knowles!
