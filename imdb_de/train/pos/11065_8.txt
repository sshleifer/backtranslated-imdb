This comedy with a lot of pain and sadness succeeds where most others fail. There have been many films of this genre with notable actors trying to achieve this elusive mixture that has not come close to the depth and skill of this film. This is certainly because the extraordinary cast of outstanding performances by Reg Rogers and Ally Sheedy is so spontaneous that the reality of their characters quickly captures your interest and emotions throughout the movie. Initially, the action seems rather unconventional and mind-boggling, but one learns little by little that these two miserably damaged people desperately and unwillingly try to heal themselves, even if subsequently, through each other. Roger's heartbreaking expressions of numb pain and Sheedy's angry outbursts are so eloquent that you can feel them when you watch them. They will take care of these two sympathetic but deeply suffering people and hope that they will succeed because there are doubts and all are hanging by a weak emotional thread. Hopefully, viewers will see more of Reg Rogers and Ally Sheedy, as this film proves their merit as a very accomplished actor beyond doubt.
