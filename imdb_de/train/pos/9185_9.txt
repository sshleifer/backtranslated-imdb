The double exposure was a huge surprise. It contains outstanding acting (especially from the underappreciated Callan), fine cinematography and a captivating storyline. In other words, it is one of the best horror efforts of the 1980s. Callan plays a fashion photographer who experiences the dreams of murdering his models at a time when he is united with his psychologically unpredictable brother (who lacks an arm and a leg). When the models that Callan dreams of killing actually appear dead, the photographer begins to doubt his own reason ... but the image has more to offer than he sees. <br /> <br /> This movie has never earned the praise deserved. Most critics and movie lovers associate it with the horde of Slasher films released at the same time, but it stands far above the mass of that sad lot. It's smart and unique, which you can not easily say about most of the films in this genre, but it's also passionately designed and performed. DOUBLE EXPOSURE is a gem of this kind.
