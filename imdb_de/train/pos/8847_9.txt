When I watch a movie and do not even look at my watch or watch to see how long it is going, or when I hope the last scene is not the end of the movie, it must be pretty good. I am not a film internalist or a cinema dissectionist. I watch movies, and if they're interested in me until the end, they're pretty good, because some of the critically acclaimed movies bore me to death (The English Patient, Shakespeare in Love, Atonement, Crash). This movie has interested me and is busy The show is great, the story is absolutely original, the Flash Back technique is very emotional: a bit of Citizen Kane was thrown into the room when Hoffman leaves his apartment to Tomei, but I forgive that because I consider it a tribute to Orson and not just a rip-off.
