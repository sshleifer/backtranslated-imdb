This movie is a great way to end the series for good. Peter (the boy of Puppet Master III) is grown up and is now the Puppet Master. Well, this girl is coming to destroy the dolls and learn the secrets of Toulon. Instead she hears the story about the dolls. Most of the film consists of footage from Puppet Master II, Puppet Master III, Puppet Master 4, Puppet Master 5, Curse of the Puppet Master and Retro Puppet Master (sorry ... but I think Paramount would not make them To use scenes from 1). Personally, I wish Puppet Master Vs. Demonic Toys would finally be made, but as this movie ends, they basically say, "This is the last movie in the series ..."
