The surprise nominee of this year's Best Animated Feature Race at the Oscars. It is an Irish film by heart, but co-produced by Belgium and Brazil, and animators work in all three countries. The product is one of the most beautiful and unique films lately. The character design is reminiscent of the French animated film Persepolis from a few years ago with very simple characters with thick black contours. This movie is not in black and white. Oh no. What makes this movie so great is the use of color, just one of the most amazing and exciting colors I've ever seen. The overall design of the pictures is much more geometric, with characters that are essentially rectangles or ovals. Much of the film can be used to search the circle - a key aspect of the visual design is a circle in the center of the image. All these geometric designs have a purpose - the story is about a young boy who learns to be an artist working on illuminated manuscripts (the Book of Kells is a real illuminated Bible, the art of the film is based on the drawings in it) ). The story of the movie is not very deep, but it's a pretty good fantasy story. Brendan is a small boy in Kells, a city surrounded by enormous walls and built by his uncle to keep the Vikings out. Brother Aiden, a freshman in Kells, inspired Brendan to engage in illustrations. He also inspires him to leave Kells and explore the nearby forest where a nymph lives. Bruno Coulais delivers a fantastic result, almost as good as Coraline's, which I consider the best of the year.
