This is a totally adorable and unexpected movie. They begin by following a young person who hopes to enter the qualifying football match between Bahrain and Iran. If Iran wins, they will enter the 2006 World Cup in Germany. The problem is that the adolescent is a girl and girls (or women for that matter) are not allowed in football games to sit with men. What follows is a wonderful comedy played by a small ensemble of perfect skill. The film examines the absurdity of the restrictions on freedom of women (and the young soldiers who must force them). There are some great set pieces, not least if one of the girls has to go to the bathroom and the stadium does not have toilets for women. The camera work is the easiest and in some ways this story could have been told as a stage play. However, it is the small scale that gives the film its bite. Big cinema? No probably not; great entertainment - sure.
