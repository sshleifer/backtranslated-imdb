Personally, this is one of my favorites of all time! no, I'm not 10 .. I'm 30! I own an old, original VHS of it, which I bought in a rental business. I have seen it countless times. <br /> <br /> While it's a fun movie for kids, it's a fascinating adult movie. I've seen this movie once, even though I was not sober. My eyes were open to things I had never noticed before. I saw that morality was strongly encouraged, both openly and somewhat subliminally. I wish I could remember all the things I've noticed, but it's been a long time since then. Rest assured, there are tons of things that are referred to throughout the movie. If you get the chance to see it ... not sober ... then you will not be disappointed. In fact, you will probably feel more happy and warm. <br /> <br /> unique and wonderful!
