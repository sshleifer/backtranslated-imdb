For the sake of romance, as a married man. The following two films are recommended. <br /> <br /> 1. Short meeting by David Lean (1945), Great Britain <br /> <br /> Something can happen if a woman goes to a train station. And it happened! How she longed to be there, in a small tavern waiting for the man of her dreams. But she was married ... the man was a stranger to the fantasizing woman. <br /> <br /> 2. Xiao Cheng Zhi Chun of Fei Mu (1948), China <br /> <br /> When a woman on the Market goes to buy fish, food and medicine, she goes through the ruins of an old wall in a small town. There is much to think about, the melancholy of her life, her sick husband in self-pity and lack of future ... When just a cheering young doctor came, something happened ... the doctor was a high school high school woman fantasizing <br /> <br /> In both films, by great British and Chinese directors, the passion for restraint was so intense, but in the end, the intimate feelings did not develop into physical contact. This leaves a great aftertaste and smells intense without biting it.
