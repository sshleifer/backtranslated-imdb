What is "Cry Freedom"? It's just a great and unique experience of how to do South Africa and how Blacks in this land have been oppressed by whites. The main character of the story is Donald Woods (Kevin Kline), editor-in-chief of the daily Dispatch newspaper in South Africa. Woods writes several articles in which he critically talks about views of Steve Biko (Denzel Washington). Woods soon gets to know Biko and he changes his mind about him and begins to understand what the authorities in South Africa are doing for blacks (from the top, even the police chief). When Biko dies in police custody, Woods decides that he has to write a book about him and that it does not matter what he has to publish. But Woods must flee his country to publish this book, and he must also bring his family to second place so that the world can find out the truth Main statement that black and white are the same because we are all human. The story takes us to South Africa and this movie is a great way for the whole world to know what happened in this country, and I'm disappointed that only 3,200 people rated this movie. This is a movie that we can all learn from. Although it is a bit long, this story could not be presented any shorter because the director wanted to show us how hard it was for Woods to publish this book after Biko's death. <br /> <br /> Also, the relationship between Woods and Biko was great, as were the families of these two people and all the problems they are going through. But sometimes sacrifices have to be made (Biko's death) so that the truth can be praised (Woods book).
