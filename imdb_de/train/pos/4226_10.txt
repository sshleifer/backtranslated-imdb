I have a lot of time for all Columbo movies, but especially this one was extremely well written and the solution was very effective in the end. My main memory of this, however, is the opening of a scene in the middle of the film between Columbo and the killer (I apologize if I have not remembered every detail). It's the most striking picture of Columbo I've ever seen: the gaze goes out from the darkness of the cupboard where the victim was murdered, and into the room beyond, lit by daylight. Columbo sits in a high-backed chair and looks out the door (and us). He looks at the cupboard and is almost in silhouette due to the light contrast. There is no sound to be heard. The camera slowly moves out of the room and toward him. He is deep in meditation and gently blows on a cigar. Clouds of smoke cigar slowly circling upwards while he thinks. Then the dialogue begins. Outstanding.
