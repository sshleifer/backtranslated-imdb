Well, it is a long year and I have not yet published the graduation film for 2004. Panaghoy Sa Suba (Call of The River) took second place at the Metro Manila Film Festival. As expected, it was not so good at the box office, as it was too artistic for ordinary moviegoers, especially since MMFF is the season in which many families watch movies. <br /> <br /> It was quite interesting to watch a movie that was not playing Filipino or English on the screen. I thought Cesar Montano did a good job as a star and director. His great vision and creativity really helped this movie. He was also very effective as a lead star and was able to express a wide range of emotions that were required for the film. The young actress Rebecca Lusterio also performed well. She did a great job showing Bikay, Duroy's younger sister. I hope that in the future I can see her in many other film projects, maybe in other genres. I think the fact that this movie was in her local dialect really helped her. <br /> <br /> Some of the camera shots of the movie were very well done. The scenery was breathtaking, though I think a lesser effort would have been completely different. In terms of story, I feel like the writers have continued to look into the lives of the smaller characters The Movie. I certainly will not rave about the story of this movie.
