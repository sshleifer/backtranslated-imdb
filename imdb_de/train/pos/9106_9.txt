Since I saw it for the first time, "Piedras" is a personal favorite and one of the only pictures I have ever seen. The great script shows the life of a group of women (all of whom are somehow connected) with deep understanding and sensitivity. Ramón Salazar made a convincing film in his directorial debut and proves to be a powerful director. <br /> <br /> Not all services are excellent. Of all the leading ladies, they range from average (Najwa Nimri) to very good (Vicky Peña), but the standing ovations should be directed to the newcomer Mónica Cervera, who plays convincingly Antonia San Juan as a reserved daughter. Enrique Alcides is irresistibly sexy as a girl's male nurse, and there are nice twists and turns by Andrés Gertrúdix, Geli Albaladejo and the director Ramón Salazar. <br /> <br /> "Piedras" is beautifully written and filmed as I moved it so I could not stop thinking about it for days. I highly recommend it.
