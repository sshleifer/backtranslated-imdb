From the trend "Demons meets clergy" of the late 60s / early 70s, which especially the triptych "Rosemary's Baby", "The Exorcist" and "The Omen" belonged, "The Sentinel" is also just as good (if also the most overlooked). In a way, it combines the best elements of these films and throws in a dash Polanski's "The Tenant" (which came out in the same year) for a good measure. A model in New York who is unable to devote himself to his friend's lawyer moves into a moss-coated townhouse that initially appears to be a perfect bar. She meets a cunning, old neighbor (the brilliant Burgess Meredith) and the other tenants. Kept awake by loud noises above her apartment, she soon discovers that a silent priest and she are the only inhabitants of the otherwise abandoned building. From there, director Michael Winner ("Todeswunsch") gets this supernatural thriller going and there is a hell of a joy about the hallucinogenic tortures he inflicts on his heroine. Supported by a brilliant ensemble ensemble, a subtle storyline and a superb make-up effect by Dick Smith ("The Exorcist"), "The Sentinel" is a really scary horror movie.
