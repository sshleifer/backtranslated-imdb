My favorite movie genre is the Western, it's really the only one of American origin. And despite Sergio Leone, she does not like Americans. <br /> <br /> At the top of my list of the ten favorite Westerns is Winchester 73. It was the first couple and the only black and white film of the partnership of director Anthony Mann and actor James Stewart. It was also a milestone movie where Stewart opted for a percentage of the win, rather than a pure salary from Universal. Many of these offerings followed for the players and made them as rich as the moguls they hired. By that time, Anthony Mann had mostly made B-pictures, noir-typical stuff with no real budgets. Shortly before Winchester 73, Robert Taylor, Devil's Doorway, made a good Western man who never gets enough praise. I'm sure James Stewart must have seen and decided that Mann is the person with whom he chose to partner. In this film, Mann also developed a mini-corporation for which John Ford was legendary. In addition to Stewart would appear in the next man films, other actors such as Millard Mitchell, Steve Brodie, Dan Duryea, John McIntire, Jay C. Flippen and Rock Hudson. <br /> <br /> It's a simple act, James Stewart is obsessed with finding a man named Dutch Henry Brown and killing him. Why I do not say that, but so far we've never seen such cold rage on the screen by James Stewart. Anthony Mann reached into Jimmy Stewart's soul and pulled out some demons that we all fear. <br /> <br /> The hate is aptly shown at the beginning of the film in a great moment. After Stewart and buddy Millard Mitchell are disarmed by Wyatt Earp, played by Will Geer, because no weapons are being carried in Earp's Dodge City. There is a shooting contest for a Winchester rifle in Dodge City, and the favorite of the sweepstakes is the Dutch Henry Brown, who is threatened by Stephen McNally. Stewart, Mitchell and Geer go into the saloon and Stewart and McNally meet at the same moment and pick up weapons that are not there. Take a closer look at Stewart and McNally, they say more than 10 dialog pages. <br /> <br /> Another character Stewart encounters in the film is Waco Johnny Dean, played by Dan Duryea, who almost steals the movie. This was possibly Duryea's most beautiful moment on the screen. He is a psychopathic outlaw killer who is deadly like a left-hander, despite having two six cannons. <br /> <br /> Another person Stewart encounters is Shelley Winters, whose fiancee is driven into a showdown by Duryea and killed. Her best scenes are with Duryea, who is interested in her. She plays for time, until she can safely move away from him. Guess who she's finally done with? <br /> <br /> There are wonderful performances in small roles, there is no sour tone in the cast. John McIntire as a nimble Indian trader, Jay C. Flippen as the army's grisly sergeant, and Rock Hudson got his first name as a young Indian chief. Even John Alexander, known as "Theodore Roosevelt" in Arsenic and Old Lace, has a brief but impressive role as owner of a trading post where both McNally and Stewart stop at different times. Mann and Stewart made eight films, five of which were western, and ready to make a sixth Western night passage as they quarrel and Mann left the set. The end of a beautiful partnership that produced some quality films.
