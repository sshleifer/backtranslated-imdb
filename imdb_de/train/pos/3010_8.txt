William Powell's last assignment as Philo Vance takes place in The Kennel Murder Case, where the murder of a championship dog leads to two more murders and an attempt by mankind. It all depends on how that leads to who and why. <br /> <br /> SS Van Dine's Philo Vance murders were the most popular at the time, and the crafty Mr. Van Dine found a way to sell his books one by one to the highest bidder. That's why you see so many Philo Vances and so many studios releasing them. Had Bill Powell not become known as Nick Charles of the Thin Man series with MGM, he would have been known as the greatest Philo Vances. <br /> <br /> It turned out that Powell had denied his little Terrier captain in the same contest in which the murdered dog was registered and then another rival owner became the first murder victim. As usual, Powell shows Eugene Palette as Sergeant Heath, whose biggest contribution to the process was to tear down the locking door from the inside door where the first murder victim was found. I said he was locked inside and it was a top story, so it was figuring out how. Powell has a lovely group of suspects that are as extensive as is normally the case in a Thin Man puzzle. People like Paul Cavanaugh, Helen Vinson, Ralph Morgan, and Mary Astor are filling their casting lines well. Warner Brothers liked this version so much that they revived it in the thirties with James Stephenson in his thirties, a single outing as Philo Vance. It does not hold a candle for this. <br /> <br /> As this is the only Powell Philo Vance that definitely appears on VHS or DVD, be sure to see or purchase it here if you can.
