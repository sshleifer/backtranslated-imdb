This will be another type of review. I've watched this movie twice on TV and would like a copy because it talks about Panama City and the beach in winter, which is my favorite time to be there. It was the first movie I saw of Ashley Judd. She was great and I enjoyed all the other things I saw her in. Sundance's response also impressed me, just like the director Victor Nunez, who directed this and wrote several films about Florida. This movie speaks to me and I have not seen anything to compare it to. The plot appeals to me less than the environment. Well, I told you it would be a different kind of review.
