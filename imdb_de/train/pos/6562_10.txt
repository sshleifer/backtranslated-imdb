Simply the best reality show ever made. The first two seasons (the only ones that matter) are on Hulu. I challenge everyone to watch the first three episodes of season one and do not like it. I guarantee you to see the season over. Then I guarantee you will see Season 2. <br /> <br /> Other quick reasons: 1. Anderson Cooper is hilarious 2. The locations in Europe are awesome 3. The games are mentally challenging 4. It's very interactive 5. In one episode, a player responds to the desperate Endeavor of another player: "I try, as hard as I can!" with an equally desperate "Not necessarily". <br /> <br /> Can you find out who the mole is?
