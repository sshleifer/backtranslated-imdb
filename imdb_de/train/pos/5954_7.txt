I feel a mixture of confusion and different personal tastes in the reactions to this film. Yes, there are vampire stereotypes. Yes, it deals with scientific stereotypes. Even martial arts stereotypes. Everything good and good and safe, not everything made perfect. However, I feel that a crucial point in this film is overlooked ... the cultural significance of the place. The film takes place in Pensacola, Florida, and does not try to avoid saying so. This is a bold move in today's movie world and a rare treat for fans of Indy films. And indeed it can not be the last one. Pensacola is world famous as a naval city, aviation city, wood town and sometimes even as a breeding ground for political controversy. Rarely is it seen as a growing film city. But that's all changing now. Other film companies are turning up. And more native Pensacolians are discovering the power of cinema for themselves. This film is part of a growing trend in Pensacola-based Indy films and more are on the way. Pensacola makes a big noise in the global film community, and over time, the world is attracting more attention. Watch and hear, world. The pensacolians are coming. Like a virus.
