A truly adorable heroine, who is alternately surprised and scared of tricks, sailor battles running full in closed doors ... just a few moments that sparkle in my memory of 'The Naked Truth'. I loved what I got from this show LOVED: pleasingly stupid plots and good supportive characters set the stage for the show's diamond - Tea Leoni as 'Nora Wilde'; sweet, clownish and wonderfully prone to accident - how refreshing it is to see an actress who can be a clown - it's no wonder Hollyood does not know how to make her work. But where-oh-where are the DVD releases? The amount of (beep) they release is unbelievable that this little gem remains buried. (Please correct me if I'm wrong.)
