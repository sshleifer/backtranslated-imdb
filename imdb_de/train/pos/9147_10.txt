As a great Prince fan of the last three to four years, I really can not believe that I have just seen "Purple Rain". The brand new 2 Disc Jubilee Special Edition brought me to buy. Wow, I was really looking forward to seeing it, but I was not prepared for how electrical it really is. The musical performances by Prince throughout the movie are amazing - he really has the features in this movie. I know myself (through repeated listening) very well with the classic "Purple Rain" album and all its songs, but when you see them in the context of the film, the perception of the melodies and lyrics changes completely - like COMPUTER BLUE, THE BEAUTIFUL ONES WHEN DOVE CRY and PURPLE RAIN themselves. There are some indescribably mesmerizing scenes in which Prince and The Revolution occur. The final songs BABY I'M A STAR and I WANT THE FOR U show how much energy and talent Prince accomplished in his mid 20s (he is overcrowded!), It blew me away. It even makes Michael Jackson inanimate in his prime. <br /> <br /> Prince shows you how to win the girl of your dreams - drive her to a lake, let her jump in and drive away - absolutely funny things in hindsight. <br /> <br /> Some scenes are very 1980s and unintentionally funny, but that's all the charm of the movie. Morris Day is the coolest cat in the block (and weird), and when his group performs The Time THE BIRD, you see Morris Day and Jerome Benton illuminating the stage of Minneapolis radio-style - I love their dance in this regard, and like Benton Morris offers a medium power mirror. <br /> <br /> I can not wait to see it again, I really can not! The extras are great - especially when the young Eddie Murphy admitted to Beverly Hills Cop that he is a "Prince Groupie".
