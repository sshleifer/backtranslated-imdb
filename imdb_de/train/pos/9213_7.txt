Gómez Pereira is in charge of some of the most despicable comedies in the latest Spanish cinema (just look at his CV), so I did not expect much from "Cosas Que Hacen ..." I do not know why I chose it to look at me. Anyway, I just ... and what a surprise. It looks like Gómez Pereira is finally mature and can make a good movie now. His last work deals with the midlife crisis, the disappointment and the search for a second chance after ruining everything. The last half hour of the movie (the more dramatic) is the best part, and it's worth watching the movie. In addition, Eduard Fernandez plays the main role, and I continue to think that he is (by far) the best actor of his generation. <br /> <br /> * My rating: 7/10
