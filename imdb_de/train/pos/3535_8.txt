** WARNING - CONTAINS SPOILER! ** <br /> <br /> First I would like to say that I really enjoyed this game. I got it for Christmas after giving hints to my parents for two months. I am glad that I did that. <br /> <br /> First of all, I would say that the single player was very good. The first level is probably one of the best in the game when you're at a party in London and some bad guys are ruining it by kidnapping the premier's daughter. Of course you have to save them, and it's a pretty big level, but you should probably need at least five minutes. The best part, and I think the funniest part too, is when you're in the jet pack and people are abseiling Big Ben. Simply equip the Jet-Pack's most reliable rocket launcher and shoot down the dials and enemies. Pure fun! <br /> <br /> The rest of the levels are very good, but pretty short. There are four mini levels that you can unlock, and that's one of the disappointments, because only the first two are really fun, and the last two you unlock are "killing 25 enemies," I mean, c. mon! We have a lot of points to unlock these missions and the last two bonus missions are really bad! <br /> <br /> The multiplayer, myself and some of my friends agree, is very good and challenging, even if there are none. Bots Halo did not have any bots, but these are still good multiplayer games! You can be a lot of bad guys, and you can go against each other, and you can also set traps, which is the best way to kill people without dealing with their character. <br /> <br /> Gameplay - 8.5 / 10 (The levels can be repeated very often and the bonus missions could be improved). Graphics - 9/10 (there is the odd bad graphics, but that's not very often). Multiplayer - 10/10 (needs no comment, just great, you can drive jet packs and vehicles). Sound - 8/10 Replay Value - 7/10 (the only levels I come back to are the Loondon Level and Istanbul Part 1). <br /> <br /> I give this game: 8.5 / 10 <br /> <br /> Could be improved somewhat, but it's still good.
