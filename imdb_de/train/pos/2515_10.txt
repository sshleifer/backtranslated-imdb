Moon Child with Japanese rockers Hyde and Gackt was a better movie than I expected. In fact, I was very impressed and it immediately became one of my favorite movies. In Mallepa, the story plays a group of street orphans, Sho, Sho's brother Shinji and Toshi, who rob and murder earn a living. In a robbery, Sho meets Hyde's kei vampire, who burns in the sunlight. Keen's true nature is shown by the harsh events, but nobody shies away from him. <br /> <br /> Time flies by suggesting that the immortal, never-changing Kei Sho has raised, and the two have an extremely close connection. Sho and Kei then meet Son in an outrageous fight and they become fast friends. Both Kei and Hyde fall in love with Son's sister Yi-Che. <br /> <br /> Time jumps ahead and shows a grown sho, this time without kei. It also explains that Sho and Son have become enemies. <br /> <br /> Through the tragedy of the tragedy, this film delves into the reality of life and all its difficulties, focusing on friendship and love. It's a really touching movie that's both sad and beautiful at the same time. <br /> <br /> As far as acting is concerned, I think Gackt did a great job. Hyde did an amazing job for a first timer. <br /> <br /> The shots were beautiful, but the film had rare and short, cruel shots. <br /> <br /> All in all, I have to say this film is amazing, moving and I highly recommend it.
