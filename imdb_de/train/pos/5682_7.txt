No, that's not an Alice fairy tale, my friends! This "Wonderland" fable is based on the true story of the gruesome bloody Wonderland murders that took place in California's' 80s. At the center of this bloodbath was none other than Johnny Wad. Yes, John Holmes! Daddy Ding-Dong used shotguns other than his infamous 13-inch Dairy Machine. Holmes was not just a legendary movie actor, he was also a drug addict who made friends with various Hollywood junkies. Val Kilmer was occasionally majestic like Holmes, but this time, this Holmes character has not completely milked it. The film has a "who's who" backing players: Josh Lucas & Dylan Mcdermott as Hollywood riffraffs, Kate Bosworth & Lisa Kudrow as women in Holmes life and Eric Bogosian as a menacing Tinsletown entrepreneur. These characters play an important role directly or indirectly in the "Wonderland" murders. From this support group, it was Josh Lucas who was the most passionate and impressive of the passionate Ron Launius. Lucas is slowly escalating into a major Hollywood player with such charismatic twists in "A Beautiful Mind" and "Sweet Home Alabama." Director James Cox sometimes proved to be a Coxsucker, showing a plethora of overlapping scenes, as well as Holmes' famous organ. Holmes was finally acquitted of the "Wonderland" murders. He died from complications of the AIDS virus. "Wonderland" will surprise you, what really happened on that damn night and if Holmes really designed his weapon. Oops! Wrong Holmes movie! OK! That's enough, before I get 'penislized', I mean punished. Bye Holmies! *** Average
