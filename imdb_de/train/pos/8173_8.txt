The brilliance of this film is that even a competent dentist is pretty scary. It is one of the primal fears of man. This movie is the nightmarish picture that every kid in the waiting room has to go through. Corbin Bernsen gives a surprisingly lackluster performance as a crazy dentist who probably tries to kill people, but he only works on the teeth, so it does not really work. In a particularly bloody scene we find the actor Earl Boen, who has completely destroyed his teeth with drills and what not, which in my opinion is the absolute worst, if you are a killer dentist. It's a typical situation of Brian Yuzna, which is not well written, but there is a lot of gore. The plot is modest and sometimes seems to be done on the spot, but hey, it's a killer dentist movie, we all thought about it, but they did it first.
