I saw this series when I was a kid, and I loved the details she went into and never forgot. I finally bought the DVD collection and remembered exactly. That is exactly how a document should be, unbiased and objective. The footage is incredible and the interviews are fantastic. The only other series I equate with is "Die Deutsche Panzer". <br /> <br /> I just wish Hollywood would sit down and watch this show, then they could make some great war movies. <Br /> <br /> Note. Band of Brothers, Private Ryan's Rescue, Letters from Iwo Jima, Flags of Our Fathers and When Trumpets Fade are some that I would recommend
