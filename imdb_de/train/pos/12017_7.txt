"The Last Hard Men" is a typical Western of the 70s. Most seem to be inspired by Sam Peckinpah. This too, but director Andrew McLaglan is a John Ford student, and this can obviously be shown in many scenes. IMO is the beginning very well. In a way, McLaglan wanted to show the audience a journey from civilization to the wild. In the third part, there are some illogical mistakes and I complain a bit about Charlton Heston. He has to play an old ex-lawyer named Sam Burgade, but he's in fantastic shape. I never had the feeling that he really had problems climbing a horse or a rock. For me, he does not look very motivated, as is usual in most of his epic films. The same goes for the beautiful Barbara Hershey, who plays the sheriff's daughter. Maybe both had problems with the director or were dissatisfied with their roles. Hershey and Coburn do not show their best but are still good. If screenwriter John Wayne had Sam Burgade in mind? Even Michael Parks as a modern Sheriff is a little understaffed in his role. On the other hand, there is James Coburn as Outlaw Zach Provo. Coburn is a really great villain in this case. He portrays the villain between madness and prudence. His role and his acting are the best of the film. <br /> <br /> Landscapes and shootouts are terrific. The shooting scenes are bloody and the violence is realistic. Zach Provo and his gang had some bloody and violent scenes. What I miss is the typical Western action in the middle of the movie. I would have appreciated a bank robbery or similar. All in all, it's an entertaining western movie. Not a great movie, but above average for a big Coburn, a very good start, and some bloody and violent scenes.
