A big surprise, probably because I expected it to be shitty. The reviews were quite hostile, even though they all agreed that the concept was golden: A man finds out that his new girlfriend is a superhero, and finds that if he wants to break up with her, she's kind of psycho , I had always expected it to fall apart, but it never really did. Sure, it does not do as much of its great premise as it could, and decides to be short when it might be better to expand the film's universe. But I can not blame it. Uma Thurman is great as a bipolar superhero, G-Girl. And after several years of dislike for him, I've discovered that Luke Wilson can be absolutely perfect when he acts as a slapper. He has given two of the best comic acts of 2006 (the other in the pretty much unpublished idiocracy). I was completely annoyed by the facial expressions when he and Thurman had sex for the first time. It's one of the funniest sex scenes of all time. My only real complaint is that they make G-Girl a bit too psychotic, almost unbelievable. With some background I might have been able to accept it better. However, I can forgive the shortcomings because I had a really good time to look at them. Certainly underestimated.
