This movie has everything that makes a bad movie worth seeing - sloppy editing, little to no continuity, crazy dialogue, bad (you could even say there is none) acting, pointless storylines, recordings that take far too long. .. and it's perfect for MST3K-style riffing, not to mention the "Corpse Eaters Drinking Game": scribble on forms ... shoot a shot - sign your name ... shoot - catch a bad Foley- Cut in ... Many shots. <br /> <br /> The only reason I did not rate him higher than 8 is that there is not enough unfounded nudity and because, despite his madness, it only takes an hour - a movie like this one should actually at least 20-30 minutes longer!
