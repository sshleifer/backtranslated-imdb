I have to say that this TV movie was the work that really showed how talented Melissa Joan Hart is. We're so used to seeing them in a sitcom, and I really hope that a TV station will be showing this TV movie again soon, as it will show the Sabrina fans that MJH shines in a drama. Just as we've seen her on Sabrina for 5 years now, it would be a plus to give viewers a taste of her much untapped talent. Melissa plays her role so well that she wants her parents to be with the guy she loves. One thing that all Sabrina viewers will notice is that Melissa works with David Lascher long before he took on the role of Josh in Sabrina. So it would be nice to see this every time it airs again. Hopefully, MJH gets good roles in movies or even in other TV movies, like Kellie Martin, who has always starred in TV movies. Many unused talents are waiting to get out of the running with Melissa Joan Hart, they always shine Melissa !!!
