Why can not more directors create horror movies like "The Shining" these days? There is one simple answer: modern directors are not Stanley Kubrick. Kubrick has once and for all proved with this film that he is truly one of the best directors and authors of all time. <br /> <br /> The plot is pretty simple. A man named Jack Torrance (brilliantly played by Jack Nicholson) and his family move to a large, secluded hotel to monitor the offseason. The kicker is that the hotel's previous janitor brutally murdered his wife and two girls. What follows is most easily summarized in the title of the movie, but you'll have to look at it to see what I mean. <br /> <br /> This is the first movie in a long time that seems to me to be "scary." It is something seriously messed up, but in a good way. One of the things that contributes to the fear factor is Music played an important role in Kubrick's films (2001: A Space Oddysey and A Clockwork Orange, to name but a couple), and he does not disappoint in this regard: The score completely sets the tone and this film would be without him not the same. <br /> <br /> Finally, I have to comment on Nicholson's legendary performance, Jack is a terribly convincing crazy murderer, in fact, only his gaze steals some of the scenes in this movie, which is a first-rate spectacle seen There will never be a horror movie that fits in with this movie, CALM IN PEACE.
