I enjoyed this movie, maybe because I did not see any reviews etc. It was adorable and a bit "romping". I do not know why it did not spatter anymore. As for the story, I could refer to some aspects of the Paul Reiser character and "see my father" in Falk's character. I remembered bygone days when I was a kid listening to my grandparents. If you've enjoyed movies like Grumpy Old Men or On Golden Pond, this is your movie. A "sleeper", in my opinion, and one of those feel-good stories. Peter Falk and Paul Reiser had many wonderful verbal arguments, but nothing was overstated. I would say it rates at least an 8, maybe higher.
