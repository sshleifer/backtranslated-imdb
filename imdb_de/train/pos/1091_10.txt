I loved this movie. I saw it for the first time when I was 20 years old (which was only four years ago) and I liked it so much that I brought my own copy the next day. The comedy is played well by everyone involved. I have to rewind and re-watch the scene, where Mr. Tsanders explains why he found water in an area of ​​6 feet in one area and 227 feet in another area. Also, look for Jason Robard's father, who plays Mr. Retch. Talent ran in this family.
