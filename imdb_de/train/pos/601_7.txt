I was surprised at the bad rating this movie received from viewers. I saw it on TV late one night and it hit the spot - I think it was 1989 when it first appeared. I remember well, with one or two nice twists and an interesting ambience on a windmill farm. Michael Pollard looks pretty run-down for his role, which pretty much sums up the unfulfilled early promise of his career, and everyone else plays it straight ahead. I definitely recommend it as a pawnshop, though some of the issues that may have seemed a bit nervous in 1989 now seem tame, which is a pity considering that contemporary "edginess" is often used only as a necessary marketing tool. a kind of lamentation, just to attract attention.
