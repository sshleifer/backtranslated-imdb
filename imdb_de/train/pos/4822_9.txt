Does anyone have to hold their hands up or down the stairs? Have others tried your food before you eat it? Opposite a towering mother? These are just some of the obstacles young Victoria has to deal with in this film (there are also various power struggles and attacks on her life). It is needless to say that this provides a very fascinating and informative view. <br /> <br /> I had only seen Emily Blunt in The Devil Wears Prada (and little else). As she was in this movie, she is again outstanding here. I was extremely impressed with her portrayal of the young Victoria and thought that she handled the role very well. She makes the transition from the young Victoria, whom we meet at the beginning of the film, to the Queen Victoria, which later becomes completely credible. Blunt is perfect in the role and shows all the different sides (from the vulnerable to the strong, from the young Victoria, who makes mistakes, to the queen, who takes control). About Emily Blunt can not be said enough in this role. It is - quite simply - exquisite and puts its attention on the screen every second. She keeps you arrested until the last movie. <br /> <br /> Rupert Friend also proves to be Victoria's love interest (and his future husband) Prince Albert. The actors have good chemistry and they absolutely believe in their developing relationship. They have their disagreements, but you can say that they are in love. Blunt and Friend are excellent in every scene they share, and they keep an eye out for what's going on between Victoria and Albert. The other actors in the movie are also very good. Paul Bettany as Lord Melbourne, Miranda Richardson as Duchess of Kent, Mark Strong as Sir John Conroy and Jim Broadbent as King William. There is not a single bad performance in this movie. The less focused people are also well represented given the low screen time. Even Victoria's dog (a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel named Dash) is memorable and characterizes the movie. <br /> <br /> Although the film tends to skip more than a few aspects of Victoria's life - especially at the end - and instead * tells * us what happened on screen (with her and Albert) , Most importantly, that's what we actually see *. After all, this is a movie about 'The Young Victoria' (not 'The Victoria in Middle Ages' or 'The Old Victoria'). While there are some embellishments in the story of this film, it continues to focus on what he's up to, namely the story of how the young princess came to power. <br /> <br /> The movie looks amazing, the costumes that Emily Blunt wears are visually gorgeous and the music only contributes to the movie and never distracts. It's been filmed for once and, unlike many other movies, this movie is actually a good length, as it does not run that long, that you lose interest or feel like it's being unnecessarily drained. <br /> <br /> That this movie is so great, of course, is Emily Blunt. She's in good shape here, showing another outstanding performance and making this movie about what he could have been if another actress had played in this quite important / historical role. This is a finely honed film with outstanding performances that should definitely be seen. If you have a fascinating view of a woman that has been of great importance in the story, this is a must.
