It is a pity that this TV series, which was inspired by the towering television images "The Night Stalker" and "The Night Strangler", lasted only a single season and twenty episodes, as this broadcast was best offered often profitable and extreme entertaining mix of sharp cynical humor (Carl Kolchak's spirited verbal sparring games with the ever-irascible and long-lived editor Tony Vincenzo have always been a pleasure to see and hear), clever writing, subtle supernatural threats (the Offbeat creatures love in "The Spanish Moss Murders") "The Sentry" and "Horror in the Heights" can not go wrong with such popular favorites as zombies, vampires, werewolves and witches, colorful characters, vivid drama from a series of cool guest stars (legendary biker icon William Smith had a rare chance to tackle a heroic lead role in "The Energy Eater" while other episodes with veteran figures such as Keenan Wynn, John Fiedler, John Dehner, Severn Darden and William Daniels (juicy roles), effective moments of real excitement (especially the adventurous climax of "The Spanish Moss Murders" was really staggering) and, most importantly, the only one Darren McGavin in a jocose manner as the bold, aggressive and excitable, but basically decent, brave and honest little newspaper reporter from Chicago, Illinois, Carl Kolchak. Kolchak was the epitome of the 70s protagonist of the 70s smart and quick-witted guy with a strong nose for a delicious spoon and an unfortunate gimmick for all sorts of difficulties. Besides, the occasionally limping kolchak was anything but superhuman; Normally he stumbled or stumbled upon a deadly threat, but he possessed a certain inner strength and courage that enabled him to save humanity time and again from all kinds of deadly enemies in the other world. Kolchak was surrounded by a handful of entertaining minor characters: Simon Oakland was perfect as Carl's chronically ill-tempered boss Tony Vincenzo, Jack Grinnage as Ruth McDevitt's Ron Updyke made for an ideal comic book, was as adorable as sweet Miss Emily Cowles and Carol Ann Susi also had a lot of fun as avid beaver rookie Monique Marmelstein (which unfortunately disappeared after just three episodes). Granted, the show suffered from dull make-up and special effects (the title lycanthrope in "The Werewolf" unfortunately resembles a Yorkshire terrier!) And the latest episodes boasted some ridiculously stupid monsters (the headless motorcyclist in "Chopper," Cathy Lee Crosby as Helen of Troy in "The Youth Killer"), but even the second-rate shows are replaced by the program's malicious, sardonic wit and McGavin's boundless vitality and captivating, disagreeable presence.
