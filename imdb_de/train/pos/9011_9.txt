I found this movie quite by accident, but I am glad that I did that. Kenneth Branagh's performance was almost stealing this film from Helena Bonham Carter, but her strong chemistry made for a much more enjoyable movie. This movie was reminiscent of the great films Branagh made with Emma Thompson. Carter's star turn here as a handicapped young woman trying to complete herself was as good a feat as I have long seen in a female lead role. It's hard to portray a disabled person, but basically just with her eyes, to show her grief over her life situation, she made it so believable. If this movie had come out after the current wave of movies in which beautiful women make themselves ugly for roles (Charlize Theron, Halle Berry), I'm sure Carter would have a strong idea for an Oscar. If you run this movie like me late at night, trust me, it's worth the lost sleep.
