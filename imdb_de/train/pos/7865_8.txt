Page 3 is a great movie. The story is so refreshing and interesting. Throughout the movie, I did not just stare into space once. Konkana Sen did a good job in the movie, though I think someone with more glamor or excitement would have been better, but she did a great job. All supporting actors were also very good and helped with the film. Boman Irani did a great job. There is one thing that stands out in this movie THE STORY, it's great and very realistic. I think more film like this should be done, I'm tired of seeing the same cotton candy movies over and over again, they're going to be hard to digest now. Everyone should watch, it's a great movie. -Only my 2 cents :)
