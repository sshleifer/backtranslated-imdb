If it were possible to bring the heart and soul of the sport - no, the pure lifestyle - of surfing to its perfect form, this documentary has made it. This documentary shows that life depends not only on the waves, but more on the people, the pioneers and the modern avant-garde, who push the envelope of the Great Wave further than they have ever been before. <br /> <br /> Stacy Peralta - a virtual legend from the early 80s of skateboarding as a teenager of SoCal - has come up with a wealth of amazing images and interview films and created a document that is not just a documentary, but a documentary Masterpiece of the genre is. When his heart and soul are in matter - and it is clear here - his genius is marked by a pure vision that does not enchant, hype, or make sentimental. He admires surfers and the surf / beach lifestyle, but he does not know. The sport also has a bitter reality. <br /> <br /> There's so much to this documentary about the surfers, the early history of the sport, and the wild big wave surfers he's talking about. Greg Noll, the first big-wave personality to call sport a pioneer; Jeff Carter, an amazing guy who rode almost alone on the extremely dangerous Maverick surf of northern California for fifteen years; and, the heart of the documentary, Laird Hamliton, today's Messiah of Big Wave Surfing. <br /> <br /> Between all these guys - and some girls who show up in front of the camera - they have a tremendous heart and heartiness, a deep and powerful love of surfing and the sea, expressed in every word , I found the story of how Hamilton's adoptive father met him and how Hamilton, as a small 4- or 5-year-old boy, practically forced him to become his father, who was particularly heartwarming (and again deprived of juicy sentimentality) Like to surf - or not - this is a wonderful documentary that you need to look at just because you are a student of the form or appreciate someone who simply values ​​unbelievably well-made works of art.
