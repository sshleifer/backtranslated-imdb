WAQT is a perfect example of a chicken soup that is not suitable for your soul. The broth has unfortunately lost its flavor, thanks to all the excessive thinning and garnishings that were produced during its production. <br /> <br /> What is surprising and disappointing is that WAQT comes from a director who has kept away from the usual clich√©s of Hindi cinema in his first venture, but in his second appearance, all the formulas of the stereotype gives way. While Vipul Shah was convinced to show something as implausible as blind men who robbed a bank in Aankhen, he simply fails to create life in the entire package of WAQT, based on something called Father-Son. Relationship is possible. WAQT, taken from a Gujarati play by Aavjo Vhala Fari Malishu, has a sensible history with a social message to secure. A mature view of the father-son relationship, the unconditional love of a father for his son and the responsibility of a son for his family. Ishwar Chand Sharawat (Amitabh Bachchan), who has rebuilt his entire empire from scratch, is leading a prosperous life with his wife Sumitra (Shefali Shah). Her only son, Aditya (Akshay Kumar), never felt the need to seek anything because in life he got everything tailor-made and fed with spoons. Ishwar's pampering has only spoiled him more. Aditya dreams of becoming a superstar, but does nothing to make his dreams come true. Meanwhile, he marries his Ladylove Mitali (Priyanka Chopra). Ishwar hopes that marriage will make Aditya a more responsible man, but he is disappointed. Aditya is still best when he leads a carefree life. <br /> <br /> The stamina breaks as Ishwar drives Aditya out of his house. The sudden change in his loving father's attitude towards him and his now-awaited wife amazed Aditya. He has no choice but to seek the livelihood of his wife and unborn child. He becomes an independent man, but the gap in the relationship between him and his father is growing. <br /> <br /> The story is simple, while the straightforward script has a very basic approach. One can easily identify the credible characters of the Father and the Son and identify with them. If you are not one of them, you might at least have encountered people like you in real life. <br /> <br /> Add the easy handling of the script to director Vipul Shah. With a family affair like this, every other director would have added tons of melodrama in his place in the proceedings under the film laws of the Bollywood family drama, making the film a compulsive tearjerker. Shah, however, is characterized by the effortless handling of emotions for the majority of the film. <br /> <br /> A clear example of his unpretentious direction is evident in the bias scene in which the father drove the son out of his house in a rather frivolous manner. The purpose of the scene is achieved without burdening the brain of the audience with a brunt. The same applies to the scene in the second half, in which the now separate father's son has a funky conversation. This is what sets WAQT apart from KABHI KUSHI GHUM or EK RISHTAA, and it is a level of treatment in terms of treatment. <br /> <br /> But once you've got all the distinctions, you can wonder where WAQT still fails in? The problem lies in the fact that, while WAQT differs from the others in its league in terms of treatment, it does address packaging disruption. What with the director forces in the back and forth in the first half. There is a Johar Kinda Shaadi Song, a Chopra Kinda Holi Song, a Father-Son Disco Dandia Song, a dream song, and a dream song that has come true, causing enough yawning in the viewer. Imagine this ... the father has just pushed the son out of his house and the son is dreaming of a song in the Moroccan mountains with his wife. Out of place! For good reason! and the audience from sitting. <br /> <br /> The film only moves in the first half and the story begins in the second half. The director has wasted too much WAQT on unnecessary elements. The much discussed sequence of chases is not bad, but not redeeming. But Akshay Kumar's Taandav dance is just ridiculous. Imagine, he qualifies for the star hunt in the movie with this (unintentionally) funny histrionics. Add the climax set in the final of the star hunt, where the son bursts with emotion. This is so archetypal! Also, the pattern could have been reversed to hide the father's reason for changing the attitude towards his son. Anu Malik's music is fine, though it is not necessary in the process. Santosh Thundiiayil's camera work is competent enough, but not very demanding. Aatish Kapadia has found some good dialogue for dramatic moments. <br /> <br /> Boman Irani and Rajpal Yadav make the light moments in the film very efficient. While Rajpal Yadav has recently gone overboard in many movies with his comic histrionics, this time he signs his character and is totally reserved. His expressionless facial expressions are perfectly complemented by Boman's exaggerated histrionics. <br /> <br /> Shefali Shah convinces in the role of mother. Not to be considered blameless, but she is flawless in playing and "looking" her character. Priyanka is great and plays her role well. <br /> <br /> Of course, Akshay Kumar and Amitabh Bachchan deserve the biggest applause. Akshay is particularly expressive in the scene where his crappy father deliberately scolds him to become aware of his responsibilities. Although Bachchan looks a bit dramatic in a few scenes, his brilliance is felt throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> In summary, WAQT is like a soup whose ingredients are both delicious and nutritious, but the last recipe is somehow not 'It's so appetizing.
