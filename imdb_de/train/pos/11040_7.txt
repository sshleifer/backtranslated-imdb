I saw this French horror movie last night and liked it a lot. The entire film takes place in a prison cell with three prisoners, who find a handwritten diary in a wall of a serial killer who escaped from prison 20 years ago, somehow without leaving his cell. As you look through the journal, you discover that it deals with the black arts and orders that may find their way out of the cell into freedom. What they find out is something completely different and terrible, to say the least. I like low-budget horror films that deliver the goods in a pretty good way and tell a good story. This movie does just that, though it takes a while to get started. The result and the horror they unleash are very interesting to me and I enjoyed the ride. Not much blood, but that would not fit into the story, though it's pretty good.
