I saw this movie for the first time in the 1980s, and now this movie is still one of the best movies I've ever seen! I would recommend anyone to watch this movie. You will not regret it. It's well played, so real and never boring. The acting is outstanding and the situation makes the film look as if you were there. From start to finish, this movie is the guy you lose your attention on. The actress plays the girl who has survived this terrible plane crash in the Amazon superbly and shows how she survived it alone in the Amazon. It is incredible that everyone can survive in such conditions. That's why this movie is so appealing. The fact that this is a true story makes the movie even more interesting and believing that a young girl could survive on this ordeal is overwhelming. I find this movie that I can watch again and again and I never get tired. This is indeed a compliment, as I have hundreds of films! I would say that's probably my favorite movie and the best I've ever seen!
