Hare Rama Hare Krishna was the biggest hit of 1971. The film was filmed almost entirely in Kathmandu, the capital of Nepal, and shows not only the theme of a broken family, but also a relationship between a brother and a sister as well as drugs and the Hippy movement that made many people think that it was related to ISKON - the Krishna consciousness movement. The film begins with drug scenes and the information that the woman who dances in front of him, the narrator is sister. Back in the past, brother and sister happily play around the house just to hear their parents quarrel. This soon leads to a split in the family. The brother goes with the mother and the sister with the father. <br /> <br /> Over the years, the brother goes in search of his sister and is informed that she no longer lives with her father and moved to Nepal. Here, Prashant, the brother not only finds love, but also his sister Janice. He finds out, however, that she is not only in bad company with friends, but also drugged, because she wants to block all memories of her past. With the help of Shanti, his love, the brother tries to dissuade his sister from all this, but has to overcome many obstacles, including humans, who bend down on all possible levels to stop him. This is a multicast film directed by the director and producer himself, Dev Anand, and stars Zeenat Aman (her first film), Mumtaz, Rajendranath, Prem Chopra, Jnr Mehmood, AK Hangal and Achala Sachdev. The music is superbly delivered by the late R. D. Burman, whose last score was "1942 - A Love Story". During filming, Dev Anand Panchamda (R.D. Burman) asked to compose something special for this film. Days later, Panchamda returned with the composition of "Dum Maro Dum". The song was a hit right away.
