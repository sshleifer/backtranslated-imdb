From living in (some) colleges. Of course, there were artistic licenses, but some of what you've seen in this movie is being continued at some colleges. <br /> <br /> I went to colleges in Southern California, where the races pretty often depend on their own. It's funny because these are schools that want racial unity, equality, etc., and I can honestly say it's there. But the thing is, when class expires, or when they just wait for class, students seem to be just with people of their own race or ethnicity. Is it bad? Not really. Everyone needs a sense of belonging. But as the school paper at one of the schools I attended once wrote about, "we should all try to be with and meet students of other ethnic groups." Otherwise, create your own segregation. <br /> <br /> In one of these schools I visited, there was certainly racism. One day somebody brought leaflets to campus to talk about the glories of the Aryan race and had the symbols of some of these racist organizations. Fortunately, nothing happened like the incident in the movie where the young Caucasian man went off and started shooting a multicultural gathering. <br /> <br /> I can only hope and pray that this will never happen. > <br /> So is "Higher Learning" too dramatic? Over the top? Could be. Is it so "off mark"? It depends on where you went to school or went to school. The thing about the race, where the ethnicities hang around with their own things, happens. Aside from the Hollywood exaggerations, the race thing came pretty close to home for me.
