These guys are anything but the usual suspects! They are a bunch of nice nonsense balls that you want to play with, but they are so unhappy that there are few chances. No one is better than William H Macy when portraying the man with a big heart. This is probably his best performance since Fargo. Sam Rockwell has played the meathead boxer perfectly, and the rest of the gang was also consistently good. Luis Guzman brought Cosimo and George Clooney every scene of his cameo role. The Heist scene in the end was absolutely hilarious. <br /> <br /> The direction was also determined by the Russo brothers. It was certainly a feeling of Coen brothers throughout the movie and it will be interesting you will see how they will develop their careers. They still have a long way to go before the Coen, but this is a great start, and I'm looking forward to their next celluloid outing. ....... "Yo mutha is a whore"!
