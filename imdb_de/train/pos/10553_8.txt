... as that ;-) What would happen if Terry Gilliam and Douglas Adams collaborated on a film? This film starts with a touch of Brazil ... if the story moves directly into the twilight zone at some point ... nothing new, but just nothing ... and nothing is great fun! When Dave and Andrew explore their new surroundings, the movie gets really funny ... bouncing heads? well ... yes ;-) <br /> <br /> anyway ... this movie was imho the biggest surprise at this year's FantasyFilmFest ... <br /> <br /> Just like in Cube and Cypher Natali gave this one a minimalist, weird but very special design that makes it difficult to find the place of the story or its time ... somehow timeless ...
