I really enjoyed this movie. The acting was great, as was the conspiracy. Jeff Combs has more talent than he is. The only thing I would change was the end. The death of the creature was far too cruel for the sci-fi channel. <br /> <br /> There were some interesting religious messages in this film. Jeff Combs obviously played a messiah figure, and the creature (or the shark, if you like) represented the anti-Chirst. There were some particularly scary scenes that felt this "end of the world". I only noticed it after my third visit to this classic creature feature. I know that many people do not get the clues about Christianity, but if you look closely, you will understand.
