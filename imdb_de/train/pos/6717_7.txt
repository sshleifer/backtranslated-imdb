This documentary was very thorough and enlightening and at the same time entertaining, which I found quite impressive. I felt like they did the sport well from its inception until today, but there's a reason why I do not give this movie such a high score ... <br /> <br /> I felt like that the story sometimes focused too much on the proper names of the sport: too many places to surf and, above all, too many surfers. I had the feeling that the documentary had more to do with the nature of sport, the ideology of sport, and so on. It would have been better (although of course this was covered, I do not think it has as much time as it needs to). <br /> <br /> And for many people who are not completely crazy about surfing, sometimes they are heard in certain places and places, and certain surfers can get bored. Although the video clips and in-depth research are highly regarded, they could have been presented in a way that would be better for those who are not avid surfers. <br /> <br /> Also, my biggest disappointment at times was that they talked about how amazingly amazing and wondrous things were in surfing history, but they did not have the actual footage of those events and the whole time you wait for them To see on the canvas this breathtaking event men speak of life-changing moments, and in the end you only get a lot of men talking about it, and not the actual material. It was far too tempting to hear these stories and then not be able to see them. I understand the difficulty of getting a footage of everything, but please: do not brag about an event and do not show it. All in all, a very fresh documentary that I liked to see. Not the best documentary for the reasons mentioned above, but since it's very fresh and has extremely exciting footage and a good soundtrack, it's a documentary I'd recommend to anyone.
