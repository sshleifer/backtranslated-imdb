I saw this movie for the first time when I was about seven, and was completely enchanted at the time, but for years I could not figure out what the movie was called. Now I'm twenty-one and about two weeks ago I came across the movie by chance and bought a copy. Although my memory of the film was a bit blurry, I was by no means disappointed with what I saw. The animation in this movie is great and conjures up a whole world that is so believable and so well animated that you are attracted to this movie alone. But this film also has an action that enchants and entertains adults and children alike. With a floating island, a crazy general, a friendly pirate mother and a well constructed love story, this movie will not let you down. I would recommend this movie to anyone.
