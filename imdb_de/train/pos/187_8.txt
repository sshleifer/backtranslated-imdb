Marion Davies plays the lead role in this remarkable comedy "Show People", which was released in 1928 by MGM. Davies plays a hick from Savannah, Georgia, who arrives in Hollywood with her father (Dell Henderson). The jalopy in which they arrive is a hoot - as is Davie's outrageous southern garb. Davies gets a job in a slapstick comedy, not what she wants, but it brings her success. She meets the slapstick star William Haines, who is immediately enthusiastic. Well, Davies then gets a job in a more prestigious studio ("High Art Studios") and ends up in stuffy pieces of time. A handsome but fake actor (Andre Telefair) shows her how to be the typically overbearing Hollywood star. Davies leaves her boyfriend and father out of slapstick for the good life, but of course that does not really teach who she really is. Marion Davies is thoroughly wonderful, for she masters the range of emotions that a "serious" actress needs. William Haines is his usual wonderful comic self, and there are cameos by Charles Chaplin, John Gilbert and other famous stars of the day, including the director of the film, King Vidor. This is a silent movie with a few "sound effects" because the sound images just came into their own. A treasure of a movie.
