Rohmer returns to his historic dramas in the true story of Grace Elliot, an Englishwoman who had been in France during the French Revolution. There was always a suspicion that Rohmer was a conservative, but who knew he was such a red-blooded reactionary. If you can put aside Rohmer's outrageous defense of the monarchy (and that's not an easy thing, as the French lower classes, for example, are portrayed as terrible louts), this is indeed an elegant, intelligent and polished film. Rohmer lacks the money for a major cinematic renewal of 18th-century France. Instead, the actors play against obvious painted cardboard. It's an obvious artificial imagination, but it works somehow. And newcomer Lucy Russell manages to turn sympathy into a character that should not be.
