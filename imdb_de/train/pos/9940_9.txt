This animation TV series is simply the best way for kids to learn how the human body works. Yes, that's biology, but they'll never say that's it. <br /> <br /> I really believe that this is the best part of this stream of "educational cartoons". I remember that you can find small books and a plastic body in several parts: skin, skeleton and of course: organs. <br /> <br /> In the same stream, you'll find: "Il était une fois l" homme ", which relates human history from the Big Bang to the 20th century, and also reads:" Il était une fois l ' espace "(about space and its exploration), but this is more of a fiction than a description of reality as it takes place in the future.
