Although George C. Scott is the only actor in this version of ACC without a British accent, he more than makes up for it with his exaggerated and larger-than-life interpretation of Ebenezer Scrooge. <br /> <br Especially effective is when he faces Bob Cratchit in his office at the end of the film. When Scott stands in front of a large window, sunlight throws a glowing cloak over him; All you can see is its silhouette. With the voice of Scott, a lumbering growl, the effect intensifies ... similar to Marlon Brando's first scene in APOCALYPSE NOW. "The horror" indeed! <br /> <br /> However, what works for you can also work against you. Since Scott shows so savage wildness throughout the film, it proves to be contagious. In other words, the "before" Scrooge is almost as charismatic as the "after", though he really should not be. It could be called the "Doctor Smith" effect, as Jonathan Harris used a very similar approach and numerous other heavies (stage and screen) in this role. <br /> <br /> Scott's rage does not really seem to blame. But it could also be other "Christmas carols" purists. Watch the movie and judge for yourself.
