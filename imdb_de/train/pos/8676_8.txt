Tom, the cat, Jerry, the mouse, and Spike, the dog (this is Butch, his third name, his second "killer"), decide to sign a peace treaty in which everyone loves each other. It's strange and a bit unnatural to see them all that way, and even the girlfriends seem to think so. But in the end, thanks to a disagreement over a steak, everything is back to normal and everything is as it should be. This short is the second of three on the new Spotlight DVD to be edited, and I have no idea why this one was. This animated film can be found on the DVD "Spot & Tom" by "Tom & Jerry". <br /> <br /> My degree: B
