The Night Listener is probably not one of Williams' best roles, but he does make a very interesting character in a weird, but very different movie. I can assure you that you have never seen this kind of movie. Some people may not like the slow pace of this movie, but I think it's the movie's big plus. It's definitely one of the best movies of the year 2006. It has a fascinating performance in a movie with a great content and dramatic feel. This is not an Americanized movie. It's not a predictable movie either. You just have the feeling that this is a movie that has secrets that you find difficult to figure out what the result might be. This is not an excellent movie that has it all, but damn good and very original.
