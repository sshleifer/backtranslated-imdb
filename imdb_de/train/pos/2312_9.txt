A young man named Court is loved by all. His painful bloody death brings everyone closer. You can find other symbols and allusions throughout the movie. Whether predictable or not, and independent of ecclesiastical beliefs, this is a moving story full of milieu and sensuality. Another thing, someone mentioned that his fate was so fast that it did not seem plausible. However, the elements are subtle. Notice what his mother says about bringing his lunch to the field. Notice how he holds the steering wheel and his gloves. He is sweaty and uses dangerous devices. Tractors are pretty dangerous until today.
