This movie attracts you and makes you addicted if you keep your eyes on the screen. The writer / director is brilliant with the narrative parts and the use of creative and interesting camera angles and perspectives that all contribute to the gripping hold he has for you. Insomniac's Nightmare is original and is refreshingly different from any other movie you've ever seen. Is it a dream or a reality? In this indie, you will discuss the twists and turns of the conscious and subconscious. It has an eerie feeling with its dark interpretations of illusions. Dominic Monaghan really became an insomniac. He is a great actor who is not hard on the eye either! He really put his whole being into this role. From plot to shoot, this indie is one of my favorites. I highly recommend it and look forward to seeing more of this innovative, creative writer / director / cameraman !!!
