Level 1, horror. <br /> <br /> When I saw this movie for the first time at 10, I knew it would give me nightmares. As I recall, it was, surprisingly, the sound as well as the sight of the monster that caused it. Level 2, Psychoanalytic Theory. Later, as an adult, I saw the story for what it was: what if the cruel, unrestrained instinct that we all suppress is manifested. Level three, pure science fiction "What if" the plot goes through the science fiction genre. This is pure science fiction, not the "cowboys in space" that apply to the genre today. After 43 years, Forbidden Planet is the largest of all science fiction films. If you are planning a remake, SKG or Lucas, watch out!
