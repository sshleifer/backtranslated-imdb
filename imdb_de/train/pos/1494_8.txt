A classic offer from Amicus, producer Milton Subotsky and director Peter Duffell ("The Faraway Pavilions", etc.) is an elegant, intelligent "four-handed" with a strong cast (Peter Cushing, Christopher Lee, Jon Pertwee, Ingrid Pitt, etc.). All offer stylish performances, despite a low budget, which leads to some "unusual effects". The most notable contribution, however, is that of the seven-year-old Chloe Franks, who in a deterrent and effective manner pays off the part that makes the blood cold. Only the spoiled title the lenders wished for the movie spoils this undervalued release, which is beyond the usual "Blood 'n' Courage" shocker movie, for those who appreciate a little thought with their horror.
