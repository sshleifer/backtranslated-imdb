This is a very interesting project that could be quite brilliant. Composed 11 international directors, each assigned 11 minutes, 9 seconds, and 1 frame to create a segment of their choice; every brief exploration of the global reverberation of 9/11. Without a spoiler, I would say that the piece by Ken Loach is the jewel in the crown, and Mira Nair's short film (India segment), based on a true story, deserves to become a feature film. You can also see how Alejandro González Iñárritu is today one of the best directors in the world. he is simply a master of the medium who also has a deep understanding of the subject. Unfortunately, not all 11 parts are made. Youssef Chahine, in his section "Egypt," assumes the Arab attitude of self-inflicted collective guilt, which could possibly have been the most interesting. He fails miserably. Chahine's short film is poorly written and poorly executed, at least enough to stand out from other superior chapters of the film. Despite the imbalance in quality, I would still give the movie 7/10 for the concept, if not for the performance.
