I saw Insomniac's Nightmare for the first time not so long ago, and I have to say I thought it was really good. If you are a fan of Dominic Monaghan, you will love it. The whole movie takes place in his head - or does it? The acting of all the others is a bit rushed and shaky and some of the scenes could be cut off, but in the end it works. The extras on the DVD are just as great as the movie, if not bigger for the dome fans. There are many honest moments from the set, outtakes and a great interview with the director. Anyone who has made an independent film will love watching Tess (the director), Dom, and everyone else working in a very close personal environment to make this little, trippy, scary movie. It was quite pleasant and I am glad to have it in my collection.
