This movie really surprised me. I had my doubts first, but the movie got better by the minute. <br /> <br /> It may not be for action-seeking audiences, but for those who like an explicit portrait of a very strange criminal, husband, lover, and husband. If you are not a fan of bad language or sexual content, this is really not for you. <br /> <br /> The plot is sometimes a bit hard to track, but in the end, I think it has done everything better. The end was unexpected, as you were almost fearing that it would end up otherwise. <br /> <br /> Regarding acting, I think it was good. It will not be a long time for an Oscar, but it has at least fascinated me. Gil Bellow's portrait of a jailer is not always perfect, but it's very entertaining. Shaun Parke's Portrait of Bellow's Prisoner Clinique is awesome and extremely powerful. I think I'm going to pinpoint the Esai Morales portrait of Markie. <br /> <br /> Take my advice and watch this movie, either you will love it or not!
