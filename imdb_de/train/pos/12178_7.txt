I think this movie was rated bad because it was rated after the worst moments. There's a diarrhea joke and an awkward nut scratch scene, but apart from that, there are actually some moments when I had to laugh out loud. Jason Lee performs a wonderfully subtle comedy in this movie and Julia Stiles manages to be damn funny herself. Apart from that, this movie behaves like most romantic comedies, after about 40 minutes you know how it will end. (Which is better than most of them, where you already know after +/- 5 minutes). Definitely better movies, but definitely not the worst choice ... Cheers
