Vaguely reminiscent of the great westerns of the 1940s, such as "The Treasure of the Sierra Madre" (1948), "Red Rock West" is a story about conscience, greed and betrayal. Michael (Nicolas Cage) is an outspoken, but honest, young man from Texas, who goes west in search of work and money. He finds both, but not as he expected. <br /> <br /> The film's script contains many surprises and twists. Excellent cinematography, skilful film editing and atmospheric Western music provide excitement and excitement. The expanse of the great sky country offers a wonderful backdrop. The show ranges from good to excellent, with outstanding performances by Dennis Hopper and J.T. Walsh Dwight Yoakam's specially recorded country / western song gives the film a strong finale. <br /> <br /> As "neo-noir", the word "Red Rock West" seems to be something else. The storyline is full of amazing coincidences and improbable moments, so others see the script as flawed. I usually agree. In this case, however, in combination with the atmospheric atmosphere and the fact that the small town of Red Rock seems almost without the normal everyday life, the coincidences and the improbable timing point to a story that goes beyond "Noirish". surreal. It's almost as if destiny purposely intervenes in unlikely events to force Michael to deal with himself. From this perspective, the coincidences are no shortcomings at all. They are necessary plot points in a nightmarish story of a young man who has to face his own demons disguised as other characters. <br /> <br /> All we need here is Rod Serling, who explains in a postscript his always clear voice that ... a young man looking for himself in a small one , almost deserted city stops, a thousand kilometers from nowhere. It is his last stop on a journey into the twilight zone.
