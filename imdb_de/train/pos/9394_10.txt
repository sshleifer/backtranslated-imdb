"Red Rock West" was by far one of the best suspense thrillers of the '90s with an outstanding script (by John and Rick Dahl) that made you guess most of the movie in the whole area and on the edge of your seat. It was a brilliant directing by John Dahl and was composed of a wonderful cast, including Nicolas Cage, Dennis Hopper, Lara Flynn Boyle and, above all, JT Walsh (in a memorable performance) that made this a fascinating and intriguing thriller that you did not should miss. The film never had much publicity when it was released (in fact, I first caught up with it on TV) and is therefore one of the special little gems you have to look for, but this unique film is slowly gaining cult. > <br /> Nicolas Cage is Michael Williams, who is broke and has no work while in the small town of Red Rock. Confused of a hitman named Lyle from Dallas, he is shocked to have offered $ 10,000 for the assassination of Barnee Wayne Brown's wife (the excellent J. T. Walsh). He plays with the plan and decides he should warn Brown's wife Suzanne (Lara Flynn Boyle), but then the plan thickens and there are so many twists, turns and surprises - and double clashes - that Cage is plunged into crisis the other is thrown and finds himself caught in a terrible situation from which he can not tear himself out! To complicate matters, real Lyle turns up to carry out the genocide (played by any beloved heavy Dennis Hopper). When Hopper discovers what happened, he goes after Cage, but no one could overlook the surprising events that follow. <br /> <br /> Some favorite parts of the movie: <br /> <br /> Nicolas Cage (to Lara Flynn Boyle): "I hate to see an innocent woman injured, but it's a lot of money" , <br /> <br /> J. T. Walsh (to Cage): "Michael Williams. Well, Michael, you will spend some time with us until we get to the bottom of it." Boyle (to Cage): "You are not a murderer?" Cage: "That's right, no, but the guy I just drove out into the city needs to get out of here." Boyle (to Cage): "OK, how are you? Want to embody a hired killer and take $ 10,000 from my husband?" <br /> <br /> An exceptionally entertaining little thriller (only 98 minutes) with an action that never gives up a powerful spectacle from all the directors. Every film with J. T. Walsh is O.K. in my book and "Red Rock West" was one of his best. How sad it was that this exceptional actor's career was tragically interrupted in 1998 by a heart attack. The most productive phase for "film noir" was undoubtedly the 1940s, but "Red Rock West" is a good modern example of the genre and jumped right into my "Top Ten" list of all my favorite movies so far. I'm looking forward to more from director John Dahl. 10/10. Clive Roberts. <br /> <br />
