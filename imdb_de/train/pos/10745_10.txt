First, let me put the bad one out of the way. James Hanlon is absolutely terrible when trying to describe his descriptions of what happened to the rookie training and the events of the day. Actually it is a strong contract with the other firefighters without theatrical aspirations that are natural in their delivery. <br /> <br /> That means it's an amazing movie that you can not see without tears in my eyes. I'm an Englishman from London, but I love New York and visited many times before and after 9/11. It is a second home for me, and I can not help it, I feel devastated by the loss of life, but also by the destruction of part of such a wonderful, beautiful city. This is the real deal where firefighters collide with anything that collapses around them. I am so glad that there is footage to show people what it was like that day. It's a shame they did not take pictures of people who jumped out of the buildings, because friends who were there tell me that this is so much of their memory. They should be included to show future generations how dreadful it really was. <br /> <br /> Conspiracy theorists can go to hell, by the way.
