The best martial arts film of all time. This one movie is better than anything Bruce Lee ever did. A classic with an absolutely entertaining and brutal climax. Jackie Chan is the king of martial arts films and the true king of Kung Fu. It is a pity that Bruce Lee was so overrated, but Jackie Chan needed an age to become popular in Europe and America. Jackie rules !!!!
