Although this movie was released one year before my birth, it is definitely one of my favorite comedies. It depicts Redd Foxx as a father trying to understand his son's homosexuality. Like most parents, he does not know what it means to be gay, and has all these stereotypes about how gay people are. His son Norman is now grown and lives alone. When his father Ben learns that his son is gay, he visits his son in the hope of changing him. The title comes from one of the funniest lines in the movie - when Ben arrives at Norman's apartment, he meets a female prostitute and says it's his son on the train ("Norman ... is that you?"). The movie made me laugh from start to finish. Redd Foxx is great. Although many of the contents are stereotypical, I found nothing insulting in the handling of the material and it even ends well. Highly recommended.
