A great movie about two policemen who love the same woman. One of the policemen (Périer) killed her, but all evidence seems to burden the other (Montand). Unfortunate Montand does not know who the other lover is who could have killed her, and Périer does not know that Montand had an affair with the girl. Montand must necessarily find the murderer ... and what a great ending! Highly recommended.
