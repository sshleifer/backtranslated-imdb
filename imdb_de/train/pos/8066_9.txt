One of John Ford's best films, The Informer, does not provide a great backdrop for the American West. Instead, the intense drama known to Ford for games on the no less robust terrain of British character actor Victor McLaglen was known. The former award-winner, who once dealt with Joe Louis in the ring, presents an Oscar-winning Gago Nolan shame on the worst night of his life. The plot is gracefully simple: 1922 Dublin, a starving and humiliated man expelled from the IRA for not being able to kill an informant in cold blood, becomes an informant himself. For Â£ 20 he betrays a friend to "The Tans" and for the rest of the night he drinks and gives his blood money in fast-changing cramps of guilt, denial, self-pity and a desperate desire to escape the consequences of his actions. <br /> <br /> It's the remarkable complexity given to the character of the seemingly simple gypos, which is the film's most impressive performance. In most movies, a burly Gypo guy would be considered heavy, he would have at most two or three lines and would be quickly disposed of so that the hero and the villain could have their showdown. In 'The Informer', Gypo is himself a hero and villain, while the showdown is in his inner turmoil, each piece of which is explicitly shared with the audience. <br /> <br /> Because Liam O'Flaherty's novel had previously been RKO, which was filmed in 1929, Ford gave a very modest budget. The director and his collaborators, especially the cinematographer Joseph H. August, have taken advantage of this by creating a claustrophobic masterpiece about a man who is at war with himself. Besides McLaglen's Oscar, "The Informer" also won John Ford for the first time and also won Best Screenplay and Best Score.
