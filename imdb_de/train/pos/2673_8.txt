The Journey of Hope (1990) is about a hike that many nomadic and poor Turks undertake to live the good life in Switzerland. These people are so desperate to live as Westerners, giving up their lives and lives to reach the Promised Land. So many of them are cheated by greedy rogues who live by charging high fees to desperate people who are unsuccessful in a situation. A family defies the cold, the insidious mountain range and predatory criminals, only to discover that at the end of the tunnel does not always light a white light. This problem exists worldwide, not only in America. Some people tend to forget that. A heartbreaker of a movie that makes you wonder in the end. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
