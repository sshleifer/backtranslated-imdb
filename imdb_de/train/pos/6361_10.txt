I'm looking forward to the opening of this movie for months. As a great Jim Carrey fan, I easily saw him transform into Seuss's Grinch and make the character his own. I was not disappointed. <br /> <br /> This movie was pure magic. Carrey is a master of his craft and no one could have played this role as perfectly as he did. There was much to enjoy for both adults and children, and this movie is sure to become a timeless classic that everyone can enjoy in years to come. I already have visions of my little daughter year by year sitting down to watch this remake on video, and I'll undoubtedly watch her and laugh with her as I saw it the first time Jim Carrey wrote everything in this movie and I do not think he would have come without him. The minor cast, however, was charming and entertaining, especially the enchanting Taylor Momsen, who was the perfect foil for Carrey's antics. The scenery, music, and costumes created a magical, fabulous end product, and I believe everyone involved can be proud. <br /> <br /> It's no easy task to turn a 22-minute cartoon classic into a full-length live action movie, but Howard has done so with flying colors. For those critics who disagree, your hearts may be two sizes too small.
