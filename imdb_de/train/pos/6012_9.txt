Antonioni was aiming for another hip masterpiece, this time on the other side of the Atlantic as a "blow up". However, it was not successful with critics and teenagers like the former. Why? Maybe because it was a European view of America filled with stereotypes that did not work then and did not age well. (The revolutionary students are embarrassed at first.) <br /> <br /> Maybe it seemed, were published as big blockbuster movies and aimed specifically at the youth market, dated. If it had been published a year ago, Flippes would perhaps appeared fresh in deserts ... It is a very interesting film, beautifully shot with some brilliant and antonio African scenes in between, like making love in the desert, the silence of the desert villa the explosive end ... that the guides were two amateurs did not help. They were beautiful, but inexperienced. Mark Freshette is a bit better than Daria Halprin. With real actors it would have been so much better! Maybe Michelle Phillips or a young Jessica Lange ... The dialogue is sometimes quite funny and poignant, so you do not know how the lines are delivered ... <br /> <br /> A very interesting document from the late sixties Years are definitely worth a look for the photography and the soundtrack.
