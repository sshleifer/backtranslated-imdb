This is probably one of the worst movies ever made. It is terrible. But it is so good! It's probably best if you do not watch as you expect a thrilling plot and something fantastically clever and entertaining because you'll be disappointed. However, if you want to see it so that you can see 50 million vases and Goro's fantastic hair / bad English, this is a real treat. The harder you think about the movie, the worse it gets, unless you have a contest to find the most action holes. I would recommend this movie only for bored or die-hard Smap fans. And even then, the latter should be careful, because the Japanese fans of Goro were a little annoyed about it, they thought he was selling himself. (He was not real, not when Johnny Kitagawa (the executive producer) can do that for him).
