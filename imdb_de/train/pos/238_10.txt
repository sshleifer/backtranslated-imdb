Can not imagine a better movie than this <br /> <br /> Hey, before you all let go of "Chick Flick" on me. I am a very big Strong & Masculine, Macho Man, who happens to think that this was one of the better films of the last 20 years. <br /> <br /> The acting was great and the story was wonderful. This is a wonderful medicine for heart and soul. The drama could not have been better or the movie could be better filled. <br /> <br /> I've known for a long time that Mercedes Ruehl, along with Holly Hunter, Joan Plowright, Dame Edith Evans, Sissy Spacek and Judi Dench are among the greatest actresses ever seen in the film. And of course, in my opinion, Cloris Leachman (in this film as well) can really surprise everyone with her talent and her diverse roles in which she has performed over the years. This movie was like a book you can not put off, and when you reach the last page, you want more ... more. I can not for the life of me understand why this film receives here on the IMDb only a rating of 3.9. <br /> <br /> This review here is absolutely amazing for me. Or maybe not. Maybe I understand that really well and that makes me really sad. It still saddens me that films like "American Beauty", "Leaving Las Vegas", "Sexy Beast" and "Fight Club" surpass the popularity of the charts, even though they should have received an "R", at least in this audience rating. " Rating ... R this is for "garbage." Hey ok, I realize that there are a lot of different stories in this world for many different audiences, but it's a sad comment if this lovely, powerful ... extraordinary, Director, drama and written movie seems overrated. <br /> <br /> It was also evident at the Academy Awards ... How sad and predictable. My summary is that if you are a powerful, happy, sad, beautiful Want to see history ... look ...... rather own this movie ...
