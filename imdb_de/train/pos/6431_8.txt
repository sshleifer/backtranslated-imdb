The visuals and effects match the original movie and provide a lot of entertainment, even if the plot is essentially the same as the first two films. It also seems to be charged a lot erotic, as I remember the other films. If you are a big fan of flying griffin hairs and tongues that can reach into your stomach, you will love this movie.
