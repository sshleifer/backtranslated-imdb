I was all ready to rock this episode as this 'master' really has no horror movies under his belt ... but this is by far the season's best episode. <br /> <br /> The acting was good !! I do not know how he did it, but we have real talent in this episode! And while you could see things coming from a far-off mile, it was at least entertaining and I managed to keep myself busy for the full 56 minutes, something that was missing in the series so far. </ Br> /> I liked it a bit in the end, not a say, but just a funny bit where, as always, he becomes the cock-picked husband. <br /> <br /> Really good effort. As I've said in other reviews - these are not real masters doing a lot of these episodes ... but they may someday be masters in the future.
