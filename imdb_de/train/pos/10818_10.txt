Why does this have such a low rating? I really do not understand ... Is it because of the bad acting? The bad dialogue? Well, who cares in cheesy low-budget horror movies? Seriously, the acting and the dialogue are not important in these films. People who hate films only because of bad acting and bad dialogue should not be allowed to rate cheap low-budget films. These films should not be taken seriously. Period. Anyway, time to talk about the movie, right? Well, I loved it! I bought it because I expected a gorefest, but it's not a gorefest, and the gore is pretty bad (most of the time it's just animal guts on the actor's body and that's lame), but that did not really interest me Movie is funny! The characters are funny, the acting is weird (bad acting is a good thing in cheesy low budget horror movies), the dialogue is weird (bad dialogue is a GOOD in cheesy low budget horror movies), the zombie rapist with one Huge cock is weird, the flying demon baby is weird and I could go on and on and on, but I do not want to say too much ... BUT I have to mention that there is a scene where a girl masturbates a sex doll like that is alive lol! Oh, and the zombie rapist falls in love with the sex doll lol! <br /> <br /> Best Lines in the Movie: <br /> <br /> Detective Manners: * Sniffs Coke * Detective Sloane: What the * bleep * are you doing, manners? What the hell were you doing? What the hell is that? Detective Maners: It's not a man, it's ... Ehh ... Cold medicine ... <br /> <br /> Detective Maners: * injects heroin into his arm * Detective Sloane: What the * bleep * are you doing ? Manners? Are you * beep * crazy? Detective Manners: It's cold medicine. <br /> <br /> Detective Maners: * Repulsively slaps a random guy * Detective Sloane: What the hell is going on, manners? What do you do? Detective Manners: This maniac wobbled over demons and then he started banging his head on the rocks! He just started banging his head on the rocks! I think he's on PCP or something! <br /> <br /> LOL!
