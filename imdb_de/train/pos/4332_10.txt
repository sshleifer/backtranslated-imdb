Paul Reiser has done a spectacular job writing this film. Peter Falk gives the performance of his life. It deserves an Oscar. This was one of the most poignant and funniest films of the year. Reiser's joke is fantastic and he is as good as he can be and as he was in his longtime TV sitcom "Mad about You". Peter Falk did a masterly job as a dad, and Peter, now 78 years old, made us both laugh and cry. The minor cast was up to the task, especially the beautiful Elizabeth Perkins. It's a must-have movie for 2005. We're betting that everyone of all ages and religions will love this movie and somehow relate to it in one way or another. We have such mothers and fathers and siblings in the movie. We all had good and bad times together and wished things were the same, but different.
