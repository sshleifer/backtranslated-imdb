This electrifying musical has more than a touch of egoism from its star, the musical genius that is Prince. The movie is about 90 minutes posing, but in truth it's easy to understand why he's such a cult classic. Similar to other films that strive for the young musician who tries to be tall, this is the case contains a touch of drama to add a dimension to the musical numbers. While not as good as 8 miles (8 miles), this movie is still entertaining and the soundtrack is much better. On the dramatic side, it's all about the Kid (Prince), a young artist and a regular club member. The owner of the club is frustrated with the child's arrogance and little does the child know that he could soon be dismissed and replaced by a rival. The child's parents have problems, and his father violently abuses them. During the film, the child learns a few lessons in life and learns to appreciate his friends more. It's all we've seen in the upcoming dramas, but this is combined into a musical, a very stylized musical. <br /> <br /> The cast is good. Prince is actually pretty good on the drama side when he's not posing a pose. He seems human and understandable. Clarence Williams is also very good as an abusive father. Appollonia Kotero makes a good debut as Princes sexy love interest. <br /> <br /> The main strength of the film, however, is the excellent soundtrack. The music numbers are well staged and electrifying. Prince is undoubtedly a musical maestro, albeit very eccentric. If he's inspired, he's great, but on the other hand, he'll often make songs that are just for his liking, and occasionally his experiment may fail, but that's the same for many music geniuses. However, the soundtrack for this movie is excellent, with only sex shooter being a weak point. The impressive performance of Purple Rain, however, is outstanding. It is one of my favorite songs of all time. *** <br /> <br />
