Summary: The morning after his bachelor party, Paul is awakened by his future mother-in-law and discovers that a woman is sleeping next to him. Unfortunately it is a waitress from the bar and not his fianc√©. And suddenly she appears everywhere ... the tollbooth on the highway and at his parents-in-law's dinner. And it's hard to keep a secret when his jealous ex-boyfriend chased and photographed him. It's not just about saving his wedding ... it's about survival. <br /> <br /> Comment: Actually much better than expected. Not the sweet romantic comedy I expected, but something much funnier, something with a little edge. This movie was not afraid to make the jokes a bit wider. And now Jason Lee is making comedies, especially when his character is half in panic and in deep trouble because he's here. And he received nice support from the pretty ladies Julia Stiles and Selma Blair. And actually, I thought that Lochlyn Munro played a good role as an ex. <br /> <br /> Well, more emphasis on comedy than romance and the end result was good. I really enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> 7/10
