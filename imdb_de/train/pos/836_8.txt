This will probably not be voted Best Comedy of the Year, a few too many coincidences and storylines. However, it is a film in which a batsman and a white bread trader are buddies, a few disagreements should therefore not be too surprised. Brosnan is excellent in this role, the wooden James Bond (a role in which he was wasted) has disappeared. If he can maintain that quality, I hope he continues to make comedies. Greg Kinnear is also honored as Brosnans pure man. I read a few negative comments about Hope Davis here, but I thought she was a good housewife with a dark side deep inside. There are many good giggles as Brosnan makes his way and a few scenes where I almost died laughing. My father (a consultant) almost lost it when Julian describes himself as an "intermediary". Similar to "Big Pointe Blank," another hit-man comedy, the humor can be very dark. When you're at it, be ready to enjoy yourself.
