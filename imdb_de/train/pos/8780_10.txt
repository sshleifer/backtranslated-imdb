This is one of the biggest sports movies Hollywood has ever made. What a wonderful story about one of the great athletes in American history. What makes the story of James J. Corbett particularly interesting is that Mr. Corbett has introduced the style of boxing which continues to this day. In this regard, James J. Corbett was really renewed. But back to the movie, all performances were excellent. Alexis Smith was beautiful. She actually looked like Nicole Kidman. And though it is a historical piece, history stands the test of time; it is not stale. Ward Bonds depiction of John L. Sullivan must be one of the great portrayals of a real sports figure in the history of the film. The boxing scenes are realistic, well staged and extremely effective. This, together with a great script, makes this film a must.
