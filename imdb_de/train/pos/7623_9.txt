Originally, I did not hesitate to look at "Lost," but I accidentally discovered an episode at the beginning of Season One-the one with the Polar Bear-and she has since received my undivided attention. The show is that. Not the polar bear. Bear (heh) with me as I throw out so much daring, half-coherent praise as I can muster. <br /> <br /> "Lost" takes the simple idea of ​​a passenger flight full of people into the desert island, and gradually adds extraordinary depth to its premise by exploring each character deeply and unflinchingly. What drives them, who are they? Where are you from? It quickly becomes clear that the island on which they are stranded is a common denominator for many things in their lives, whether they flee from something (Sawyer and Kate et al.) Or connect with spirituality (Locke, p. Claire). , But "Lost" also zooms on the island and the mysterious horrors that it houses ... and all seem to be strangely interconnected. <br /> <br /> While television actors are not exactly known for their subtlety or dazzling acting skills, most of the cast of "Lost" are in fact spectacular actors for their respective roles, projecting heart and humor in their performances. There are also a lot of eye candy, but they are not like Hollywood's most TV shows. The characters all feel very real and they are extremely captivating. Their interactions seldom fall prey to predictable sappiness, small arguments, or cheesy melodrama (though they are annoyingly mysterious)? These people are primarily trying to survive, and every relationship that emerges is treated secondarily. The realism of these characters allows for a well-sculpted storyline. <br /> <br /> About this diagram ... Imagine a tree as a template plot, then the branches as subplans (in this case a branch for each character)? Well, Lost adds twigs and then twigs to each branch as other storylines. If you're brother / sister of one of the main characters in Flashbacks, you get your own story. If you are a DOG, you have your own story. If writers fail to weave them together for a glorious climax, they will stand up. I am more than a little worried that there will be some disappointing arguments for this show, as I'm sure most people are. <br /> <br /> But assuming the writers do, "Lost" may be the best show ever on TV. <br /> <br /> 9/10
