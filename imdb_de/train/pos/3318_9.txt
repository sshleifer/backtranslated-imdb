A very cute movie with a great background provided by the City of Boston and Fenway Park. As a baseball fan and addicted to a light movie, it hit a homerun for me. Lots of laughter and lots of authentic baseball scenes with real ballplayers and real hints of past Bosox failures. And how nice was it to watch a baseball-themed movie without having to endure an over-the-top, self-serving Kevin Costner trying to make believers out of a critical audience? Jimmy and Drew did a great job as a young amorous couple suffering from Jimmy's Bosox "jones". It was a bit crazy and from the left field, but there are really Sox fans who are so fanatical and live their lives through the assets of their beloved team. The film progressed at a fast pace and the end, though predictable, had the charm and sentimentality of so many other popular films, without being overly presumptuous. <br /> <br /> Also gratifying was the return of Willie Garson to the screen. I miss the ever-popular "Stanford Blatch" by Sex & the City. He is always funny, even if he says or says very little. <br /> <br /> So buy two box seats, some popcorn, and get ready for a fun time. "Fever Pitch" is a winner.
