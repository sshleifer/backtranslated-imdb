The ScareCrow was one of the funniest killer I've ever seen! And most of the time it's really jumpy, which was fantastic! He also had an excellent voice. I mean, it was just perfect for him. The plot was also excellent. I like how the child soul was transferred to ScareCrow, that was cool! Besides, he had a reason for all the killing. ScareCrows look was really good! His look gives this person an "OMG!" Reaction when they see him! What was great, the looks he got were funny! These people were stupid, they would stare so long! You should take a look at it and running for their lives ... even if that would make any difference!
