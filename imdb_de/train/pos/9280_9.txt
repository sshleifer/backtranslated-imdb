In Iran, women are officially excluded from sporting events for men. In June 2005, the Iranian national football team made an important match against Bahrain in the Azadi Stadium to qualify for the World Cup. A group of Iranian girls and lovers of football dresses like boys and unsuccessful attempts to enter the stadium being arrested. Football (and Flamengo's team), beach and movies are my biggest passions; That's why I loved this little gem about a group of girls and their passion for football. Director Jafar Panahi from "The White Balloon", "The Mirror" and "The Circle" filmed this film on the day Iran defeated Bahrain and qualified for the World Cup in Germany. The dramatic and fun adventure of these Iranian girls is one of the most beautiful movies I have ever seen. My voice is nine. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): Not available
