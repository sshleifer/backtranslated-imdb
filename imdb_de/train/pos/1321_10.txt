Embark on a path to this important documentary that looks like an attractive feature. Forbidden Lie $ (2007) is simply a better (cinematic) version of Norma Khouri's book Forbidden Love, and that was a bestseller. Lie $ is an onion scrub with literary fraud and a pretty woman. Lie $ is the best in editorial reality TV. Clein is edited and colorfully staged by Broinowski's narrative of moving silhouettes by Norma Khouri that spray smoke. I do not agree (with Variety) that it's overlong; Instead, my only problem was the episodic nature of the main actors, who commented on the testimonies of others just recorded. A single look confuses your sense of narration ..... so I watched it twice. <br /> <br /> This Oscar-worthy effort is at once really funny, exciting and totally captivating as it documents a lie one after another. The apparent coexistence in the Australian state of Queensland was triggered by very personal scams by Khouri's friends and fans (!). Obviously, these friends are now "turned around", the funniest camera line of Khouri's QLD neighbor Rachel Richardson, who expresses her disillusionment in flat, uncomplicated colloquialisms: "I think it's a lot sh! T. Personal" /> <br /> We have to learn from their experiences, hence my belief in spoilers. Any perennial lie spinner who has fallen into a lie just says everything to gain time to tell another lie. <br /> <br /> There are some stunning shots of Khouri taunting this documentary filmmaker, who instead repeatedly urges her (con) "artist" for confirmation. <br /> <br /> Since being beaten by Sydney Morning, Herald journalists Caroline Overington and David Knox were on the run a year after the release, but were tempted to get the director back, allegedly to erase their name. She allegedly fled because a) she was either scared of her sly, more Italian-looking than Greek husband, or b) because she needed her passport / visa to erase her name. <br /> <br /> Unlikely. <br /> <br /> A more plausible reason was that the FBI regained its track in Queensland before leaping overseas again (a guess: No, not Jordan). According to a graduation card, Khouri is "still under investigation by the FBI in 2007". I guessed that the audience might give Khouri the benefit of the doubt as soon as she had addressed the need for utmost secrecy and delusion. Instead, the audience with whom I sat slowly became as disillusioned as the deceived people on the screen. Once they had prevailed, there was plenty of counter mockery and battles. Stressed sighs had previously come from listeners who simply did not know how to absorb Khouri's growing contradictions. The filmmaker gets props for such a beautiful, sweeping story from start to finish and does not mind. - Not even her self-sacrifice. <br /> <br /> Anna opens her film with a sympathetic book tale by Khouri. The reason given for writing is at first credibly retold - the key to the functioning of a lifelong liar: in half-truths. However, Khouri is a very handsome and intelligent 35-year-old man with rather disarming charm and surprisingly well-made biceps. Little by little we are introduced to fewer and less inspiring Australian journos, publishers and journalists fans who first bought the extent of Khouri's reproaches, hooks, strings and sinkers. Later, we see their stubborn and factual reactions, though some may be a bit bitter. <br /> <br /> There were Jordanian anti-killing activists, and the deepest respect caused Khouri's fallacies because they were forced to slow the pace of change by stirring the temple. Honor killings take place in Jordan; It is only their dissemination that contradicts Khouri's book - and 72 other "facts". In 2003, these activists faxed the (Australian) Random House with 73 carefully examined objections. <br /> <br /> The publishers on four continents who had taken the chance to release first-time author Khouri have never tried to verify facts. They gave up any confirmation of disclaimer in their contract with the originator, and they too were a fair play. So a massive hot-topic scam around the world was as easy to commit as typing in cyber caf√©s. Later we are shocked to discover that the "factual mistakes" refer to Khouri's biography. Good. Not only is she not a 35-year-old virgin (her defense is that she did not just liberate people from her assumptions), but she has a sloppy husband and 2 teenagers! Sometimes she just talks too fast with her American accent. It also seems too comfortable with cell phone technology and Western clothing. I notice that such observations may seem detrimental to Jordanian women who do not need Western paternalism, but if even cultural cues are out of place with Khouri's "facts," you must question your source. <br /> <br /> At some point the filmmaker came to the same conclusion. She admirably tries to hold Khouri personally accountable in Jordan. The last third is spent on an information trip to Amman, where one "fact" after another falls. Finally, Broinowski forces her (her) "artist" to admit the decade-discrepancy in her story, and then Khouri records her hideous secret confession into her own digital camera. Secret, because in Khouri's "American Watchman" Jeremy's Australian accent is heard: He's an actor! (We never know how Anna discovered it.) So, this becomes the filmmaker's triumph, as she never swings in her tone or commitment. Their revelations in front of the camera cause the audience to learn from the mistakes of others led by such a litany of reasonable doubt, FBI documents, and Khouri's most shocking initial crime. Anna Broinowski (list now)) is even smart enough to use the only artistic instrument (key player that comments on the footage) to kill two birds - causing their audience to drink well again. In fact, despite her fraudulent approach, she once again provoked me to confirm that Overington and Knox had really won their Walkleys in 2004 in Investigate Journalism for their "Norma Khouri Investigation." <br /> <br /> Broinowski MADE ME LOOK.
