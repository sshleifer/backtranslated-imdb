I was pretty surprised with this movie. Although their budjet was obviously still missing, one must be impressed that this movie lasted 7 years and still went well. The acting was pretty impressive and the story really intrigued me. My only complaint would be that the end was really a bit too abrupt for my liking. But if your audience wants more, then this movie is successful. <br /> <br /> I would really recommend to anyone in Hollywood to look for Antonella Ríos, who is an outstanding Spanish talent (something that is hard to find nowadays) the bad novela about the acting). Antonella Ríos is truly a star on the rise.
