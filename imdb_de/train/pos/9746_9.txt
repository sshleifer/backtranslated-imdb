Okay, let's face it. This is a terrible movie. The plot (as it is) is awful, the acting worse. But the movie was made for one reason, like all those horrible Mario Lanza movies ... just to hear the voice of the star, in this case Pavarotti in his best form. Okay, maybe the Lanza movies were an excuse for him to attack women, but this movie is about hearing Luciano. That alone is worth the movie. A great opera star who is stuck to himself faces his fears, finds humility and love on the way and also strips out a number of hits. I am Italian. I'm a big Pavarotti fan (is there anything about Pavarotti that's not big, including his fan base?). When I saw this movie for the first time, I went out alone, saw the height and depth of Life's possibilities and was in love for the first time. As awful as this movie may be, the beautiful voice and the memories are enough to breathe deeply and love life again. <br /> <br /> Yes, it is trite and horrible. But the voice is immortal and timeless and the voice is what it's about. That's why I give this film a high rating, in the hope that someone who has never heard Pavarotti before will enjoy a new level of music and love, especially since he's gone. Try it like Italian food that you have never tasted before! You will be pleasantly surprised as a Luciano lover or potential Pavarotti peep.
