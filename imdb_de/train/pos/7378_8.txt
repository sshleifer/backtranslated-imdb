After seeing this movie last night at Sundance, I realized that much of Nakata's style was first made in this film. Here we have many of the same elements of the RINGU series, especially the idea that the media are the source of the supernatural. Instead of the cursed videotape we instead have a spooky studio and weird pictures in the movie. The strange pictures that appear in the movie immediately remind you of the cursed video in RINGU. The only thing missing was the obsession of the water that Nakata's later films go through. The last scenes are quite refreshing, with a slight nod to Murnau, which reminds me of NOSFERATU when the door opens by itself and the ghost enters the room. A horrible movie that makes you think twice over the catwalk.
