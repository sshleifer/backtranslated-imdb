I took my 10 year old daughter to see Nancy Drew over the weekend and found myself entertained very well. At first it was clean and I mean with my standards. The majority of today's children's films are full of gross toilet humor and disgusting jokes to cause cheap laughter from the youthful audience. Nancy Drew is smarter than that, and the humor is subtle and smart. <br /> <br /> The title role is played by Emma Roberts with refreshing vivacity that is sassy and polite, without ever being annoying. Unlike The Brady Bunch Movie, in which the anachronistic characters are mocked and mocked, Nancy's style is treated with respect and dignity. It's a great moment for the "style-conscious" girls to be kicked out of the boutique owner's Paris Hilton Streetwalker clothes while Nancy is dressed in her penny moccasins and her homemade Butterick dress. This movie avoids the we need to enlighten the whole girl that so many Hollywood movies bring with them. Nancy remains true to herself and her values ​​in all areas. <br /> <br /> The mystery is sometimes tense enough to be captivating. There were several exciting moments when my daughter nervously grabbed my arm, but there were no unintended shock scenes. Everything is based on suspense and mood and a lot of fun. The understudy is good, especially Marshall Bell as a scary janitor. There are some great cameos by Eddie Jemison, Chris Kattan and Bruce Willis and many moments that will make adults smile. <br /> <br /> This movie deserves better reviews than some have. I was not only glad that I was not dragged to another computer animated film where talking animals everywhere whine and gas, but I was also very entertained. If I had been there without a child, I would have enjoyed the movie anyway. This is a DVD with my daughter's name under the Christmas tree.
