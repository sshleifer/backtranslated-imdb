I love this movie, Jouvet, Arletty, Blier, Carn√© ... Almost everything has already been said about the film, but there is a detail that I want to put some light into: no shots of the real, still standing Hotel du Nord (is it was still? I heard it should be demolished ...) was used for the movie - the entire scene was rebuilt on set, the main reason is that they could not stop the traffic on the St Martin Canal For several weeks.
