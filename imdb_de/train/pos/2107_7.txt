I recently bought this movie with a number of other LaserDiscs from eBay. Usually I'm into war and action movies, but occasionally I like romantic comedies. <br /> <br /> If you are bored with today's special FX movies and high-gloss, romantic comedies, you should visit "Shop Around the Corner" on a quiet evening. What I like about the movie is that the characters have a lot of decency. There is nothing wrong or presumptuous about them. Take, for example, Mr Matuschek: When he finds out that his wife is cheating on him with one of his employees, he tries to shoot himself. Not only because of the humiliation, but because he did not do justice to the character of Stewart. (OK, usual example.) Yes, the focus of the film is tight and the plot is predictable. Nevertheless, I really liked it. If you like Notting Hill, you are welcome to shop around the corner. In fact, Hugh Grant reminds me a lot of Jimmy Stewart.
