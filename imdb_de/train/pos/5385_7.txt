I have never seen the show "Next Action Hero" and did not know until reading the other comments here that this film was the "prize" of this competition. I've just switched channels and came across this, and I've watched as I eagerly dared to venture all the way to the end and almost got the "gotcha" - as the protagonist would beat the hunter in the end. I think the hi-tech was over the top (GPS) and gave me cold flash flashbacks from Night Rider, but it was still not over the top. <br /> <br /> The fundamental problem I had with this film was the extent of SOD (suspension of disbelief) demanded by the viewer. Do we really think that someone flying in a helicopter could drop countless firecrackers on a public bridge and NO COPS show up to investigate? Could a limousine in a crossroads of Las Vegas make tons of donuts and NO COPS show up? Pleeease Far too much of these kinds of things - fun to see, but at least plausible, thank you. <br /> <br /> The final solution was good, but the end was disappointing, with the aftertaste of a bad Star Trek episode. At least, I now understand why acting was so cheesy - except for Zane, who does not get as much work as he deserves - they were the winners of a reality show. <br /> <br /> Beat me out.
