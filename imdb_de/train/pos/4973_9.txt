I remember seeing that when he aired in 1962 as a five or six year old. I recently had the opportunity to see it again for the first time since it was aired on Disney Channel's Walt Disney Presents. I had forgotten most of it and some of it was geared for children, but it was still enjoyable. I can not wait to show it to my niece and nephew.
