In a time in our culture where the narrative reality overwhelms fiction as we know it on the big and small screen, "Apart From That" is a film that shows real - life moments that are in the making feeling more honest, fresh, and innovative in their presentation than I have seen before. The usual spoon feeding conventions are not present in this film, so that a satisfied audience can sit and watch as these moments of real life run one after another on the canvas. It's hard to believe that these amazing performances during the movie and even after the contemplation were actually that. Every moment with the great cast of actors felt like the truth in their daily lives. Nevertheless, "Apart From That" does not feel like a documentary or reality TV, but transcends into its own category with its unique cinematography and orientation. I look forward to continuing this new category of storytelling with other films by directors Jennifer Shainin and Randy Walker. <br /> <br /> This movie has to be seen.
