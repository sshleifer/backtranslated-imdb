MacArthur is a great movie with a great story about a great man - General Douglas MacArthur. This, of course, is the story of one of America's greatest military figures, and a character I learned from the earliest moments of my memory. There is a continuity problem (there may be others), eg. MacArthur's speech, which was portrayed in the film as his 1962 speech to the US Military Academy on the acceptance of the Thayer Prize, did not contain the phrase "old soldiers never die, they only fade". (That was in his speech to Congress when he was recalled by President Truman) in 1951 for alleged insubordination (these two did not look on par!) Philippines during World War II. The film moves quickly and easily with the General, his family and his associates from the beginning of World War II to the end of his service career. This film would be much more important to one who is familiar with both the Second World War and the Korean War. Yet Peck's portrayal of this great man, who fought the two evils of fascism and communism and hated the war as a soldier, is indeed memorable. "There is no substitute for victory in war."
