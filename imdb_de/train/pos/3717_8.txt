It was not until I saw Napoleon Dynamite that I realized I saw Cracker Bag. Just a nice feeling and never bending over, that he is alert. There are great cinematographs and the main girl is pretty brilliant. It captures more than the nostalgia of the time. It has a real heart. It is the childhood Achilles wound that is exquisite and painful. A simple story is always effective when done well. This Glendyn Ivin has a great future and I am looking for his next project. Follow-up is always the hardest. For most people it's like the second album blues. <br /> <br /> I just hope his next movie is not something like a shark movie. Cheers to all. Enjoy your cinema.
