The master of the film spectacle Cecil B. De Mille moves west. With three legends of the Old West as protagonists (which they've probably never met), Gary Cooper portrays Wild Bill Hickock, James Ellison as Buffalo Bill, and Jean Arthur a beautiful Calamity Jane. The story is just to make De Mille hang up wonderful action sequences like the big Indian attack. Such scenes are very well made entertaining western. Look for a very young Anthony Quinn who is trying out the role of an Indian brave performer who participated in the Battle of Little Big Horn.
