The Korean War was called the forgotten war of America. So many unanswered questions were buried along with the 50,000 men who died there. Occasionally we are treated to a play or a movie that deals with this far away, ghostly frozen graveyard. Here is perhaps one of the most beautiful. It's called "Sergeant Ryker". The story is about an American soldier named Sgt. Paul Ryker (Lee Marvin) who is selected by his commander for a top secret mission. His job is to approach the North Koreans and offer their services against United Nations forces. As successful is its cover, it proves invaluable to the enemy and receives the rank of major. Afterwards, however, he is captured by the Americans and put on trial as a traitor and spy. He says he was ordered to be defective, and he sadly learns that his commander was killed and he has no evidence of his innocence. He is convicted and sentenced to hang. His conviction, however, is doubted by Captain Young (Bradford Dillman), his prosecutor. Convincing convincing General Amos Baily (Lloyd Nolan) of his doubts, he is granted a new trial, and if convicted, he is executed. The drama in the courtroom is first-rate, as is the cast, which includes Peter Graves, Murray Hamilton and Norman Fell as Sgt. Max Winkler Korea was a far-flung area, but the opportunity to convict and hang a communist was very close to his homeland in the 1950s. Its dramatic writing and powerful message made this drama a classic courtroom. Excellent view and recommended for everyone. ****
