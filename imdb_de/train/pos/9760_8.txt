I have very fond memories of this film when I saw it with my two younger sisters when it first appeared in theatrical terms in 1977 and I was eight years old. Apparently it was considered a failure - and is now virtually forgotten (the pan-and-scan videocassette that never did justice to the picture or its ambitious Panavision compositions are no longer on press.) The film is very stylized (shadow of YELLOW SUBMARINE) and uneven. Some of the characters and sequences are exquisite, while others are a bit youthful and indistinguishable. The sad discarded blue camel (nuances of Eeyore) and his blue song are really heartwarming. For the most part, Joe Raposo's songs are just beautiful. In any case, a rewarding curiosity that (unfortunately) will fall into complete darkness.
