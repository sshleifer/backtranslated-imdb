This movie must be my favorite of all time. There should be no conspiracy because the creators wanted the people (Charlie Sheen, I believe) to believe that it was a real snuff movie. This was an exercise with visual effects and does not truncate if the action happens like any other movie. Nowadays, movies are all about sound effects. Visualizing computers makes it easier to deal with CGI blood. There are still filmmakers who still do not get the wrong blood to look like a real thing. There is no rape scene because it was not the point to shoot the movie. Did you see that the hills have 2 eyes? The rape scene was funny rather than shocking. Although I'm sure, there are some gonzo pornographers who have tried to marry porn with horror. But since they probably do not make enough movies, they probably could not make it. The movie "Baise Moi" has a disturbing rape scene because the actors are actually porn stars and show everything, even though the movie is a total shit. <br /> <br /> It's too bad that a movie can not be made without thinking about the money aspect, especially when talking about an AO or NC-17 rating. I'm sure Eli Roth has the ability / talent to make his hostel movie series much better, but he's tamed it too much to get an R rating ... or at least I hope his films are due these restrictions shit. <br /> <br /> Look at death marks or more than Smashed Pumpkins if you do not want real footage (crime scene, footage, footage). Do not forget that this movie was shot in 1985. The fact that this movie can still stand up to most of the shit that's been made these days says a lot about this movie. That would be like saying that the 8bit Super Mario Brothers is shitty because the PS3 has better graphics.
