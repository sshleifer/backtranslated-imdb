It's amazing that so many people I know have not seen this little gem. Everyone I've mentioned has come back with the same reaction: WHAT A GREAT FILM! <br /> <br /> I've never cared for Brad Pitt (though his twists at 12 Monkeys and Fight Club show an improvement), but his performance in this movie as Psycho is annoying, dark, and right on target. <br /> <br /> All the others in the film deliver great performances, and the film's slow and deliberate tempo dramatically improves the process. The feeling of fear of the characters increases the more they realize what really happened. <br /> <br /> The only thing that keeps this from a 10 in my book is that, compared to what came before, the end is a bit too long and overused. But that's the only mistake I could find in this cult classic. <br /> <br /> When you check out this movie, try to get the direct cut of the Letterboxed Unrated for the best viewing option. <br /> <br /> rating: 9
