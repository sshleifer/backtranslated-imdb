First, I liked this movie. It was handled well by everyone. <br /> <br /> But I do not understand any comments that I hear from people about a surprising ending. I did not know anything about this movie except for a few "must do" recommendations, but I knew where the storyline was under ten minutes. (I'm not going to mention what's talking to me to avoid ruining a good movie for others.) Still, it seemed obvious to me that I kept watching. It was nice to see how it all happened, the details and motivational motives of the characters in later scenes. I hate it only when the road to dissolution is lined with a boring scenery. Will Smith's screen person is just likeable, even if he plays such a restless character. He is energetic and believable in everything that I have seen. Seven pounds is another good achievement. <br /> <br /> Rosario Dawson is a solid performer who, despite unreliable heart problems, is a quirky, optimistic character. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and with Rosario, if you do not find it great, you should replace your eyes. <br /> <br /> It was nice to see Woody Harrelson back on screen. I have not seen him much lately, but that could only be me. Woody did not have much time on the screen, but he sold his funny, piano-playing, blind character for everything that was worth it. Excellent. <br /> <br /> A quick search on the jellyfish jellyfish tells me that the poison is cardiotoxic, neurotoxic and dermatonecrotic. I think that makes it a questionable choice for both pets and plots. <br /> <br /> Overall, I do not have to recommend this movie for plotting, but for some very good performances and for the fact that it tends to evoke some of the tragic feelings that we generally try to avoid.
