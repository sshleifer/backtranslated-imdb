Another Woo masterpiece! <br /> <br /> This is the best Wuxie movie I have ever seen! Woo - RULEZ forever (except some Hollywood moments ...). John Woo - great director of the century. <br /> <br /> Maybe hi is not more intellectual than a lot of great directors ... But he is a lyrical and spiritual idol of all people who can think freely! <br /> <br /> His films like the great poetry! Woo is a movie Sheakspeare! Woo is a movie Biron! Woo is a Mozart of Bloodshet! <br /> <br /> IMHO, who is violent in Woo films, is not a director, but an instrument of art. The themes of Woo films are more humanistic than the new films.
