Not to mention Pierce Brosnons best performance. Of course Greg Kinnear is always great. Really, when was he really bad? I think this movie is incredibly underrated! The use of colors in this film is something completely different in today's movie world, where every other movie has the Payback Blue filter. I also love how they used the song from Asia. To prove that even what was once considered a bit cheesy can be placed really cool. <br /> <br /> I just did my first feature when this came out. Since my movie was a hit-man movie, I had to review everything in the genre that was released. After seeing it, I was sure that it affected me through the process. When my movie was included in the IMDb, it was pretty cool that he would recommend this movie, if you like mine. As the others behave, I have no idea and make a more interesting coincidence. <br /> <br /> http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1337580/
