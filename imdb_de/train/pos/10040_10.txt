For me personally, this film is in my top 4 ever. No exceptions. James Cameron has proven time and again that he is a storyteller. Films like Aliens, The Abyss, and both Terminators make it clear that he was a brilliant and familiar director of action and science fiction. He sees a story and adds a strange quality to the movie. But the Titanic is so different from its other highlights. The film is exceptionally moving and leaves room for surprises, storylines and interesting character developments in a story that everyone knows. The story of the famous Voyager, lost on her maiden voyage, is a legend. So the challenge for Cameron was to make an honest, interesting and entertaining film about it. The acting is wonderful as Leonardo DiCaprio, who plays Jack, and Kate Winslet, who plays Rose, became superstars overnight with the release of this movie. In most movies, I get annoyed when the minor characters are not very busy, because when an older Rose (Gloria Stuart) tells her story, it quickly becomes clear that it's just Rose and Jack's story, not anyone. Emotionally it is completely satisfying and can not leave a dry eye in a theater or at home. The music has become legendary and legendary. It's the best soundtrack by the composer James Horner, who gets so much out of film and audience. The song has become annoying after so long, but I still appreciate it for the phenomenon and the movie. Only one problem, the usual James Cameron problem, is the dialogue, which is memorable, but in a bad way, how cheesy it is at points, but the whole. James Cameron has delivered a masterpiece and a romantic epic that takes you on a journey of a lifetime. My heart will not move on.
