Well ... Vivah is a pretty good film, but typical of Sooraj Barjatya. It shows different aspects of Indian families, wedding ceremonies etc. The movie is more than good, but not extremely good. <br /> <br /> The movie's big plus is directing, music and Shahid and Amrita's acting (especially the last scene). The film begins with a common factor in Indian film: a girl who is not loved by her stepmother. History is the movie is a bit general, but it's good, good enough to turn the movie into a blockbuster. <br /> <br /> Minus dot is the general story of the Bollywood movie. All in all, I would say it's a movie twice if you want to see typical Indian family values ​​and, of course, love!
