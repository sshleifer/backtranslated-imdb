"Bell Book and Candle" was recently shown on cable. We have not seen it for a while and decided to revisit this comedy. Based on the Broadway hit by James Van Druten, who was a vehicle for Rex Harrison and Lilli Palmer in the early fifties, the film was adapted for the screen by Daniel Taradash. The film was shot by Richard Quine, who made the play a delightful comedy. <br /> <br /> Judging by some comments from IMDb, the big issue seems to be the pairing of the two stars. who had worked on "Vertigo" appeared in the same year. The film audience did not think about the age difference when this movie was released. In fact, most of the aging male stars of that time were always involved with much younger women. <br /> <br /> The film, set in Manhattan for Christmas, is a delightful comedy that enchants audiences. Kim Novak was at the height of her beauty when it was clear the camera was worshiping her no matter what she was playing. As the witch who becomes human, her Gillian is charming. James Stewart, who plays the publisher Shep 'Henderson, is also at his best. Mr. Stewart was an excellent comedy actor who shows why he was at the top. In the supporting roles is the wonderful Elsa Lanchester, who plays Queenie, a welcome addition to any film, as she proves here. Jack Lemmons Nicky Holroyd, Gillian's brother, is also good. Ernie Kovacs is also considered a writer Sidney Radlitch. <br /> <br /> This is a great way to spend a winter's night at home and watch "Bell Book and Candle".
