Obviously, not many people have seen this movie because nobody has published any comments. This is not a movie to miss. After all, it has won the George Peabody Award and the Humanitas Award. Paul Winfield should have received a prize for his great performance in this film. Eugene Logan, who co-wrote the film produced for the TV movie, was also part of another film about humanity or its loss, as a technical advisor to Truman Capote's The Glass House. This movie is now available on DVD. If anyone is interested, I will post another letter stating that Eugene Logan became the technical advisor of a movie to such an amazing person as Truman Capote. Thank you for reading and I hope you find a way to watch these two films.
