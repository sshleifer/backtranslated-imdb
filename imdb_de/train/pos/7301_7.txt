When I heard that "Hammerhead" was released on DVD and finally found in my local DVD store, I thought, "Well, just another cheap monster movie from Nu Image." The guys around Boaz Davidson and Avi Lerner have been producing cheap but very entertaining B-pictures in recent months, as well as some very disappointing films. So I did not expect much, especially after seeing the rather disappointing "Shark Zone" just a few days earlier. However, "Hammerhead" turned out to be an outstanding revival of the monster movies of the 1950s. We have a crazy scientist, a group of people in a dangerous situation, screeching women and girls in need, man-eating plants and of course we have the creature, a huge mutant mix between a man and a hammerhead shark. Everything you need for a fun monster movie. The only thing missing is the graphic sex scenes and nudity one expects in films of this kind, but since the film was made for television, it is understandable why these scenes are missing. It does not matter, because "Hammerhead" is action and horror entertainment. There are two reasons why I gave it seven out of ten points: First, the monster is not seen very often and the showdown with the creature's destruction is too fast and bad, and second, William Forsythe is not the type for the " Heroes' partner and for falling in love with the beautiful Hunter Tylo. Apart from that, I can recommend this movie to any monster movie fan. Grab a cool drink and popcorn, watch this movie and have fun. Jasper P. Morgan
