I've watched this documentary twice - and although I'm a big fan of movies, most documentaries do not catch my attention. This movie was fascinating, though. Almost every recording is perfect - so much more than an audio commentary to say (which this documentary does not have). <br /> <br /> The concept of this film is amazing, I can not praise it enough. Mardi Gras beads - who would have thought ?? <br /> <br /> Amazing and excellent selection of interviews - filming a factory in China - the movie makes you feel like you're actually there. <br /> <br /> I am politically aware - and I have read several books on globalization, so there was nothing in this film that surprised me. However, I have thought so much about it. <br /> <br /> I also wish so much that this world was a better place. <br /> <br /> One million kudos for the filmmaker - and thank you for making this movie as well. <br /> <br /> I wish everyone could see it.
