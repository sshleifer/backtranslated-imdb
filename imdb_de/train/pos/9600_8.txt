This film is a touching story about an adventure of 15-year-old Darius Weems. Darius has Duchenne muscular dystrophy, a disease that is still incurable, which claimed his brother's life at the age of nineteen and is the number one cause of death in the United States. He and a few close friends travel through the country to Los Angeles with the goal of adapting his wheelchair to MTV's Pimp My Ride, one of his favorite shows. The journey begins in Georgia, where Darius grew up and never left. The gang heads west for a journey that all participants will never forget. Darius can travel for the first time by boat, ride a hot air balloon, swim in the sea and visit places he has always wanted to see, such as the Grand Canyon and New Orleans. The filmmakers clearly have an emotional connection to the material here. They do not make money from the sale of the 20-dollar DVDs. US $ 17 will be used to research the disease and US $ 3 to make additional copies. The film has won more than 25 awards at festivals, and I agree with Variety's quote, "Certain to beweg hearts".
