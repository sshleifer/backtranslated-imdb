This movie is one of those who have an overwhelming familiarity. It's earthy, earthy and a movie that makes you think and smile. Paul Reiser and Peter Falk take you on a journey that you will not forget. The soundtrack is nice and varied; and the movie itself is like a breath of fresh air. This certainly deserves recognition both for the movie and for the actors! Finally, a work of art that deviates from the obvious love story and the frequent special effects that can be seen today. I have never gone out of a movie with such deep warmth and thoughtfulness in my heart. because it felt as if someone had just wrapped it in a fluffy fleece blanket. To see this movie is to find a real treasure and to inspire it.
