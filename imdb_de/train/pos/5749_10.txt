I would like to warn you that this comment has a very bittersweet quality. Also, this comment will be much more meaningful to you after watching the movie. <br /> <br /> Although it is tragically sad to say that the film has a similarity to my life that is so conspicuous that it really is scary. The rest of you will never know how exactly this film depicts how people who have been in such situations act and react in their later lives. <br /> <br /> This could not be a fiction. It had to be based on personal experience. <br /> <br /> My testimony of how good the movie was is shown in the fact that although he was one of the best movies I've ever seen, he has seen my life shown on screen such a painful experience that I will never see it again. <br /> <br /> But I wholeheartedly support everyone as an opportunity to look into another person's soul to the extent that you have probably never experienced or will ever experience again. I know for sure, because that's my soul, which you will observe.
