One day I heard some friends saying, "Scarface sucks ... an idiot was trying to make a new godchild in the early 80s." Now I usually hear idiots / watch CNN, so I decided I would stay away from it. Then my buddy gave me the DVD and said, "This is the # 1 Pelicangs", I tried it confused. This is the best movie ever. It's more realistic than all this crap to run stolen cars that are too expensive for someone in the area (* hough2Fast2Furiouscough *). There is some humor ... the Pelicangs and the light music of the 80s. But what is better than Al Pacino, who dominates a m203? I give you a ***** ****, perfect for fans of Al or GTA: Vice City.
