First, shut up quickly! ' to which says this movie stinks. You can not go into any movie with "Citizen Kane". That was actually a funny movie. Jason Lee is good at everything he does. The only flaw in this movie is, I do not think there was enough chemistry between Lee and Julia Stiles. You should have thought more about it. Apart from that, the movie is a lot of fun. Selma Blair has to eat something. She worries me. But she still looks nice. Yes, I recommend this movie for a date or a light pleasure on Saturday afternoon. See here. <br /> <br /> RATING: ** 1/2 of ****
