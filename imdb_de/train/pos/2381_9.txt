"The Classic War of the Worlds" by Timothy Hines is a very entertaining film that obviously makes great efforts to faithfully recreate the classic book by H. G. Wells. This succeeds Mr. Hines. Me and those who watched his movie with me appreciated the fact that it was not the usual, predictable Hollywood fare that comes out every year; The Spielberg version with Tom Cruise had only the slightest resemblance to the book. Obviously everyone is looking for different things in a movie. Those who imagine themselves as amateur "critics" are just trying to criticize everything they can. Others rate a movie on a more important basis, such as being entertained. That's why most people never agree with the "critics." We enjoyed the effort that Mr. Hines gave to the classic novel by H. G. Wells, and we found it very entertaining. This made it easy to overlook what the "critics" perceived as their shortcomings.
