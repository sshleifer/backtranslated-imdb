De Grot is a very good movie. The great plot comes from the novel by Tim Krabbé, who also adapted this story for the screen. A really high-profile acting, not only by Van Huêt, but most of all by Marcel Hensema, who mostly did TV work before his performance by Axel van de Graaf. The movie seems like a thriller, and the mood is excellent. Then we meet Egon Wagter and Axel van de Graaf, and the story is gradually revealed in a captivating flash-back structure that enhances the film's more romantic aspect and character drama. In the end, this culminates in an emotional end that will grab the audience by the throat. Make sure that you know as little as possible about the plot when you watch this movie. A must, especially if you like 'Spoorloos' (The Vanishing's original screen customization).
