It is so rare to find a literary work that has been adequately translated to the screen, so I may have rated this film higher than it deserved, but not much. As a longtime student of Vonnegut's work, I can not hesitate to recommend the film to his readers, at least to those who love him as much as I do. The casting is inspired: Nolte is triumphant, confused in defeat, decisive in judgment. Sheryl Lee is thoroughly fed, but her dealings with sneaky Resi and her tragic crescendo almost make her forget her beauty. Alan Arkin delivers an absolutely lovable, but equally insidious, Soviet spy. <br /> <br /> Do not think that you have to read Mother Night to appreciate the movie; However, if you have not read Mother Night, you probably want to watch the movie. <br /> <br /> Note the shifts from color to black and white and back, and do not miss the final symbolism of the Campbell noose. Also check out Kurt Vonnegut's cameo at the end of the film. <br /> <br /> Bing Crosby's "White Christmas" never sounds the same (I write in mid-December when the song gets a heavy audio drama) and it drives me crazy).
