I found this movie very well put together. The voice overs were great too. I liked how they overcame all their conflicts and achieved their goals. I would recommend this movie to anyone. It was definitely the time and worth the money to see it. Atlantis has some comic scenes that made me laugh. Other scenes made me sad. And others made me happy. It's a movie that every age can enjoy. From that moment on, Milo is the mad "profesor" or until he collects the crew for the fantastic underwater journey. After watching the movie, I read the book. It was fine too, but the movie brings you better pictures to mind. It's just like the book. But look at this movie!
