Spoiler! <br /> <br /> From the moment I saw a local movie critic put this film in the garbage in a report on 10 o'clock news, I wanted to see it. I can not remember who it was or what local Omaha news program ran the review, but the critic insisted that this movie was much too run-down for the average church Nebraskan. They showed an excerpt from the scene where John Glover abducts Ann-Margret swimming in the pool. Glover's figure praises her about how beautiful her body is, and so on, with many words the local broadcaster deemed necessary to work on. I was addicted. There was a problem though. I was only 13 years old at the time and had to wait one year for it to come out via cable. Let's just say it was worth it to wait! <br /> <br /> If it ever gave me a bad pleasure, this movie is it. To call this film "sleazy" would be a great understatement. At the center of the film is a successful businessman who is blackmailed after an affair with a young woman of three small Zeitm√ºllern. Roy Scheider, as effective as ever, plays the poor guy who wanted only a small swarm, and is now at the mercy of three big villains. John Glover's character is one of the most memorable scumbags of all time. He is sloppy, sometimes funny and always on the verge of doing something crazy. Then there's Robert Trebors (nice name!) Character Leo, who pulls himself clearly with this blackmail program over his head. He is a whimpering, sweaty coward who operates a peep-show place with live nude models. Then there's Clarence Williams III as Bobby Shy, a brooding sociopath who everyone is afraid of for a good reason. Who could forget the wake up call he gives vanity with the giant teddy bear? <br /> <br /> After facing the initial shock of knowing what he's up to, Scheider turns the tables and takes control of the situation until Glover finds his wife! The conflict is brutal and virtually the entire cast is shot, raped or blown up. <br /> <br /> I do not know why I love this movie so much. It should really crawl out of me, but it does not. Maybe it's because these characters are all interesting and the story holds many opportunities that most films would never try today. It's scary to think that the adult movie industry is likely to have more than a few characters like Glover running around in LA looking for trouble. Just thinking about his voice is enough to make me laugh. "Hey sports, have a nice day!" <br /> <br /> This movie has a lot of shootouts, cool cars, great dialogues (like the line in my opening set) and decent acting. Many cameos of real pornstars. Look for Ron Jeremy romping around a whirlpool with two chicks in a Glover party scene. <br /> <br /> What I have to add: How hot are the women in this movie ??? Impressive! Travolta did the right thing to marry Kelly Preston. Tasty We also see that vanity gets naked at a time before she is born again. And Ann Margret. What else can you say about her except that she is the quintessential American beauty. <br /> <br /> 9 out of 10 stars. <br /> <br /> That's what the dog says. <br /> <br /> added February 14, 2008: RIP Roy Scheider!
