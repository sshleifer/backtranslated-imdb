Care Bears Movie 2: A new generation is not a bad movie at all. In fact, I like it very much. Yes, I admit, the dialogue is crazy and the story is sometimes told a little bad. But Darkheart, though very dark, is a compelling figure that changes the villain, and Hadley Kay has done a great job defending him. Speaking of voice, it was great, there was nothing wrong with it. The animation is colorful and some of the visuals, especially at the beginning, were breathtaking. The songs and the score are lovely, especially Growing Up and Forever Young, the latter was always my personal favorite of the two. The kids bears that I like are adorable, and the human kids are also well done. And the end is a real tear-hunter. All in all harmless fun for kids. Bethany Cox
