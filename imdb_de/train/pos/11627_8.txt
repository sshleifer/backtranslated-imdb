Lisa is a hotel manager or owner and flies to Miami. In the end, she sits next to an assassin named Jackson, who tells her to change a family room or that her father dies. The reason she has to change the room is because Jackson wants to blow it up. <br /> <br /> It's a great suspense movie as Lisa tries different ways to escape the trick Jackson set up. The whole story is great and I thought that they could spend some more time on the plane. There could have been more for the plane, but otherwise the whole movie was pretty good. <br /> <br /> I really liked the end because it was really heartbreaking. I did not know what would happen and I was surprised. For me, this movie just started.
