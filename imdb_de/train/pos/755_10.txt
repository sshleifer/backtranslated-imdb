Dirty Sanchez is the more extreme British version of Jackass, in which the four boys (Pritchard, Dainton, Joycey and Pancho) do everything they can to hurt and humiliate each other. The reason this show is better than Jackass is because most stunts are not planned, which makes the reaction much funnier. There are 3 series of the show, the first follows them and looks long into their lives, eg. There is an episode about her love life, her job, etc. The second series sends the boys to try different professions. The third follows her European tour. It seems the guys are getting bolder as the series progresses. In my opinion, the third series is the best, but trust me when I say if you have a week belly, DO NOT NOTE, as you will easily see a lot of blood and puke in each episode.
