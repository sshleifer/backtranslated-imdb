This film was not only one of John Ford's personal favorites, but also included the directors Sergei M. Eisenstein and Bertrand Tavernier among his top-class admirers. Ironically, I've just caught up with Criterion's recently released 2-disc set after missing it on Italian television many years ago and a few times on television while in Hollywood. <br /> <br /> The film described Ford as the first of nine collaborations with Henry Fonda and is also a typical example of the popular Americana vein of Ford. A beautifully done and visually quite poetic work, the sequences (and the eventual Revelation) of the courtroom in the second half are still a real eye-catcher aside from giving the distinctive character actor Donald Meek a remarkably meaty role as a prosecutor. <br /> Fonda is, of course, perfect as a shy, inexperienced, but strict and humanistic lawyer who was appointed president. Fonda would then portray other fictional politicians in films - especially in THE BEST MAN (1964) by Franklin J. Schaffner and FAIL-SAFE (1964) by Sidney Lumet - and it is surprising that at that time he was reluctant to accept the Role of Lincoln, because in his opinion, this was "how to play God"! <br /> <br /> It is interesting to note that Ford attacked Abraham Lincoln in 1967 (tangentially) in THE PRISONER OF SHARK ISLAND (1936), a great, but perhaps little-known, gem that was fortunately just released Special edition DVD of the British Criterion-Stand-In, the label "Masters Of Cinema" by Eureka. I also have two more Abraham Lincoln movies in my DVD collection, which I still have to watch. By the way, both were directed by DW Griffith - THE BIRTH OF A NATION (1915) and ABRAHAM LINCOLN (1930) - Not only have I received a number of films that I have never seen before, I would have liked to give them a spin based on that on my very satisfying viewing experience with YOUNG MR. LINCOLN.
