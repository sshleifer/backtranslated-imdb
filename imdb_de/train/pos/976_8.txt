Takashi Miike's intruder into Kinderland almost immediately convinced me because he shows nerves and bravery in dealing with fantasy elements. This is a fairy tale that dares to be dark. Even as a child, I thought that most fairy tales have something sinister about them; In most children's books, terrible things happen to people. Miike understands that these classic stories are a bit scary (and more disturbing) than they seem at first glance. The filmmaker brings the archetypal story of a child on a wondrous quest from the kindergarten classroom. He emphasizes the very real fears of a world with endless dangerous missions. Westerners may downplay the gravity of bedtime stories written especially for children. I appreciated the fact that Miike was more honest than most American filmmakers. He talks about the history of history, but also shows signs of restraint. But a self-obsessed Miike is still stranger than most filmmakers. I thought it was a great movie. Highly recommended.
