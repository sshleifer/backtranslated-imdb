Nice character development in a pretty cool environment. As a man, I'm probably not qualified to fully understand it, but they manage to create the restrictive Victorian environment from the start. It is not as bleak as it really was and the treatment of women was probably even rougher. What makes this up is a wonderful chemistry among the main characters. Everyone has their own "thing" to compete with. As soon as they come out of the rain and break out of the spider webs, they begin to interact and slowly lose the feeling of suspicion. What I liked about this movie is that it is not meant for cheap comedy if it had. It did not try to teach a lesson in us. The people who appear absolutely without merit are really well-developed people who see the light. I had some problems with the character of Alfred Molina having such an epiphany so quickly, but within that world it had to happen. All-round good with something positive in the lives of some pretty good people.
