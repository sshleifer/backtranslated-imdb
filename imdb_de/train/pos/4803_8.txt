It's hard to find a very bad historical drama based on the lives of any number of British monarchs. Just take a respected British or Australian actor, make things look pretty, and you're guaranteed to be a formula for Oscar success. <br /> <br /> The Young Victoria is no exception and beautiful, with soft lights and rich colors and fabrics. Emily Blunt plays a role in a role in which she can finally fly. The film opens with Victoria's 18-year-old birthday and goes through the intrigues and themes that surround her later rise to the throne and her famous marriage to Prince Albert (Rupert Friend). As the young Victoria herself complains, she has moved like a chess game at various parties when she feels like one of the most influential British rulers and voices. <br /> <br /> While moving around the chessboard is a fairly typical area, it's the development of Victoria's relationship with Albert that makes the movie a little more interesting. I admit: I have a degree in history with a specialization in the Victorian era, so I'm a little attached to these characters. Despite their many shortcomings as rulers, Victoria and Albert were among the first leaders committed to improving the civilization of their people. They left their heritage in the arts, health and education, as well as in Victoria's conservative views and funeral culture after Albert's death. But these things are only briefly indicated in the film. <br /> <br /> It is well known that Victoria and Albert were not only madly in love, but respected each other, which is not usually seen between monarchs in arranged marriages. Even if it happened behind the scenes, it was certainly one of the best known. Blunt and and Friend have just the right kind of chemistry to do justice to the famous couple, the right mix of restraint and despair. It's another love that's not usually shown on screen, especially in this kind of movie. It is encouraging to finally see a relationship in which man and woman are equal. <br /> <br /> But we can not see this love enough. While the filmmakers try to put the matter under political traps, this does not increase the momentum needed to sustain the tension. Without focusing on the couple's more advanced, important public work, things feel a bit dizzy, superficial rather than intimate and sometimes confusing. It's not such a big problem during the movie, but afterwards the effects gradually drop and you try to remember what you've just seen, despite the perfect performances of the leads, most notably blunt, which even expresses the famous Monarchs captures. <br /> <br /> As much as it is tried, Victoria Victoria succeeds on many levels, but they lack a certain sparkle that would make them from solid to classic.
