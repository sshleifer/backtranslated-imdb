Tirelessly grim and depressing, the film awakens the legendary misery and emptiness that characterize Houellebecq's controversial novel of the same name. As with many French films, their style is wistful depth, but it is painfully slow - or should that be painful? Although this is an excellent and challenging movie, it is not enjoyable and it is difficult to think of a time when you might be in the "right" mood to see it.
