By chance, in the same year that Jimmy Stewart and Kim Novak made Alfred Hitchcock's haunting masterpiece "Vertigo," this easy comedy was born. Maybe the two actors had to do it after undergoing the hitchcock film's harshness. Anyway, this is a great companion piece to "Vertigo", as it explores again a very unlikely but powerful romance. In fact, the movie can be seen as the flip side of "Vertigo" with its happy ending. Here, Novak goes through another transformation, in Vertigo she essentially plays two women, and here she 'transforms' from witch to mortal. Stewart is enchanted again and tormented for a while by his love for her. Unlike Vertigo, the two come together in "Bell Book and Candle," a perfect antidote to the hitcock movie. Again, the dynamics of love and attraction are explored, but in a completely different direction. The cast is great. Lemmon hilarious as Novak's sorcerer and Elsa Lancaster as the classic auntie as aunt. Ernie Kovacs as an alcoholic and writer and of course Hermoine Gingold, who plays Novak's rivals, are all great. The scene in which Stewart drinks the potion is the finest of comedies. Anyone who has seen Vertigo or not should see this memorable easy comedy.
