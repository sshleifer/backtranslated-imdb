Another excellent Arnold movie. This futuristic movie offers great action and is one of Arnie's best films. Arnold is framed in this movie as a villain and plays a Game of Death. This movie is excellent and a great sci-fi / action movie. I've always liked this movie and it has to be one of the greatest adventure movies of all time. 10 out of 10! PERFECTION
