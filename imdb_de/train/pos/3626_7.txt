These efforts are based on the true story of Jim Morris, a high school science / baseball science teacher, who is inspired by his players to try for pros and fulfill their lifelong dream of the majors. Dennis Quaid, not a stranger to sports, plays Morris with enough conviction to make the role successful, and the producers do a credible job recreating the real-world events that led to Morris' brief stint as relief relief for the devilish Tampa Bay Devil Rays led. The first half of the movie, which is about his rag-tag pile of high school baseball players (all looking too old to actually be in high school), is less effective and probably a bit too long. Overall, the film has some speed issues and some additional subplots that we could probably do without. However, it's still a pretty engaging movie with an inspiring theme that proves once again that baseball is, for a reason, the national pastime. NOTE B-
