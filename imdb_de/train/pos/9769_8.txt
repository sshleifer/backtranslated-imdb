I enjoyed it. In general, I'm not a fan of comedies and comedians, but I like Whoopi. I'm also part of Sci / Fi Fantasy. And the dinosaurs enthusiasm. I read for pleasure, but when I feel overused or really crazy, I watch TV and movies to escape. Theodore Rex made it possible for me. That makes it a success in my eyes! I did not even go away to do something else while it was running. Whether it was rated "good" or not does not matter to me. And no, I'm not a teenager. I'm not an idiot either.
