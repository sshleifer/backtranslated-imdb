One of the last great musicals of the 60s. I was 7 years old when I saw this movie for the first time, and since then it has always been a favorite. The musical numbers are all memorable. In the '60s, people cast in musicals actually had musical talent (as opposed to a CERTAIN Academy Award, which nominated the current musical in a large Midwestern city). All the main roles were beautifully taken ... Ron Moody shines as Fagin, as does Shani Wallis as Nancy. Oliver Reed was a menacing Bill Sikes (who fortunately has no music, lol) and Mark Lester as Oliver and Jack Wild as Dodger were great too. Mark Lester looks like an innocent Waif, as Dickens intended when he wrote the book! Then, of course, there are dozens of dancers who are in "think for yourself," "I would do anything," "who will buy," and "be back soon," many who were children! This is a great show for the whole family.
