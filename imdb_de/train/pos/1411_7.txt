Greetings from the darkness. Stunning photography highlights this Disney documentary and gives an insight into the harshness of animals that live in the wild. For all over 40s, Disney and Mutual of Omaha's Wild Kingdom have provided many insights into wild animals since our childhood ... back when there was no channel for National Geographic or Nature or Animal Planet. <br /> <br /> Whatever the intriguing circumstances are for many of these majestic creatures. Seeing the elephants tramping for days, almost insane from lack of water, is so painful. Their nightly fight against the lions, however, is exciting. <br /> <br /> Some underwater shots are breathless. The humps of the mother and baby are beautiful and it is as frightening as "Jaws" when the white shark is attacked. The most amazing landscape for me was the breathtaking view of the Himalayas. I had never seen such a detail from the breadth of the range. <br /> <br /> I do not think most young kids today are going to be too excited, but it's certainly one of the best-photographed documentary films I've ever seen.
