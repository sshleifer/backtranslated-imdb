I've only seen this movie once 25 years ago, and to this day I've always said it's probably the best movie I've ever seen. Given the fact that there was no verbal dialogue and only a thought dialogue, I found the film intriguing and even held my breath to produce no sound. I would highly recommend this movie, I wish it were available on DVD.
