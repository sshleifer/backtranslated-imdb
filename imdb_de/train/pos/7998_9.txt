I loved this movie. I am Mexican and least offended. I think this movie should be shown in the police all over Mexico. It is a sad truth that our police system is as corrupt as a 3-month-old corpse. It annoys me to read in the news as killers, kidnappers and other slime get rid of by paying a ridiculous fine or how kings live in jail cells. We should have someone like Creasy, Denzel Washington's character. A bodyguard became revengeful revenge. Abduction flourishes here in the industry (at least in the big cities). I really wish that kidnappers in real life could suffer the same fate as Creasy, who did his job. That would be so wonderful (sorry, I'm so annoying!). MAN ON FIRE is a gripping movie that you should not miss. For some of you, it may be hard if you're not used to reading subtitles (Mexicans do it all the time while watching American movies), but it's well worth the effort. Part of the editing is a little out of focus ... somehow like TRAFFIC, remember? (Another brilliant attitude on how corrupt Mexico is). The movie starts a bit slow, but the tempo gets hectic in the second half. I swear to you that you will cheer as you watch Denzel Washington send the wrong doers. His performance is just excellent. The end (no spoilers, OK !!!) is a bit sad, but I'm sure you'll like it anyway. MAN ON FIRE is one of the best films of the year. A "must" for a DVD collection! 9 out of 10
