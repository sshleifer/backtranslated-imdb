I was one of the best political satire I've seen so far, with an outstanding performance for Cusak, Tomei and all supporting actors. <br /> <br /> Excellent plot, very well placed and a very good result in the end. The action scenes were well shot and choreographed. Very funny. <br /> <br /> All in all, I give this movie a big thumbs up. It is extremely critical of US military intervention in the Middle East and can therefore receive poor ratings from people who do not share the same political view, or from those who are too politically ignorant to appreciate the dark and hip humor. In some places the comedy was so close to the truth that it was on the borderline between funny and tragic.
