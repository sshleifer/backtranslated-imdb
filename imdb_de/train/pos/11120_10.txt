Impressive. I loved the whole series, and I'm shocked by the comments of people who thought they had a bad ending. Maybe it has eased a bit in the 4th and 5th seasons, while it stays on TV better than anything else. But 6 and above all 6b were nice implementations to the themes that were developed in the first three seasons. <br /> <br /> 6B began with such a gloomy mood and Janice's always keen insight into the fear of the family - that fateful line about knowing Tony's penchant for sitting and staring. Anyone who missed the episodes for the rest of the series does not know Tony. Melfi's discomfort with the psychiatric study and its allusions to the self-deceptive sentimentality of the sociopath for pets and animals goes back to the first episodes of the series, such as Tony's panic attack over the ducks leaving his pool, and resonates with Phil's Wave Bye. Goodbye to his grandchildren before the coup de grace of the last episode (not to get into Chase's dark humor). <br /> <br /> I could go on, but I just add that I thought that was a closing show - starting with the Opening tribes of Vanilla Fudge, to convey the ironic remarks ("You Keep Me Hangin 'On") of the endless moments in which Tony disappears with his family in tow or how AJs SUV or Phil's head diverge were absolutely PERFECT Times <br /> <br /> Pretty good in a dying medium that pathologically mocks the "Jack-Off-Fantasies" AJ (and then into which he pro mpt decreases). A tip from the pork pie to Mr. Chase.
