When I was told about this movie, I thought it would be another chick movie. I was wrong. This movie sends a strong message about judging others. I was deeply moved Everyone I met, I recommended this movie. Nobody came back and said it was bad. Busy, has also done a great job with her role in this film. I do not know much about her acting career, but it was great how she ended the end of this filling. But after she went to the hospital ... wow, the movie picks up again. I have no idea why this film was not addressed in the film world. I wish that this movie would be re-released and more advertised ... because it sends a strong message in just one and a half hours.
