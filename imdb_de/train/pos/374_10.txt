Rating "10/10" Masterpiece <br /> <br /> Several years ago I heard Spielberg's comment that he would repeat the film here and there, if he had a chance. Well, Mr. Spielberg, I think nothing is perfect, but this movie - along with Schindler's list - is your best movie. Even Oprah is good in this case! <br /> <br /> What impressed me most is the realism of the story and the drama. This has happened and is still happening in the world.
