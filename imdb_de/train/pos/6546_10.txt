I'm probably one of the biggest Nancy Drew fans. I have read each book three times and played many Nancy Draw games. I loved this movie. It kept you entertained all the time when you saw it. I was with about 10 of my friends and everyone loved it. Behind us sat three women, who seemed to be in their late thirties or early thirties, and I asked them how they liked it. So you see, it will be a conversation for all ages. You just have to give it a chance. And there is also a lesson: just be yourself, even though everyone around you is exactly the same. Overall, this step was great. I will see it a second time now! So stop beating it. It's a really good movie!
