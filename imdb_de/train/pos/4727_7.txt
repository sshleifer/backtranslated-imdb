I was pleasantly surprised that I liked this movie very much. Funny writing (some "inside" jokes I got, others I did not do - maybe because actors talked to each other), great acting (especially John Cassini), great cameos, interesting and unique directing I rented it, to see Jeffrey Meek (very disappointed that he was so brief, blinking and you'll miss him!), but found the movie remarkably entertaining. I'll actually take another look at it before sending it back to Netflix. I think actors and wannabe actors will really enjoy this movie. The end is a bit anticipated, but I wish they had done something different (and more positive). It is a pity that the film was only recorded better on the "festival" market. I recommend it to anyone who loves the acting business.
