"Cinderella" is one of Disney's most popular classics. And it really deserves its status. Based on the classic fairy tale, as told by Charles Perrault, the film follows the trials and tribulations of Cinderella, a good girl mistreated by his evil stepmother and equally unlikely stepsisters. When a royal ball is held and all eligible young women are invited (read: The king wants the prince to marry), Cinderella is left at home while her stepmother takes her horrible daughters with her. But there's a fairy godmother ... <br /> <br /> The story of "Cinderella" alone would not be able to fill out any feature, so the story otherwise remains otherwise fairly random characters of the animals with which the Fairy Godmother is present helps bring the title character to the ball, become Cinderella's real cronies. The mice Jaq and Gus are the most important cronies, and her own nemesis is the stepmother Lucifer. Their antics are generally intertwined with the main fairy tale plot and are wonderful for the most part. Although the movie slows down slightly between the character's main launch and just before the stepsisters go to the ball, the movie surprisingly picks up again after this slowdown (since "Cinderella" is the most run-down story of all time, probably) ends up being one of the most involved Disney stories. <br /> <br /> The animation and the artistic orientation are lovely. All of the legendary Nine Old Men were animated in this image and Mary Blair's color styling and conceptual art (she also did conceptual art and color styling for "Alice in Wonderland", "Peter Pan", "The Three Caballeros" and many others) manage to get on to move the screen. The colors and designs are especially appealing in the Fairy Godmother and Ball scenes as well as in these little and small moments. <br /> <br /> All in all, "Cinderella" is one of the best Disney fairies. Stories and comes for young people and everything that embodies the Disney philosophy that dreams can truly accomplish.
