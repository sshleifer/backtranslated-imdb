Certainly one of the most beautiful films I have seen for some time. Exquisite directing and flawless acting make this movie a very entertaining and often moving movie. Denzel Washington is still playing one of his most engaging and emotional roles, and the rest of the cast is outstanding. Christopher Walken is of course great in his role, though he did not appear as often as I would have liked. A story of the ultimate greed that backfires is balanced against the innocence and love of a child. This is also a movie for action movie lovers as it has a relatively high percentage of bullets, missiles and revenge. The location of Mexico City feels sour and corrupt, which in itself is an eye-opener. All in all a really exciting movie from start to finish. Highly recommended!
