Marlene Gorris has established herself as one of the great directors of the world. This sensitive, visually beautiful film is based on a story by Vladimir Nabokov and captures the dark irony of this writer well. John Turturro gives what I think is his best performance (I'm not usually a fan of him); and Emily Watson is also brilliant. Worth seeing.
