Idiotic hack rogue, a baby, a safe, a plan, and a baby. Add them all and you'll get the best comedy you've never heard of. <br /> <br /> Even with an A-list starpower (at least a-minus ... ok, b-plus?), this movie has gotten very little publicity not to belittle its genius. <br /> <br /> Great writing, solid delivery and a believable set of characters. Some really classic lines and a funny twist in the end. <br /> <br /> This is not a diluted "Nutty Professor" comedy. These are bad guys with little life. They speak bad villain and they make evil. But they do it for your entertainment and entertainment, and they do it well. <br /> <br /> One of the best comedies I have ever seen.
