This film was directed by Victor Nunez, who also wrote the screenplay (Ulee's Gold). Nice and uncomplicated writing that was nominated for the Independent Spirit Award and Ruby considered in everyday life. What we see is part of the life of young Ruby. Ashley Judd (Sisters) won the Independent Spirit Award for best female lead role in this role. Ruby begins to live alone and establish her own identity. She researches jobs, friendships, young friends, sex and a typical search of young adults. The film won the Grand Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival. As an independent movie lover, I chose the movie for Sundance. I appreciate this kind of movie because it does not carry the Hollywood luggage. <br /> <br /> Although the stories are completely different, it reminded me of Nobody's Fool, Paul Newman. The later film is an excerpt from the everyday life of a simple man. I like it. The story is told very nicely and we just had to sit and enjoy the story. The only thing I'm not sure about is the title. I am sure that there are not so many beetles and in paradise as in Florida. Since I'm allergic to mosquitoes, Florida is not a paradise for me. I itch everywhere when I think of Florida. I transform into a totally red blood. I recommend this movie! Favorite Scenes: Ruby and her friend Rochelle Bridges, played by Allison Dean while walking on the beach in Panama City, Florida. In fact, the sand is very white. I was there. Favorite Quotes: "Need has always been a good excuse." "All the excitement of finding a man is no different now, who will, when and why." <br /> <br />
