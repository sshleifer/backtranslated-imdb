I saw this movie at the Palm Springs International Festival in 2005, and of the 14 films I've seen there, I would rank 4th. The 900+ theater was full and in the end it received a standing ovation. This was the classic Peter Falk, if you are a Falk fan and have shown a lot of chemistry between the characters of Peter Falk and Paul Reiser. The title of the movie seemed too long and too weird. I am surprised that it did not come to the general publication. This was far better than the majority of the garbage the big studios throw at you. Maybe too grown-up as it was geared towards the baby boomer and the older crowd. Many people could relate to situations in this film. There will probably be a revival of years when people look back on this film and see it as a kind of jewel. I would rate this 8.0 to 8.5 on a scale of 10 and definitely recommend it.
