This film is not a hit despite the lo-fi production and the connection to the Troma productions. A dark fable for adults. Exploitation is a topic of sugar biscuits, and one wonders if the performers do not belong to this topic. A funny movie with seductive visuals: shadows and contrast are prominent. Definitely worth a look, especially by fans of Warhol and stylish decadence. Through all the cruelty and wickedness, a moral, if twisted, can shine.
