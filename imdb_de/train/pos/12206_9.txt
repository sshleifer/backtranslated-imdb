Of all the film noirs of the 1940s and 1950s, this is considered to be one of the strangest and most fun. I say that because of the four main characters: Orson Welles, Rita Hayworth, Everett Sloane and Glenn Anders. <br /> <br /> The first two names are familiar to everyone, but it was the last two who made this movie so interesting for me, especially Anders. His character "George Grisby" is one of the strangest people I've ever seen in the movie. His voice and some of the things he said must be heard to be believed. Slaone is not far behind in the "strange" category. Hayworth is not so glamorous with short blond hair, but still Hayworth, which means a lot if you're a guy. Welles is as fascinating as ever. A tip: If you have the DVD, turn on the English subtitles. His character in this movie is an Irishman, and you need subtitles to understand everything he says. <br /> <br /> Welles directed the movie as well, which means you have great camera angles and wonderful close-ups. You also have a unique ending with a shootout in a mirror house. Great stuff! As bizarre as this movie may be, I still thought the buffoon-like carnival atmosphere at the end of the process was too much and took the seriousness of the scene. Apart from that no complaints. <br /> <br /> This is great entertainment, as the name of the game is.
