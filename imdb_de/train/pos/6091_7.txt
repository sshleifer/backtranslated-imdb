As with Ishtar and King of Comedy, other great misunderstood comedies, Envy has great performances by two actors who essentially play losers (possibly too harsh a word, I'll call them Suburban Under-Achievers) This movie was a dark comedy and I'm not sure what people expect. I like watching a big studio comedy that's not filled with obvious humor, and I think the little moments in this movie are worth it. The expression on Stiller's face as he sees the dog disappear for the first time captures a moment, a moment most people can recognize in themselves. Yes, it was a pretty simple story, but she investigated the root of envy in a really interesting way. There were a lot of great scenes (J-Man's decrepit "Lakeside Cottage", Corky's funeral funeral, the role of Weitz's wife, and Walken's J-Man - all great stuff. <br /> <br /> I know people who engage in IMDb and mercilessly throw away movies if they have absolutely no idea what it takes to make a movie I will consider Envy to be almost all of the ten best comedies of the year (except Napoleon Dynamite), and an unusual, enjoyable gem. <br /> <br /> Remember this people: Popular is not always good.
