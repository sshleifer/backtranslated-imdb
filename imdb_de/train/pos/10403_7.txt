This is an oriental fantasy about "One Thousand and One Arabian Nights" - many incredible adventures, fantasy witchcraft and magic art. The vicious vizier Jaffar (magnificently played by Conrad Veidt) with powerful magical abilities locks the prince Ahamad of Baghdad (attractive John Justin), who loses his throne, and escapes thanks to a small thief named Abu (sympathetic Sabu). You arrive in Basora, where Ahamad and the Princess (the beautiful June Duprez) fall in love. But Prince and Thief are persecuted by Jaffar, Ahamd becomes blind and Abu becomes a dog. The story collects some fantastic ingredients such as the transformation of the main characters, a flying mechanic horse, a magic bow, a flying carpet and of course the colossal genius (overacting, performed by Rex Ingram), the Sabu, the magical eye, the figurine three wishes goddess Kali with several hands, among others. <br /> <br /> This remarkable image is considered one of the most beautiful fantastic films of all time. Produced by London Fims Alexander Korda and director of the definitely credited Ludwing Berger, Michael Powell and Tim Whelan with an impressive script by Lajos Biro and Miles Malleson, who also lead a dialogue as author of the sultan and mechanic. The outbreak of World War II caused the crippling shooting. Then the three brothers and co-workers of Korda traveled to the USA, where filming continued in particular in Grand Cannon Colorado. Menzies and Vincent Korda, the cinematography of George Perinal and the special effects of Osmond Borradaile are now obsolete and in desperate need of color worn out. In addition, a nomination for the atmospheric and oriental music by Miklos Rozsa. This vibrant story with an immense amount of fantasy will appeal to fantasy fans and movie classics
