"It's all up to you, Ed?" "Now you can play the game." On the day my dad left my mother, he took me along with his new girlfriend on the opening day at the Cinerama Dome in Hollywood. I was only fourteen years old. I was not even sure what I saw, but I'll never forget it, especially the scene with Ned Beatty. <br /> <br /> When I see it today, thirty-six years later, I still have quivers. <br /> <br /> My dad was a big fan of Burt Reynolds. That's why I had been queuing for almost an hour to watch an action movie. I had previously seen two films in the dome: "Grand Prix" and "The Song of Norway". Well, that was not exactly Mario Andretti or The Brady Bunch. After leaving the theater, I was shocked. <br /> <br /> But even at this tender age, I appreciated the artistry ... and when I met again today, I was amazed that I was still standing after watching that disturbing, but extremely well-made film. <br /> <br /> Suffice to say, it was a traumatic experience for a fourteen-year-old who had not kissed his first girlfriend yet. I do not blame my dad for taking me, but for a child, the testimony was a bit. <br /> <br /> As an adult, I still find it quite disturbing, but I'm still very impressed with the quality of the film. <br /> <br /> Burt Reynolds as an absolute miracle, like all the principles ... from Billy Redden as an inbreeding guitar prodigy to Ronny Cox as a frightened insurance agent ... Everyone does an admirable job. The sound quality is second to none, from the twittering birds to the ticking clocks. The photography, the cinematography ... all the technical aspects of this remarkable film are first class. <br /> <br /> The moral issues, from the murder of sexual perpetrators to the consequences of the death of a human being, remain profound today as they did when this trailblazing film was released. And the classic sequences of wilderness survival after such unanticipated brutality change lives. These four men, city dwellers who have suddenly been confronted with a situation they can never imagine, set the bar from action to horror. <br /> <br /> It's a classic, to be sure. And the phrase "you have a nice mouth" has been endlessly quoted, from Saturday Night Live to straightforward comments around water coolers at work. This film is undoubtedly a big part of our social pop culture ... as much as "Make my day" or "I'm be back". <br /> <br /> What would you do if you attacked your friends with guns from miners who are far from your life? In the city, cozy bed, wife and children? And if you took the action that Burt Reynolds took (and I did), would you bury the body under the soon-to-be-seen lake or stand trial and seize your chances? The bottom line is: delivery delivers. You can bring this to the bank. If this film does not get under your skin, you are not human. <br /> <br /> Even if you have already seen this, rent it again and ask yourself the question above. <br /> <br /> My favorite part of the movie is still the same: Ed can not kill the stag ... and then shifts. Life and its unpredictable circumstances can change a man. I think that's what this movie is all about, especially because Ed shows the best performance here. And he remains one of the more gifted actors in Hollywood's history, from Midnight Cowboy to his highly underrated performance as Franklin D. Roosevelt at Pearl Harbor. His acting takes the film to another level. Climb the rocks at dusk, scared and determined to do it right It has to be seen to be believed. I guarantee that your heart rate will be raised to a new level. <br /> <br /> Dynamic, tense, tight and taut like a banjo string. This is a morality game that asks questions that still exist today. Times have changed, but our choices as humans are not. <br /> <br /> Ten out of ten stars.
