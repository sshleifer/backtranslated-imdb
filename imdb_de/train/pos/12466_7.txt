When Jean Renoir's first film "Whirlpool of Fate" first introduces us to the landscape of the countryside, the rivers and the life of the peasantry that he will continue to explore, it seems only fitting that his second film be largely with the wealthy and privileged, the upper classes and those who are trying to fight their way up. Put together the characters from the first two films and you have the germ of his great "Grand Illusion" and "Rules of the Game". This movie is filmed beautifully. The restless camera uses the amazingly large apartments and backstage areas that dominate the interior of the film, and acting, though often overused, offers some great moments, especially from Muffat by Werner Krauss. But the glamorous and sultry Ms. Hessling, who at first looks like she's arguing with Louise Brooks for her money in vampishness, never goes beyond a self-serving whoring. Maybe this is partly a problem with the script, which seems to be mostly for high scores and outraged emotions. Since I did not read the novel, I do not really know if the decisions were good or not. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, the differences between Nana's followers are well-marked, and I particularly liked the relationship between Muffat and Jean Angelo's Vandeuvres - the tragic understanding that everyone seems to have of his ultimate destiny and compassion, especially in the scene at the bottom of the huge staircase where Vandeuvres warns Muffat, and we wonder if violence will break out. These and other insights about the ridiculousness of idle richness give the film the depth it has. <br /> <br /> Far from his greatest achievement, and probably just shy of what I call "Whirlpool of Fate," still worth watching for Renoir fans or generally for the silent cinema.
