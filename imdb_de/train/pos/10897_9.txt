What would you expect from a movie entitled "Surviving Christmas" and presented as "festive fun", such as Ghandi or an English patient? There are many things I love about this movie, it is funny, it is very well staffed and it is excellently written. I came to the film as a Kaplan / Elfort fan, but was questionable when I read the story, it sounded ridiculous. But the movie does not happen because Affleck (as Drew Latham) plays his role perfectly, one minute as a childlike adult, the next a mature man who realizes he has won everything in life from what he really wants , In fact, we see Latham growing up in this movie as he bumps into the problems of those he envies, realizing that her life is not so good, he sees that his own lot is not that bad. <br /> <br /> This movie has less faint scenes than many other comedies I have seen. Comedy is so much harder than any other kind of drama, it either works or it does not work and few comedy writers correct it every time. I was particularly excited about the drama scene where the family reads the parts written by Latham. The pleasure lies in the reaction of Tom Valco (James Gandolfini) and the comments of Brian Valco (Josh Zuckerman). It's the dilemma of greedy Tom Valco, who has to bite his tongue, wear silly hats, or sing in front of the Christmas tree to earn the prize money that makes the movie well. <br /> <br /> The addition of daughter Alicia (Christina Applegate) to the story brings a delightful romantic perspective, and why not in a Christmas movie? Of course it is hackneyed and invented; He is rich and handsome, she is beautiful and single and so she and her affect inevitably fall into the snow and see each other face to face. Great! I would have liked more festive music to be used to enhance the atmosphere, but I can not really complain. I got what I wanted.
