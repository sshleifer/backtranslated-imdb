Henry Thomas was "great". His character held my attention. I was so excited about the story that I forgot it was not real. I wanted him to keep the baby and see what a special person it was. The other persons in the story were essential to the composition of his character. The way they banded together to help each other was really impressive. I love movies that show the real side of human emotions without being knocked over your head because you're not smart enough to figure things out for yourself.
