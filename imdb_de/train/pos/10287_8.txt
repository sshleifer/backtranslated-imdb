This is one of those films for which they have advertised too much. If you watch TV, you can not see the movie as well. Almost all the funny scenes are spoiled in the preview images, with the exception that Jennifer Annisten happens to be the funny one. It's typical Jim Carrey humor and it's really funny. Do not visit this movie and expect to be surprised. All in all, if you like Jim Carrey or comedies, this is a must, otherwise just look at the previews and you will be just as satisfied.
