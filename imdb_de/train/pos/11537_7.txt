Neil Simon had a knack for dialogue and nowhere is this more obvious than the lines he gives to WALTER MATTHAU and JACK LEMMON as opponents in THE ODD COUPLE - a mixture of comedy and sadness that completely depends on the credibility of two such inappropriate friends An apartment , <br /> <br /> Lemmon is a Neatnik Felix Ungar, who tends to commit suicide after divorcing his wife and reluctantly agrees to share an apartment with Oscar Madison (Matthau), with catastrophic consequences. It seems that everything Felix says and does pushes Oscar to the wall and nobody can stand the other way, with Oscar being the messiest man and Felix the exact opposite. <br /> <br /> The funniest scene for me was the giggling pigeons sisters in the apartment upstairs visiting them for a dinner. The priceless interaction between Lemmon, Matthau and Carole Shelley and Monica Evans is enough to kill you. The talented Pigeon sisters are the women who played the voices for the Gabble sisters (a pair of geese) in Disney's THE ARISTOCATS, and here - their comic timing in addition to Lemmons sad story of despair is enough to make the movie in Merriment. If it's a Neil Simon fan and has enjoyed other screen treatments of his work, this one is unmissable. Matthau and Lemmon are perfectly cast (though they've considered switching roles before the filming starts), and of course it's clear why they later became a top-notch TV show. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: Top Simon comedy, not to be missed.
