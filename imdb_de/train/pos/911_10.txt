VIVAH is, in my opinion, the best movie of the year 2006 and comes from a director who has proven successful throughout his career. I'm not particularly fond of romantic films these days because I see them as "old wine in a new bottle" and so predictable. However, I've seen this movie three times already ... and believe me, it's a great movie. <br /> <br /> VIVAH returns to the traditional route, showing simple characters in a meaningful and realistic story of the journey between engagement and marriage. The film entertains in all its ways, because it reflects in what we do (or would do) in marriage. In this sense, Sooraj R. Barjatya has done well his homework and presented a very realistic story to a well-made, very entertaining film. <br /> <br /> Several sequences in this film immediately arouse your interest: <br /> <br /> * When Shahid Kapoor visits the bride (Amrita Rao), he tries to look at her, without him and his family too obvious. The song 'Do Anjaane Ajnabi' fits well with the mood of this scene. <br /> <br /> * The first conversation between Shahid and Amrita when he visits her, ie a shy Shahid, who does not know exactly what to say about, but draw a decent conversation. Also Amrita's naive nature, limited eye contact, shy features, and a gentle response to Shahid's questions. <br /> <br /> * The emotional collapse of Amrita and her uncle (Alok Nath) as she feeds him in the form of Shahid's party by the daughter-in-law of another and not her uncle's beloved niece. <br /> <br /> The movie clearly belongs to Amrita Rao. The actress plays the role of Poonam with such conviction that you can not imagine anyone else replacing her. She looks beautiful throughout the movie and perfectly portrays an innocent and shy traditional girl. Shahid Kapoor also plays brilliantly. He delivers a promising performance and shows that he is no less than Salman Khan when it comes to acting in a Sooraj R. Barjatya movie. In fact, Shahid and Amrita make a sweet couple on the screen, no doubt. Other Characters - Alok Nath (Outstanding), Anupam Kher (Brilliant), Mohan Joshi (Very Good). <br /> <br /> On the whole, VIVAH delivers what it promises, a well-made and realistic story of two families. The film features world-class performances, an excellent story, and great music to suit the movie, and is led by the fabulous Sooraj R. Barjatya. You must have seen something like that!
