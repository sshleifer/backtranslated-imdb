Pushing Daisies is just a fairy tale with shades of Amelie's aesthetics and romance. It has a beautiful palette, its settings are thoughtful and detailed, its names and dialogues bizarre and too small to be true, its imagination is great and its romance deep. <br /> <br /> Watch the blue in the sky You look at each other, because in the remaining sets or shots blue (with a few exceptions) can not be found. <br /> <br /> Watch an unusually natural and totally satisfying song erupt from a scene. <br /> <br /> The music is great, the cast is very sympathetic, there is great music and the two leading romantic stars can not touch or they will die. How much more sexual tension do you need? (Actually I would have liked them to find a way, but that's all possible.) <br /> <br /> It's just a show that's a pleasure to spend an hour with, and me highly recommend it. There was no other television that would appeal so much and I would like to see more. It got me flu in a fucking week because it makes for good company. <br /> <br /> Bring it back!
