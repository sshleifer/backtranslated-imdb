SPOILERS <br /> <br /> One of my buddies said NEXT MOVIE was the best Cheech & Chong strip, and I did my best to lend myself and the BLUES BROTHERS. NEXT MOVIE has no plot, no tempo, really has nothing of what makes a movie ... but it's funny. And what's worth, Cheech and Chong show a heart. <br /> <br /> Well, in this little section that I put into the story, but since it's the fifth of the movie, nothing that normally starts a story happens. I'll just say Cheechs cousin shows up. <br /> <br /> Was not there another funny moment when Chong Cheech twice had the piss drink? What about the cock? Was this the first movie by Pee-Wee Herman? You would have to watch the movie yourself to enjoy it. I do not think NEXT MOVIE is strong enough to make it great, but the movie has heart and hey, my buddy lent it to me, so it gets a 7.
