A hot-headed police officer accidentally kills a murder suspect and covers up the crime. However, he has to deal with a guilty conscience while trying to solve a murder case. Andrews and Tierney are united with director Preminger in a film noir that is as effective as "Laura," their earlier collaboration. Andrews is perfectly staffed as a serious cop, a good man trapped in unfortunate circumstances. Acting is alright everywhere, including Malden as a tough police captain and Tully as Tierney's protective father. The screenplay by Hecht, a great and successful scriptwriter, is tense and exciting, and Preminger creates a great atmosphere.
