This is one of my absolute favorites. Great music and a few funny pieces. Every once in a while I laugh about Millie, the maid pretending to be a debutant, holding her delicious handkerchief while chatting and polishing furniture while chattering. I just can not get over their French accent of never being a problem as they try to pass it on as the boss's daughter. <br /> <br /> Seeing a youthful Mel Torme and the very young vocals of Frank Sinatra is such a pleasure. My mother saw Frank Sinatra in a theater around the same time this movie was released. She said that they could not eliminate the "bobby addicts" between the movies (these days you did not have to go between the screenings). This film shows you how attractive and appealing the young Frank was, and lets you appreciate his early talent. And Victor Borge has some of his routine, which is a bonus. <br /> <br /> This is a funny movie with a sweet, simple plot. Very pleasant.
