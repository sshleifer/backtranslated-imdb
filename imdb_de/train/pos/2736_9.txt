A unique movie ... one of the best ever. Acting, script, Quincy Jones' score, cinematography, editing etc. - just fantastic. As most viewers know, this film is based on Truman Capote's book on the famous murder of a Kansas farm family (the Clutters) by a few young men during a misguided robbery. I've never seen a movie that made such a brilliant story into a fascinating movie. <br /> <br /> The actors are solid across the board, but the focus is on the killers, Dick and Perry, and the law enforcement team that tracks them. Scott Wilson, since Dick Hickock is incredible. Over-studious, restless and without pity, he seems so charming, oily and plausible. Robert Blake as Perry Smith is extraordinary, lonely and yet empathetic and cold-blooded. Who could fold these qualities into one person and make us buy them? He does it and it's awesome! A key point of the book is how to use the intersection of these two very different sociopathic individuals to create the critical mass to commit such a stupid and heinous crime, and these two actors make it work wonderfully. Both had moments in their later careers, but these achievements are high-water brands, and that means acting time. <br /> <br /> The cops are also wonderful. The investigation leads John Forsythe, but the other three detectives are great. Unlike contemporary films, where producers find it necessary to provide the police with superhuman assets or weaknesses, these are merely real flatfeets that handle the case with determination and competence. They seem so real. I've never seen cops on the screen that are so authentic. and I have seen that most of the classics of crime go back. Really unique in this regard. <br /> <br /> PARTIAL SPOILER COMING (this movie is unique in that you already know what happened, but I warn you before taking it). <br /> <br /> The best scenes from the best crime shows and movies are, of course, the interrogations - the intellectual fencing games between the cops and the crooks, Mano a Mano. This movie contains the best interrogation scenes you'll ever see in the movie. Watch as Dick and Perry try to bluff their way through the area and slowly dissolve, unaware that the cops have the goods on it. But the cops must deftly prepare their suspects to break their alibis and hopefully confess. This is one of the best spectacles you will ever see. Think of Glengarry Glen Ross without show-boarding. <br /> <br /> To translate the sad and awful aspects of this true story, ICB was filmed in the actual Clutter House, and I've heard that clutters were played by film students to give them a real feel. It works out. This seems to be a decent, simple people. It makes crime so tangible and sad. <br /> <br /> I will stop here. It's not a feel-good movie, but it's one of the best movies ever made, and so unique is it's compulsory for any movie lover.
