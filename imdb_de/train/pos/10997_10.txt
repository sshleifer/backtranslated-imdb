IMPRESSIVE. One of the greatest movies I have ever seen - ever seen. <br /> <br /> Absolutely thrilled! Before the opening credits were ready, I was glued to the screen. <br /> <br /> It's a sci-fi thriller - AND Seating edge of Whodunnit. Incredible. <br /> <br /> I wish it would never end. <br /> <br /> Lucy Liu is a throwaway role. Everyone could have played it. The protagonist Jeremy Northram was the perfect geeky guy. <br /> <br /> This movie appeals to me who loved War Games, Sneakers and Track Down. <br /> <br /> Unbelievable! <br /> <br /> 8-22-06.
