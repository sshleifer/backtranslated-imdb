If you want to have a serious laugh pain, watch this movie and the things that Bruce inflicts on his comrade. The deleted scenes are priceless. I do not know why they were not included in the original movie. It can not be for time reasons, since the movie is only 101 minutes long. Morgan Freeman is a brilliant actor who has been overlooked for too long. Jim Carrey needs medication!
