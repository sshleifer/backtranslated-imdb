I'm not a very good writer, that's why I think so. World at War is the best documentary of World War II I've ever seen. I have seen several World War II documentary films (not just English / North Americans), and this documentation seems to be the most complete documentation of World War II I've seen. I think it might be a little bit more about the Great Depression and why / how Hitler came to power, but it's very good at covering the war. It seems to be complete and objective for everyone. It does not exaggerate or diminish the roles of different nations. It contains a lot of original material, including color material and many eyewitnesses (it was made in the 70's when a lot more lived). It has great music and narrators. All in all, I gave this 10/10 because it is so good. (I have not seen any specials in the DVD version, so I can not comment on them.)
