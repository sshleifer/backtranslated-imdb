This is really an incredible movie. It not only documents the eternal struggle of indigenous and disenfranchised people for their rightful voice, but also shows the United States for its dishonesty, subservience and obvious disregard for human rights and self-determination. Chavez is portrayed as a very brave and charismatic leader struggling against something that can only be described as a despicable elite that has no sense of proportion and justice. These filmmakers have recorded a coup that is different than before. <br /> <br /> And in the crosshairs we see the USA, which once again pull the strings and blur all reality. It is heartbreaking to watch the early stages of the uprising and to know that the subversion of democracy we have experienced is a tool that has long been used by successive American governments and their seemingly flashing citizens. The footage makes it clear that this is not a manipulation of television or generic footage, but an active documentary of a people and their government fighting for their future. Truly a moving experience for those who have a conscience. These Irish filmmakers deserve our gratitude. Long live Chavez. <br /> <br /> We must adhere to the idea that every country should be able to choose its government and develop in ways that the majority deem appropriate. The first phase in this process is the need to know the realities of the situation, and this documentary does just that.
