Apart from the fact that my list of the most popular filmmakers is: 1) Stanley Kubrick 2) God Allmighty 3) The rest ... This movie is actually better than the book (and the TV miniseries, although in light of the director an easy task is)). The flawless style of shooting, acting and (Kubrick's first-ever number one skill) music make her a masterpiece of horror. I watched the TV miniseries a few years ago and I liked the story, and I had my hope when I got it. IT'S BLOWING ME AWAY !!! It's a lot better than I ever imagined. It starts slowly (Kubrick trademark) and has many downtimes that build up the tension. The intro scene is definitely a classic, and I've seen it about 20 times, just because of the shearing atmosphere it sets off for the entire movie. Also, the movie does not offer much gore (just enough and is by no means distasteful), a trend I hate in the horror movies of the last few days. Just look at it!
