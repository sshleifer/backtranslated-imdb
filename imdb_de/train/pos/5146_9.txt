As someone born of a German mother and an English father (who spent five years in a POW camp), I come from a unique position. One had to deal with the various Nazis on one side of the family and the victors of World War II on the other. This mini-series can not immerse itself in every single part of Hitler's psyche and must give the viewer a general impression of the situation at the time and as well as possible, what Hitler's state of mind can do. In that sense, the series is pretty good. Carlyle is very good, just like O'Toole, but I'd like more information about relationships with other people in the party because Hitler did nothing himself. He had people around him who followed him to the letter, often without question, and certainly beyond question later in his murderous career. What went through Goebbels, Goering and Hess? It would have been helpful to see more of these relationships. But I hope that people will explore the subject more. It could also make people understand why someone like Saddam Hussein should not stay in power.
