Some of the background details of this story are very, very loosely based on real events of the era in which it was placed. The story combines some details of the famous Leopold and Loeb Falls with some of Aimee Semple McPherson. <br /> <br /> The story begins with two mothers (Shelley Winters and Debbie Reynolds) courtroom. The crowd seems very anxious to do them physical harm, as their sons have just been convicted of a heinous thrill crime. One person in the crowd apparently smashes Winters' hand as they leave for a waiting car. <br /> <br /> As soon as they arrive home, they receive threatening telephone calls. Reynolds proposes to move both to the West Driving together and opening a dance school. The dance school is a hit and it targets unbelievably disgusting parents who think their child is the next Shirley Temple. One of the parents of these spoiled children is a multimillionaire who is quite in love with Reynolds and goes out with him. Life seems to be very good. But when the threatening phone calls start again, Winters responds by flipping over - behaving as if she were approaching a psychotic break, and retreating into religion - almost constantly listening to "Sister Alma" on the radio. Again and again you see the winter in the outskirts and finally culminate in very bad things! I will not say more because it could spoil this exciting and interesting movie. <br /> <br /> In many ways, this movie resembles the horror movies of Bette Davis and Joan Crawford from the 1960s, like "Whatever Happened" to Baby Jane? "," Straight-Jacket "and" The Nanny "While none of them are really intellectual, it's very entertaining and fun at the kitsch level, the writing is very good and there are some nice twists in the end that make it all very exciting Winters is great as a fragile and denied lady, and Reynolds plays one of the sexiest 39-year-olds I've ever seen - and she really, really can dance. <br /> <br /> My only concern with all that is Some winters find hyper-religiousness in the film a bit cheesy - like a cheap attack on Christianity - at first I felt that way, but when you meet Sister Alma, it seems sincere and not mocked, so I only considered Winter's religious zeal as Signs of Madness - What I Assume, Anyway, What was Intended / By the way, this movie is out with "Whoever Slew Auntie Roo?" - another Shelley Winters horror movie the year 1971, packed. Both are great fun ... and are over the top!
