Considering the lack of art in African cinema (or Black American Cinema). The idea provides a multidimensional view of a community associated with hoods and merchants. But the funny thing is that here is not the focus or even the topic of the short films. But the unspoken claim of independence from these issues is most evident. The genre is unique and not the typical expectation. It's almost this descent that catches the eye first. So it's critical to see her twice. The film has an aesthetic quality that lends itself to the true art of cinema. <br /> <br /> And it is this true art that is extremely rare with an African voice. The film does not copy to reach its message, it invents and provokes by drawing subtle stereotypes (not racial but character-based stereotypes). It carries several messages that contain a very fast character development. Remember that this movie takes less than 10 minutes, and he manages to create a character very quickly. The use of color textures and music is also recommended. But considering the director, Owen Alik Shahadah's latest adventure 500 years later, music is expected. But from a thematic point of view, the idea seems to be a departure, but satire indirectly eludes a social problem.
