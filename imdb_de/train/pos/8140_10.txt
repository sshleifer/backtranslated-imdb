I saw this movie for the first time in a movie channel (HBO?) Some time ago. I was a fan of Public Enemy, NWA and other rap and had seen CB4 in theaters. Anyway, I noticed the promo and I wanted to see what it was about. Well, I knew right away that it would be alright (WARNING!) And I was right. The parody songs alone make this movie worth seeing (My Peanuts), but the overall flow and delivery of the movie was great. You must love the satire of rap groups (obviously NWA), certain rappers (Eazy E, Flava Flav, Ice Cube) and the humor of the three members of NWH. Who can forget that Tone scrapes Deaf with his ass? It's too bad that this film did not get the merit it deserves as CB4 was overshadowed in its releases, but in my opinion the movie is much better. If you know and like the gangster rap of the '90s, you'll be watching and laughing with this movie for a long time. If you do not like or dislike rap, enjoy the jokes at the expense of the genre.
