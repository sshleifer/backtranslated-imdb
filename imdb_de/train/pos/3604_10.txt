I think it's a great movie. because you can see how Diana's life is at home. She has become so aggressive and wants to prove that even girls can fight. I think she and Adrian were great actors. Because of this movie I am also boxing. It really impressed me. The only negative part I think. This is the end. because it's alright between Diana and Adrian. But you can not see how it is at home. And I did not really like that one does not see how her father and her brother are doing. But I think it was a great movie and I think I will watch it a lot more. I recommend it to anyone, even if you do not like boxing. I had a great time to see it.
