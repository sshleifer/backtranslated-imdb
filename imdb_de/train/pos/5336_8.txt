I really like this movie because in Australia, Chinese films like these are never shown at prime time. I have to say that this is one of the best serious films that makes the difference between the people of Hong Kong and mainland China clear. It really shows that there is discomfort between the two, but it can only get better when HK learns Mandarin. It also showed me how the indie rock scene is in China and how the Chinese know how to play the guitar and make the house party! Who said China is not ready for rock music? Daniel Wu is absolutely outstanding with his clear and clear voice, his honest acting and his absolute chick magnet. I recommend this movie to those who do not know much about Asians to get rid of the typical Western stereotypes, and people who love Chinese / Asian cinema like me. Listen!
