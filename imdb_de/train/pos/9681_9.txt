Add Paulie, the parrot, to the movie's beloved animal characters. This movie is a love story - Bird and Gena Rowlands, Bird and the popular Marie, Michael and Marie. A Russian janitor helps a talking and thinking parrot find his rightful owner many years after Marie's parents sell him to a pawnbroker. Before the heartwarming end, we learn all the mishaps of Paulie. Cheech Marin and his dancing parrots are wonderful. Beautiful photography everywhere. Great little movie, word of mouth makes him a cult favorite.
