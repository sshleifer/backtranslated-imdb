I have not seen how many times I've watched this movie - I probably know the entire dialogue backwards - but I'm always attracted to it. <br /> <br /> In Hungary, a young Jimmy Stewart plays the legitimate bachelor "Kralik", who becomes the secret admirer of Margaret Sullavan's innocent "Klara". Kralik secretly becomes Klara, pen pal, and working together, Klara Kralik confides in the content of his letters. Apparently, Kralik is tainted with Klara - but can not perceive his feelings when competing with the "pen pal". Confused? They will not - this story has a sweet, almost sugar-sweet ending - but we all know that this is the end we all want. <br /> <br /> Other noteworthy characters include Frank Morgan, who plays his usual role, this time as the shopkeeper "Hugo Matuschek", Felix Bressart as "Pirovitch", Kralik's confidant. Joseph Schildkraut as the arrogant maiden "Vadas" - played so well that you have to hate him from the start. <br /> <br /> Finally William Tracy, who manages to cherish all with his overconfident upstart "Junior Pepi Katona". <br /> <br /> Recently redesigned as "You've Got Mail" with Tom Hanks & Meg Ryan, it's not as good as the original for me - though I suspect a younger crowd I would not agree. <br /> <br /> If this movie is about Christmas in your area, I suggest you pour out a good glass of wine, put a log on the fire and have a box of Kleenex at hand.
