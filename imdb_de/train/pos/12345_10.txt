Kurosawa tells a story with characters as diverse as any Shakespearean drama, and the play is true to the story, with each star playing its role as part of the larger story. It is touching, funny and in all parts fascinating. The character development is almost perfect, the cinematography is alive and captivating and the story attracts you. <br /> <br /> I would like to say that the "Samurai freaks" and those obsessed by dynasties of the late 18th and 19th centuries Japanese stories may call this film the best work by Kurosawa. Maybe not his best, but even in the worst case, Kurosawa is better than many of the best. This story is designed to lift the earthly life of ordinary people in a time of great change, timeless, even though it is located in the not-so-distant past. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this for any movie fan and especially for those who are likely to continue reading the novel the movie is based on.
