This movie is pretty good. I bought it on DVD half a year ago. But at first I thought it was the original movie. I saw the show and it's a good movie, but here they put together "The Living Legend, part1 and 2" and "Fire in Space". The same as the first movie, but with other episodes. Still, it's a pretty good movie. Only the end is strange (you do not see what happens to the Pegasus). But I still think it's pretty good. The actors and special effects were good. If you have not seen it, look at it. Performers: Richard Hatch, Dirk Benedict, Lorne Greene, Herb. Jefferson Jr., Tony Swartz, Terry Carter, Lloyd Bridges, Jack Stauffer.
