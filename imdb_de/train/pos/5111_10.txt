Does anyone know what kind of pickup John T drove? I look like a Ford mid to late 70's. This movie is both my favorite movie and my wife. It was the first memorable movie we saw as a married couple. The pickup is interesting as it resembles the first truck I recently rode with another. I want to restore the pickup point that I want to see in the movie. Also the music was great and the acting was great. Where and what is the lady who portrayed John's aunt? Did John also have a stunt double for the scene on the tower when he almost fell? In what year of Mustang did Debra W ride this show. It looked like a '60s model. Many Thanks,
