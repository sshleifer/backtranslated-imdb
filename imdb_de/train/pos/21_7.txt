While not a memorable classic, this is a touching romance with an important theme that emphasizes the importance of literacy in modern society and the devastating career and life consequences of any unhappy person who lacks this vital skill. <br /> <br /> The story revolves around Iris, a widow who knows a colleague in her factory job, a cafeteria illiterate named Stanley. Iris discovers that Stanley can not read, and after he has lost his job, she gives him reading lessons in her kitchen at home. As you may predict, the two, though initially suspicious, develop feelings for each other ... Jane Fonda competently plays Iris, a woman with her own problems coping with a problem. Jobs without prospects, two teenage children (one of them pregnant), an unemployed sister and her abusive husband. However, Robert DeNiro is, of course, brilliant in his loveable portrayal of the intelligent and resourceful but illiterate Stanley, who brings dignity to the respectful role. They are not a typical, charming, young yuppie couple, as usually portrayed on screen romance, but a normal work-age middle-aged couple with fairly down-to-earth struggles. <br /> <br /> I will not put an end to it, but it's a lovely heartwarming romance and personal insight into the troubling issue of illiteracy among adults, albeit from the perspective of a fictional character.
