This is the beginning of a new and interesting Star Trek series. It has a "down-to-earth" feel with darker and less "plaggy" scenography. The characters need more time to develop, but they have potential. One thing that is quite disappointing (really in all Star Trek series) is that they portray the equality of men and women in the future so bleakly when they draw a very positive picture of everything else. (The earth has stopped war, hunger, etc.) <br /> <br /> The female characters are two, Subcommander T'Pol, the volcanist and communications officer Hoshi, who is human. Hoshi is quite shaky and T'Pol is a "Vulcan Babe". <br /> <br /> Some crew attitudes feel a little too American (as opposed to the more international feelings of the TNG crew). but creates an interesting dynamic. <br /> <br /> A very good pilot for a very good series.
