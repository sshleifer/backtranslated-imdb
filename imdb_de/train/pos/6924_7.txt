This complicated Western was a milestone in JAMES STEWART's career after his return from military service. He wanted to change his image by creating a western that is widely regarded as a reason for the influx of Western in the 1950s, as it is very impressive. Too bad it was not photographed in Technicolor. <br /> <br /> Stewart wins the first prize for "The Weapon That Won the West," but then has to spend the rest of the movie finding him after a theft. SHELLEY WINTERS is a shady woman with an unsavory reputation and STEPHEN McNALLY is the local villain in Dodge City. WILL GEER is Wyatt Earp and DAN DURYEA is Shelley's bad friend. And if you do not know that this is a Universal International movie, TONY CURTIS and ROCK HUDSON (both very unknown people at the time) have a small role. <br /> <br /> An interesting sequence shows the first Indian attack. CHARLES DRAKE reveals himself as a coward who rode off leaving Shelley alone in a horse-drawn carriage. Later he redeems himself, but it's just one of the twists where the weapon passes from one disgusting hand to the other - and eventually ends up with the rightful owner. STEPHEN McNALLY and JAMES STEWART A pretty complete firefight that's almost as melodramatic (but not quite) as the finale of DUEL IN THE SUN. McNally is the perfect villain, and DAN DURYEA is equally treacherous in the sort of vicious role he played as a lifelong gunfighter in the 1940s. It's fun to call ROCK HUDSON (referred to as Young Bull) in Indian war paint and TONY CURTIS as a boy Seeing soldiers, the yearning looks on the then slender and attractive Shelley Winters throws above-average story.
