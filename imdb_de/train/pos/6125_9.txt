Okay, here I'm thinking about Jack Frost. I looked at the Morphing box for the VHS tape and thought that looks interesting. I rent it and I take it home. Boy, I was right, it's interesting. They drove the serial killer spirits in dreams, in walking corpses and in everyday machines. However, this must be the most unique place to put the spirit of a serial killer to the point. In the body of a snowman. I liked all the friendly pictures of the snowman scattering the landscape, the potholder, the snowglobe, etc. I like the actor who played Jack, and he made fun of a murderer that has not been seen since FREDDY KRUGGER. That's right, I said it. FREDDY KRUGGER. It's the level of "cool". I wish some of the puppet effects were better, mouth movements could have been better. But I give it to myself on a small budget. The cast is doing a great job, there are some great liners and horrors that make every hardcore horror fan jump. All in all a great story, good effects, great dialogues and a great cast. I give JACK FROST ... 9 STARS
