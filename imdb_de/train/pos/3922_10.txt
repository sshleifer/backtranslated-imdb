Carmen is one of the best movies I have ever seen. It's hard to say whose performance is best: Antonio Gades, Cristina Hoyos and Laura del Sol are outstanding. They dance their souls out. It is a beautiful story of the inseparability of life and myth; Myth permeates everyday life. Dance becomes life and all life is danced. Real people at the same time live their own lives and become somebody else, playing the lovers of yesteryear. The magic continues.
