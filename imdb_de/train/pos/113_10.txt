I have not seen this movie for about 5 years, but it still haunts me. <br /> <br /> When asked about my favorite movies, this is the one I always seem to mention first. There are certain films (works of art like this movie, "Dark City" and "Breaking the Waves") that seem to touch a place in you, a place that is so protected and hidden yet so sensitive that it makes a lifelong impression No other than a life-changing event, such as the end of a serious relationship or the death of a friend ... This movie "shook" me when I saw it for the first time. I had an emotional hangover that lasted several days.
