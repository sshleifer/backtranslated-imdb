This is a great self-contained work that is not related to anything before or after. Brat Pack Crooning and Club Exclusivity are not my biscuits of choice, but in this lawless world they create a seductive ambience. The film is packed with Our Guys, unmistakable actors who honor their work with successful performances. The dialogue is a pleasure. In fact, it is a new language. One of the few films that can be viewed repeatedly with increasing appreciation. Highlights include Billy Idol's British Loutishness, Ben London's Vulturine Brassware, Kyle's Eyelash, and the ad hoc philosophical overview.
