Unfortunately, I have to say that I disagree with other people in this Columbo episode. Death gives me a hand, frankly a boring columbo. After a few times I get bored and change the channel. I still love Robert Culp and Patricia Crowley and Ray Milland in their roles, but the story was weaker in this episode than in the others. First, Robert Culp plays an investigator for Ray Milland's character. He hires him to examine his young pretty wife, played by Patricia Crowley, to see if she's having an affair. In return, Culps character blackmails the fraudulent woman, who intends to expose his system to her husband, who is ruining his career. In anger, Culp kills her by slapping her face and placing her body elsewhere. I dont know. Maybe I just was not interested in these. Of course, Columbo gets him in the end. It's just the question of how.
