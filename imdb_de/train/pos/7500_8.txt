If you think that "Weird Al" Yankovic is hilarious, you will not be disappointed by THE COMPLEAT AL. Not only does this rare mockumentary contain many of Yankovic's memorable videos (including "Like A Surgeon" and "I Love Rocky Road"), but they are interspersed with funny vignettes highlighting the Parodist's rise to fame. Yankovic is not for all tastes, but his humor is harmless and resourceful enough that even non-fans will at least be slightly amused. Hard-core fans will not only love the content, but also the relatively early glimpse of Yankovic's almost three decades of career. Suitable for all ages, children will undoubtedly love the funny pictures.
