The 100 black and white half-hour episodes of the early sitcom "Mr. Peepers" were originally aired on NBC from 1952 to 1955. Like many baby boomers, this and the Ding Dong School are my earliest memories of television. Since both worked later in the syndication, it is difficult to say how many of these memories are actually tied to the original broadcasts. <br /> <br /> "Mr. Peepers" is worth a look on more than just the nostalgia value. It represents a very different style of situational comedy than shows like "The Honeymooners" and "I Love Lucy". The genre could have gone in two different directions at that time and ended the loud, abrasive path of these two shows. That's probably why they still look contemporary. <br /> <br /> "Mr. Peepers", which is characterized by its intelligent, restrained tone, appears slow and boring in comparison. However, it is more a matter of adaptation to the other style. Once you engage with the characters, you will convince most intelligent viewers. Producer of the show, Fred Coe, is a key player in early television, whose dramatic anthologies are also worth a visit ("Philco Television Playhouse", "Lights Out", "Playhouse 90", "Producers Showcase", "Playwrights") 56 "," Fireside Theater "etc. also on the Kinescope. <br /> <br />" Mr. Peepers "provided a much gentler style with Wally Cox (a few years later the voice of" Underdog ") in the title role, Robinson Peepers, a gentle university science teacher whose glasses were his trademark and a symbolic link to his name and his role as a passive observer. <br /> <br /> The series provided Cox with an outstanding cast, with Tony Randall playing his best friend , the history teacher Harvey Weskit, Jack Warden played Frank Whip, the noisy sports teacher whose mild bullying gave the show the most conflicting elements. <br /> <br /> There is a love contest in which the school's nurse, Nancy Re mington (Patricia Benoit). Spectators quickly blend in with Mr. Peepers, who is much better suited to gentle Nancy. Her wedding on screen towards the end of the 1953-54 season drew national attention, an early version of the "Who Shot J.R.?" Rage. <br /> <br /> What else do I know? I am only a child.
