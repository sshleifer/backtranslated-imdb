Holy crap, that's so hysterical! Why are not American comedies written this way? For anyone who thinks comedy is stupid - in the six episodes of this series is more wit and intelligence than on a shelf full of novels! Hugh Laurie is an absolute shout. I could not believe it was the same guy as House! There are so many great lines and gags in this series that you can watch every show dozens of times and still pick up new things every time. Rowan Atkinson is weird as the wordy and Butler Edmund. This is my favorite of all Blackadder series. And Tony Robinson is as wonderful as ever before as the slightly dull heart of the series "The oppressed mass" Baldrick. Some of my favorite lines: "If somebody gets confused with a Wellington, he really steps in," and Baldrick explains how he got his name and cousin Macadder as "the top tipper seller" and the swordsman from Scotland.
