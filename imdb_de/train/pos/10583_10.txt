The stock market crash of 1929 and the ensuing depression almost ruined the American Musical Theater, in fact this was the final deathblow for Variety. Those behind the curtains were just as bad as their predecessors. <br /> <br /> To stimulate the show business economy and his own personal economy, theater director James Cagney, who is unemployed, comes up with a brilliant idea. Stage live relevant prologues to the movies shown in various cinemas emerging overnight from the old theaters. Some other competitors are getting wind of it and the competition is in progress. <br /> <br /> Footlight Parade is my favorite movie from Busby Berkeley. It gives James Cagney the chance to show something of his versatility as a dancer as well as a tough guy. Retired, Cagney said he could hardly be disturbed by some of his dramatic dramatized films as he introduced his few and far-flung musicals. He wished he had made some musicals in his career, and I wish he had. <br /> <br /> The staging of this Busby Berkeley extravaganzas on the stage of a film palace contradicts of course every logic and reason. But it's so creative and fun to watch. <br /> <br /> Dick Powell sings three songs in Footlight Parade, Ah the Moon is here, Honeymoon Hotel and By a Waterfall, the last two with Ruby Keeler, who further consolidate the screen team. Ruby sings and dances with Powell in the last two and she's starring James Cagney in my favorite number of Footlight Parade, Shanghai Lil. <br /> <br /> Joan Blondell is Cagny's unobtrusive girl on Friday in the theater. As in Blonde Crazy, she is the one with the true minds in this duo, and it is her quick thinking that saves him from some of the domestic problems he has in addition to his theatrical issues. One of Blondell's best roles. <br /> <br /> Look for Dorothy Lamour and Ann Sothern in the refrain according to the IMDb pages for both. John Garfield is briefly in the Shanghai Lil number to see. In a scene at the beginning of the film, producer Guy Kibbee takes Cagney to a movie theater, where they show a B-western with John Wayne. The voice of the Duke is unmistakable. Even more unusual, the short clip shows him in a scene with Frank McHugh playing another Cagney assistant in Footlight Parade. I think the Warner brothers played a little joke there. I have to believe that the clip was deliberate. <br /> <br /> Footlight Parade is Busby Berkeley from its surreal side.
