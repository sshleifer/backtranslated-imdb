I saw this movie for the first time at the Sundance Film Festival this year, and as a teenager myself I found the movie very appealing. These kids are unusual and very unexpected in a movie of this size, but with proper dialogue and junk, they've made the movie a complete success. I enjoyed this movie more than others, but I strongly recommend that you release and watch this movie. It's a mix of funny comments and hilarious reality. High School Record has captured the essence of high school and brought my favorite list to the top and hopefully has the chance to be shown in cinemas. Thanks to all the kids who did the hard work for this movie, it helped to make my eyes cry with laughter.
