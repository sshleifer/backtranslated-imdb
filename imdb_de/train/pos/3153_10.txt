I'll do it succinctly because I think there's not much that can really be told to anyone about this show who has never seen it as weird and unique. For me it's possibly the funniest show ever. <br /> <br /> You really have to watch it to understand its sense of humor, and I needed a few episodes to really get in, but once inside, there's no turning back. The way the character of Hydes always wants his friends to get into trouble, the more it happens, the funnier it gets. <br /> <br /> It's the classic classic. I mean the cast, the writers, the director. It's just a recipe for success. I think, whoever is hard to do is Ashton Kutcher, but I think he's great in this series. I do not think it's possible that the character Kelso was played by anyone else dumb. All the main characters are great and it would not be a worthwhile review if I did not mention the stone cold fox Mila Kunis. Now it's a spicy meeting with a ball that's all fun.
