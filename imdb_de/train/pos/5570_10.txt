Sophmoric is this movie. But it's funny because everyone comes out. It shows the "boys changing room mentality" played by the "other side". It's good to see how these tides turn and how stupid they are. But that's probably not news for most women, because (just ask one), "they've all heard them before". the room will be laughing for 2 hours. And the other 2.7% ... can you really like them?
