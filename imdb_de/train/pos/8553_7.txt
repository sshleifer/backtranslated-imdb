I have just watched the movie. I was afraid he would disappoint me. In the end, though, I was pretty surprised. The American Cake Franchise is still in my favorite franchise films of all time. Yes, it will not be true if I say that I liked it as much as the original ones. The Beta House, along with the previous two pies, definitely lost something the first two pies had. It will not be a classic, like the first two. But hell, it's still fun with a lot of good moments and I think it should be the first movie you should choose if you want to have fun and relax after a hard day's work or at school. Beta House earns 6/10, but I gave it 7/10 just because it's another piece of PIE.
