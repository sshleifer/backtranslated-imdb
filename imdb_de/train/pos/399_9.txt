This movie is very cool. If you are a fan of Tsui Hark and Chinese fantasy movies, you should love this. This movie is the Asian Lord of the Rings: A fantasy story based on Chinese mythology. (I realize that many critics have labeled this film devoid of action, I think they probably have no knowledge of Chinese mythology.) If you like Stormriders or Warriors of Heaven & Earth, this one should be just right. This movie is still very hard to find in the US, though it was acquired for distribution in the US together with Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and Iron Monkey. Is it worth the search !!! This DVD is also worth a visit.
