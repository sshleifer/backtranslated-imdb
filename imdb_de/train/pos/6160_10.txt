SPOILER ALERT !!!! <br /> <br /> I had just seen the extended version of bedknobs and broomsticks. Although I liked the extended version, I wish they had left the original version on the DVD. <br /> <br /> The Portabello Road could have been reduced to its original length. It was too long and dragged the film along. Although dancing is great, it would have stayed much better on the DVD than deleted scene. <br /> <br /> All in all, this is a great movie. My 5 year old liked it. And it's wonderful that movies that I enjoyed as a kid are passed on to a new generation. This and Mary Poppins are added to my collection. <br /> <br /> Just as I remembered! <br /> <br /> *** from **** <br /> <br />
