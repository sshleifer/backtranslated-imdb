The story of Old Jane seems to be very popular nowadays. I've lost the number of versions that are running around. Probably the reason is that their "ruts" are also our "ruts" at this late stage. This TV miniseries gives the novel a neat narration. The stubborn, opinionated Emma is a pretty "modern" girl, if you think about it, even if the ambience of Jane Austen's world seems a bit artificial to us today. If you do not seem EMMA, I'll just say that self-sufficient Emma gets her talent. It's worth it to see how it works. The award goes to the ladies: Kate, Prunella, Lucy and Samantha. They almost had a psychic connection to old Jane!
