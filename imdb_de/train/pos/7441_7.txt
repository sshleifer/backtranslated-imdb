Personally, I do not despise the Jerry Springer Show, but I found "Ringmaster" the funniest movie I've seen this year. The infinite satire of Jerry Springer's "guests" starting in the opening scene makes you laugh throughout the movie. Despite a brief scene in which Jerry Springer makes a faint attempt to justify his existence, I definitely recommend this movie for sheer entertainment value.
