Hmmm, yes, this episode is extremely underestimated. <br /> <br /> Even if there are too many bad writing and actions in parts. I think the good wins the bad. <br /> <br /> I love the origami parts and the big "twist" at the end. I absolutely love this scene when Michelle faces Tony. It's actually one of my favorite scenes of the first season. <br /> <br /> For some reason, people have always hated the reincarnation episodes, but I've always liked them. They are not the best in writing. But the topic really interests me, <br /> <br /> I will give it a THREE star, but if the writing would be a little more consistent, I would give it FOUR.
