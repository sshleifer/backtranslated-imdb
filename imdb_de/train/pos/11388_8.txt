If I remember, Ira Gershwin, George's lyricist and brother, offered the Gershwin catalog for this film, which was picked up by the producers. In many ways, it was a typical 50s freed unit musical by MGM and was directed by Vincente Minelli with much help from Gene Kelly. Of course, the Gershwins were among the largest of all Broadway music teams, but in my opinion, George himself was one of the greatest American composers, period !!! Gene Kelly, of course, was one of the two biggest dancers of the musical (A guess like the other?), And I can not imagine his casting ever being questioned. However, I think the rest of the cast needs an explanation: Oscar Levant was a well-known personality in his day and as a true friend of George Gershwin he had to play in that movie. He was a talented pianist and even a moderately talented composer as well as a well-known neurotic and hypochondriac, and here he plays himself as always. Leslie Caron was a stranger at the time and she was one of them French "gamin" type. As a talented dancer she was never a real beauty. George Guétary, who plays the role of Maurice Chavalier, oops, I mean, Henri Baurel, was a Greek and not a Frenchman, but as a French tabloid he is certainly more than okay, even if he is a bit too young for the role. <br /> <br /> Gene's hoof song is useful here, but Guétary has much better vocal equipment. Although Gene was better manned elsewhere, apparently in "Singin 'in the Rain," where his character is much more calculating, he also sometimes appears as a sort of heel (he became, not in vain, as the "cast") more original Joey in Pal Joey, the Broadway musical.) I was not thrilled with his "I Got Rhythm" scene with the kids, which does not seem as spontaneous as I meant it. <br /> <br /> I Also, Nina Foch's character Milo found her quite annoying. <br /> <br /> But the highlight of the film is obviously the long ballet at the end of the film, based on theme music, with sets and costumes inspired by the great French Impressionist painters. <br /> <br /> I had a hard time believing Gene and Oscar as fighting artists, and I do not think the musical numbers are as well positioned as they possibly are, but on balance. The Gershwin music will be in Served very well in this film. <br /> <br /> The DVD is well done with fine, clear graphics (if they're affected) and the mono sound is good, but a trifle shallow.
