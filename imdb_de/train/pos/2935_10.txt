Eddie Murphy Delirious is by far the funniest thing you'll ever see in your life. You can compare it to any film, and I want to tell you that Delirious is the funniest movie ever! This movie is about 1 hour. 45 minutes, and during that time there was hardly a moment when I did not laugh. They'll laugh for hours after it's over, and keep playing the headlines in your head. Eddie Murphy has performed so many humorous performances over the course of his career (48 hours, Trading Places, Beverly Hills Cop, Raw, Coming To America, The Nutty Professor, Shrek, etc.), but this is by far the MOST KNOWLEDGE. I've seen this movie so many times, and it's always funnier. It never loses its edge. From that day on, every great standup performance by Delirious will be imitated. ***** and two thumbs up!
