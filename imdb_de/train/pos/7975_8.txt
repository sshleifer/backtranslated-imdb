I love Malles documentaries. They are so effortless and simple, but still fascinating. I have no idea why this documentation works. It's about Glencoe, Minnesota. 5000 people live there and nothing really happens. Nevertheless, Malle manages to make it fascinating and interesting. His love of humanity, even for racist or homophobic people, is so overwhelming that one can not help but fall in love with them. <br /> <br /> Malle made most of his filming in 1979. He returned six years later to see what had changed. This would have been a good movie with no material 6 years later, but this little addition makes it great. It may sound like Malle is simply doing what was done in the Up series, but in fact it is not. The Up series is about people. Malles emphasis is not so much on what happened to each person, but on what has happened to this community. And the change is great. 1985 is the Reagan era and the peasants are suffering. Once a proud community, today no one sees much future and parents hope that their children educate themselves and do something other than agriculture. <br /> <br /> This documentation is very relevant today. Our financial crisis started today because of what happened then. Take a look at these last words of the film, which were spoken in 1985 by an elderly lawyer from the city: "Well, I have high hopes for this country, because things are going well Now I can only as an obsession with greed A nation does not live long with this obsession, and above all a democracy that ... There is good - there is good - much good in this country and much good people and they will not - they will not subordinate to this philosophy of greed that is now going on, it's awful. "<br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it took more than 20 years and a hell of a headache before that happened.
