I could not agree with the quote "This is one of the best films ever made". If you think that Vanilla Sky is simply a "make-your-make", you could not be wrong. The film has an enormous depth: visually, musically and emotionally. <br /> <br /> Optical because the film is sometimes soft and tender (early scenes with Sofia) and sometimes powerful and intense (Times Square), post-climactic scenes). <br /> <br /> Music and sounds fit so perfectly into this movie. Without the music, only half of the story is told. Nancy Wilson has created an emotional yet versatile score for the film that would not be more appropriate for such a dreamlike theme (though I was never released, I was able to get the original film score for about $ 60.) If you If you look hard, you can find a copy yourself). Crow's other music choices, like The Beach Boys, Josh Rouse, Spiritualized, Sigur Ros, the Monkees, etcetera, etc., are also perfect for the movie (Crowe has an ear for great music). <br /> <br /> More importantly, the emotional themes in this film (ie, love, sadness, remorse) are very powerful, amplified tenfold by the visual and musical experience and ingenious dialogue. I admit, the elevator scene keeps bringing tears to my eyes. <br /> <br /> But the best part of this movie is (as if it could get even better) that it's made so smart that each one of them, when you watch the movie, catch something new - have a look and be ready to think! Sure, a theme will be obvious after the first or second clock, but history has more to offer than you think. <br /> <br /> This is easily the best work of Cameron Crowe and overall a brilliant job. Many of my cinematic and musical inspirations come from this work alone. It has honestly touched my life because true art tends to do something. It always surprises me that there are many people who can not appreciate this movie as it is (I believe that true art is an art in itself). <br /> <br /> Conclusion: Vanilla Sky is owning a league of its class.
