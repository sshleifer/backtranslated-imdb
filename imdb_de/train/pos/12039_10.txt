The woman in black is fantastic in every way. It's scary, exciting and so realistic that you can actually see it in real life. I saw this on TV for the first time in 1989, and since all the lights were off and the volume was high, this was probably the scariest experience of my life. I've managed to get a copy, and now I make sure it comes out every Halloween and shows it to unsuspecting family members who have no idea what they're up to, and I can only laugh with joy. To the movie: <br /> <br /> It starts with a young lawyer named Arthur Kipps, who is hired by his firm to go to the market town of Crythin Gifford to settle the papers of a recently deceased client - Ms. Alice Drablow. <br /> <br /> This film starts with a pretty solid and interesting ghost story. But then Arthur takes part in the funeral and from that scene we do not feel safe. We are constantly on edge and biting our nails, and that lasts about the next hour until the final, exciting finale. <br /> <br /> A warning to all new viewers: Do not watch this alone. ..
