La Teta y la Luna is a symbolic Spanish movie. Everything that happens in this movie has a symbolic meaning. It's completely different than the ordinary movie you have. <br /> <br /> This movie is good, but it will only be good for people who are looking for the meaning of everything in the history of the movie. I have to say that this is not a sample movie. <br /> <br /> Please have fun !!!
