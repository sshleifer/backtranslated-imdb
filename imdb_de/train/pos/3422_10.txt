I need this urgently on a tape, not on a DVD, and soon! <br /> <br /> I have a nephew who is in the infantry but is not yet in action, although he wants to go to Iraq shortly after December 2008. I lost my beloved stepson in Ramadi Iraq on 15.09.05 due to an unmanned missile in a green zone. I have another nephew going into the army as soon as he graduates from high school this spring because, like his older brother, he has an idealized and romanticized idea of ​​what military service means. My stepson died after only ten days in the country and he never went out on missions, so my nephews have no way of referring to the experiences shown in this honest documentary, personal experiences that may have been mine by now deceased son were mediated. <br /> <br /> There's nothing I can do about those who have gone in or now, but I still have one who has not raised his hand and sworn in YET. I absolutely want him to know that none of the others did. <br /> <br /> Please help me with this. <br /> <br /> The film documentary The Ground Truth is the best visual reference I've ever seen. I have to make my youngest nephew somehow see what he gets involved in before it's too late. BUT: (does not laugh) I MUST first see my mother. She must actually see and hear these men and women, not just the idea of ​​them, but the truth about what they will be immersed in, possibly forever. Then she has the emotional determination to get my brother to watch this movie, and when he does, he can also get his son, my youngest nephew, to look at him. Then my nephew could take this seriously. <br /> <br /> ((Is there any other time this is shown on TV? If so, please tell me when?))) <br /> <br /> My problem is that my mom does this i dont own a dvd player, she still uses video (is that true? with tapes?). So I have to find a way to see this movie. Can I buy someone's product in this form? If not, is there any other way for me to get this in the form of a cassette from anyone? Is there a legitimate link from which I can pay to download it to my computer and then transfer it to a tape. If so, whom would I contact? I will gladly pay for the privilege, provided it is a legitimate connection. <br /> <br /> Or if you have alternative ideas, I'll consider anything that you can suggest. <br /> <br /> Please help me, I have lost a very precious lover and one already loved, I already know I will never be the same again my eldest nephew when he returns, and I could lose him too , I can not lose three and the emotional tribute to all who make it is too high to pay for every male child in my family of this generation. Please help me. I'll call you, email me a number if this is the best way to get the information you need. Many thanks for your help. <br /> <br /> Best regards Lori Swanberg l.swanberg@yahoo.com
