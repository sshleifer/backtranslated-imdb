The Thing About My Folks is a wonderful film about relationships - first and foremost an adult son and his father, but also this son with his wife, sisters and mother. Paul Reiser has written a semi-autobiographical film about his relationship with his father. The movie is funny, poignant and thought-provoking. This caused me to reevaluate my own relationship with my now deceased father and adult son. Peter Falk has been honored as Paul's father - the role could not have been better filled. I hope that both Mr. Falk and Mr. Reiser will be recognized for their efforts at the next year's film awards - Falk for his performance and Reiser for his screenplay.
