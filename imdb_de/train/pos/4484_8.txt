"Anchors Aweigh", released a few months before the end of the war, is one of Gene Kelly's greatest musical achievements in the 1940s. <br /> <br /> Directed by George Sidney, it had the benefits of a pleasant outcome, and above all, the services of Gene Kelly in his first true starring role at MGM. The year before, he had revealed in Columbia's "Cover Girl" an innovative approach to dancing on the screen, a slight but pleasant singing voice and considerable charm in "Anchors Aweigh", although it was billed under Frank Sinatra and Kathryn Grayson. he has laid the solid foundations for his most insightful years at MGM? <br /> <br /> The story of the film, a kind of dry run for "On the Town" four years later, follows sailors Kelly and Sinatra ashore, spending their holidays in Hollywood, where they engage in Hollywood affairs an aspiring singer (Grayson) and her little nephew (Dean Stockwell). <br /> <br /> Grayson, it seems, has set her heart for an audition with conductor pianist Jose Iturbi. Of course she gets the audition; Kelly gets Grayson after some misunderstandings; and Sinatra, forgot to be shy, and lost his heart to a girl from Brooklyn (Pamela Britton). <br /> <br /> The plot is conventional for that time, but unfortunately it seems hard to tolerate now.

He also does a charming Mexican dance with the little Sharon McManus on the site of a Mexican settlement in Los Angeles. <br /> <br /> However, the highlight of the film is Kelly's famous cartoon comedy Jerry the Mouse (by "Tom and Jerry" fame). Fine and innovative, he skillfully combines live action and animation in his story of a sad mouse king refusing to allow music in his kingdom until Kelly, a Pomeranian Navy sailor wearing a striped shirt and berets, tells him shows how that works "Look at me, I dance!" says the happy mouse king ...
