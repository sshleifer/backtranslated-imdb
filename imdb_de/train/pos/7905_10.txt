I am very sorry for people who go to the cinema with a block and a pencil to write down mistakes and to take notes about how bad a movie is. I also feel despised for people who go to the movies and DO NOT interrupt reality and / or enjoy 90 minutes of their boring or busy life! Get a GRIP team. ECGTB is a very ENTERTAINING movie. If you take movies seriously, this is NOT for you. If you expect the movie to be somehow similar to the book, this is not for you. But if you enjoyed the utter serenity of Priscilla Queen of the Desert or the "What the hell I see" by Moulin Rouge. Or the rough comedy of "The Sweetest Thing" Then let's escape to cowgirls. It has some really funny parts. Funny, actually. It also has really good music, kudos to kd.lang. I also mentioned that there are 90 minutes of Uma Thurman. Do I have to say more?
