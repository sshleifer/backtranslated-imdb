I really liked "Doctor Mordrid". This is a low budget movie, which is a deterrent for some, but I have no problem with that. I admire it all the more, considering that it is FURTHER entertaining than the throttle that Hollywood erupts every year. Too bad that there was no theatrical version; I do not know anyone, but I would have seen it in the cinemas. "Doctor Mordrid" is a very entertaining sci-fi movie that almost anyone can enjoy, especially if they love sci-fi. I can not understand why this is a R-Rated movie. Only one F-word is said, and there are no cruel death scenes and no blood. The timeless rivalry between the wizards Anton and Kabal (Anton wanted to use his powers to save humanity while Kabal wanted to enslave them) gives the story a sense of enchantment, while the mythical storyline lends charm to the story itself. Basically, this is a movie that is just fun. However, there is one unintentionally funny thing in this movie: See Jeffrey Combs wearing this stupid blue cape and suit. That makes me laugh every time. But I digress ... In any case, the spectacle is great; the main protagonists (Anton and his girlfriend Samantha) are very sympathetic; Anton is personable and hospitable, and Samantha is friendly. Plus, the settings were wonderful. The floating island in the other dimension was very cool; However, we only have a quick look at it. It would have been nice if more scenes could be seen here. The main attitude was also very neat; Anton's apartment is very spacious and has some cool appliances, especially the surveillance system that he uses to track the events of the world. He even has a pet trench he keeps in his apartment called Edgar. Overall, a great movie; It was fun to watch and the lead actors give their roles a lot of feeling. If you find somewhere that "Doctor Mordrid" rents, you should rent it (or in my case buy it, it was definitely well spent money)! <br /> <br /> My rating: 8 stars ten. <br /> <br />
