I really love this show! I always liked the shows of Space Ghost from the 1990s! This show was hilarious and I can not believe why Adult Swim from Cartoon Network would make such a funny show like this from the air. I hope you put this show on DVD or something. The show is about Brak (from the Space Ghost Cartoons, SGCC and Cartoon Planet), who lives his daily life with his mother and father and his best friend, who likes to come over a lot, Zorak! My favorite episodes were those in which Zorak gets this really good singing voice, and then his voice does not give him any money that Zorak has actually earned from singing. Another episode I like is when Brak and Zorak did not do their homework and then they go back from Sunday to Friday and they just go away and then they return to the day the homework was invented , and then when they return homework did not exist! Another episode I like is the one in which Brak's dad and his neighbor, Thundercleese the Robot, keep coming in and getting eaten by a huge worm. Another episode I liked was the one in which Zorak makes a tyrant, and then a new man took his point. I also like many other episodes! One thing that always makes me laugh is when Zorak gets beaten up, beaten and fidgeted!
