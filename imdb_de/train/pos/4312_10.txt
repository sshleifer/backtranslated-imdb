If you have not seen this great film about life in the 90s (in LA), you've missed something special. This is one of the most amazing and powerful films ever made about American life in the '90s, and it even transmits to today's world in which we live. Love, adultery, empty nest syndrome, selfishness, etc., and the list goes on. This story builds to an ultimate climax and, if nothing else is important, it is loved again and again with friends and family and the love of life. It helps us to dig deep within ourselves and to seek what we want from life. Let us ask questions for ourselves. Have we done enough for others, are we like that, etc.? Lean back and enjoy a wonderfully made and emotional film that will surely delight others. <br /> <br /> Note Mary McDonnell, Kevin Kline and Danny Glover's wonderful performance in this movie. These actors are amazing and really show the true splendor and meaning of what message is sent to us all. These are 3 of my favorite actors after watching this movie over 10 years ago. I enjoy it again and again. Do you also enjoy the wonderful soundtrack and do not forget to count how many times you see the helicopter fly by and try to figure out the symbolism for the movie? Role in a movie he has ever made. He also does an excellent job in this film. This can be a surprise to most of you. Sit back, relax and enjoy really good filming .....
