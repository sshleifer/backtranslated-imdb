I can not stop saying how much I loved this movie. This movie is one of the least known and one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. The film follows the exploits of a rap group, NWH (Ni # $% rs with Hats). He goes from the beginning of the group to the end of the group after it has tragically dissolved. The group is followed by documentary filmmaker Nina Blackburn. <br /> <br /> The film has a tight budget but does not seem to matter. This is a very well made, well produced movie, and the performances of all these actors and actresses are excellent. The main strength of this film is writing. There are so many brilliant lines and smacks of rap in this movie, it's unreal. <br /> <br /> SPOILER <br /> <br /> There are launches of real rappers like MC Slammer, Vanilla Sherbert, Ice Cold, Tone Def, Tastey Taste and Songs (Booty Juice, Grab Your Dick), Etc.) Rusty Condieff made an excellent movie. In the movie he plays the rapper Ice Cold. The movie does not end, it's funny from start to finish. <br /> <br /> The movie works so well because it sometimes gets strange, but it hits the line where it's funny without going too far. Listening to the three main attempts to try to talk about a kind of philosophy was one of the best parts of the movie, like Tone Def, who told a record producer "if you take the bus, you get there" and the producer responds, ? that's deep! '<br /> <br /> The group representing NWH has a kind of natural chemistry to them. They work so well together, and they manage to pull that movie to where there's not a week in the movie. What really makes this movie so good is the fact that it suits some of the rap groups of the time this movie is playing. Many rap groups had problems with violence, with censors, and like NWA, the group only became popular when the establishment began to make a big deal out of the controversial texts. <br /> <br /> I like this movie because it is offensive. There is something here to offend everyone in a good-natured way. The film has a large number of folks out of the rap, and the funniest of Spike Lee. I can not imagine where they had this dialogue from. The movie has line by line that will make you roll on the floor. As I said, the writing is just outstanding. <br /> <br /> I am not surprised that this film found such a limited release. It's an intelligent, controversial and even thought provoking movie. This is too much for mainstream, though it is hilarious and almost flawless in its production. There are no main stars, but many familiar faces, including Marc Lawrence, who plays Tone Def. Look at this movie, at least you definitely have an opinion.
