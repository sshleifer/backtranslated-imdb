As far as I can remember, the changes made by Balanchine to Tchaikovsky's score are as follows: <br /> <br /> 1) The final section of the Grandfather Dance (a traditional piece that is played at the end of a party) is repeated several times to the children one last dance before her scene is over. <br /> <br /> 2) A violin solo, written for Tchaikovsky's score for The Sleeping Beauty, interpolates between the end of the party scene and the beginning of the party scene. Balanchine chose this music because of its melodic relationship with the music for the growing Christmas tree, which occurs shortly thereafter. <br /> <br /> 3) The solo for the Cavalier of the Sugar Plum Fairy is eliminated. <br /> <br /> It seems to me that the accusation that Balanchine has desecrated Tchaikovsky's big score somehow is out of place.
