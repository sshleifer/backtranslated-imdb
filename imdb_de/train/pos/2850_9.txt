The Japanese "Run Lola Run" is an unusual film that will put a smile on everyone's face. Fans of Run Lola Run, Tampopo, Go! And slackers will probably like this. It tends to follow a formula that is becoming increasingly popular these days, made up of separate, seemingly incoherent vignettes that all contribute in unexpected ways to the overall story. catch it when you see it, otherwise you are waiting for the rental.
