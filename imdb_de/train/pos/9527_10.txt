This is the best mob movie ever made. It deserves more than what it got at the Oscars. Nominated for things like score, art direction, supporting role (Newman), this film could easily have been nominated for Best Picture, Director (Mendes), Actor (Hanks), Supporting Actor (Newman and Law) and won !! Hanks is one of his best performers, and the boy who played Michel Jr. was so good that I'm surprised I do not see him in more movies today. Critics themselves did not give enough credit to this film. In addition to the incredible performances, the incredible music is another real star of this film. This was by far the best result of the year. It was nominated, but did not win. This is a great movie everyone should see. My grade-A +
