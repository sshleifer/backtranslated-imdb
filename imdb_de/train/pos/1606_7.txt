The "adult movie" is a rare thing these days, but Moonstruck is doing well and is still a better than the average movie that ages very well. Although they are comic moments that are lower than the rest, the film has a wonderful peculiarity (Italians in Brooklyn) that is not used to shorten the characters or viewers. (That is, gangsters never show up uncomplicatedly, it never gets grotesque like My Big Fat Greek Wedding.) The secondary storyline is narrated economically with short scenes that allow breakage with the main thread. These are the scenes that are now missing in contemporary films and whose immediate value can not be impressed by producers and greats. I miss these scenes. They are also older characters. The film takes its own light, quiet path to a conclusion. There is no badly written scene where some executives relax sphincter. Cage and Cher do a very good job. <br /> <br /> Moonstruck calls Old School, Ethnic and Labor day New Yorkers, much like "Marty", except that Moonstruck is far less sacred.
