I really enjoyed the detail that went into the script. Jonathan Rhys Myers (misspelled) and Jewel were outstanding roles in their role. Like Jeffery Wright. Toby McGuire almost always did a theatrical job when he had to amputate his best friend's arm because he knew he would die without the procedure. <br /> <br /> Attention to detail, with good dialect coaching to catch the southern accent incredibly well. <br /> <br /> I can only imagine why this film was swept under the carpet by the Hollywood organizers. I have strong suspicions. The more attractive it is for me. I spent a dozen DVD copies of gifts. <br /> <br /> movie completely overlooked. Rent or buy it and give it full attention for a few hours, then judge it.
