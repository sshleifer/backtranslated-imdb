I'm not a big fan of most anime, but Gundam Wing is really different. The Gundam Wing lacks all this stereotyped melodrama that you might think of when you think of anime, since the number of jokes made over the 17 hours would only be in the double digits, Gundam Wing gets down to work. <br /> <br /> Gundam Wing is as much a political thriller as an action series. Large parts focus on the diplomatic handling of a war, not just the battles. Although the combat animation lacks extreme details in cases where it would be painful to animate, individual duels between Gundams are almost works of art, animating the complex mechanics and fast movements. <br /> <br /> This 49 episode plus a film series was picked up on my knowledge in the year 2000 by a caricature network and synonymous of them professionally synchronized. The synchronization is simply flawless. Not just every word matches, but the voices used really make the characters more believable. Many believe it's best to watch anime with English subtitles, but I'm just not determined to do that. <br /> <br /> Not only the votes are good, but also the result of the series is impressive. I'm just saying that I vainly scoured the net to find a soundtrack. <br /> <br /> The storyline of this series is what will really captivate viewers, and no, not like a primetime drama like Lost, created solely for the purpose of captivating you. A deeper explanation of the plot would lead to many spoilers, as many of the characters do not even have a name until some episodes of the series. The rough idea of ​​the series is that the Earth and its now independent space colonies have difficulty keeping the peace. Thus begins a war that leads to military coups and diplomatic situations. I believe that more details would reveal information, which is crucial to the plot. <br /> <br /> I stop by saying that this series is for anyone who likes anime, anyone who thinks ALL ANIME is stupid (they have good reasons to believe it) and anyone who has anime to get in touch with a serious tone.
