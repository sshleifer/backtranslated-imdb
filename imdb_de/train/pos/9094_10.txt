I saw this independent movie when he was in Philadelphia and it was a nice surprise. I left the theater with a smile on my face. One of the things that made it so funny was that it was based on a true story - unbelievable! It also has some great character actors. Mindy Sterling is in it and is very good. I loved her in Austin Powers. Howard Hesseman is great, too. I remember him from the headmaster. I'm tired of all the dark, annoying movies that are still going on. It's fun and light and I can see it with my family and I'm not embarrassed. I constantly check when it will appear on DVD. I will definitely buy it.
