When I saw this movie again, this time it seemed to me to be infinitely superior to what I had seen before. The spectacle is amazingly wonderful. The characters are very clearly drawn. Brad Pitt is just great as the misguided son who rebels. The other actors and actresses are fine in every way. Robert Redford creates a wonderful piece from the time of the souls of the 1920s. The landscape is incredibly beautiful from the mountains and streams of western Montana. All in all, this is one of the most beautiful films of the 1990s. <br /> <br /> You have to watch this movie! <br /> <br />
