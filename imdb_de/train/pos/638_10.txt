Anyone who thinks this show is not for them, please try. Network television has evolved into clone clones or reality-based shows with often unreal people. This show is a return to family-oriented television, where it's important to learn some life lessons, learn what real friends and family are all about, and maybe even learn about our national pastime. Jeremy Sumpter is one of the most attractive young actors in show business today, and he's perfect as a young, slightly naive new batboy for the fictional New York Empires (big name!). Dean Cain, Christopher Lloyd, Mare Winningham and Kirsten Storms complete the lead actor and they are all extraordinary. This show deserves a chance to prevail and be seen. Hopefully there will be a few more seasons left and we can watch Pete Young (Sumpter's character) learning and growing.
