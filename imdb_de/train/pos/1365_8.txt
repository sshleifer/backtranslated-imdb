He-he-hello !! This is a really funny movie. Basically, Party Girl is your happy, independent New Yorker chick of the early '90s. Together with her party friends, she meets a mature Turkish salesman. It's an old story for those new adults who are looking for what they want to do. It's comforting to see a female slacker become a mature woman. We hope that we all slackers, who may feel that they are the only ones capable, will be able to remain while being hammered, and a good opportunity to hold good parties. <br /> <br /> By the way, Parker Posey makes this movie great. I've never been a big fan of her, but this movie just makes me see all her films. There are subtle mannerisms that perfect their character. If you want good laughs and a fun time, you should watch this movie. Repeated visits are a must.
