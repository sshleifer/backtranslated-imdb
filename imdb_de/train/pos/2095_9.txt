Let us remove any discussion about the use of non-Asian actors playing Asian roles. The movie is 67 years old. In 1937, studio bosses believed every actor could / should play a role. Actors were under contract and did not always have the choice of what role they played. End of the story. <br /> <br /> This is a really great epic story about love, individual rights, classes and men / women issues. The heart of the film are two brilliant performances by Luise Rainer and Paul Muni. <br /> <br /> Muni plays Wang, a Chinese farmer who is taking a wife (Rainer). He treated her with respect from the beginning, at a time when women were considered little more than hired help. Without giving away too much of the film, they go through the ups and downs of all relationships, and even though the story takes place in the late 19th / early 20th centuries, the story and much of their emotions seem believable. <Br /> <br /> Apart from the fact that the movie is about 5-10 minutes longer than it needs to be, and the performances of Charley Grapewin and Walter Connolly are typical of the cartoon characters of the 1930s, this is a truly wonderful one Film, unfortunately, has become a victim of political correctness. <br /> <br /> 9 out of 10
