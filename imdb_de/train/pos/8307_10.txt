Tressa's vocal performance was outstanding !! Tressa played the lead role while Richard was in the club. When she stepped on stage for the first time and started ripping and scattering her things, my soul was shaken. Her voice is platinum. She has to do a CD. She has more fans than she realized. I loved the fact that she had shown her power in the five heartbeats she had played as Leon with Leon. How can a little girl have such a big voice? She is really amazing. Good voice good good good good voice voice voice excellent voice fantastic voice, shivering, tears crying, uplifting, take in the days voice. Tressa, if you read this commit, please take my advice and start recording a CD. Not only for the love of singing, but also for your fans. I think you can really do it. Look at these other single-studio singers, lol.
