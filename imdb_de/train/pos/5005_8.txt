With films like "Wallace & Gromit" and "Chicken Run" under their belt, the good folks from across the pond, Aardman Animation, make some of their twisted humor with "Creature Comforts." <br /> <br /> "Creature Comforts" is a short film show where short clips of conversations are removed from their context and given to an animal of some kind. Aardman Animation went around the country interviewing people with harmless questions like "Are you a liar?" and then speed things up a bit after their sexual life. <br /> <br /> The answers may seem boring and banal, but they're actually pretty funny if you understand that the dialogues come first and the animals are added later. <br /> <br /> How many of these animals look like the person making the statements? One of the characters discussing what he's looking for in a woman is, "I kinda like her thin." is an insect, the walking stick. <br /> <br /> There are two dogs that talk about smells and smells as they sniff the back of a poodle while talking about the different smells of a woman. <br /> <br /> There are two birds in a cage. While the "woman" of the litany says her health, her boring husband stands beside her and says nothing. <br /> <br /> It may take a while for "Creature Comforts" to find its "legs". it should find a place on television for those who are tired of the ordinary. While there are more reality shows than Carter has liver pills, "Creature Comforts" is unique and well worth a look. <br /> <br /> Part of the humor may seem a bit racy, it's the clay art that captures the kids 'attention (as with the old Batman series of the' 60s, the jokes are subtle enough for the kids to see them not get it) and it's the jokes that are there for the adults.
