I saw The Big Bad Swim at the Temecula Film Festival in 2006 and was totally surprised how much I participated. <br /> <br /> The film revolves around the life of a group of people taking an adult swimming class for various reasons. The class is a peculiar humorous idea and serves as a catalyst for major changes in the lives of students. <br /> <br /> What surprised me about the film was how real it felt. Rarely in ensemble pieces characters are treated so well. I really enjoyed the scenes in the class and the drama outside was very moving. Nothing seemed to be inappropriate or uncharacteristic, and in the end it left a very strong feeling, like visiting a school or a summer camp - where you make quick friends, make strong bonds and make discoveries about yourself, but have to leave too early /> <br /> My only complaint was that the character of Paula had a very strong and unusual introduction, which is why you wanted to know a little more about her than was finally revealed. I suppose you do not meet everyone in class, but ... <br /> <br /> Apart from that, I found the movie very rounded and very enjoyable. See it when you get the opportunity.
