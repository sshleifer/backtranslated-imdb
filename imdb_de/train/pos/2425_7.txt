I recorded this film on the IFC and I enjoyed it, although I felt that the cut was a bit rough, although it may have been deliberate. It was hard to figure out what was going on first, because they seemed to be a small non-linear plot presentation in pulp-fiction style. However, it seemed a bit forced. I definitely think that the movie is worth a look, but I think it could have needed a bit of tidying up. Some scenes just do not seem to make sense for others. <br /> <br /> I am surprised that the rating here is as low as it is. It's not great, but it does not have serious problems. I gave it a 7/10. The film has at least shown that Laurence Fishburne can act if he wants. You must have just told him that he should not be in the Matrix movies.
