I first saw this version of "A Christmas Carol" on TV. I actually expected to see the movie when it was promoted and it more than met my expectations. I have bought the DVD now and plan to see it every year. With the exception of "It's A Wonderful Life," I consider this version of "A Christmas Carol" to be one of the best Christmas movies ever made. George C. Scott is excellent and surrounds him with a great cast of Roger Rees! Scott proves once again that he is one of the best actors of our time. Scott has the artistic talent and theatrical ability to play any role and to keep the character unique. How can one remember as Patton and Scrooge? Scott makes it so easy. The direction is wonderful with the fine sets, costumes and music that give the film a special sense of time, place and epoch. You will love this movie and will be your favorite during the holidays.
