I recently saw Caprica again and thought I might as well come and write a review! I saw this for the first time after seeing the series finale of Battlestar Galactica (since I was a big, drooling fan boy of the series, I could stick to everything I could from the show universe came out with a smile, although I must admit ... <br /> <br /> The story begins dramatically on the planet Caprica and we are presented with a variety of interesting characters ... I will not give away too much, but there is a dramatic event, that determines the course of the story, but I suggest you see this. <br /> <br /> Gotta say ... Esai Morales is a damned actor he made a young Joseph Adama ... (Father Admiral in Battlestar Galactica) I found his acting place and I could believe that he is the father of William Adama of BSG ... <br /> <br /> Eric Stoltz fits his role too ...! It was nice to see Polly Walker outside Rome Do not sit down and look at Caprica with the expectation that it's like Battlestar Galactica, because the story is pretty straightforward and anyone can watch it without you having to see BSG. <br /> <br /> This show is a well written drama for those who like the drama with a sci-fi kick!
