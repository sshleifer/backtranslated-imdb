"Pet Sematary" is successful in two major situations. First, it's a scary horror movie. The ones that are just not being produced these days. Second, it's an emotional, smart movie. So if you're looking for chills, fear, scary and visually stunning settings, great drama, dial songs and gruesome effects, you've come to the right place. This is the movie you are looking for. A classic now and a must for any horror fan. <br /> <br /> Probably the best adaptation to King's novels. The events feel a bit rushed compared to the novel, but that does not mean that this undervalued film is not a horror / drama perfection. <br /> <br /> Stephen King's novel is known for being very emotional and cruel at the same time. The movie gives the same feeling, mainly because there is a great character development and you can feel the loving relationship between the members. When everything seems to be happy (technically happy, because the title "Pet Sematary" does not offer any appeal!), A tragic event changes the atmosphere of the movie, now it is getting very dark. The movie has an eerie feeling since the opening credits, but after Gage is killed, the movie becomes sad, gray and scary. Dealing with the loss of a baby son can ruin a family's entire life, and "Pet Sematary" proves it dramatically. <br /> <br /> The legend behind pet sematary is more than a myth nobody wants to experience, but sadness and desperation lead an emotionally damaged father to give him a shot. Unfortunately, the legend comes true and Baby Gage returns from the dead. The previous encounter with the pet half-time legend turned out to be a tragedy, but this time it is much, much worse. What will happen to the life of our All American Family? Could Pascow prevent this tragedy? What's up with the surreal nightmares? <br /> <br /> Check out "Pet Sematary" for one of the most touching, emotional horror movies of late. You will not regret it. Acting is very good, although I did not dig up the actor who portrayed the father. He did not seem to be disturbed enough when the situations demanded his desperation. But that's just my opinion. Denise Crosby really did a great job and worked perfectly as a noble, tender mother. Baby Gage was amazing even in his uncanny places. * Shivers *. Overall, this is a great classic of all time and a disturbing film that touches people's deepest fears ... the loss of a loved one, the return of the dead and a sense of desperation. <br /> <br /> Something is safe ... I do not want to be buried in a pet sematary !!
