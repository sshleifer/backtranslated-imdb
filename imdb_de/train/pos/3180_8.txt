A friend lent me this DVD he got from a director at a festival, I think. I warned that some of the technical aspects of the film were a bit shaky and that the writing was good but not great. Maybe that stained my judgment, but I have to admit that I liked this movie. <br /> <br /> The outstanding actors. Youssef Kerkor was really good as Ernie, the main character, miserable in a sympathetic way. Adam Jones (who also directed) and Justin Lane were excellent roommates driving Ernie crazy. The Bill figure (Justin Lane), who is dressed like a panda, was by far my favorite. he was the least one-dimensional and reminded me so much of an old roommate at the university that I had called him after watching the DVD. Really kind of adorable and very funny. Some of the other plays were good, others were so-so, but none of it was bad. I also really liked the Vigilante duo. Ridiculous and funny. <br /> <br /> I give this a high score, even if there are some problems, because one notices when watching that these people worried and decided to make their film according to their ideas. Well done to Adam Jones and the crew.
