I enjoyed watching this movie late on late television and it caught my interest. This wonderful, spooky, but mysterious-looking English house with evil-looking decorations and countless pieces of furniture and rooms that makes you wonder why anyone wants to rent this house or even own it. There are four (4) stories concerning this house, and every resident of the house has many problems. You will notice the beautiful lake and pond around the house and also the sweet singing of the birds, but do not let that fool you, there is horror everywhere. Peter Cushing, "Black Jack," '80 is a great performer when he lives at home, and even Christopher Lee, "Curse of the Crimson Altar," 68 and his little daughter, Chloe Franks (Jane Reid), make a wonderful thrilling Story, his daughter likes to read WITCHCRAFT BOOKS for some reason! If you love scary, horrible and mysterious movies with lots of surprises, this is the MOVIE FOR YOU !!!!
