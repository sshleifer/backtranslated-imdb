I love Full House so much that I could not live without Full House. Why did it end? It bothers many fans. Can we have a Full House II? Oh come on! But it is better that we have this DVD to help us. But I need those real ones to find another new episode. Love, warmth fills the house! All characters are very cute and pretty! Candace Cameron, Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen, Jodie Sweetin, Bob Saget, Dave Coulier and John Stamos, loooooooove you you! DJ, Michelle, Stephanie, Danny, Joey and Jesse, please come back to the screen! How is Michelle after falling off the horse? How is Nicky and Alex? Is Joey alone or does he have a wife or at least a girlfriend? Are you still living in the same house? I want to continue the full house life! and please do not annoy me!
