I absolutely loved this movie! I hesitated to look at it first because I thought it was too painful. I remember how hard it was when John was shot. However, the reputation of the "two of us" brought me back to a happier time when he was still alive and gave hope and opportunity. I think the author has done an amazing job of showing what "possibly has been". Aidan Quinn was as adorable as Paul and faced the challenge. I was impressed by his accent and manners. Jared Harris is also very talented and was quite credible as John. My favorite parts were the scene in the park and the badger scene - which was so moving. The film has made me both sad and satisfied, which I consider appropriate given the circumstances.
