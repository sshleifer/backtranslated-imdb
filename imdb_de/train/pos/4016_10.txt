This wonderful little movie contains all the elements that made the Spaghetti Western so exciting and fun: GREAT music (by one of the few ... if not the only female composer working in the genre, Nora Orlandi), EXCITING action sequences (and very vicious for the day!) and beautiful scenery and sets (of course in Almeria, Spain). It also has a very good story with a beautiful tragic romance. The actors perform great jobs - with truly outstanding performances by Lawrence Dobkin and Rosalba Neri (in the key role of a woman in a spaghetti western ... outside of Cardinale in Leone's "Once Upon a Time in the West"). Let me say that this movie is one of the best finishes of a movie I've ever seen!
