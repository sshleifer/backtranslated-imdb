Leased the movie as a joke. My friends and I had so much fun laughing that I found a used one and bought it for myself. Now when all my friends are looking for a funny movie, I give them Sasquatch Hunter. It must be said, though there is a rule that has made the movie much better. While the movie is running, do not talk unless the words are Sasquatch in a song. I was also thrilled with the recognition at the end of the film. "Thanks for the Jeep, Tom!" Who Tom is, I say thank you, because without your Jeep, the film may not have been made. In short, a great movie if you are looking for a laugh. If you're looking for a good movie, you may be looking for something else, but if you do not mind a laugh at the expense of a man in a monkey costume, grab a copy.
