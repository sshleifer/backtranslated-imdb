Bakshi's "Coonskin" is one of the most interesting films that can be classified as "Blaxploitation" and is a rich text full of wonderful insight. He wrote it in collaboration with Scat Man Crothers and Barry White, who also participate in the film. The racist images can often be disturbing, but the message of the film was so powerful that the NAACP gave it an endorsement (but reluctantly). I recommend this movie to anyone who is interested in a movie exploring the pervasive atmosphere of racism that Bakshi is trying to deconstruct. Wonderful stuff.
