Here's a decent 1970s horror movie about a gate to hell in New York, which happens to be an old brownstone. It seems that there are many gates to hell, but of course this ignorant model decides that she needs some space from her boyfriend / fianc√©, and so she just chooses one that is disguised as a nice and inexpensive apartment. She meets several foreign neighbors and even visits a birthday party for a cat. At a real estate agent meeting, hearing strange noises from above at night, she learns that she and an old priest are the only tenants to be SUPPORTED. Whoa! Who are all these crazy people then? Her boyfriend (a slimy lawyer, played by Chris Sarandon) starts playing around and realizes that things are not what they seem, not in the long run. This has some decent scary scenes and the idea that the old people, who are their "sometimes" neighbors, are different than they appear is pretty intriguing. A little decent Gore and even a parade of less normal people make it a decent clock, and although I've seen this on TV many times, the uncut DVD version is of course much better. Not a bad little horror movie, maybe a good companion to "Burnt Offerings". 8 out of 10.
