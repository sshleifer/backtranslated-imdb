Not on the same level as Ring (or Ring 2), but still a good Japanese horror movie. I wish North American horror producers would take a side of the Japanese horror original and put more "haunting" and less cheap shocks into their films. There are many good examples in this case: scenes in which a chiseled face stares behind a young actress. Photos on a wall suddenly become visible for a quick smile and more. It's worth checking if you like the genre.
