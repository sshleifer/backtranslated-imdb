This is a pretty strange movie. It looks like an exploitative film with exaggerated violence and unrealistic situations, but it is unusual because it was built around rural characters who are at war with each other, as opposed to an invading "other." <br /> <br /> The film is an excessive stereotype of Vietnam veterans in a long series of films depicting veterinarians as dangerous psychopaths. Kris Kristofferson's final line is "I have not lost a war yet" when he found his death after leaving a long trail of murder and destruction, including the city police chief and his brother's girlfriend in a particularly appalling scene. However, Kristofferson is a good actor and charismatic enough to carry this rogue with a surprising depth. Vincent is clearly the golden boy, but with enough intensity over his clean cut. The film is reminiscent of Winchester 73, where Jimmy Stewart tries to tolerate a criminal brother until he is forced to act against him. <br /> <br /> The film has b-movie grade action, though the presence of Kristofferson, Vincent, a gorgeous Victoria Principal, and Bernadette Peters give her an A-grade. <br /> <br /> I give her a 7 because she has lost a long lost look into an American psyche of post-Vietnamese / pre-Reagan introspection, paranoia, and confusion and a movie industry that was willing to deal with it to deal with such topics at this time. <br /> <br /> Seen on this channel, a great network that plays many old films of the 70s to 90s of political inclination.
