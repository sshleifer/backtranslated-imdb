I read a comment that called this movie "garbage" and "waste of time." I think that person has pulled their political underwear a bit too much. <br /> <br /> I just rented the new Criterion DVDs from Yellow and Blue. <br /> <br /> These films are - though not terrific - at least of historical interest in the so-called "radical students" of the recent political-social movement of the 1960's. <br /> <br /> I had neither seen a picture nor expected her notorious reputation for expecting <br /> <br /> real porn (there is not one.) There are frontal <br /> <br / > Nudity (including the still-banned frontal male nudity (automatic <br /> <br /> NC-17 - the Orwellian-X) in the US But I did not expect the movies. <br /> in-your -face Democratic Socialist Embassy. <br /> <br /> Although it's rather simplistic, I thought it occasionally <br /> <br /> made its points well Both films had occasional I laughed aloud and the comment the director made it clear that there was a lot of parody in the film, especially the supp ola "pornographic" sex scenes.The first such scene is very realistic.The main couple is <br /> <br /> awkward, awkward, funny and lovable in his first copulation scene. <br /> <br /> The second - which caused the most complaints - was <br /> counterfeited C unnilingus and fellatio. And the last is the end of an angry fight that is believable. The extras include an informative introduction to the film, a <br /> <br /> interview with the original American distributor and lawyer, <br /> <br /> extract from court hearings in the US, and a "journal" commentary br /> <br /> from the director in some scenes. <br /> <br /> This is the movie that "Blue Noses" did not abandon and to the <br /> <br /> authoritative "urgent interest without social redemption value" standard <br /> <br / Fortunately, it still stands. <br /> <br /> Those who are interested in the quirks of history will find this a must <br /> <br />.
