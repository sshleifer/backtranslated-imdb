He surprised me because I was often disappointed by Adrian Pasdar in the past, but he found the perfect balance in the performance, avoiding both farce and pathos and showing humor and real emotion. The always wonderful Julie Waters is great, and anyone who did not put her on stage at Educating Rita in 1983 should rent it right away (wonderful movie). The rest of the minor characters is also well played, many wonderfully eccentric, without surpassing it. That is fun.
