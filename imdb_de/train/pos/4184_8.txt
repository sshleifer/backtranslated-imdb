Some war films succeed where others do not, and that can be judged from different angles. The humanistic point of view, in which one can feel the raw emotions (fear of attacks, the camaraderie among soldiers, the tedious tests to which people are exposed in a fight, etc.) are always films that I find captivating. Movies like The Boat and A Midnight Clear are just two examples of movies where you feel connected to the characters in the movie. <br /> <br /> This film is also successful at this level. It speaks of "The Highest Honor" and that honor does the right thing. These 23 soldiers did the right thing, they had honor and it is recognized in a way that is totally incompatible with Western thinking, but it is a true honorary story to the end. Unforgettable movie. Based on a true story.
