This is a great movie, if you look at it in the right context - it should be a parody of teen horror devil worship movies (and the 80's have seen many of them)! I saw this movie when it first came out and I liked it right away. As a big KISS fan, it was great to see Gene in the movie. And anything with OZZY as a Metal Hate preacher can not be all bad! Fastway was already a favorite of mine so it was great to hear her on the soundtrack. <br /> <br /> The original VHS cover (this was a pre-DVD) for Trick Or Treat contained an illustration of Sammi's knees, playing his guitar in a ring of fire with a "demon" watching. It was a special order, and the price for the VHS copy at that time (about 1987) was $ 90! I really wanted the movie, but not for that ridiculous price. The cover of "OZZY genes" was created for the 5 USD re-release only. The company that published it probably guessed that Gene and OZZY were the only recognizable people in the movie, so they better put it on the cover! The same goes for the original "Little Shop Of Horrors" - Jack Nicholson was in it for five minutes, but now they have him on the cover as if he were the main star. <br /> <br /> I have a "Trick Or Treat" website, and it's amazing how many people think Sammi Curr was a real person! Fastway helped to perpetuate this myth by dedicating their soundtrack album Sammi Curr. All in all, it was just a good time Rock N Roll movie. Not to be taken too seriously, but it was just fun!
