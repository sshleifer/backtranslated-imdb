If you've seen Dogtown and Z-Boys, or are interested in seeing America's real, non-karatic, "real American" side, Riding Giants will beat deeper than anything you've seen before. <br /> <br /> This film is "unreal", a light expression, if ever there was one, but very suitable, if it can be derived from a literal meaning - it is a 100% factual documentation, but with the whole drama of an opera. and the utterly obvious sense of love, the expert and worth knowing of Stacy Peralta's guidance and narration, expertly takes you from the wave to the great wave in this film, captivating you in everything that gives you the privilege of seeing it Film is a symphony that was produced just like Beethoven's Ninth. It starts off wonderfully in Hawaii, moves deep into human emotions in Santa Cruz, and ends with riot, triumph and crescendo in Laird Hamilton's talent in Hawaii. <br /> <br /> Like classical music; Like Beethoven's 9th Ride of Valkyries or Barber's Adagio for Strings, this may be the only piece you like, but it's worth it. Trust me.
