Simply great movie without a doubt. Great story and great performances, be it Amitabh, Akshay, Shefali, Priyanka, Boman or Rajpal. The Hindi film industry is shameless with Mallika and Co, this film is completely free of vulgarity and therefore inevitably fails in vulgarity-hungry Indian society. But the message and the concept of this film are absolutely outstanding. Anu Malik (boring imitators) could have been avoided and Ismail Darbar or Himmesh Reshmmiya could be used as musicians. I think Vipul Shah should have given some Gujarati touch especially in the music. Anu Malik is the worst musician and he considers himself a pop star, but this is not the movie where presence was in demand. He just looks good with Govinda songs. I felt that some nice serious music with some good ghazals or sad songs could have made this movie more memorable.
