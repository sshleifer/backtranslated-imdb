I was overwhelmed by the rediscovered Battlestar Galactica, a show that kept me guessing and moved to tears on more than one occasion. As a die-hard science fiction fan, I think I can pick the good stuff out of the BS, and that was good. <br /> <br /> When I heard of the prospect of a prequel series for the first time A few months ago I had a sick feeling in my stomach. I was afraid that the formula that made Battlestar so successful would be reused in Caprica, which would not work at all. BSG's story of a sad, ragged group of survivors trapped aboard staggering starships and led by prophetic visions and a succession of pseudo-miracles has been perfectly complemented by extraordinary music and a better cast of actors. Caprica feels different. Where BSG takes place after the fall of a great civilization, Caprica portrays this civilization in its cold and decadent heyday. The general atmosphere I received from Caprica was similar to that of the minority report, except for excessive and counterproductive theatricality. In true BSG form, Caprica has already tackled the problems of religious freedom, racism, the moral of God's play and the nature of the human soul in the earliest hours of programming. The casting for Caprica is also excellent. Each character is unique and profound, from the obsessive and distant scientist who became an entrepreneur to his troubled and headstrong daughter, every actor and actress throws herself into their respective roles. <br /> <br /> Music used in this way also plays an important role in the BSG in Caprica. Battlestar's powerful compactors and sad Duduks served his subjects very well. Caprica uses a more orchestral sound that gives the show its own feel, which is quite different from its predecessors. <br /> <br /> The new Caprica is definitely a show of its own and only pulls out as much of the Battlestar series as it needs. I am looking forward to the complete series.
