I would not have known about this film, if not for its "surprising" Oscar nomination for the best animated film. Luckily, I was able to watch this animated little treasure. <br /> <br /> The story is about the child Brendan, the nephew of the imposing and overprotective abbot of Kells. The most important occupation of the abbot is the construction of a wall to protect Kells from the attacking Vikings. One day, Aiden, the renowned illustrator from Iona, took refuge with them. Aiden opens Brendan's eyes to the art of illustration and the lure of the outside world. Along the way, Brendan became friends with the white forest spirit Aisling as he sought to find an ancient crystal that is invaluable to the meticulous art of book illustration these days. It is a kind of retrogression, as the illustrations are executed in strict geometrical lines and in the design without much regard for realism and symbolism. The movements of these lines are reminiscent of the simple but flowing animation style used in the opening sequence of "Kung Fu Panda". However, it is the great use of color that is the main source of wonder for the audience. The reds used in the Viking invasion sequence are unforgettably haunting. <br /> <br /> Try to catch this quiet gem of a movie. It is a welcome respite from all the pointless bombast of current animated fare like Monsters vs. Aliens and the like. The sparse Celtic film music evokes the sense of fantasy that permeates the film. OK, the story could be a bit flat and the end a bit to be desired. I would like to know more about the book Brendan and Aiden worked on. However, the clear star of this film is clearly its amazing, stylized artwork based on the artwork of the real Book of Kells.
