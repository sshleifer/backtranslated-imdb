I personally love this movie and this novel (I first read the book and decided to watch the movie). First, the plot is truly original and unique. Acting is great too and I love the cast. Judd Crandall (plays Fred Gwynne) fits perfectly with his role and really sells it. There are also some crazy lines thrown in there (idk if they're crazy), but they really will lighten the mood and make a good laugh. The Maine atmosphere is really a perfect place to film this movie, and somehow pulls you through the movie. You will not only love it, but you will want to see it again and again, I recommend it to every horror fan 100% !!
