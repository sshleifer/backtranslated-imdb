Bela made 9 pictures for Monogram, but it was not until DIESEM, the 4th, that things started to run. The rest of the series would use this as an essential template for production, writing and character development. From now on, the series would also occupy itself with an essential topic: A scientist (usually Bela) performs experiments in the basement or in the old house (sometimes in the cellar in the old house), where things go wrong. This was also the first time that art director Dave Milton had the chance to spread his wings. He came on board for BLACK DRAGONS, the strip previously, but at this point he can begin his crafting click. Lewis did not have a great atmosphere for almost anything and was there for all the other monograms. Casting is the key here, and it's a pretty good movie. They receive Barclay and Harlen (also from BLACK DRAGONS), along with Russell, who would star in Lewton's CAT PEOPLE films and Rosetto by SPOOKS RUN WILD - a beautiful piece of the Poverty Row talent. If you have limited time and budget, start with it ... it summarizes everything you have learned so far and gives you the comparison with the rest. The plot? Bela steals gland juice to keep his evil wife young. They both like to sleep in coffins. If you can read that and smile, the rest will be easy.
