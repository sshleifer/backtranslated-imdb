*** Possible spoilers *** <br /> <br /> I saw this movie recently with my eleven-year-old son and was pleased that he laughed in the right places and was thrilled with the action sequences. Ron Ely is exactly right as Doc. Cool, calm, almost always under control (and occasionally with a wink). What more can you ask for? I have never read a Doc Savage book, so I do not know if it is true to the source, but I enjoyed the light tone and the mocking. Many people compared this movie to Raiders of the Lost Ark, which I do not consider fair. The budget difference is amazing (Raiders have to be at least 10 times the budget). Doc Savage does not have the extensive site work that Raiders has. Special effects are also kept to a minimum, but people matter, the story is fun and the humor is just right. The Sousa music is catchy (I love this theme song.) Every time I watch the movie, I mumbled the subject together for days). Highlights include the thrilling opening sequence where the fabulous Five and Doc chase the Indian sniper through the rooftops of New York, and the very funny fighting sequence between Doc and Captain Seas. Not so good is the villain who sleeps in a huge crib (really!). Overall, a great movie that you can see on a rainy day. I give 7 out of 10 points. <br /> <br /> Doc Savage, Doc Savage ... thank the Lord, he is here!
