.... after 16 years Tim Burton finally disappoints me !!!! What happened to old Burton, who read "The Dark Knight Returns" by Frank Miller as research for his preparation for Batman in 1988-89? As it stands, Burton did not research the book or the movie because he got everything WRONG! This movie is shit! It is not as good as the original and does not deal with the same theme as the original. If you want a good monkey movie, look at the original. <br /> <br /> ** of **** stars
