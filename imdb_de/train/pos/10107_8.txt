"Ardh Satya" is one of the most beautiful films ever shot in Indian cinema. Under the direction of great director Govind Nihalani, this is the most successful Hard Hitting Parallel Cinema, which also turned out to be a commercial success. Ardh Satya is still an inspiration to all the leading directors of India today. The film tells the real scenario of the Mumbai police of the 70s. Unlike any other police in India, the police in Mumbai have a different system altogether. Govind Nihalani creates a very practical outlay with a real approach to the police environment in Mumbai. <br /> <br /> Among various police officers and colleagues, the film describes the story of Anand Velankar, a young, hot-blooded policeman who comes from a poor family. His father is a strict police officer. Anand himself suffers from his father's ideologies and the incidents of his father's atrocities with his mother. Anand's approach to cracking down on crime is a lethargic desire for job satisfaction. The film revolves around a plot in which Anand's constant efforts against crime are trampled down by his seniors. This leads to frustration because he can not achieve the desired job satisfaction. Due to the frustration, his anger manifests itself in excessive force in the examination rooms and bars and also makes him an alcoholic. The spirit in him is still alive because he is constantly fighting against the system. He is aware of the Metro system, where police and politicians are inextricably linked. His compromise with unethical practice is negative. Finally he is suspended. <br /> <br /> The Direction is a masterpiece and a thoroughly hard core. One of the best memorable scenes is when Anand interrupts in the house of gangster Rama Shetty to arrest him, followed by a brief conversation, which is fantastic. In many scenes, the film has hair-raising moments. <br /> <br /> The practical approach of Script is a big hit. Alcoholism, corruption, political influence, courage and deception are still an integral part of Mumbai police today. These aspects are treated brilliantly. <br /> <br /> Finally, the films belong to the one-man show. Om Puri plays Anand Velankar, who crosses all his emotions absolutely brilliantly.
