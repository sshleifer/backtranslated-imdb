This movie is beautifully designed! There are no shortcomings. Not in the design of the set, the lighting, the sounds, the plot. The script is an invitation to a complex game in which the participants are on a simple mission. <br /> <br /> Paxton is best in this role. His mannerisms, the infections that are used in the tones of his voice, are without error. Every shot made meticulous! Surprises turn up one after another when the movie has passed its first hour. This may not be the best picture of the year, but it's a jewel that has been polished very well. It is not for the simple mind.
