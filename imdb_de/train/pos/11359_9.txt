Citizen X tells the real drama of finding a serial killer named "The Rostov Ripper" This great movie shows the long journey required to capture a killer. The film shows how politics may have helped the killer romp for over 12 years. (Possibly more than 50 victims, mostly women and children) The achievements of Stephen Rea as chief investigator and of Donald Sutherland as overall investigator were outstanding. Jeffrey DeMunn as the Ripper Andrei Romanovich Chikatilo. This is the kind of movie that will fascinate you and immediately search the Internet for the true case. This film may not be missing. It debuted I believe in HBO and have never received a theatrical release for my understanding. Excellent movie
