As the jacket proclaims, this film is "gloriously filmed and masterfully edited" and yes, it is fascinatingly beautiful. The timelessness that we perceive in the Stoic rocks and in the perpetual ebb and flow of the water, frames the cursory works of Goldsworthy, so that they point to eternity in their transience. And so the beauty of his compositions pursue us with a touch of melancholy - or in the words of Matthew Arnold from "Dover Beach": <br /> <br /> Listen! you hear the crunching sound of the pebbles that pull back and spin the waves, on their return up the high strand, begin and stop, and then start again, with trembling cadence slowly, bringing in the eternal touch of sadness. <At a point near the end of the film, Goldsworthy says that "words do their job, but what I'm doing here says a lot more." As a word maker, I'm not offended, and for a moment I do not think him immodest, because the combination of form and time and change, and texture and color and composition that Goldsworthy painstakingly and intuitively creates, is indeed more than words can say. <br /> <br /> At another point, he remarks, "What's left ... and what's not?" That's his topic. <br /> <br /> I think that sometime in the twentieth century artists became acutely aware of how transiently even the greatest works of art are compared to the vast expanse of cosmic time. and so they began to reflect that understanding by deliberately composing short-lived works. The idea was that by highlighting how transient the most powerful works of man are, a sense of the timelessness of art would be expressed. <br /> <br /> Perhaps part of the effectiveness of Goldsworthy's work is in this type of expression. He laboriously puts together a form of straw or leaves where the tide will reach it, or lays it in the river where it is swept away; and in this process both composition and transience are united. <br /> <br /> Both the transient and the timeless are necessary to understand our world and our place in it. And it is important that these works are performed in the context of nature so that the composition is integrated into the natural. So the stone walls and the stone eggs that Goldsworthy constructs are calm and solid, but we know that they are not monuments to eternity, but instead remain for an indefinite time and then disperse and return to a state akin to that similar to that existed before we came. <br /> <br /> This is art that should be art, similar to the spiritual one. <br /> <br /> In a way, Goldsworthy's work is an incoherent understanding. It is a pure experience of time and form. In a sense, his work "answers" Shelley's famous poem, "Ozymandia," by saying that even if the tide washes away the work and even if the river dissipates the expression, art continues to live on our experience Tibetan sand paintings, which have been so carefully assembled and measured, and then, when finished so beautifully and preciously, they are given to the wind, so we know that everything is flow.> In the modern world, however, these works of art consist of photos and photographs Videos Goldsworthy is an accomplished photographer (I would say so), and all his works, even the unsuccessful ones, are photographed so he can look at them in a more reflective mood and see what he has achieved and achieves did not have. <br /> <br /> This cinematic production of Thomas Riedelsheimer with the beautiful and correspondingly haunting music of Fred Frith is not too great It's one of the most beautiful documentaries I've ever seen and one of the most spiritual.
