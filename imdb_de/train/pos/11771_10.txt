Great entertainment from start to finish. Wonderful performances by Belushi, Beach, Dalton & Railsback. Some twists and many action scenes. The movie was made for me! Funny lines in the script, good music. Dalton as hard sheriff and railsback as "redneck villain". I have to recommend this movie to any action-adventure fan! 10/10
