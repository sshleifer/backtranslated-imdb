That was a soul excitement! I am an Iranian and I live in the 21st century. I did not know that such great tribes lived under such conditions in my grandfather's time! In 1925, on one side of the world, a woman or a baby could have everything clean and on demand, but here, 80 years ago, people dared to go somewhere with more grass. It is really interesting that these Persians endure these difficulties to find pasture for their sheep, but they lose many sheep on their way.
