This movie is like a 1950 version of Ettore Scola's Brutti sporchi e cattivi. Less sex and less realism, but a story with great humanism and cordiality. I would not call that a neorealistic picture. It is very sentimental and more like a fairy tale and should probably be considered a comedy even though it is serious stuff (a bit like Chaplin or 1930 comedy). Typically Italian, very emotional and hard to resist, except for a person who is just cold. Sentimentalism is a failure, though this picture should not be a realistic drama. It's not a masterpiece like Umberto D or The Bicycle Thief. But it's a lovely and funny comedy with good music. <br /> <br /> 7/10
