Breaking Glass is a movie that anyone who wants to be in the music industry should see more than once. It's a very dark story about the way a record company manipulates a singer to do things her way and make as much money as possible with her. When I look at some of today's "Looking for a Star" movie in the UK and abroad, I am always reminded of this movie. Although they are not an expert on this subject, the winners of these shows tend to make a very big first hit, and then it goes downhill. This movie precedes these shows, though the effect is the same. After getting rid of her manager, who was played quite brilliantly by Phil Daniels, the record company is slowly changing, but her lyrics put her on stimulants. Your potential stars of tomorrow ... SEE THIS AND NOTE !!!
