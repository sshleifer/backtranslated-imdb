LOL !!! Delirious was so funny .. I was in tears. Eddie Murphy's impressions are absolutely right. The best impression was of James Brown and Mr. T> SO FUNNY !! It's weird how Eddie Murphy was then, and how DELIRIOUS is now, a must, but if you do not like bad language, do not watch, BUT AMAZING AND SO FUNNY Every time. This is Eddie Murphy's best and you can see where he got the humor and ideas from movies like the crazy professor. He also makes impressions of his family, which is really funny. <br /> <br /> if only I had been there ...
