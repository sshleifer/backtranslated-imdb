I had read about FLAVIA THE HERETIC for many years, but I did not see it until the beginning of last year, when I went on an insane frenzy, and for whatever reason, it has been bothering me lately, although it is I have not been there for several months. <br /> <br /> It is a remarkable movie that takes place somewhere in the 15th century in Italy. Definitely Middle Ages (though I believe that no particular year will ever be given). This is the time of the Christian ascension, age is a time of madness and the film shows this very well. <br /> <br /> Flavia, our protagonist, is a young lady who meets a fallen Muslim on a battlefield. He seems to be a warm-hearted and intriguing guy, and she's taken home right away. Her father, a soldier from a family of some, comes by almost immediately and murders the wounded right before their eyes. But she will continue to see him in her dreams. <br /> <br /> Her father takes her to a monastery that looks more like a madhouse in the open air - the inhabitants, who are so oppressed by relentless medieval Christianity, slowly go crazy. Flavia is under the influence of one of the craziest nuns. But in a crazy world, only the sensible are really crazy, and this sociopathic sister clearly recognizes the madness around her. Her attitude toward the times in which she lives meets Flavia with Flavia, who seems as young and seemingly protected, to question everything in the world in which she finds herself. <br /> <br /> The film is tireless in its depiction of this world, which shows a lot of inconvenience. We see a horse with gelding, a lord who rapes one of his country's women in a pigsty, the pious torture of a young nun. In all of this, Flavia observes and questions the Christian dogma that creates such a parody of terror, which seems to criticize the film over the years because it seems anachronistic. I do not agree with this review. Flavia's views, though sometimes expressed in a way that reflects, for example, the then-contemporary feminist commentary (the film was made in 1974) revolve around really obvious questions. It may be hard to believe that in her own time she might be as much a fish out of the water, but that's the kind of incidental thing she does not do to work. Flavia is written in such a way that those of our time or any era can empathize with their plight. If you nailed yourself to such a thing, you would miss the forest for the trees. <br /> <br /> Flavia is encouraged when Muslims invade the country and find in their leader a new version of the Pretty Islamist who is still visiting her dreams. Almost instantly in love with her, he allows her to virtually lead his army, becomes a Joan of Arc figure in full combat gear, and instructs the invaders to tear down the Christian society and take revenge on all those who do Seeing evil commit /> <br /> Is she the herald of a new and better world? She may think so, but Muslims of this era were not so important in feminism either, as she soon learns the hard way. As you say, you meet the new boss ... <br /> <br /> This is really just a small selection of the things that happen in FLAVIA THE HERETIC. The movie is pretty bleak and has a very rundown, rather depressing ending. Certainly not a mass audience. It's pretty good, though, and it does not belong on the "nonsploitation" stack, which is often carelessly thrown at. I think the last movie has a lot of value, and I'm glad I saw it.
