If you are looking for a realistic movie or a movie with a strong and credible storyline, then this movie is NOT for you. No, you will hate it. For those who like sweet, a little screwball comedy, it will be a great time to watch this petty movie. Tony Randall works for the IRS and he's looking into a very nice farmer who has never noticed him required to file an income tax return. As much as he tries to convince them of the seriousness of his visit, everyone in the family is thrilled to have company. They have focused on him and treat him like a family member ... and intend to take him to their daughter Debbie Reynolds. That's really all about the plot that exists. But the film gets high grades for a witty script and decent acting. A really nice little curio from the late 1950s.
