They spend most of this two-hour movie asking, "What's the main character story?" <br /> <br /> Will Smith, as an inconspicuous "Ben Thomas", will advise you to guess. The last 20 to 25 minutes is when you find out, and it's a shock ... but you knew something dramatic would be revealed. Until then, Smith plays it mysterious and almost persecutes people. You know he has a good reason to do it, but it's never been explained again that we're guessing right up to the end. <br /> <br /> Anything, including a renewed back and forth, but a touching romance with Rosario Dawkins ("Emily Posa") might make some viewers frustrated or want to leave the movie ... but not because the last one long segment all the pieces of this puzzle put together. <br /> <br /> This is a two-hour movie and not the typical action-macho movie by Will Smith. In fact, the most shocking aspect of this story could be Smith's drawn, sad face. It almost does not look like it in some shots. He looks like he lost weight and is sick. Smith does a great job and shows a man who carries a lot of sadness with him. <br /> <br /> As a good movie is often enough, this movie will make you think a long time after the credits.
