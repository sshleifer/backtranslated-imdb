Perhaps not the absolute greatest contributor to the Hammer House of Horror series, but it certainly wins the prize for the most invented episode! "The house that bleeds to death"? I could scream this title all day without ever getting tired! In addition to the wonderful title, this short film also benefits from a solid script and a handful of really exciting moments. It may require extra consideration before you fully understand the peculiar final twist, but it's definitely an original idea for a horror short. The story begins with pictures of an elderly couple drinking tea in his bourgeois home. The husband sadistically kills his wife and a few years later the "damned" house is still for sale. A young couple and their cherubic daughter move in and begin to restore it, but mysterious events occur, and especially affect young Sophie. Her beloved cat is killed and even her birthday party is ruined when suddenly one of the house's pipes spits blood on the guests (a particularly detestable episode, this!). Is the old house really being tracked? Or maybe the seemingly helpful neighbors cause the whole horror? The answers to these questions can be found in the original and fairly unpredictable climax and there is even room for a real shock at the very end. The tension is masterful and the titular house is full of sinister landscapes, like the pair of rusty machetes with which the man killed his wife. Little warning, the sequence with the cat is hard to observe if you are animal lover. Finally, a winner for Hammer's short-running TV series!
