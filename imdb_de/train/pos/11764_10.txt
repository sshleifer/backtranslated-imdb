I saw this in the theater in 1986 and fell out of my chair more than once. "Beirut" ... "What do you know about Beirut?" ... "Beirut ... he's the best damned baseball player ever to live." <br /> <br /> It's a great time to get there. The training scenes are very funny, but the best scene is possibly the scene where Jack and Reno try to play the Monday football game Falcons. Vikings as they try a make-up dinner with their wives. <br /> <br /> Williams and Russell seem to have a lot of fun with it, and it is a pity that they are overlooked as a first-class comedy.
