I did not expect much when I saw the DVD cover for the first time. I mean, Pierce Brosnan as Gray Owl? <br /> <br /> Ah ... but then the story began, unfolding in a beautifully photographed and moving film. I was surprised and pleased with this (essentially) true story. I wanted to read more about this fascinating character, that is, the director has served his purpose and the movie was a success!
