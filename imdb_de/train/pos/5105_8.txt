How can anyone deny the fact that Urban Cowboy was and is still the best document of Texan life for this period. Consider the following: Men beat their wives, getting drunk every night in bars, marrying, arguing, committing adultery, and competing with mechanical bulls. Try and name a movie that portrays real life so alive. They do not do it anymore. Apparently, current films are always people with a lot of money, living in huge houses, driving expensive cars and not working. This movie has a festive scene about getting a trailer for Pitet's sake! Seriously. I split this movie from end to end. Feel free to email me to learn more about why I call it Documentary. Look at the following scenes: Bud sees Sissy - they are split - he honks and waves friendly, she kills him the bird - he gives half the peace sign back and honks his horn to amplify the effect, then it snaps off Bud's mother Call him approximately. 18 hours after moving into town, on a Sunday, to see if he still has a job - all he has achieved is getting drunk and laying (x2), with the help of his uncle and aunt, who care for him <br /> "They all live like pigs" Think about why this scene is needed. Think about it. Was it necessary? Could not we find out without showing the dirty sink? God, I love that! <br /> <br /> Sissy allows Wes to help her with bull riding. Just a couple of days (or maybe the next day) after Wes just threw the shit out of her husband. Steve asks: Hey Sissy, do you remember Wes? Oh yes, you did not beat my husband the other day, so let's start this lesson, not to mention that later in one of the many bouts of Bud and Sissy, he seeks solace in him, all by the way - in Gilleys ! <br /> <br /> The wedding reception session (oh mankind!) could at least arrange it or move the chairs away. "My legs sweat in Momma" <br /> <br /> Finally, do not include scenes like these in a movie to try to give insight into human psychology. It is a documentation of real life. <br /> <br /> I just wish there was a director's cut ...
