I caught this movie on TV. Last night and you know that Danny Masterson was a pretty good actor in the movie, and it's great to see him in something other than this 70's show. The movie is not rated, but in my opinion I would rate it (R) only because of the nudity and the many adult content. But all in all, what I loved, I thought Dirt's Wisecracks were pretty funny. It's basically just about a man who has no job, no girlfriend or money and finally gets a job as a private investigator (actually rather a messenger) The people who really need to help him. I give it .... *** 3 stars.
