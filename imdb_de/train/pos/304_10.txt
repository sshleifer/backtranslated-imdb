I saw it a few years ago. I remembered very mysterious situations and a mixture of melancholy things, like the fate of Dorothy and the personal future of Bogdanovich. <br /> <br /> I turn around and look at my VHS copy and more. Nowadays I am waiting for the DVD version, at any price! <br /> <br /> The country and easy listening music is very well chosen from the first second, a bit bluish, but also happy /> <br /> All characters are great for me, with funny situations, great actors and many dialogues that have made this a cult movie for me and many people I met on the internet or in movie clubs. This may not be a loss. <br /> <br /> I think the title is a hope for life! You must be happy and laugh as much as possible. <br /> <br /> I know that this may be a special comment for the movie, but the fact is that I really like it. I think this movie has me and I will never forget it.
