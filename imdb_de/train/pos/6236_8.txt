The plot intelligence is about as easy as a down. But the benefit here is the classic rejection of boys and girls we got used to in "The Gay Divorcee" and "Top Hat" is missing now. Instead of the typical chance acquaintance, the dance duo consists of the former lovers Bake Baker and Sherry Martin, who are still in love since their dance days misunderstood romance, stylish advertising and the slight irritation of a sabotaged audition with bicarbonate soda have cost Ginger something special. And in the grand tradition of dwindling finances, there's nothing better for Hollywood's best entertainer than showing a show. <br /> <br /> Throughout the show, splendid figures from Irving Berlin are being sprayed. Caps and evening dresses are kept until the end, which remains a refreshing change. Fred and Ginger are on their way again to charm the world ... and to charm the Navy. Everyone and everything is so beautiful again. <br /> <br /> Classical. But with Astaire and Rogers, we know it has to work. <br /> <br /> Rating: 8,25 / 10
