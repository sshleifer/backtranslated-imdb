Mary Tyler Moore and Valerie Harper can still turn the world on with their smile. The combined talent of these two wonderful stars makes this combination of reunion / new beginning film work. Take a look and look forward to meeting sixty! Maria resists with wit and charm of youth-oriented society. A hint of drama adds realism in 2000. A series of a television series would expand the new characters and give us the opportunity to occasionally see Lou Grant, Phyllis, Sue Ann, Murray and Georgette!
