Ira Levin's Death Trap is one of Sleuth's mystery films that would be very easy to ruin considering the plot of the movie's plot. So I'll be brief on a play, a man who's a famous mystery playwright, another man who is a promising writer, the dramatist's wife, who is much younger and sexier than the character should have been, and a German clairvoyant is there for the ride. For the most part, director Sidney Lumet, no stranger to the film industry, is pretty good at producing the excitement the film needs to drive. The dialogue is fast, fresh and funny. Michael Caine is characterized by such roles. Christopher Reeve is useful and actually grows with you the more you see him working. Irene Worth is a funny psychic. How about Dyan Cannon? I love how Lumet wrapped her rump in those snug-fitting pants and she probably wore the tight-fitting tops, but she's terribly mismanaged in that role - a role that an older actress should have given, and certainly less was seductive. But why with an obvious attempt to bribe his male audience, if it does not change anything now? The death trap is funny, sophisticated, funny and noble. The mystery has a few blatant distractions, and I was not quite happy with the end, but it was enough to watch Caine and Reeve under the direction of Lumet with Levin's sublime words to arouse my interest and the entire To keep the length of the film trapped.
