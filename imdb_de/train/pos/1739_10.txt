From the point of view of a NASCAR maniac as I am, the movie is interesting. You can see many racing cars from the year 1983. The racing scenes are not so realistic even in difficult situations. But I have to admit that I did not see a race before 1995 because they have not shown any NASCAR races in Germany in the past. <br /> <br /> from the point of view of a Burt Reynolds fan The movie is basically what we're used to from Reynolds in the 80's: Burt behind the wheel of a fast car, as in his bandit movies. If you love NASCAR and Burt Reynolds, this movie is a must. If you love just one of these two things, I recommend that you look at it. If you do not like NASCAR or Burt Reynolds, you should give it a try anyway, but remember, this movie was far from winning an Oscar. <br /> <br /> It's the typical humor of the 80s. If you like movies like Cannonball Movies and Police Academy, you will like them too.
