I'm obsessed! The story is incredible and the show is addictive, but I love it. I'm in Season 2, Disk 5, and I'm telling you that I'm too attached to the characters now. If something bad happens to you, it would seriously affect my voting for the show. And now Michael is on my list. Joke ... I'm so glad to see that there's a 3rd season, because I was too scared to go to Disk 6 because I thought it was going to end. I can not wait to see the rest now. Many thanks to the directors / producers / actors of Lost ... I like watching TV again. Before Lost, I surfed through each channel and sadly went to bed because of my disappointment on TV, but I have to say that Lost is my kind of entertainment!
