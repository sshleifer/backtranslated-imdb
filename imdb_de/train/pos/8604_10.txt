I know that many people do not like this movie, but I think it's adorable. I can not say much, but the movie is a good feeling. The songs are beautiful, the costumes are beautiful, the voices are beautiful and there are many funny lines in the movie, especially as Briggitta learns about the things of society. If you like musicals, I would say that you would like this one!
