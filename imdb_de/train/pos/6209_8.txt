When I heard for the first time that Hal Hartley did a sequel to Henry Fool, I was excited (a personal favorite for years), and then I was cautious when I heard it had something to do with terrorism. When I saw it, I was surprised it worked, though it was still a different kind of film than Henry Fool. The writing and the direction were both dead and the acting was great ... special kudos go to Hartley to assemble virtually the entire cast, to Henry's son, who was only four in the original. As I said, this movie is fundamentally different from the first movie, but it works. I have come to terms with the change of tone and theme with the fact that 10 years have passed and the characters have been in very different situations since the film ended first movie. In that case, an unexpected adventure follows ... and that's all I'll give away ... not to mention the fact that I need to see it again to really understand what's going on and who crosses twice. Although it was certainly one of the better movies I've seen in quite some time, it suffers many episodes with its end, as it looks like Hartley is now planning a third plan and the movie will hang you. I'm sure to buy my tickets for Part 3 ('Henry Grim'?) 2017.
