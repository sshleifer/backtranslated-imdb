I saw an advanced screening for this movie tonight. I absolutely loved it. The movie kept me on the edge of the seat all night. Cillian Murphy is extremely scary as a villain. For those of you who have seen Batman Begins, his character in this movie was much more frightening. He played his character very well. The scariest "bad guy" I've seen for some time. Rachel McAdams was great. Everyone in the audience laughed, gasped and cheered at the same time as if we were on a cue. The tension is held through the film. The amazing thing is that the end was not anti-climatic. I was not disappointed in the end. I felt satisfied. The trailer does not do the film justice. The movie is much better than the given trailer. Do not wait for this movie to appear on video. Look at it. Although I did not have to pay for this movie, I would have liked to give him 10:75. Enjoy!
