Those who are interested in pop music and do not know the British music trends of the late seventies should at least watch Breaking Glass. The film about the aspiration of a young woman to make a name for herself in the music world perfectly captures the times, from open sexism to rough economic times, social upheavals to the shift of pop culture from rough punk to terrible punk and sophisticated futurism / new romanticism , The music and fashion styles created daily in the UK in the late 1970s are still being rediscovered and recycled (since 1980 there is nothing new). This was a dazzling time, and Breaking Glass tells a very personal story, overlooking the cultural landscape and doing both extremely well.
