The story of the Boydieb of Baghdad (as it was once written) attracted Raoul Walsh's filmmakers in 1924, who played Douglas Fairbanks in the first, silent portrayal of "Thief of Baghdad" for less imposing, more recent attempts. Best of all, however, is the 1940s version, which in its day was an amazing, magical selection of special effects of the highest quality. These effects still have their charm. <br /> <br /> No fewer than six directors will be screened for the Technicolor movie in which Sabu was listed as the young thief, Abu, John Justin as the dreamy monarch in love, Ahmad and June Duprez as the lovable princess who Ahmad searched and was persecuted by the evil Vizier Jaffar, played by a sinister Conrad Veidt. The giant genius is cleverly traded by Rex Ingram. Ahmad is tricked by Jaffar, and when he is later arrested by this treacherous serpent, he and boy Abu suffer an apparently incompetent fate. Ahmad becomes blind and Abu becomes a lovable mutt. Their adventures through the cheerfully decorated Hollywood backlots are fun, but the special effects make this movie a success. Two men were responsible for everything, from a magical flying carpet to the gigantic spirit that pops out of a bottle with a tornado-like black swirl: Lawrence W. Butler and Tom Howard. (Howard, by the way, did the special effects for the 1961 version of this film, both men had long and notable careers in technical wizardry.) Duprez is exceedingly friendly, while she's not prone to serious acting. Justins Ahmad projects a driven but dreamy romance that is untouched by erotic impulses. Sabu is the lead actor in many scenes and he is very good. For a movie intended for both children and adults, there is a lot of violence, but of a bloodless nature. However, I do not think anyone under the age of eight should see "Thief of Baghdad". <br /> <br /> This film appears regularly on television but today my young son and I have seen him in a theater group with quite a few teenagers present. It was great to see computer-assisted children in a wealthy community responding to special effects with cheers and applause, which must seem primitive to them. <br /> <br /> "Thief of Baghdad" is a pre-war Hollywood classic from Hollywood time, where strong production values ​​often led to consistently attractive and important releases. This is one of the best of its kind. <br /> <br /> 9/10.
