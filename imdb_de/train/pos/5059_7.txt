We looked at the video and found it fascinating. Without knowing anything about this true story, I thought, "Oh no, P. Rosnan as an Indian (red indian in the movie), what a bad choice" until I discovered the truth about Gray Owl. The film does a good job of demonstrating the dignity of these indigenous peoples and undermining the racist myths about them. And Annie Galipeau, WOW, what a beauty and very convincing as an Indian (I think she's French-Canadian, she sure returns to the all-too-familiar talk of it). Despite Brosnan's distant, grunty style, he convinces in the end as a passionate, committed man. The conspiracy from the trapper to the animal coservationist is a bit weak. Good movie, highly recommended.
