Very smooth, very Pre-Hays code and still very naughty. I would highly recommend this movie, even if you are not a fan of Stynwyck. She is funny, she is sexy, she is hardworking - and she loves to get bored! <br /> <br /> Barbara Stynwyck is fantastic as a doozie of a hovering, rising in the world, perfectly represented by a bank building. John Wayne (in a suit!) Perform one of her first conquests. <br /> <br /> The last three minutes are a disappointment, but the sets, the lines and the clothes add to a big problem when the film rises vertically in a horizontal position.
