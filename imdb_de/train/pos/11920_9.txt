Christopher Lloyd is funny and credible as "Al the head angel". This movie is much better than the first, but it has great special effects that the first one did not have as well as a much better plot and script. <br /> <br /> OK - it was written for children, but for adults as much fun as the kids. Tony Danza does a very realistic job in his role - but this is NOT a taxi reunion. Danny Glover is really good and even seems to be very human in his emotions, and also shows a real acting talent for a change of variety. <br /> <br /> Look around at least once - it's worth catching.
