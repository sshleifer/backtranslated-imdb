My Name is Julia Ross is a toothy little potboiler whose 65-minute length is not a second too short. He goes back to an English tradition where things are not what they seem - Hitchcock's The Lady Vanishes is an example. Out of Work Julia Ross (Nina Foch) finds a dream job at a new employment agency in London, whose eerie representative seems to be very curious about whether she has living relatives or a boyfriend. After reporting for duty, she wakes up in a huge Manderley-like pile on the Cornish coast, allegedly as Barmy-in-the-Crumpet's wife of George Macready, who displays an alarming interest in knives and ice axes. His dazzling mother who encourages courage is the irresistible Lady May Whitty (this time a model of buzzing efficiency on the other side of good vs. evil when she was employed in The Lady Vanishes). The nightmare vision of this story unfolds claustrophobic; We know what's going on, but we can not tell poor Julia. Strangely, this film is regularly honored as one of the first (and very few British) Noir films. I think it's closer to the tradition of the gothic old-dark house than the American one of wet cobblestones and urban corruption. However, it shows a more modern psychoanalytic way of thinking. Whatever you call it, it remains a very satisfying thriller.
