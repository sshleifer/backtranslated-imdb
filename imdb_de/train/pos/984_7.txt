One night I came across "bait" on cable when it started, and thought, "Eh, why not?" I'm glad I gave him a chance. <br /> <br /> "Bait" is not perfect. It suffers from unnecessarily conspicuous direction and occasional stupidity. But overall, this movie has worked. All the elements were exactly the same and they broke off what otherwise could have been a pretty ugly movie. <br /> <br /> I think most of it is Jamie Foxx. I do not know who picked Foxx for the lead role, but whoever it was did a great deal for this movie. Credible and incredibly likeable, Foxx glides through the movie, as smooth as butter and more funnier than hell. You notice that he is working on instinct, and his instinct does not dry up. <br /> <br /> The plot, though unimportant, actually blends well, and there's even a character sheet that grows Foxx's character as a person. They could have got rid of everything without it, but it just makes things much better. <br /> <br /> I'm surprised about the low rating. Maybe I caught this train just in the right night or vice versa, but I would give it a 7/10. Bravo, Mssr. Foxx.
