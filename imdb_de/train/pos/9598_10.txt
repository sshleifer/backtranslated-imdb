I followed the journey two years ago on the internet - now I have seen the movie !! What a ride! And what a journey to finally get to know Darius Weems! Such a brave, wise, witty and talented spirit! And what a crew! Listening to Darius as he laughed in the water in Panama City, seeing how disturbed he was to be too close to alligators in Louisiana, the wonder in his eyes as he drove in a hot air balloon, the excitement of rafting through some rapids I bet to eat a spoonful of wasabi, and the phone calls home, and as always boys will be boys. This movie has to be seen by everyone - young and old. Darius and his mother are role models for strength and courage. And the crew members testify to the heart of the younger generation. They got Darius a new wheelchair. they documented problems with accessibility; They took Darius along on the journey of his life. and they touched many, many lives. By raising awareness of DMD and promoting research, this film will help achieve the ultimate goal of Darius Goes West - a cure for DMD.
