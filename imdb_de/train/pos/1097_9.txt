I gave up on "Mr. Blandings Building His Dream House" 10/10 because we feel a bit excited in the 21st century: the fact that a black man is the faithful servant (reminiscent of Stepin Fetchit). But otherwise the movie is a shout. Jim (Cary Grant) and Muriel Blandings (Myrna Loy) from New York, who want to build a house in Connecticut, have something for everyone to do just fine as a mere wife. But Melvyn Douglas adds some real laughs to Jim and Muriel's lawyer Bill Cole, who seems to have more plans than he makes clear. As far as the house itself is concerned, you will probably feel ambiguous throughout most of the movie, whether you want to live there or not. The builders, contractors and others also ensure a good mood. <br /> <br /> All in all a comedy classic. With Louise Beavers, Reginald Denny, Sharyn Moffett, Connie Marshall and Jason Robards Sr.
