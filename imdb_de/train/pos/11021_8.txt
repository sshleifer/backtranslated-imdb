After the success of Die Hard and its sequels, it's no surprise that in the 1990s, a flood of "Die Hard on a ...." films affected the wrong man, the wrong place, and the wrong time concept. That's what they did with Cliffhanger, Die Hard on a mountain just in time to save the career of Sly 'Stop or My Mom Will Shoot' Stallone. Cliffhanger is a big nitpicker dream, especially for those who are experts in mountaineering, base jumping, aviation, facial expressions and acting. All in all, it's full of excuses to turn the movie over as a pompous garbage pile. Stallone even managed to be outwitted by a horse! However, if you forget all the nonsense, it is indeed a very lovable and undeniably entertaining trumpet that provides just as much thrill and unintentionally much laughter. <br /> <br /> You have to love John Lithgow's taunting nausea, his tick in every box of bad guys, and best of all, the permanently bothered and hapless "Wendelrock" agent Rex Linn as Travers.

He insists on screaming in painful disbelief because this man has never hurt anyone, and although he certainly is not can really see how Frank von Waite character grins when the girl crashes to death. <br /> <br /> Also needs to mention the former "London's Burning" actor Craig Fairbrass as a British villain who comes as a Cropper Yeah, you can not help it, enjoy that little bit, Hal needed a good kick. <br /> <br /> So forget about your better judgment, who cares if "never does "lower your expectations, turn up the volume and enjoy!" And if you're looking for Qaulen, he'll carry the helicopter.
