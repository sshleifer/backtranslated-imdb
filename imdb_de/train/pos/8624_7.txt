What's the best way to review a movie like Deathking? Let me start by saying I've just come out of the movie and the images are still deeply engraved in my brain - and I do not think they'll move soon. <br /> <br /> It's probably fair to say you have a good idea of ​​what a movie is on this page, even if you have not seen it. If not, let me know that this is not a medium budget gem that has been lost as "Near Dark" for several years, nor is it a cheaper, fluffier, "fun" B movie. What is low-budget art, presented in a simple yet poignant way? The idea is simple - seven stories about suicides that end in suicides interspersed with shots of a crumbling corpse. Sounds right, even boring? It's not words that can not really describe how powerful this movie gets when you're halfway through; It really attracts you, whether you want to go or not. <br /> <br /> I could go for a walk here about the technical advantages and disadvantages of the direction; Perhaps point out that the scenes are obviously taken with Super 8 cameras and sometimes a bit blurry. I could point out that some of the sound effects can not keep up with the Fulci movies, but by the end of the day it all seems to fade into insignificance. <br /> <br /> So far I have seen the heaviest of them on extreme films, and yet Deathking has moved me in a way few others have succeeded in, though they are not particularly bloody and have few scenes which I would consider as "gratuitous". The most disturbing scene I found was the last story. I'm not going to ruin it, just to say that the character's emotional agony drips off screen and makes you sympathize if you do not yearn for its end. <br /> <br /> Sure, it's not the best movie ever made, and in many places it looks clumsy and maybe a bit amateur, but despite these shortcomings, death killing is an experience I can recommend to anyone who likes sophisticated cinema. If you are someone who likes comfortable movies or "beautiful" movies or just wants to look for something brutal and meaningless, this is not what you are looking for. <br /> <br /> Whether you enjoy it or not, you will not forget it so quickly.
