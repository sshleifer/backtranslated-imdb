When I was a little girl (and my father owned a video store), this was one of my favorite movies. I had not heard much since then and could not really remember anything. It had been forgotten when Don Bluth had played other, probably better, films. However, I tracked it down a few weeks ago and was pleasantly surprised again. The animation that takes place in New Orleans in the 1930s is delightful and the songs are memorable. If you look tough enough, there are some weaknesses in the continuity that do not affect the plot, which makes you smile (and maybe even a little foggy look when you love animals). The characters are believable (maybe even too big for younger viewers). Two paws up, and for those of you who have not seen it for some time, it's definitely worth a second look.
