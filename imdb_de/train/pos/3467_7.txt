I still wonder why I saw this movie. However, before I saw this movie, I knew practically nothing about the Beatles. I did not even know all her names! All I knew was that they had a lot of fans, they had albums, some of which claim to be the biggest they ever parted, John married Yoko Ono, and John was murdered. VH1 is not even my favorite station, MTV is. Still, for some reason, I decided to look at it without much to expect. Surprisingly, I really liked it! The dialogue was very well written and confused with a slight accent. This is very important, because John and Paul are talking about the whole movie, even though they are being brought outside to explore more opportunities and to watch them. Jared Harris and Adien Quinn perform well overall. <br /> <br /> The end was also very smart. I enjoyed watching the movie excite you for the SNL performance and then flipping you over and making it clear to you that it would be better if you just let it go and finish it with a good grade. My favorite moment is probably the touching badger scene. <br /> <br /> Overall, I recommend this movie to almost anyone. It's a very good way to satisfy your curiosity about what would have happened if Paul had appeared just outside John's doorstep six years after the breakup. This is probably the main reason I saw this movie, and made it curious who the Beatles really were and what could happen to them after the breakup.
