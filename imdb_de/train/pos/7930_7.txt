I will be honest. I got this movie so I can make fun of it. I mean, come on, "Hood of the Living Dead"? What other reaction could I have? The thing is, the movie (and its makers) decided that it would not make fun of it. Instead, it should do its best to be a good movie. <br /> <br /> And you know what? It came terribly close. A little less cheese in the stage music, a bit more professionalism in photography, acting, the incidents (like the props - like the Best Buy bag) ... well, it's not a classic of the zombie movie genre, it's still a nice little movie for yourself. And the acting, the writing and the tempo are surprisingly better than I expected. There is even a decent sense of humor as two of our leads discuss how to decide if a dead zombie is really dead almost permanent profanity, this can be a pretty funny time in the movies. No, that's not great. Yes, it could have been better. But the creators, the actors, the crew, they all tried to do a good movie (instead of a classic), and that matters a lot. The series of Campy Zombie Movies is a mile long, and thanks, guys, that you have not contributed. <br /> <br /> Kudos to the Quiroz brothers. I would like to see what they are going to do next. And hey, someone, give them a budget!
