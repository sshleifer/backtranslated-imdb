As someone who lives near Buffalo, New York, this film has earned me points before I even saw it, since the story is based here. There are even a few small parts with real news TV anchors from Buffalo ... and for once it does not bang in the area. Hallelujah! <br /> <br /> Theology-wise, puh-leeze !!! God is still made to look and think like people ... and of course a bit on the liberal side. As a light comedy, it's not something that should win prizes, but it's still entertaining and a pleasant way to kill 102 minutes. <br /> <br /> There are some laughing slapstick comedy scenes and, hopefully, viewers - from Christians to atheists. - That has added to some laughter, for example, what prayer is all about. Kudos to the authors who have at least straightened this theology and given a good message. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's a kind-hearted movie that should offend only a few.
