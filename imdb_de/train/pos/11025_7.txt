Cliffhanger is a decent action thriller adventure with some of the shortcomings of director Renny Harlin, whose film is admirable over an experienced mountaineer taken hostage by a gang of dangerous criminals in search of cases of stolen money the Rocky Mountains. Sylvester Stallone is impressive as Gabe Walker, the seasoned climber, especially in the action / combat sequences, but some of them are bordering on the unrealistic line. I want to expose my unbelief for the film. The rest of the cast, including John Lithgow, Michael Rooker, Janine Turner, Rex Linn, Caroline Goodall and Leon, are considered supportive characters of the film. The action / combat sequences are well executed, but as mentioned earlier, some are not very realistic, no matter how strong you are. However, the climbing sequences are very well done, because instead of shooting the whole movie in a studio, their chosen locations felt very real and the Ariel views of the mountain ranges are wonderful, giving the movie a touch of reality. The deaths are resourceful, while others are predictable. The villains are solid, but it would have been better if they had concentrated on a more central one instead of having many of them. The tempo of the movie was a bit slow, but the good outweighs the bad in this one. If you're a big fan of Harlins or Stallone, you'll probably enjoy it as well. Overall, Cliffhanger has character development with plenty of action, drama, some suspense, suspense, thrills, and good performances by the performers who are worth the movie to watch.
