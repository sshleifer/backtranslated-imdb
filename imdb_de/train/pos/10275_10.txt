Get ready: This is one of my favorite movies of all time. I'm relatively uninformed about the other works of David Mamet (writer and director), but after seeing this movie half a dozen times (it's always a pleasure to look at it), I can say without hesitation that it's one Genius is. This movie is very well written and quickly draws you into its environment of fraud, competitors and backrooms. The feeling of the film is very similar to The Sting (1973) and it is also a tribute to Noir. <br /> <br /> It's a pretty psychologically complex movie and will definitely make you think about the different twists and motives of the storyline of the shady characters. It is sometimes somewhat predictable, but the shocking climax is always exciting to look at. <br /> <br /> In general, the acting is great - especially Joe Mantegna - but someone I saw the movie with told me that it does not matter. A good idea, a heroine (Lindsay Crouse) who is not just a player, a smoker and a thief, but also wears a bad 80s hairstyle. I agree, but I think she's still great in the role. <br /> <br /> The less you know about the plot of this movie, the better, as well as Mamet's latest film, The Spanish Prisoner, because the ending will be even more impressive. Just sit back and let yourself be carried away by a movie that comes dangerously close to brilliance.
