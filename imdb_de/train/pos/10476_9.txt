My first encounter with "Whale Music" was the eponymous Rheostatics album, which I bought around 1993. I read the liner notes and the band said that the album, which remains in a prominent place in my collection, was inspired by Canada author Paul Quarrington's book. <br /> <br /> I picked up the book a few months later and devoured it! A great read! Since then, I've read the book several times and each time I found a new element for Desmond and his desire to complete the Whale Music. <br /> <br /> I found the movie on video in 1996. I did not have much good experiences with the Canadian movie, but it worked for me. The role of Claire could be played differently, but overall I think Paul Quarrington's vision was well translated from the book to the screen. Maury Chaykin is a moving genius as an isolated genius. The film is about family relationships, love and finding someone who has understanding. I would recommend "Whale Music" not just to music fans, but to anyone who has ever lost anything or anyone and tried to find their way back to the world.
