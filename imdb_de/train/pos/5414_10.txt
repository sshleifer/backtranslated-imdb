Rather loosely based on the memorable poem by Rudyard Kipling and his novel "Soldiers Three," this happy crook dating back to 1939 was considered a first-class conversation in the 1880s about the British imperial army in India. Cary Grant makes more punches with his clenched fists than in all his films together. Located in far-off India, this six-fisted yarn thrives on the exploits of three rugged British sergeants and their native water-bearer Gunga Din (Sam Jaffe), who are struggling with a bloodthirsty cult of murderous Indians called Thuggee. Sergeant Archibald Cutter (The Last Outpost's Cary Grant), Sergeant MacChesney (Oscar winner Victor McLaglen of "The Informer") and Sergeant Ballantine (Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. of "Dawn Patrol") are a competitive trio of alpha males whose year-long break will soon become history as Ballantine marries Emmy Stebbins (Joan Fontaine) and wants to get into the tea business. Of course, Cutter and MacChesney are putting forward various plans to derail Ballentine's plans. When her supervisors meet her with Sgt. Bertie Higginbotham (Robert Coote of "The Sheik Steps Out"), Cutter and MacChesney drug Higginbotham so he can not accompany her and Ballantine has to replace him. Half of the fun is to watch the principals try to outsmart each other without hating themselves. Director George Stevens celebrates the spirit of adventure in grand style and scale as our heroes engage with an army of Thuggees. Lenser Joseph H. August received an Oscar nomination for his outstanding black and white cinematography.
