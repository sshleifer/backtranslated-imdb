Here's a funny fact, I was the baby in the movie, in the manger. :) I'm 19 years old now. My parents took me to try the part we were living in Texas. I think I only made $ 80 for it, but I was not there for very long. My parents said I would cry if I was happy and would be happy to cry. I was all confused. Strange and funny fact I assume .. and no, I'm not a child actress. I live in San Antonio and work in a Walgreen. I graduated from Texas, but I've lived in Maryland most of my life. This movie is a great movie, but a good concept. I have seen it several times in my short 19 years.
