Okay, the plot is on shaky ground. Yes, all right, so there are some randomly inserted song and / or dance sequences (for example: Adam's Concert and Henri's Stage Act). And Leslie Caron can not really, um, you know ... act. <br /> <br /> But somehow "An American In Paris" manages to go through everything as a polished, first-class musical. Mainly on the basis of Gene Kelly's unbelievable dance talent and choreography and the charm that he seems to incorporate into every scene with Caron. (He has to do it because she seems to have a ... problem with emotions.) <br /> <br /> The most accomplished and technically most impressive number in this musical is obviously the 16-minute ballet at the end of The Movie. It's amazingly filmed and Kelly and Caron dance beautifully. But my favorite number would have to be Kelly's character, who sings "I Got Rhythm" with some French schoolchildren and then breaks into a series of American dances. It just proves that you do not need special effects if you have real * talent. <br /> <br /> Not classic 'Singin' In The Rain ', but pretty high up anyway. Worth the watch!
