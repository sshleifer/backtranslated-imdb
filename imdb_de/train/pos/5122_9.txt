# 3 in the trilogy of young John Travolta by blockbusters. He dances to disco, rock'n'roll and country. He goes to Houston to find work and love. Gilley's is the hot spot, and it's the time of the mechanical bull. In order not to be outdone, I rode the bull in a club in Nashville. I recently watched this almost forgotten film on TV, remembering how good it was and how good a year 1980 was. I wore a black cowboy hat this year, as did Travolta. Debra Winger was in good shape. She looks stunning in her red top. There is a lot of charisma. Bud and Sissy seem to be the ideal couple, even if they are garbage. They part, just because it feels so good to come together again. Urban Cowboy has an amazing soundtrack. We hear Lyin 'Eyes from The Eagles and Lookin' For Love from Johnny Lee.
