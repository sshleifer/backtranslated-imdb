"Holly" is a problem-oriented film, but neither manipulative nor overly sentimental. At its heart is a character-driven movie that would not be nearly as successful without the detailed depictions of Patrick (Ron Livingston), the lost soul with the gradually awakening conscience, and Holly (Thuy Nguyen), but ultimately exaggerated young Vietnamese girls. From the vibrant places and photography to the actual editing, everything is open and well done. The contemporary classical score may seem a little scary at first glance, but it is a first-rate composition and underscores the admirable restraint that is visible in all areas. This film, which poses many problems but has few clear answers, eventually sensitizes Holly and the many who share their misery to awareness and compassion. Kudos to all who made it.
