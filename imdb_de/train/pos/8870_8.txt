When John Singleton is on, he is * on * !! And that's one of his better movies. Not quite as close as the Boyz-n-the-Hood, but close (and with many of the same stars). This movie was written very well, put together very well and shot very well. There is very little to criticize, and most of my complaints are superficial (eg, where did Fudge get the money for 6 years of college and a lot of expensive stuff? No mention of a rich background ... and why not Professor Phibbs?) An office? A professor of his size * should * have one ... And while we're at it, for a science student, whether he's or is not, Remy's pretty stupid figure - I'd say he has a bit more of basic intelligence - He speaks and behaves like a total buffoon. <br /> <br /> But apart from that, the movie was very spicy. A good selection of characters and points of view; and Singleton takes no sides in the story - many of the characters are not sympathetic, and he does well to put together the Panthers and Supremacist scenes to show the folly on both sides. <br /> <br /> Much of the cinematography was excellent; I especially loved the scene where Kirsty Swanson gets intimate with Taryn and Wayne, where each scene was put together very well. Also the Malik / Deja scenes were really well received. <br /> <br /> The dialogue was a bit much at times; This movie was prone to sometimes * really * preaching, and he also pounded the dots that he would pull over the head if the dots were just as blunt (we really did not need the US flag if you entered 'UNLEAR' , give some recognition, we are not idiots ...). And to top it off, even though Singleton uses melodrama pretty well in most cases, sometimes it gets a bit naughty (like Deja's death). That's fine until she's 'WHY !!!' screams, which just ruins the whole effect and scene). <br /> <br /> But acting was generally high on the line. Fabulous performances by Omar Epps (maybe the best I've ever seen), Kirsty Swanson (who knew Buffy could act?), Michael Rapaport (surprised me to hell ... to True Romance and Beautiful Girls, though he did was a one-roll actor) and of course, Ice Cube and Laurence Fishburne * are always * outstanding. <br /> <br /> Disadvantage? Jennifer Connelly was flat; Although it's not entirely her fault: her role was stereotypical and one-dimensional. Generically in the highest degree. And Tyra Banks, who had the role, was terrible. She whined and whined and whined. Another in the long line of models who have become actresses who have miserably failed (though there are some who prove the exception to this rule). <br /> <br /> Finally the soundtrack! Impressive! An amazing soundtrack (which is definitely worth a purchase!), Which fits like a glove to the film. Each scene has a twin song (although the Tori Amos songs really started to annoy me ... not their best work). Liz Phair, Rage Against the Machine, Ice Cube ... how can you go wrong? All in all: a really good watch, a really strong cast, a great script, a great movie. 8.10.
