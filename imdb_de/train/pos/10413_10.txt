I grew up with it as my favorite movie of all time. The special effects are incredible for the era and have won prizes. I can remember the dialogue as if I had heard it yesterday. It's just a great, timeless adventure. The music is by Miklos Rosza, the best cinematic history. Sabu is the thief. Conrad Veidt is the big bad guy. I have a copy within reach, for the next journey into the past. Whoa there! Rex Ingram wants out of his Geni bottle!
