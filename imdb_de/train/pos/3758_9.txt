This movie is great. If you take it too seriously, you will of course hate it; However, there are a lot of "dudes" and "right ons" that bring laughter and faint memories from about 15 years ago. I like his ability to just giggle at obvious jokes and stupidity, and his ability to make me see his predecessor "Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure" (1989). If you're looking for a movie full of multi-faceted jokes and totally sophisticated humor, do not look at the movie; However, if you want a movie that is humorous and stupid but smart and appealing, you will enjoy it. I wish that more pictures of this kind would appear in today's theaters. And hey, it's Keanu Reeves, who acts as everyone portrays him as an actor ... right ... can not get much better :)
