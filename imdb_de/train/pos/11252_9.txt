This is my second time for A Perfect Spy. I saw it 2 or 3 years ago and I liked it. I still like it. It is natural that it is compared to the other major Le Carre series, the Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy. Tinker Tailor focuses on the game of spies "Game"; Perfect spy gives us the other axis - what kind of person is a spy? There are a number of topics that these films share with others in the genre. <br /> <br /> Ambiguity - moral, sexual, interpersonal - that creates a multidimensional space between true and false, inside and out. Love vs. Responsibility. In a sense, these characters are happiest when they are treated most shabbily by those who love and respect them - in their various nuances "sneaky". <br /> <br /> Also the theme of the fathers and father figures is important. One of the most intriguing characters in A Perfect Spy is Rick, perhaps the grandfather of Magnus. Throughout history, he reveals and is betrayed. A rogue who always manages to climb the ladder when he's fallen, and seems inconspicuous to what others think about him, asks Magnus every time they meet: "Do you love your old man?" and never "do you love me?" Maybe that means elsewhere, but A Perfect Spy is a love story. Another topic is that of malignancy. The essence of the business is to turn others - against their government, against their friends and colleagues, against their values ​​and beliefs. In every Le Carre movie I've ever seen, The Spy That Got Out Of The Cold, The War Between The Glasses, The Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, Smileys People And A Perfect Spy. <br /> <br /> After all, not so much an issue as an artistic touch - in each of these films, there is usually only a single firearm or perhaps two shots in which the story is referred to as a bookend. Violence, torture and cruelty are always below the surface. We see their results not as streams of blood or damp prison cells, but in the objects that hold the figures of Le Carre, as they are inevitably drawn into the morass. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen the movies above, and you enjoy a perfect spy, you will be pampered. I would also recommend the Sandbagger series (Yorkshire TV), whose second and third season reach the level of this complexity. The IPCRESS file and funeral in Berlin are nice, if easy. For political intrigues, try a very British coup, a house of cards and yes, minister / yes, prime minister. <br /> <br /> If only one Briton put his hand on turning The Three Kingdoms, there would be a film of intrigue and complexity.
