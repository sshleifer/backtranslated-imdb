A very stupid movie that begins with a gentle porno sequence, ventures into an elaborate comedy in the art gallery, adds a find in the hotel room, and then initiates a random murder for no apparent reason. <br /> <br /> What follows is bizarre and surreal (in particular the stopwatch scene is exquisitely unnecessary) and ends with a revellatory "twist" ending that is as obvious to the viewer as it is unfair (why deliberately unfair) br /> <br /> The movie does everything to attack as many groups as possible - transsexuals, insane people and the wonderful "Huggie Bear" style idols in the subway - and condescendingly treat the viewer an idiot in the final scenes, as the characters explain endlessly endlessly and over and over again the happenings in the film. Although the female characters in the background are a joy in the restaurant scene at the end, it is a pleasure to look at them. <br /> <br /> In fact, the whole movie is a pleasure he can see: despite its many, many flaws, the whole package just works well.
