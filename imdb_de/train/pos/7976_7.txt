Revenge is the subject of this Denzel Washington thriller that offers action, chaos, murder and cruel bloodshed. The essence is a bodyguard search and destruction mission while his boss, the young Dakota Fanning, is kidnapped from school. That's what Washington stopped to do to prevent this. The venues in Mexico City are as chaotic as the plot moves toward its predictable, violent conclusion. Washington, a former CIA employee with a drinking problem, receives a good indication from a former colleague who sets the plot of the story in motion. Washington and Fanning have great chemistry between them, and after a tedious start, the bodyguard and his team become the best friends. Christopher Walken, Rachel Ticotin, Radha Mitchell, Giancarlo Giannini and Mickey Rourke form the good cast in support of the two stars.
