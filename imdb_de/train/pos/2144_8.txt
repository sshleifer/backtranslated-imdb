A sweet and totally charming movie, Shall we do Dansu? made me laugh and cry. Sugiyama-san was not very appealing at first glance - a damned Salaryman, apparently devoted to his family, but easily captured by a face in a window. The object of his obsession is distant and cold. But at the end of the movie, I was in love with him, her, his wife and daughter, all dance teachers and dance students. This straightforward story of transformation and renewal is a little gem that I would like to see again.
