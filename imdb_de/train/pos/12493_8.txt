After all the crap that Hollywood (and the Indies) came out with, we finally get a movie that delivers some scary moments. There are some clich√©d moments, but I'm not sure if it's possible to make a completely original movie nowadays. There is not much new here ... it's just well done. <br /> <br /> Make sure that the "subtle" fears occur quickly and often. This is not a movie to watch while you eat pizza. <br /> <br /> There is a very well written red herring in this film and unfortunately a very bad cast. Cheri Christian just does not do effective Julie (the wife / mother). For one, she is completely unsympathetic. I know, I know ... she has just had a traumatic experience. However, the viewer never gets to know her as she is "normally", and the relationship between her and her husband is rather unpleasant (in an unwanted way). I think the director thought we had sympathy for her, but I never did. <br /> <br /> Finally, a thumbs up for the end, which is disturbing and satisfying at the same time. With a sound effect at the beginning of the credits, it could have been cheapened, but the director wisely resisted. <br /> <br /> This is by no means a masterpiece, but it's a good, old-fashioned style of scary movie ... something that is rare these days.
