Holly addresses the worldwide problem of sexual exploitation of children (around 2 million children are affected by trafficking each year) and does so sensitively and without manipulation - a great task that the team at Priority Films has met with great success. American actor Ron Livington starred in the film, along with newcomer Thuy Nguyen, a Vietnamese actress Holly plays, and together bring them to the notorious K11 red light district in Cambodia, which is commonplace for humans. Although it's a heavy topic, the movie captures moments of laughter and hope as we get to know the characters up close, so the two-hour movie is not too hard to see. I am glad that such a movie draws the world's attention to the problem. Child prostitution needs to be stopped, and this is a very good first step. It's great and a movie EVERYONE needs to see.
