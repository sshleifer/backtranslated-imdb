Although this was a better movie than 101 Dalmations (live action, not an animated version), I think it still lagged a bit behind Disney's ability. It was filmed well, the music was more appropriate for the action and the effects were better (compared to 101). Acting may have been better, but then the human characters in this sequel have been given far more appropriate roles, and Glenn Close is truly unmissable, as in the first film. It makes it shine. Their poor lackey and overzealous fur attendants are wonderful characters to play with, and they contribute to the play Disney has given us. This is a great family movie with little or no annoying material, yet it remains fun and is equally interesting for adults and children. It's definitely a classic, like so many Disney movies. It is hoped that the third will get even better - because you know that you probably want to do one. ;)
