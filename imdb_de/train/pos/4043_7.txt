Alive <br /> <br /> Alive is a very entertaining SCI-FI film from Japan. I've noticed many disappointed movie freaks who loved Versus Debut's debut film or his third movie Azumi. I've heard it's blood-soaked movies with swords and zombies and all sorts of goodies. Honestly, I went to the video store to get Versus, but I'm in good hands with Alive. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a wall-to-wall action, Alive is not your choice. There's plenty of action, but it's a reward for a full hour of character. I personally think it's well done and worth it. <br /> <br /> Of course, part of the storyline is stupid as with many SCI-Fi action films, and I think the term foreign bodies could have been replaced by parasites for greater impact. This movie is brutal when it has to be so stupid that it does not have to be used. <br /> <br /> They kept the budget low for the most part, limiting the entire action to an underground building (a cue word), but the film does not suffer. Another bonus for this film are intense Gothic performances, which are created during the many flashbacks and dream sequences with a great artistic flair. <br /> <br /> Rent this!
