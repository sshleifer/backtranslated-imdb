Well, my friends, movies like "La BÃªte" (also known as "The Beast" or "O Monstro") can only be made on the old continent :), in this movie we all see: horses dirty sex, nymphomaniac kind of Gorilla, Do not Feel Dialogues etc etc etc etc etc ... In the serious terms it is now an allegory that men can sometimes be beastly, brutal and brutal. Walerian Borowczyk (the director) shows us the loss of innocence, sexual violence, rape and rape brutality. It's an amazing cinematic experience, bizarre and full of grotesque scenes. For all fans of European shocking exploitation, I recommend this movie. If you like this movie, I recommend: "Orloff Against the Invisible Man" and "Alterated States".
