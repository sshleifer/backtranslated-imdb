I just saw it yesterday on Turner Classic Movies, for the first time ever, and I loved it. I like many of the older films, mostly because of the absence of all dirty language and excessive violence, nudity and sex in most of today's movies. I also think that they have been significantly improved in many (but not all) cases. Jimmy Stewart is a special favorite of mine. I just thought the movie was a lot of fun and I really liked it. If you feel the same way about the older films, I do not think you can make a mistake with this one. I think "You've Got Mail" is a remake (albeit a bit different and a very enjoyable movie too). This movie. For a relaxed evening with a movie, you do not have to be ashamed when your children or anyone else enters your perspective, looks at them, or watches one of the classic movie channels.
