Probably Bigas Luna is the best achievement, because she creates a delicate balance between sleaze, eroticism and surrealism. The delightful Mathilda May, who has benefited most of Tobe Hooper's "Lifeforce", is the target of the young Biel Duran's preference. He can not get Mays breasts out of his head and wants so much that he sucks them and sucks the breasts of his own mother. His quest for May is the movie. As in Luna works like "Lulu" and "Jamon! Jamon!", The director brings a slightly distorted sexual sensibility to his strange but beautiful story. The usual suspects will be offended, but those who are open-minded will enjoy this frothy erotic poem on the female breasts. The pictures of Jos√© Luis Alcaine are beautiful and the music of Nicola Piovani is sweet and rich. A great cinematic confection with a delightful anarchic sensibility that the Spaniards do, of course.
