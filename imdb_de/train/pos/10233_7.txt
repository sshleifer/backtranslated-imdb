I've always been looking forward to watching Hong Kong movies, but everyone did not live up to my expectations ... until now! BURNING PARADISE contains neither the shallow humor that most HK films have, nor a second-rate plot that was implicated in the movie. The story is not complex, but there are never any scenes that only serve to fill in an "intelligent" space (the only truly intelligent martial arts movie I've ever seen is CROUCHING TIGER, but since Hollywood is involved, it's for me no HK movie). There are some incredible fight scenes in this movie, from the first one (which is one of the coolest I have ever seen, but so short) to the last main scenes! But be careful, there is a lot of blood (people cut in half, beheaded, etc.). The production is pretty good and the special effects show that the writer's imagination can be fulfilled even if some settings need to be quite technical (note: the piece of paper he throws and sticks to a wall!). Yes, it was not Tsui Hark or John Woo who made my favorite movie from Hong Kong, but Ringo Lam! And I am sure that I will learn even more from this director! As.
