SOLDIER is not as bad as many have done. I thought the film had a sarcastic, cynical sense of humor, like that of Paul Verhoven's Starship Troopers. The lack of dialogue and exaggerated action is aware and enhances the comic atmosphere. <br /> <br /> A peculiar little thing strikes me - Todd's got the names of several Space War campaigns on the chest and one of those battles is TANNHAUSER GATE .The Tannhauser Gate gets blasted by Roy Batty's elegiac last lines To mention that Todd might have been fighting alongside Android troops like Roy is crazy, to say the least, maybe the screenwriter David Peoples was nostalgic? <br /> <br /> I give this one of 3 points.
