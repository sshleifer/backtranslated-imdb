Bored with the normal, common base movies to watch this Halloween I've seen over and over again, I took a chance on "The Sentinel" and hoped my horror juices would flow again. I had just come back when I saw the Dark Castle remake of "The House on Haunted Hill" - complete and total crap. Luckily, "The Sentinel" has taken me AWAY! In an exciting story about a model moving into a spooky building in Brooklyn Hights, the movie offered everything I could find in a good movie - (1) Campy and imaginatively juicy characters, dialogue and dialogue, including hilarious twists and turns by Christopher Walken, Jeff Goldblum and above all Martin Balsam as an absent professor - (2) Terrible Terror! Not to give away a frame, but there are scenes in this movie that have refreshed me for my pancreas - (3) Fantastic Gore, great make-up and crazy (though very uneven) direction from Michael Winner, with this unreal quite fluent acts treat. If you loved "Evil Dead 2", "Dead Alive" and "Deep Rising", this will be your favorite queen. To underline my love for this film, I wound it up and looked at it again after seeing it for the first time with eyes turned upside down. It is now one of the favorites of all time. Do yourself a favor and check it!
