A dying kung fu master sends his last disciple to find out what happened to the last five disciples of the forbidden poison clan. He needs to find out if they are turning to good, and if not, he can stop them. Master also wants the disciple to find another member of the clan who ran away with the clan's money that Master wants to use forever , The former students were all taught a different style: snake, centipede, scorpion, lizard, toad, while the last student was taught a little in each style. All students land in a city looking for the old man with all the money, and soon everyone is fighting to get the money. Classical martial arts film has the title that even many non-fans are familiar with. I've talked to a few occasional fans and this seems like the one movie that's in their mind. It's a very good movie, though I do not really know why this movie stays with people, although there are other films for my money that are better from the Shaw studio (eg One Armed Swordmen or the Brave Archer series) , The film should not be sold short, but not because the film is built like a mystery. Our hero has no idea who someone is and the Venoms themselves only know who two of the others are. We get the identity of four, but we still have to find out who the fifth one really is. The film is also strange in that for a martial arts film, apart from a training sequence at the beginning and the murder of the old man and his family for the money, no action takes place for about 40 or 45 minutes. It's a brave move, but it's worth it as the plot and the performances grab your attention. (The movie is also weird in that it's the first martial arts movie I've ever seen where there are no women, I do not think one has a speaking role, and I'm pretty sure none will be in the background This is a good, solid little movie that may not live up to the reputation it has in some circles, but it's still a really good movie You can relax on your couch. <br /> At 7 of 10.
