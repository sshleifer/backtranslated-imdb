In New Orleans, an illegal immigrant feels sick and leaves a poker game while he wins the small-time criminal Blackie (Walter Jack Palance). He is followed by Blackie and his men Raymond Fitch (Zero Mostel) and Poldi (Guy Thomajan), who were killed by Blackie and his body is sunk in the sea. During the autopsy, the family man, Lieutenant Commander Dr. Clinton Reed (Richard Widmark) of the US Health Service states that the dead had a rat-induced pneumonic plague, and he needs to find out who had had contact with the man within 40 years - eight hours to avoid an epidemic. The mayor of the city instructs the skeptical Captain Tom Warren (Paul Douglas), dr. Help Clint find the killers infected with the plague and vaccinate them. <br /> <br /> "Panic in the Streets" reveals a simple story, but it's still effective and with a great villain. The appealing conspiracy is not dated after 57 years. Jack Palance shows a despicable scum on his debut, and the camera work while trying to escape with Zero Mostel is still very impressive. My voice is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "PÃ¢nico nas Ruas" ("Panic in the Streets")
