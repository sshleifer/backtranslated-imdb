With a minimal budget, an eight-minute run and a great imagination, Nacho Vigalondo has achieved one of the most moving shorts I've ever seen. The subtlety of the screenplay is really remarkable, as it does not end up being able to enjoy it much more until the very last moment. Nacho Vigalondo is the discovery of the year for his one-man show: directing, writing, and acting in this mighty size is the most notable effort I've seen in years. Also watch out for the performance of Marta Belenguer, her reaction shots are incredible. <br /> <br /> Overall rating: 8/10
