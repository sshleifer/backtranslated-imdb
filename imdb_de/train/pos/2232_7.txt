I saw that at 17 and have not seen it since. The "CBS Late Movie" showed him regularly at one point. I remember how sad and exciting it was, it really made me sick. The effects were not as they are today, but they give the feeling of being alone in the Amazon after losing both parents and looking for a way out. I remember the beetles and maggots most so realistically that they ate their meat. It's a dark movie that has been controversial at the time, though it's likely to have been heavily cut for television. I wish I remember more details, and if I ever have a chance to see it again, I can say more. I have been looking for this for years. I think it was shown on CBS under another title. I have no idea if it has ever been released on video.
