It seems that it is fashionable to rip up "Basic Instinct 2" so much that a significant portion of the audience (including critics) found it terrible even before its release. It seems even more fashionable to discard Sharon Stone, who, like us, is now fourteen years older and, unlike most of us, still looks wonderful. The first comments on this movie were so vicious that I had to see it myself. In my opinion, this sequel is not nearly as good as the original movie, but not as bad as most comments suggest. Michael Caton-Jones is not Paul Verhoeven, neither Henry Bean nor Leora Barish are Joe Eszterhas. "Basic Instinct 2" is just an entertaining, average thriller that bears little resemblance to its predecessor alongside Jerry Goldsmith's original score. Even Stone gives her character another dimension, creating a lusty, devilish Catherine Trimell who can position herself well among other monsters like Hannibal Lecter. She is a smart actress who is not afraid to take risks and play in peace with the camp. Unfortunately, it seems to be the main target for anyone who likes to throw this strip away. It has become too successful, too much of a major icon, and like all actors who have reached this level, their time has come, and it is now inevitably destroyed by the Hollywood crowd. <br /> <br /> The cast is outstanding and offers services far beyond the material it deserves. David Morrissey is a much better actor and far more interesting than Michael Douglas: his acting is flawless and lends a dense, complex dimension to an otherwise one-dimensional character. Since it has more screen time and is the axis of the movie, it can keep your attention from beginning to end. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend "Basic Instinct 2" as a great movie. I'm just expressing my disagreement with most of the comments on this site, and my belief that agendas other than the movie itself are what most viewers think.
