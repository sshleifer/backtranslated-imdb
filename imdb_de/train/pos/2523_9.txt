When I first heard about Moon Child, I thought it was a joke. After a few months, I thought it was real. The few reviews I've read that WERE NOT was not made by Fangirls squealing were not very promising. <br /> <br /> When I got the opportunity to see it, I was ready to moan, wince and otherwise close my eyes to avoid stupidity. <br /> <br /> I was more than a little surprised and in a good way. <br /> <br /> Yes, Moon Child has his moments of cheese, lager and general jerk - I think that's impossible to avoid when it comes to Gackt Camui, a man not known for his sanity - but all in all, it was absolutely pleasant. <br /> <br /> No, it's not a work of cinema genius, but it's very, very warm, amusing, with funny choreography, a touching score and a funny cast. I do not know much about Japanese cinema, so I can not really judge acting, but considering that the performers spoke a language or an extreme dialect that is foreign to them, and that some of them have almost no acting experience, I was pretty impressed. <br /> <br /> If you can enjoy a good action movie, a good drama, a good comedy, watch this movie. Rent it at least since it comes to Region 1. <br /> <br /> Incidentally, this movie does not contain any homosexual / homoerotic content. I have not even seen a subtext. Do not let yourself be ruined by people who read too much into things.
