Well done and stylish, but ultimately meaningful, this thriller would be better suited for non-Giallo fans to be more interested in the genre than the later Argento entries that go overboard in all directions. <br /> <br /> For fans of this crazy Italian thriller, you will appreciate George Hilton and the twists that his character takes and what he has achieved. The camera work is fresh with lines of graphic violence and strange but reasonable choices and a good, unencumbered music score. The less you know about the story, the better to make it work. <br /> <br /> The only thing you can not stop being a great Sergio Martino director is that the story is not particularly sexual or psychological or both elements to put it over the top. It is more of a routine puzzle, the characters are well defined, but they do not live or die according to the plot for their own virtues and mistakes. <br /> <br /> The current DVD (2005) version is beautiful and definitely the way to watch the movie, unless they get art house screenings, which seems unlikely.
