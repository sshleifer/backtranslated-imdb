These French and Germans certainly have a long history in which they do not like each other. It is interesting to note that Kamerdaschaft or Comradeship takes place in translation in 1931. Only a few years later, Hitler would besiege Germany and begin his plans to take over the world. However, these are times of serenity compared to the future. A group of miners on the border are trying to get to France to find work there. They are rejected by their French neighbors in a nightclub. Then a catastrophe occurs in the French mines and a well thought out and written scene, a troop of German miners decides to save themselves. A simple story is not it? Pabst was a silent movie poet and I'm not sure if this is his first sound film or not, but his poetry is there to be discovered. He is not picky, but brings a hard realism to the test. There is even a retrospective of a World War II event that stimulates the point of this story. The film, which is supposedly based on a real event, carries out the events proudly and directly and concisely. Sometimes a movie has to be.
