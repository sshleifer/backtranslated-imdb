I loved this show from the beginning and always looked forward to watching every episode every week. The plot, the characters, the writing, the special effects were outstanding! Then the science fiction channel was again messed up and a very entertaining, well-written show canceled. I say, bring it back, I know all the actors would come back. I would suggest to buy the DVDs. I hope that those in charge of science-fiction channels will hear about these comments and recognize that they need to engage more with their audiences. I'm just watching a show on this channel (Ghost Hunters), but I'm pretty sure they'll break that as well.
