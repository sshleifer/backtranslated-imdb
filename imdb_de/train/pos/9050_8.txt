This is a gem, a real piece of Americana for all that implies. If you're self-programmed to resist "life-sustaining" stories, just stay away and leave the rest of us to believe. And what really makes the icing on the cake so appealing is the fact that it's a story that ranges from a real rag story to a rich story. Chris Cooper is one of the greatest live actors, and the complex, self-controversial end result that well dominated the father he portrayed could only be successfully deducted by someone with his skill and insight. The simple-minded comments that refuse to accept a father trying to write down the law while sensing that he may not be in the lead disclose the commentator's restriction, not the authors or the actor. This is not for the cynical or the simple-minded.
