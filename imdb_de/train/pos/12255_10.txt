Of the many Austen films from the 1990s, this is my favorite, even "Persuasion," which converted me to Austeniana. Before I saw this "Emma", I'd seen two earlier versions, but in one, Emma was completely wrong, more like Lady Teazle, and in the other, she seemed half wrong, like a possible cheater, while she's right here , young and stupid seemed and stubborn. In general, I found that the attitude and atmosphere of the production convey the charm of the novel extraordinarily well. In fact, it's one of the sweetest and happiest things I've ever seen, more like a Christmas. The script is unusually well formed, and the additions to the adapter, such as the beam of light revealed by Harriet Emma in the church, are all fine. Mark Strong as Knightley is not what I expected, but I enjoyed it very much: he expresses the normal spoken, practical side of the character as opposed to Emma's affects, and his choleric outbursts against Frank Churchill are quite funny. Bernard Hepton turns Mr. Woodhouse into a figure of almost absurd Carrollianism; Samantha Morton as Emma's protege is as soft and as tight as she should be. And as in "Pride and Prejudice" of the same manufacturers, care is taken to ensure that the possible associations of characters can be accepted - in some cases clearly. For me, this production was and remains a pleasure.
