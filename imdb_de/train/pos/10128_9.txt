Here it is .. Friends first EVER episode, featuring Control Freak Monica Gellar (Courtney Cox), the recently divorced Ross Gellar (David Schimmer), Hippy Pheobe Buffay (Lisa Kudrow), an unknown actor, and a lady-man (Matt Le Blanc and the very sarcastic Chandler Bing (Matthew Perry): That's how the scene starts until we meet our sixth and last girlfriend Spoiled Kid Rachel Green (Jennifer Aniston). <br /> <br /> The episode is better than Most people appreciate it like any new sitcom, the first episode is not always fantastic, the acting in this episode is not great, because the characters are not really credible with their new characters (except for Kudrow and Perry - who shine) /> <br /> Matt Le Blanc-Man, his acting was really terrible, because he will become more confident later, but I think he tries to be funny, but at most fails. <br /> <br /> David Schimmer: Why is he talking to JED? IT word out? He can not speak normally, but he became one of the funniest characters in later seasons, but he's not confident. and I can not sympathize with him Jennifer Aniston - Looks hot and does a good job as Rachel Green, but we only see the real Rachel later in the first season. Courtney Cox - Looks pretty anorexic in this episode, she's disturbing, she looks totally different, now (healthier), she's a bit sketchy, but everyone is in this 20-minute pilot! Lisa Kudrow and Matthew Perry- I am making these two together because their comic timing and acting quality were outstanding. For Lisa, this was one of her first roles and she's as natural as Pheobe (Pheebs) and Matthew Perry just play Matthew Perry basically herself! The sequel quality improves later, like the sets, they look dark and creepy in this episode and make them look rude, the acting is alright, the characters gain confidence with each new scene and I am proud that this is the pilot ! I hope we see the reunion of friends! because they will always be there for us!
