The Wooden Horse is a very clever film about a very clever and successful escape plan worked out by British prisoners of war during World War II. It is great to play with a dry sense of humor, especially the lines that are expressed by the acid tongues of Leo Genn. Anthony Steele and David Tomlinson (later George Banks in Mary Poppins) are wonderful as the two heroes. The direction is consistently tight and fast. Highly recommended.
