Most Italian horror lovers seem to hate this movie because it has no connection to the first two Demons movies. And with the "Demons III" in the title, one would assume. The problem is that this movie should never be part of the Demons series. The lenders had only one "Demons III" over their original title "The Ogre" to convince themselves of the popularity of the other films. The new American DVD release of this image is titled "Demons III: The Ogre" box-art, but the film itself says only "The Ogre". I do not know if in earlier versions the title "Demons III" was on the movie itself, but this new release seems to be just a little white lie. If you pass the title of "Demons III", you can enjoy "The Ogre". It starts with a creep intro and stays pretty creeping throughout. There is no Gore and the movies are slow, but I still dug it out. Just do not expect it to be like the other Demons movies. I give "The Ogre" 7 out of 10 points. Italian fans should give it a try.
