Here at IMDb.com I've read an opinion that Gray Owl is the best character of Pierce Brosnan ever played. I do not know if he had better or worse roles, I'm not his fan, but this one was really extraordinary. <br /> <br /> The other thing - impressive hand of the film director. I give my respect. The serenity, the beauty and the spirit of the wilderness are truly exclusive. I've never experienced such closeness in a movie before. <br /> <br /> Another thing I remembered after the movie - that's the movie closest to the original books and the atmosphere inside. <br /> <br /> And a little more. I pay my respects to the original gray owl.
