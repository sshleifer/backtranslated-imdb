It may not have been for Academy Awards and admittedly rather cheesy, but it's just so much fun! Nothing makes me smile like Bill and Ted. Amiable, optimistic and funny, Bill and Ted are a great way to relax. <br /> <br /> Although I love Excellent Adventure, Bogus Journey is funnier for me. Death is a fun flippin and Bill and Ted are even more adorable. People are sorry for me because I loved this movie, but only really presumptuous movie watchers will say it's not even a bit entertaining. If that pleases you, you'll probably also become a fan of Wayne's World, Dude, where my car is, and stupid and stupid. Admit it, though it's stupid to make you smile and turn over your tick box. So just look at them for kicking and giggling !!
