One of my favorite movies for several years was "Last Action Hero"; Unfortunately, Arnold Schwarznegger has decided to spoil my fun by becoming a corrupt fool politician. Therefore, I can not stand a movie that he might have been through. The adventures of Jake Speed ​​actually play with some themes that are similar to those in Last. Hero; So I was pleased to find it on DVD, so I was able to look these topics off so well. <br /> <br /> Despite the "conspiracy within the plot" with white slavery during the civil war of an African nation this is not an action movie. Actually, the plot in which the plot is located is actually a question the film does not want to solve: is Jake Speed ​​a real person who helps the heroine save her sister from the white slave trader; or is he actually a fictional character (meaning that the heroine somehow entered the universe that really only exists in a series of pulp novels)? I claim that this is not so clearly defined in the film and that Wayne Crawford and Andrew Lane are well aware of it. The film thus becomes a presentation of what the audience can expect from such a fictional "adventure story" universe. This is actually a rich theme whose potential severity is lightened by the film's lovable and lanky humor. <br /> <br /> The film has weaknesses - first and foremost its cinematography, which makes the movie look like a television show. And the tempo drops occasionally. <br /> <br /> But I really like these characters and I like the adventure they live no matter how stupid they are. And I find it fascinating that this adventure actually takes place in a novel. <br /> <br /> Lasts under several considerations - a good show!
