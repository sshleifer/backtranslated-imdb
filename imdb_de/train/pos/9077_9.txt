I really enjoyed the pilot, it was as incredible as I hoped, if not better. Patrick Warburton was a rebellion, though at first I thought I could not stand his character. He and Megyn Price did not have much chemistry, but hopefully they will get more and more comfortable with the season. It must have been weird for Megyn to become the co-star of the star of her latest show ["Grounded For Life"]. <br /> <br /> Bianca Kajlich and Oliver Hudson seem to be really new in the whole sitcom scene, but I think they get better with time. To my surprise, the character of David Spade was not the focus of this pilot. The way he delivers his lines is so different from any other I've ever seen on TV, but I think it's just his style. It works for him. <br /> <br /> I think couples or even singles will be able to relate to all doubts and struggles and be unsure about your choices that are on this show. All the characters' situations feel like they are in real life, not too thick like most shows. <br /> <br /> I hope for all the actors that CBS gives them a chance. This show has the potential to be one of the best shows, if you only have the chance and the time.
