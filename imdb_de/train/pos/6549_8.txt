Collecting old stories poses a challenge for the production team. How can this classic character be brought up to date and interesting enough to capture a new audience while evoking memories of its former audience? In my opinion, their mission was fulfilled. A must for young children, teenagers, teenagers and their parents. OK, there are some scary moments that will be solved in a short time, but parents with young children should sit tight, the movie moves to better things. I will go with the astute reviewers of the users, who point out that Emma Roberts offers us a positive role model for young women and not syrupy. Nancy balances her femininity with her career-oriented skills. Lots to like, laughs, does not take yourself too seriously to solve a real puzzle (you can find out for yourself as an added bonus and likeable characters.) Nancy Drew even makes a good date movie in my opinion.
