This is a great show and you are made to cry. This group has really loved and shows again and again. Email me and let us chat. I was in Australia and they really talk like that. <br /> <br /> I want you to enjoy Five Mile Creek and pass on these great stories about right and wrong and friendship to your children. I have all 40 episodes on DVD-R that I've collected in the last 5 years. Watch my Five Mile Creek tribute at www.mikeandvicki.com and listen to the extended theme music. Let's talk about them. <br /> <br /> These people are so cool!
