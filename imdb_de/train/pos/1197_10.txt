I only accidentally saw this movie. What a little gem. This film from 1956 looks and feels like a movie from the late seventies. And is actually better, more restrained and correct than Blue Soldier. The ecological, anthropological undertones are far ahead of their time. The inconspicuous cinematography is outstanding and terribly realistic. The Last Hunt not only teaches dances with wolves, but also conveys the look and feel of the buffalo, the "extinguishing fields" of the late 19th century. Presumably, because the real battlefields were in the movie. The film was filmed for buffalo waste during legal forestry, so the animals you see are really turned, the bones are real. Finally, a very undervalued Western masterpiece that was excellently played, directed and filmed.
