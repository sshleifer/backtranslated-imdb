Presenting Lily Mars (MGM, 1943) is a sweet movie, but in my opinion it could have been better. Judy Garland is great as always, but some scenes in the movie seem out of place and the romance between her and Van Heflin is developing too fast. I mean, for a minute he's ready to hit her butt. But in the next minute he falls in love with her. I believe that this production, the film editing and the script (although the photography was great, the scenery was beautiful and the costumes were nice too) could be a little better. It feels like the production is too hectic. <br /> <br /> The understudy was also good, especially the little Janet Chapman as the second youngest daughter Rosie. At 11, she looks really cute and it's a shame she did not turn into a teenage comic actress. She is much better in this film than in her previous films as Warner Brothers in the late 1930s (except Broadway Musketeers in 1938 she is really good at it) when they tried to make her a Shirley Temple / Sybil-Jason hybrid , Overall, this movie could be better, but in the end, Judy gave it all.
