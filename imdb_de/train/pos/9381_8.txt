A drifter looking for a job is mistaken for a batsman in a small town in Wyoming, leading to all kinds of complications. Cage is perfect for the unfortunate jerk who hopes to make quick money and leave the city, but he can not escape the title city. Hopper does what he does best by playing a psycho known as "Lyle from Dallas," the real hitman. Walsh as crooked sheriff and Boyle as femme fatale complete the fine-shot. The script of the brothers John and Rick Dahl contains delicious twists and John's direction creates a grandiose "Neo Noir" atmosphere. Funny and very entertaining, it draws the viewer in from the beginning and never lets up.
