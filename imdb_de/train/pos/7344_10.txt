In my opinion, this is a good example of the movie, which could have been much better if it had been short 10 years earlier. I doubt it would benefit from modern technology, but it would have looked much better if it had been at least 90 instead of 70 minutes. <br /> <br /> The artists and animators did a great job. In my opinion, this film has the best background graphics and one of the best character designs. Animations are extremely smooth and realistic. Throughout the movie, you believe in the world you see, so everyone did a great job. It can also boast with one of the sexiest female animated characters, though not the sexiest, that the typical anime girls with turnips with ease are so appealing right now. First, the storyline and execution are comparable to contemporary adventure films and are actually old-fashioned by today's standards. Second, because of the duration, it would benefit a lot from an additional 20 minutes of dialogues. After all, the setting is not that popular right now. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: A great alternative to another short story about Conan the Barbarian, but not to a novel.
