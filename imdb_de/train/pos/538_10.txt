Return to the hut by the lake is perhaps one of the few sequels that can do justice to the original. It had black humor, good excitement, nice-looking girls and of course a psycho-killer. What are we missing? I do not think anything. Except, we only have a small amount of gore and nudity left because it was made for television. Apart from being one of the best followers, he is one of the best thrillers to watch as a family. Recommended for everyone.
