"De vierde man" (The Fourth Man, 1984) is considered one of the best European psycho-thrillers of the eighties. This last work by Dutch director Paul Verhoeven in his homeland, before moving to Hollywood to become a big star with films like Total Recall, Basic Instinct, and Starship Troopers, is about a psychopathic and disillusioned author ( Jeroen crab). to go to the sea for recreation. There he meets a mysterious Femme Fatale (Renee Soultendieck) and begins a deadly love affair with her. He becomes addicted to her heart and soul and finds out that her three former husbands all died in mysterious circumstances. <br/> <br/> "De vierde man" is heavily influenced by the old Hollywood movie noire and the psycho influenced thriller by Alfred Hitchcock and Orson Wells. It takes a lot of time to create a dark and enthralling atmosphere, and a few moments of extreme violence have the right effect to make the story straight forward. The tension is sometimes almost unbearable and sometimes reminiscent of the works of the Italian cult director Dario Argento. <br /> <br /> The cast is also outstanding, especially Krabbe's performance as a deranged writer who opened the doors to his international film career ("The Living Daylights", "The Fugitive"). If you have the opportunity to see this ingenious psycho-thriller on TV, video or DVD, do not miss it!
