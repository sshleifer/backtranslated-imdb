Halloween is a movie that I have to leave every time it's THIS day of the year. I even look sometimes, if it is not the holiday !!! This movie is SO great. Jamie Lee Curtis is an actress I can never stop loving. This movie may be old, but the story always gets me right, and the acting was absolutely fantastic. Although I have not seen the remake, I already feel that it was absolutely unnecessary. I think Rob Zombie should NEVER have made such a classic again. However, what kills me is to know that there are some people who have seen the remake without hearing the original. I get angry if I just think about it !!!!!! This movie was great and will always be remembered as a classic in the story.
