My friend and I liked this movie very much. The viewer is carried away by modern life in the old Japan and at the same time exposed to very current topics. The characters are realistic and detailed. It has an unpredictable end and a story that is very refreshing. The story consists of mini-plots in the lives of several geisha living together in a poor neighborhood. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who is looking for a realistic romance or life in ancient Japan. <br /> <br />
