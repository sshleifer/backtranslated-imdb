On paper, this movie sounds incredibly boring. The idea of ​​a 75-year-old man riding a riding mower across the country is not very well received, but the real power of the film lies in its charm and intelligence. Writers will not find a better study of what makes a movie than "The Straight Story." <br /> <br /> The perfect example of this is a scene in which Alvin meets a runaway teenage girl. She is pregnant and is afraid of what her parents would do if they found out. Alvin tells her a story about his own children a long time ago. He had her take a stick and break what they could easily do. Then he had them bundle the sticks and try to break them. "This bundle," he said, "is a family." So many other films would feel compelled to keep going and make sure we knew a person might be broken, but together the members were stronger. "The Straight Story" recognizes that we are smart enough to understand that, and lets us just think about it and make our own conclusions. <br /> <br /> Alvin's journey through Iowa is full of so refreshing un-Hollywood characters interactions. Every interaction is full of warmth and humor, and Alvin is so sweet to ride his mower that we need not help but smile as he leaves for Wisconsin to make peace with his brother Lyle, who has had a stroke. And the simplicity of the final scene underscores that the true story here is not the destination, but the journey. It is a journey in which Alvin shares his life with everyone he meets - for his and our benefit. It's a slow, easy and relaxing ride that reminds us of everything we've lost through the urbanization of America. <br /> <br /> "The Straight Story" is the rare live action movie "G" that should not be missed.
