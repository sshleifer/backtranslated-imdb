While many, unfortunately, have moved on, the ballroom scene is still alive and carrying on their legacy. Some are still very lively and quite good. Octavia is brighter and more beautiful than ever. Willi Ninja is very well trained and supports the entire gay community as a whole. May she rest in peace. After Anji's death, Carmen became the mother of the house of Xtravaganza (she was in the beach scene) and she also looks more and more beautiful. Some balls have categories for those who have passed, may they all rest in peace. Currently there is another project titled "What do I look like?". You can visit the website at www.howdoilooknyc.org.
