Bad script, bad direction, excellence, revised dialogue. What more could you ask for? It just will not get better for laughing. Zadora's exaggerated behavior combined with the clich√©d scenarios she finds a funny parody of the "Hollywood" machine. Almost as funny as "Spinal Tap," though it was obviously not intended as such. Do not miss Ray Liotta's debut film series "Looks Like a Penis."
