This is one of the funniest series ever! I laughed until my sides split and rolled on the floor. If only someone in America were released. Region 0 or 1 - non-PAL please. <br /> <br /> I know it's going to be released in the UK, but that's also Region 2 and PAL! Let's give this series the right momentum. America needs to know this series. Moffat is a genius. I loved Tracie Bennett's quirky, stupid role. Of course I liked Fiona Gillies! But Tracie was a sweetheart! <br /> <br /> Publish this show in America! or show it again on the PBS stations. I have to laugh and laugh again! Please treat us please! You're welcome! <br /> <br /> Thank you for reading.
