The end of this movie channel while surfing through the cable movie channels was intrigued, and I was so intrigued that I went to the next show. I came out of this movie feeling pretty distraught and desperate. It also gave me, as an adult who attended high school in the 1980s, a little better insight into what our children are dealing with these days, the coldness of the plot. It was sometimes overwhelming to see how both children and adults struggled to understand and handle the pointless shootings. And I admit that I shed a lot of tears. <br /> <br /> On the whole, not a movie I'm looking for, but I'm sure I'm glad I saw it.
