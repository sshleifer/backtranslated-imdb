A heartwarming little movie and not just for the kids. John Thaw is as brilliant as ever (without a trace of Inspector Morse). The boy who played William also did a good job, although I did not convince him in every scene. I loved the whole feeling of the small village and the slower life at this time. I also felt the scenes in London that, as far as I could tell, were historically accurate. <br /> <br /> It strongly reminded me of a Scandinavian movie that I saw a few years ago as Mother of Mine. In this movie, a boy was evacuated from Finland to Sweden during World War II. The wife of the family who took him in asked for a girl because she (as it turns out) lost her daughter. Instead of having a boy, she completely ignores him. The fact that the boy speaks Finnish makes things even more complicated. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who has enjoyed Goodnight Mr. Tom. He has the same feeling.
