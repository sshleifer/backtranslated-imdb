A young woman who is a successful model and is also engaged and who has twice attempted to commit suicide in the past is selected by a secret and distant union of Catholic priests as the nearest sentry to the Gate of Hell, which is evidently a creepy old, but good obtained apartment building in Brooklyn goes. His tenants take the stairs and can be reborn, but apparently can not escape as long as a sentry barred the way. The previous one (John Carradine) is about the dead, so fate, or whatever, is the next, and the damned must make them kill themselves to be free. Below the surface, there are many interesting details, their relationship with their father, the stories of the damned, their fianc√©e, so that this can be spent as a cheap exploitation horror, but given the sets, the large cast and the general level of bizarre that is definite worth seeing.
