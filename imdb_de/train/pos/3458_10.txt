To occupy Jack Cassidy as Ken Frankin was plain glamor. Cassidy embodied arrogance, self-confidence, charm and wit - all with a condescending, evil little grin on her face. In my opinion, Jack Cassidy is by far the best killer of the Columbo series. This particular (and first) performance is my favorite episode in Columbo - no doubt. A new face Steven Spielberg has done amazing camerawork (yes, there were occasional camera shots among the actors) that capture the nuances and banter at various and interesting angles between Columbo and Franklin. The panorama and close shots at Big Bear Lake, California (Franklin's Cabin Home) were very impressive. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen this episode yet, you owe it to yourself - it's a true masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Jack Cassidy was a very talented actor and singer. His charismatic personality was very contagious. His death in 1976 at the age of 49 years was very sad and indeed very tragic - he certainly had his best years in front of him. Rest in Peace Jack, you will live on through your great work for eternity.
