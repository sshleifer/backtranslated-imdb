The key to the 40-year-old virgin is not just that Andy Stitzer is a 40-year-old virgin, but the way Steve Carell presents him as a single entity. In a genre of crass comedy characterized by a lack of humor and engaging characters, The 40-Year-Old Virgin has a colorful cast and a smart, heartfelt writing that does not use her protagonist as the butt of cruel jokes. That Andy is still a virgin when she was forty is not so much a joke as a curiosity. Carell, a veteran of Team Ferrell in Anchorman and a former member of the Daily Show, uses the concept of the film to expand his character? we understand why Andy is the way he is. It's the little things that make this movie work. When Andy's employee at an electronics store asks him what he did on the weekend, Andy describes his failed cooking attempts. When Andy goes to work by bicycle, he signals his turns. He decorates his home not only with action figures? He paints and talks to them, revealing that some of the very old people have been with him since childhood. A smaller comedy would not even focus on all those things. <br /> <br /> The story is pretty simple? Andy's colleagues find out he has never had sex and personally take on the task of putting him to bed with a woman. It's a childish idea and the movie makes no attempt to hide its youthfulness. <br /> <br /> Andy's friends complement his neurotic nature: David (Paul Rudd) separated from his girlfriend over two years ago, but Jay is still obsessed with it. Jay (Romany Malco) is a female women's man and Cal (Seth Rogen) is a tattooed sex addict. Her attempts to throw Andy in the bag burn into the bag numerous times, and each time Andy feels less and less optimistic. <br /> <br /> Finally, Andy meets single mother Trish (played by Catherine Keener) and much to the chagrin of his troubling buddies who claim that mothers are not worthy of falling in love with her. They start a relationship and agree to postpone sex for twenty days. Trish does not know that Andy is still a virgin. <br /> <br /> The 40-year-old maiden was staged by Judd Apatow, the man who produced Anchorman and The Cable Guy, and began the short-lived cult TV show Freaks and Geeks. Apatow is known for his unique humor and script? co-written by Carell ?? offers a lot. <br /> <br /> But the most interesting and surprising aspect of the 40-year-old maiden is her maturity. By now, you probably know that the film received glowing reviews from the critics, and even the warm reception was surprised. But once you've seen the movie, it's easy to understand why. We like Andy. We take care of him. He's not just some cardboard cutout sex comedy cliche? He is a real, living, breathing person. His neurotic qualities combine the best of Woody Allen with childlike naivety. His friends are not unlikely idiots and his romance is turbulent and bittersweet. It's a chord with the audience. <br /> <br /> Although this is far from a perfect movie and definitely contains some gross allusions and sexual humor, it is not as insulting as other genre entries are because we have affection for the people have the screen. The best sex comedies work this way? from risky shops to American cakes? and that's the main difference between something like the 40-year-old maiden and 40 days and 40 nights.
