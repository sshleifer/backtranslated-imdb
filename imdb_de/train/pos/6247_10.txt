Trailers of this film may show scenes of violence or non-mainstream sexuality, but these scenes are just rare fragments that have been chosen to attract the audience. Of course they show the main message of the film: <br /> <br /> People who are constantly being kicked in their jobs and lives, using the power they have elsewhere to notoriously suppress others. And at the bottom of the chain of oppression mostly women. <br /> <br /> A movie as brutal as Dog Days is hard to deal with, but enduring such lives is even harder. <br /> <br /> Technically, the film is very similar to Short Cuts but consists of documentary episodes in which people like your neighbor are played as they are. Without glitter and most disturbing, without hope. The documentary style makes the film even more disturbing, because you know that such people are out there, and there are many of them, though our society focuses on the beautiful exterior. Somewhere the porn industry has to do its business, somewhere unreported domestic violence has to take place, somewhere hopes have to break. I certainly know such people. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch a movie with no funny scenes (some may think that the disabled woman who repeats the top 10 supermarkets is funny, but this usually happens) and without melodramatic, look look at this movie However, it will be lost if you focus on subtitles, I'm afraid, because subtitles can not convey accents.
