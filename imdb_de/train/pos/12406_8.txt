A more than 20-year closed jail, closed for over 20 years, will reopen, and Ethan Sharpe (the late, great character actor Lane Smith), once a security guard, will be assigned as a guard. When the prisoners are taken to work to repair the place, they are instructed to break into the old execution room. This unleashes a fierce spirit that mercilessly devastates both guards and prisoners. Cool-as-can-be inmate Burke (Viggo Mortensen, who has shown a genuine attitude in an early role), is cast into the role of hero. <br /> <br /> I know it's a breeze to praise the film for its atmosphere (it was filmed in a real, abandoned prison near Rawlins, Wyoming), but it picks up this horror movie a higher level. It has a great sense of foreboding right at the beginning. Director Renny Harlin did his fourth directorial work here. He got the performance "Nightmare on Elm Street 4" and started an impressive career in mainstream action movies, thrillers and horror movies. <br /> <br /> Although she has character traits, she is able to bring her to life: Chelsea Field as a young woman competing for prison reform, Lincoln Kilpatrick as tired veteran Cresus, Tom Everett as troubled Conbbitt, Ivan Kane as outgoing Lasagne, Tommy "Tiny" Lister as silent giant Tiny, and Arlen Dean Snyder as Captain Horton. It's also worth noting that Kane Hodder (as the vengeful ghost) acted as an actor early on, which helped him land Jason Voorhees's appearance in the Friday the 13th series. <br /> <br /> Decent special effects, atmospheric lighting courtesy of the prolific genre cameraman Mac Ahlberg, creepy music by Richard Band and Christopher Stone, great visuals, the incredibly bleak location and a striking and intense presentation that makes the whole thing entertaining , It is evil, cruel and makes a horror fan a great joke. <br /> <br /> 8/10
