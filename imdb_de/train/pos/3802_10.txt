Dragon Hunters must be the best-looking animated movie I've ever seen. It was amazing. The film is about a few villains looking for money, their funny, furry blue dog that spits fire, and a girl who dreams of becoming a knight, and they are sent to search to get to to go to the ends of the earth to kill the police world eaters, an incredibly huge dragon. But honestly, it does not matter what the movie is about. Because it is stunningly beautiful. Gravity in this fantasy world is different, with architectural blocks and landscapes floating between cathedrals, castles and villages, and forests of floating lily pads. The world is so creative, so unique, with a kind of subdued picture-book look. The world looks like a series of beautiful paintings. The monsters are also visually stunning like a fire dragon made up of a swarm of evil red bats. Some of the acts are not too original, like the main actors who want their farm a la Mice and Men and will never make it in the world; But the great graphics, some really scary scenes and the dialogue that evokes emotions makes this movie spectacular.
