This is one of those movies you wake up with the next morning. It gives you a warm, blurred feeling and leaves a smile on your face. <br /> <br /> Sure, we get the typical stereotype characters and stories, but it does the trick: Entertain /> <br /> Being from Sweden and temporarily living in the US, it's funny how we react. "The deadbeat husband will kill him", "She (Gabriella) will die and then there will be a heartbreaking ending" We know how these things work, in the end everything comes together. And it did. The characters were a bit simple, they were so thought-out that you did not really think about it, nothing was really left to your imagination. Siv would probably be next, she'll let you wonder if she was actually in love with Daniel, but that's about it. <br /> <br /> But the movie is beautiful, set in rural Norrland, the music is absolutely amazing and the characters are adorable. Michael Nyqvist is really awesome, with his crazy, unique look and Frida Hallberg is charming and approachable. Maybe a bit too nice. <br /> <br /> But most of all you feel in this movie, and that's the most important thing. They cry, they laugh, they hate and they identify themselves. I do not know about you, but it does not happen that often.
