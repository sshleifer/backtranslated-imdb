I loved this movie. It was so well done! Great drama and drama and historically accurate. I love Romy Schneider films. This rocks, not as great as Sissi, but it rocks anyway! <br /> <br /> And Scorpiolina, she commented and said French dubbing. Well, that's originally a German movie, not French. So yes. Second, there was an action, maybe you do not know the story. Oh, and her mother played the role of her governess, not her teacher. And the story was not actually Cinderella, but Queen Victoria, maybe you missed that detail. <br /> <br /> But still ... yes, the story in this movie is great, I love historical movies and Queen Victoria is mesmerizing! I love all the historical stuff. Like this guy trying to manipulate her mother. And when she ran away and met her future husband, he showed her the "new way of dancing". When the rolling was new, it was considered scandalous because the couples dance so close. Yes, her governess was like oh my god! <br /> <br /> And also the clothes, I love the clothes. The styles are great, the skirt skirts are fantastic. And of course Romy always looks very pretty.
