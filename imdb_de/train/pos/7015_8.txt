Ben Thomas (Smith) plays an IRS agent who practically reveals the store to everyone's surprise. What kind of IRS agent is this? <br /> <br /> Most of us have heard the line from an IRS agent: "Hello, I'm from the IRS, I'm here to help." Our smile spreads into a giggle that says, "Yes, right." <br /> <br /> If you keep getting into this story, you can not understand this guy. He does not go to those who are being tested. What is his motive? Is he from another planet, an angel, a rich guy who wants to do good? He helps so much that we want him to be our auditor if we are audited of course. Hey, IRS, are you listening? (Joking, just kidding) <br /> <br /> The tempo of the movie is perfect and so much so that clues were ignored that would have told me what was really going on. Intense, repetitive, the focus focused on Ben and stays there. The whole movie works only for Ben while we try to find it, and I have not seen any clues (what clues do you say, Willis?). Reading the box before watching the DVD movie was the better way to go here. At the end of the film, I finally put everything together. Well, it was obvious. And yes, it's overkill but still a great story, mainly because of Will Smith. <br /> <br /> Will Smith should have been nominated for the Best Actor Award. The rest of the cast was also very good. <br /> <br /> Yes, it is exaggerated and despite the great acting and when you finally get all the answers, you have to realize that the message of the movie is wrong. What is the message? Believe me, you will not need too many hints to find out. I do not have <br /> <br /> violence: no. Sex: Yes, but nothing to be happy about. Fade. Nakedness: no. Language: No.
