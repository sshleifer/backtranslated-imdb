"Toi le Venin" is the masterpiece of Robert Hossein and one of the great thrillers of the fifties. Based on a novel by Frederic Dard, an author often collaborated with the director (see also "le Monte-Charge"), which Hossein did not stage but was also starring), the script grabs you from the first pictures on a desert road in the night a pretty blonde could be the wildest of the criminals, to the mysterious house where he finds his femme fatale .. a cat and mouse game begins. One of the sisters is in a wheelchair. But is she really handicapped? Who is the criminal who tried to kill the hero that night? <br /> <br /> The two actresses Marina Vlady and the late Odile Versois were sisters. <br /> <br /> Turn off all lights before you watch. Very exciting.
