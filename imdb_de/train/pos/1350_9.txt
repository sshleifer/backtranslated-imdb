In "Anne of Green Gables" (1934), Marilla Cuthbert (Helen Westley) and Matthew Cuthbert (OP Heggie), middle-aged siblings who live together in Green Gables, a farm in Avonlea on Prince Edward Island, decide to boy from faraway orphanages, to help on her farm. But the orphan being sent to them is a precocious girl of 14 named Anne Shirley (Dawn Evelyn Paris - a veteran of Disney's series of "Alice" shorts that later took her name from her character). <br /> <br /> Anne was only eleven years old in Lucy Maude Montgomery's source novel, but the same actress could not credibly go from eleven to college throughout history. The film suffers somewhat from this concession, as many of Anne's reactions, and much of what she says, come from an eleven-year-old teenager rather than a teenager. As in the book, Anne is bright and fast, willing, but dissatisfied with her name, physique, freckles and long red hair. However, as a child of fantasy, Anne enjoys life and quickly adapts to her new family and the surrounding area of ​​Prince Edward Island. In fact, Anne is the original "Teenage Drama Queen" and the film's scriptwriter chose this aspect of her character. Which turned the basic genre from a mildly amusing family drama into a comedy. A change that thrills audiences and continues to frustrate reader purists. <br /> <br /> Since the comedy is very much in the spirit of the history of Montgomery, I can see no reason to deal with the changes, but make this a reasonable warning for anyone who expects an absolutely faithful adaptation , The comedy element is the film's strength, as it is one of the earliest self-reflexive parodies of Hollywood conventions. The actress Anne Shirley was one of Hollywood's most beautiful beauties and the movie is in black and white. It's so much fun to see the title character's endless complaints about their looks and their hair color, which contradicts what's on the screen. Anne spoils her regularly with her melodramatic lines: "If you refuse, it will give me a lifetime of worry." Perhaps the funniest moment is when she corrects the spelling of her name on the class board. <br /> <br /> Tom Brown does a nice job because Anne's love interest Gilbert Blythe and Sara Haden steal all the scenes in which she appears as a pompous neighbor of Cuthbert. <br /> <br /> What else do I know? I am only a child.
