I saw this movie on DVD yesterday and was totally devious and amazed. The unaffected acting of DDL blew me away, and I was surprised by the whole cast and their excellent acting. All the characters were so authentic to me that I took DDL for Christy Burns and Brenda Fricker for his mother. Go and see it! You scream your heart, but experience a wonderful catharsis! It also teaches an important lesson: destiny is everything. You may be a cripple in the poor suburbs of Dublin, but if you are stubborn enough, you will not have any problems at all. If you can only handle your left foot, you're still good enough to be a painter or a writer. The worst thing you can do when mentally handicapped is self-pity. It will not get you anywhere and the only person who will feel sorry for you will be you.
