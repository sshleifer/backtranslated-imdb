A hit at the time, but now better categorized as Australian cult movie. The humor is broad, indeterminate and crude in the final scene where a BBC studio fire is erased by urinating. Includes as much as any cliché about the traditional Australian pilgrimage to the "old country" and any cliché about those greedy people who stay like Tory Brits. Acceptable for the British, because of their strong cast of well-known actors and for Australians of this generation who can "get the humor". Americans - forget it. The language and the jokes are in the Australian dialect of English and therefore incomprehensible.
