This movie wonder is one of those films that has a lasting effect on you. I've read one or two reviews of angry people that I think are either Republicans or kids bats, and their extremist remarks speak of the film's ability to confront people with their own darkest secrets. No such artwork has brought laughter and tears to me before, and that's the wonder of the movie. The realism of the film and its performance by Bret Carr is unmistakable. The nature of the almost interactive effect makes people either leave the theater liberated or question their identity. Bravo at the next level of cinema.
