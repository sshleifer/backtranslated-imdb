After that, I watched the movies ... I thought, "Why was this movie so successful at the Korean box office?" Although the film had a clever / unusual scenario, the acting was not so good and the characters were not very interesting. For a Korean movie ... I liked the fight scenes. If you want to watch a movie without thinking, this is the movie for you. But I have to admit ... the movie was kinda childish ... 6/10
