I love this show because it is full of adventure, love and intrigue. Well, love it! It's so good to see a show where all the characters work well together and treat each other with respect. It is also very good to see Dick Van Dyke in a television role, as I only saw him in Mary Poppins. The mix of main characters Mark, Amanda, Jesse and Steve captivates the audience. This is a show you have to see!
