I have not laughed so much for a long time - though the movie has some sad moments too, especially when it goes from hyper-funny to honest and serious. The characters are usually very realistic, sometimes juicy, but quite believable. I'm not a fan of the Jerry Springer show - I'm sorry for the people taking part. This movie is a satire instead, and he's fine. Too bad that all the explosives were broadcast on public television while this movie was being broadcast on public television. I will rent this movie to fully enjoy it. <br /> <br />
