The idea is a very short movie with lots of information. Interesting, entertaining and leaves the viewer more. The producer has produced a short film of excellent quality that is unlike any other short film I've seen. I rated this movie with the highest possible rating. I also recommend that it be shown to office managers and business people in every facility. What comes out is the fact that people with ideas are never listened to and their voices are never heard. This is a lesson to be learned from any office that wants to move forward. I hope the producer produces a second part of this 'idea'. I'm looking forward to seeing the sequence. Congratulations to the Halaqah media for developing a film of excellent quality and quality with a view to teaching.
