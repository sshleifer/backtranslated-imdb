The story of peace-loving farmers and citizens struggling for land, water, law and order, and the respect and definitive subjugation of the long-entrenched livestock interests and their rented guns had been rewritten as good in earlier (Shane) and probably later films. There are some good action scenes and the general layout of the story, except for a disappointing ending, is well executed. Law and order and religion have taken root in the city, but the old order of cattle drives, cowboys and gunslingers still exists. The clash of the two comes in a beautifully staged ambush scene, in which the citizens ride in a trap. Granger, a former shooter, plays the guy who is shunned by the citizens who need his skills with a weapon.
