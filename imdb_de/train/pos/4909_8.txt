Most films about or in New Orleans turn out to be ridiculously bad and ridiculously inaccurate (Example: Remember "The Savage Bees." But I make an exception for "Tightrope," which was almost right). <br /> <br /> Here is one who does not inevitably misunderstand it. The accents are not too bad (yes, the "yat" accent down here is much more Brooklynese than south), the city of 1950 is shown as it was / was, without the obligatory "tourist" shots, and they understand a good drama, without trying to make everyone a "quirky Southerner". <br /> <br /> One of the few films that does justice to this city, and a good movie.
