Since Keifer Sutherland plays my favorite character in the history of television, it was a foregone conclusion that I would go to the cinema and spend $ 15 on it. I also think that this is true for the fans of Eva Longoria. <br /> <br /> The film is about a leak that a Secret Service agent is planning to assassinate the president. As the investigation unfolds, it seems to be the only likely candidate of highly decorated Pete (Michael Douglas). Pete begs innocence and goes into the fun, elusive style to seek the truth. <br /> <br /> It's solid, but certainly not spectacular. A decent cast, a decent story, but I felt a little empty, but you could certainly make it worse.
