The Snowy River II man does not reinvent the wheel but is an attractive movie that captivates many viewers. <br /> <br /> For all the fans who want the elements that make up the original Man From Snowy River movie hit (stunning scenery, sweeping film score, sweet romance and action) This film delivers a lot. This story begins a few years after the end of the first, Jim (Tom Burlinson) has his fortune collected in a brood of riding horses. He picks up where he left off where he left off, with his cute, well-earned lover Jessica (played by the Australian Australian goddess Sigrid Thornton) still trying to break her cropped upbringing on the feather station of her feathers (Harrison is now played by American Brian Dennehy). The film for Jim and the character that shakes the plot is wealthy high-class snob Alistair Patton (Nicholas Eadie), who has Jessica in mind. Add some social tension to the mix that surrounds the landowner and the stallion with a bad attitude from the first movie, and that's the storyline. <br /> <br /> The best thing about this movie is acting. Tom Burlinson fits in well with Jim's broad brim and laconic humor. Sigrid Thornton is a lovely heroine, and they both create real chemistry on the canvas. Filling Kirk Douglas' solid shoes has never been easy, and Brian Dennehy stamps and screams, but never feels very authentic. <br /> <br /> The music is sweeping and lush, and cinematography could play a role in Victoria's tourist role. However, there are moments that feel very forgiving, as if the director just wanted to show a helicopter shot of the riders to show just how gorgeous the landscape is without a personal human drama. A little more sand would have sufficed here, we are Aussies, we can take it !! There are some JAWSish moments with the stallion that defy belief. The funny thing about this film, however, is that there are some really imaginative and touching scenes among some blatant clich√©s. Jim puts the saddle on the stallion (VERY horse whispers ahead of his time) Jim and Jessica sit home, the fabulous scene in which Jim Alistair shows his reliable whip. I can see why this character is such a symbol. <br /> <br /> Overall, a very pleasing continuation. We hope that everyone involved wants to make a new one. The Man of the Snowy River III: The CRAIGS. I'm sure we'd all like to see Jim and Jessica go on their farm. <br /> <br /> The Aussie DVD contains a few extra scenes. It's worth it if you're already a fan.
