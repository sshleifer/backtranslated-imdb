One of the better kung fu films, but not quite as flawless as I had hoped given the glowing reviews. The movie starts well enough with the jokes that are visual enough to translate the language barrier (which is rarer than you would expect for that era) and to make the non-fighting dialogue sequences passable (for a kung fu movie, this is the case) a great compliment). Unlike other Chinese action films, which are always historical pieces or (following Jackie Chan's Police Story I) police drama, Pedicab Driver gives us an insight into contemporary rural China. Unfortunately, in the last third of the movie, a dive into a dark melodrama tragedy is necessary, which I thought was unnecessary. <br /> <br /> The action is overall good and shows a duel between Sammo and 1/2 of the Shaw Brothers' only 2 stars, Kar-Leung Lau, and in the end a fight with the bigger guy, who is always the villain of Jet Li plays. There is only 20 minutes of fighting here, which is standard, but what bothers me is the obvious acceleration of the camera images. I feel they have to film half the speed so they do not get hurt, but there are smooth edits and then there's something else. It's really a fight for the fights when it's so obvious that the footage got mixed up. <br /> <br /> So, if you like kung fu movies, my opinion here will not scare you off, and if not you've just spent 2 minutes of your life reading that.
