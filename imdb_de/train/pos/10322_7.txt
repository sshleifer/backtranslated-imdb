The problem is that the film fit in with the coattails of the 1960s concept that comic books could only be run as a "camp" (ie The 60s Batman show) for TV and film. So you have combat sequences with subtitles (come on!), An unsuspectingly unromantic Doc Savage (he was uncomfortable with women in pulps, not an idiot), Monk Mayfair in a night sheet (a scene that guarantees you nightmares for several nights) and that completely hokey ended up with the secondary villain, wrapped in gold like Herve Villechez, who pretends to be an Oscar-Statute. And if it's not about booming Sousa march scores, the little, funny music undercuts much of the drama. <br /> <br /> Even if this is the case, this movie is ... okay. It's fun and if it's serious, it's a very accurate representation of the pulp. With the exception of Monk, as already mentioned, he is very muscular, not obese. And Long Tom, who's supposed to be a pale, skinny guy with an attitude, not Paul Gleason with an (inexplicable) scarf. <br /> <br /> The green death sequences, for example, are remarkably cruel and not something of mine would recommend it for children. However, they are very close to the feeling of the pulp. If the writers and producers get it right, they got it right - I'll give it to them. <br /> <br /> But if the producers would have done Doc with the loving care and scripting of, say Reeves', two Superman Movies, think what we had at that time. I think the problem is the schizophrenia of the movie. There is a sense of trying a 30-year tribute, but they also try to give in to Batman's attitude of "heroes must camp". One gets the impression that there was a sober first draft of Pulpastil, and then someone came and said, "Hey, let's make fun of it - it worked with the Batman show 8 years ago!" <br /> <br /> But Doc continues to live thanks to Earl MacRauch and Buckaroo Banzai. If MacRauch does not pay homage to Doc Savage in this movie, the man is really crazy. When the series actually appears on television (supposedly mid-season '99 -00), Doc Savage will be live again, updated to the '90s.
