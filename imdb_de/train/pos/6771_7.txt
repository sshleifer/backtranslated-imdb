Yes, it is quite nostalgic to watch the first episode, because this is the one I definitely remember. I like to watch the first season and yes, compared to the action packed shows we have now, this show seems to be lame. But honestly, I like the less violent part of the show and the story has more substance than the new one. I found it interesting that Belisarius Airwolf and JAG have a similar theme - the main actors (Hawke and Harm) are both looking for a MIA relative (brother, father). I wonder if Robert Belisario's personal life mimics the theme of these two shows. <br /> <br /> Question - does anyone have pictures of Hawke's cabin? I love this cabin (sort of like a dream cabin of mine) and that's one of the scenes I remember about Airwolf.
