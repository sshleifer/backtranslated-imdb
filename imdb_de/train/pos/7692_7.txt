First I will give my overall rating for the series. ******* 7 out of 10 stars. I took three for the descent that suffered this series after the departure of John Amos. Do not get me wrong, there were later hard-hit consequences, but only after Esther's role had gone for a season and had returned. <br /> <br /> In February 1974, a really great sitcom (with dramatic overtones) premiered CBS. It was a television program, a show about an African American family living in the Chicago Projects in the 1970s. He was created by Norman Lear as a spin-off of "Maude" and met with the audience again the right chord. <br /> <br /> Since this show, I have not seen a sitcom talk directly about the struggles of families in the cities. (Well, there was Fox's "South Central" in 1994, but it was not renewed.) John Amos as James Evans senior was the ultimate father figure for this family and acted as every dad should hold His family together and his children were on the wrong track. <br/> <br/> Esther Rolle was a wonderful, meaningless mother figure who was on the same side with her husband when it came to raising her children. <br /> <br /> Ralph Carter as Michael, a young but very smart young man for his age, but in a school system that does not meet his academic needs. The name of his character is the same as the founder of the show, Mike Evans, who was Lionel Jefferson in "The Jeffersons". (Mike Evans died in December 2006). <br /> <br /> Thelma is a young girl of 16 or 17 years and has to deal with the dangers of a young woman on the streets of the ghetto. Jimmie Walker as J.J. Evans Jr. is the typical young, wise young man who does not take life seriously enough. <br /> <br /> Put simply, all my favorite episodes are with John Amos, with the exception of the Penny Gordon / Janet Jackson storylines. <br /> <br /> After the demise of the James Evans character, the show lost stability and the crowd left. Esther's role left a whole year and did not want to play the second fiddle of JJ's clever aleck "Dyno-mite's"! <br /> <br /> She returned the following season, after she had made sure that the author would make up for it. Florida's neighbor, Wilona Woods, was a divorced woman who eventually adopted an abused little girl Penny Gordon (played by then-10-year-old Janet Jackson). Penny's abusive mother was played by Totie Fields, Kim Fields' mother. The show ended in August 1979 and all projects were abandoned to enable a better life. JJ, the artist, had sold an idea to a comic book company, and Michael went from college to campus. <br /> <br/> Wilona & Penny, Thelma and Keith & Florida's husband, who worked with the football player, moved to the same building in north Chicago. Not the most realistic end, but until then it did not matter.
