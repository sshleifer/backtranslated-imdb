Although William Hurt is no longer an American matinee idol, he still has a good taste in B-movie projects. Here he plays a specialist in the disposal of hazardous waste with a tragic past, tracking down a longtime loser - played by the former pretty Weller - who was contaminated with a deadly poison. The current handsome boy Hardy Kruger Jr - possibly prettier than his father - is portrayed as Weller's arrogant boss in a terrible sequence in a chemical manufacturing facility that sets the story in motion. Natasha McElhone is a somewhat crazy government agent who deals with the incident and offers inevitable and up-coming love interest for the hero Hurt. Michael Brandon appears to play a slimy take-no-prisoner type you can not wait for. Coca-Cola wins the Product Placement Award for 2000 as the refreshment drink is seen throughout the production and was filmed on-site on a winter postcard in Hungary.
