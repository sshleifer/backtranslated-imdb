The Best of Times is one of the big sleepers of all time. The setup does not burden your patience, the development is consistent, the many interlinked relationships are lovingly tied, the jokes and bits work and everything is funny. There is a lot of sentimentality. Kurt Russell, who plays Reno Hightower, plays one of his best performances, and Robin Williams, who plays Jack Dundee, is sure-footed as always. The cast also includes many great supporters. Jack's wife is played by Jack Palance's daughter who is adorable, as well as Reno's wife, who is a great comedian. I can not tell you how many times I've seen this movie, how many times I enjoyed it, and how many times I wish more people could see it.
