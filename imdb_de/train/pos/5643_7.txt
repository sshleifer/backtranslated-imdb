Mary Pickford ("born July 4" as Angela Moore) is "The Little American" (French origin); She falls in love with Jack Holt (as Karl von Austreim), who moved to America with his German father and American mother. The French-American Raymond Hatton (as Count Jules de Destin of the "Fighting Destins") has fallen in love with Mrs. Pickford. Finally, the triangles of love triangles ends in France, with the Great War (World War I, in hindsight) complicating their lives considerably. The torpedo and sinking of a ship carrying Pickford is Titanic. The intrigue of the war becomes dramatic as Pickford slowly becomes a covert spy for France, while the Germans occupy their parents' home. Of course, the German lover Holt arrives. It was hard to believe that they recognized each other as long as he moved in because of the rape, but it was dark; and earlier events made them believe dead. The film goes far beyond the point in its symbolism. Incidentally, Pickford was Canadian - though few could deny that she was not a "Little American", in every way. <br /> <br /> Fun to discover "extras" that later became stars was Wallace Beery, Colleen Moore and Ramon Novarro - especially with Mr. Novarro, who shows "star" quality in one of the film's most memorable sequences : Pickford and the wounded soldier greet each other as he is taken from her on a stretcher. Novarro even has Mary Pickford write a letter for him; Obviously, he has a future in pictures. Future-oriented is Ben Alexander, who plays the boy "Bobby"; He becomes a reliable children actor and grows up in "Dragnet" as a Jack Webb partner. <br /> <br /> ******* The Little American (7/12/17) Cecil B.
