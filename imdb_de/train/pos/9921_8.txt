I've been an admirer of Edward Burtynsky's work for years, and it was a pleasure to see the man at work, thanks to Jennifer Baichwal's documentary. The austere beauty of the Bangladesh shipbuilding, the Vermont quarry, the huge assembly plant in China, the beleaguered old quarters in Shanghai just waiting to be pulled down: these landscapes are so well captured by the filmmaker. <br /> <br /> Sometimes I thought of old television documentaries about abandoned coal mines and plastic factory. the stuff I grew up with. Burtynsky's work has the great value of pointing out that industrial activity has only shifted to Asia and has not stopped. The strangest scene for me was the computer junkyard somewhere in China - the garbage looked threatening, while the workers were very happy.
