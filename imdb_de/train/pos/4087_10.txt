I have to say, I thought I saw everything. I am an extremely blunt film fan. This movie did not shock me in any way. I'm way beyond this point. But it took me to certain emotional places that I did not know I could visit. I had no idea that I could ever find the idea of ​​animality erotic. Never never never. Ever. Ever. But let's go. He did it. I have to give the director the recognition. He took it off. <br /> <br /> For the first 40 minutes, this movie is a total hole. We start with some very explicit shots of two horses having sex. After five minutes, I wondered if buying this movie was not a mistake. Then an old man in a wheelchair talks to another old man about two people getting married. Then a nervous guy shaves. Then we see (briefly) a hot girl who puts on a butler (but that's very short). At this point, I swore the movie aloud while trying to stay awake. In fact, I fell asleep for 40 minutes and forced myself to finish it the next evening. <br /> <br /> We finally get the good stuff, if a girl (who knows who she is or who somebody is) in this movie) has a dream of a victorian girl being devastated by an animal in the forest , The scene lasts for a while and is really the meat (heh-heh) of the whole deal. It is beautifully shot, excellently processed and delivers the goods. They try to sum up the plot at the end and it makes some sense, but somehow not. Well. I would definitely recommend this movie. The first 40 minutes have made me turn myself (and my TV), but the last 50 minutes completely solve it.
