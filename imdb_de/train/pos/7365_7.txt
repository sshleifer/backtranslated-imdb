I found that very touching as Spike and Heaton stay together throughout the movie, not to say that there are not a few betrayals along the way. I thought the chase was set aside, the relationship between the two was in my opinion in the foreground. I had already guessed that Heaton had such gay intentions. My favorite scene was the one in which Heaton and Spike were stuck in the swamp and Spike was running, I generally thought Spike would not come back. I have to say, if our film teacher had not forced us to see this, I probably would never have seen it. All in all, I found the movie pretty good and I would recommend it to anyone who is a fan of British films.
