I really enjoyed this movie and it was a bit difficult to do that when your brother made stupid comments every 30 seconds. But I really liked this movie, especially because I'm used to the usual HK action movies. Most movies like this one do not look for the story, but for the thoughtless action. And thoughtless action is right. You see Jet Li jump, spin, kick, hit, shoot, make impossible jumps and dodge countless bullets. It is true that this film was made accessible to a wider audience after Li was in Lethal Weapon 4. That's one of the reasons why the reviews for this movie have fallen. Most people probably expected a movie as polished as a North American movie. However, most HK film budgets are not nearly as high as in a North American movie, and the style in an HK action movie is usually very different, which is usually required in cable work in many of them. If you want to watch a good action movie, you should see this. Just try to ignore dubbing. <br /> <br /> My rating was 8.
