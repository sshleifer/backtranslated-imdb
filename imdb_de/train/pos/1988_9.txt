First and foremost, I would like to reiterate a correction to this film that said the last musical that won the Best Picture Academy Award was "Gigi" in 1958. This is disinformation, since "West Side Story" was won in 1962. "My Fair Lady" won in 1965 and "Sound of Music" won a year later. The movie is absolutely fantastic! The story from the novel has changed a bit, but that's more because of the limitations they had on a stage than just not changing back to a filmed version. I do not mind though. I rather think that the entire production flows better than the novel. I like it when Nancy brings Oliver to the bridge and kills her there instead of later in the apartment. The subtle things in this movie make me laugh. I love the moment when Mr. Bumble and Mrs. Bumble come out of the governorship office at the beginning. The underline for this moment is brilliant. My three favorite actors for this film were Jack Wild, who plays the best Dodger in any movie version of the story, Ron Moody, a playful and humorous fagin (this character is way better than him in the book) and Shani Wallis, the strongest and most desperate version of Nancy is. The only reason why I give this film a 9 instead of a 10 is due to the two big production numbers "Concider Yourself" and "Who Will Buy". I always hate when the choreography in musicals should look like people do their daily chores and jobs. It looks awful and cheesy, especially when they dance in the London Meat Co. They should have been doing choreography for these scenes. However, this film is a rare treasure that will hopefully stay with us forever.
