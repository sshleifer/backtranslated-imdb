That's what t.v. should be. And Pushing Daisies meets these expectations. Pushing Daisies is a beautifully designed and well-designed show. It's one of the few shows available at Primetime that has integrity. It's not about the normal action, the sex, the money or the murderous angle of any other show on TV. It's a show that makes you think and laugh, but although the basic plot seems impossible, the concepts are real to all of us. You want something that you can not have, hope for someone who wants us, get rid of your past and look for family, even in the most unlikely places, etc. I recognize that ABC has this wonderful show at this point in the Substantially aborted and will most likely replace it with a show that goes beyond the point of integrity. I suppose everything will be fine ... it is a pity that there are no other shows on ABC now that make you feel really good after watching.
