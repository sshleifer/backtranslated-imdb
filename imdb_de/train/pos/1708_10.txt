If you look at some of the negative posts, you really have to ask yourself what some people do for fun. <br /> <br /> I was fortunate enough to see the movie during its too short run. The audience laughed. I watch a tape while I write, and it's still funny! <br /> <br /> It also has a sweet side with unexpected twists of real pathos. The late, grand Royal Dano is especially effective as the lonely, happy farmer Wrenchmuller. Ariana Richards and J.J. Anderson are great as main kids. And the actors in the Martian suits are limited to mime, but they do a great job. <br /> <br /> Another thing to look for is the background information. The film is full of homages, pastiches and references to other SF and fantasy films. Take a look at the Mars costumes next time. One of them is wearing a Marty McFly costume, another is a Ghostbuster, a third is in a uniform from House Atreides and a fourth is wearing a Last Starfighter flight suit.
