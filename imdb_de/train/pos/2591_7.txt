Offbeat and rather entertaining sleeper with respect to two very different brothers, both of whom are not just so-called "fire starters" (think Stephen King snoring a book of the same name), but always in contradiction to a woman has a pretty bad habit of being a pyromaniac! Good special effects (especially towards the end), bizarre performances by a rather talented trio of actors and a really interesting and oddly fitting soundtrack make "Wilder Napalm" a unique pleasure of a movie you can watch ... if you can find it it is that! Personally, I was fortunate to get it out of my two-dollar garbage bin at my local video store. (*** out *****)
