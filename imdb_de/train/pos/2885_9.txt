When it comes to fairy tales, Cinderella was the one who made you cry the most. Poor Cinderella is a girl who was stolen all her life by two wicked and ugly stepsisters and a slave-driver mother. Thanks to Mr. Walt Disney we were able to see Cinderella in the animation. <br /> <br /> Before the story begins, Cinderella and her father are lonely and beyond their needs. To share his wealth and give his daughter some sisters, Cinderella's father marries a wife, but soon dies. the stepmother who saw only dollar signs in her eyes and slavery in her beautiful stepdaughter Cinderella. <br /> <br /> So for many days Cinderella is a slave to her stepmother and step-sisters. However, she has hope, thanks to her friends, the mice of the house (sounds as if Cinderella had not played with a full deck). She hopes that one day she will find her prince. The chance finally comes when the Prince of the Kingdom needs a girlfriend. <br /> <br /> 9/10
