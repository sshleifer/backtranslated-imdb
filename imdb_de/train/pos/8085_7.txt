One thing I can say about this movie is long, VERY LONG! I recently bought this movie recently when I found out that a new version was coming out. I was glad it was made in 1978 because the 70s (although I've never lived in them) are actually one of my favorite decades, especially for the music! When I saw this movie, the story was very good in the beginning, but after about 50 minutes it got very boring and repetitive. I'll admit that the animation impressed me! It was not something I had seen before and it was pretty cool to see. But the film could honestly have been a bit better, he had a lot more to tell and tell than just fifteen to twenty-minute scenes in which there were only strange fights. For the past 5 or 10 minutes, the film has picked up and recovered, but ended unexpectedly. In my opinion, I found it extremely long. I know it's 13 minutes over 2 hours and that's still long for a cartoon, but since it was boring for the most part of the movie, it made it look like it was 4 hours !!!! but overall, it's an okay movie, I think, and I'll see it again on one of those "nothing to do" days. I will see the new and hope it is better!
