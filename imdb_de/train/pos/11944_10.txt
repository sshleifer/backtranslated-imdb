I wanted to give an 8, but since you made people out of much better votes 6.5, I had to increase my contribution. The river Styx was a pure genius. Sure, Woody was his constant stuff, but at least his role was appropriate. The first half hour was really funny, and then the rest of the movie was easy to see. The dialogue was smart enough, and Woody's card games at the parties along with the upper crust response were fun to watch. It was much better than the newspaper critics thought. And a plus, a little sorcerer's apprentice who joins in. And have you noticed, of course, that Johansen is getting a bit weird? Charles Dance is always entertaining, just like Hugh Jackman.
