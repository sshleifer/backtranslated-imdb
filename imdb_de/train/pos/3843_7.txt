When I saw this film for the first time in the theater of a foreign film festival, I found it fascinating and fascinating for the sensitive, bi-sexual artist. So much European, so Dutch! I recently rented it for a second visit and could hardly avoid laughing at this revamped theme of the crazy writer with a religious-sexual orientation tracking complex. Get under control! This guy is a freeloader who lives on society. I suspect that the real reason he has these fantasy nightmares about the "spider-woman" is that after years of ignoring his mother's advice to get into a car (and a bed) with strangers, his guilt complex is kicking in! Not only does he make unbelievably large (probably tax-free) loot to invent stories (guilty journey), but he is too cheap to pay for a haircut, so he urges the owner of the beauty salon. Then he has the nerve to complain about the bill! But I also suspect that the world has changed a lot since the creation of this movie. Seriously, it was entertaining to see some of Jan de Bont's camera work and one of Paul Verhoeven's earlier films. Hmmm, maybe the world has not changed that much?
