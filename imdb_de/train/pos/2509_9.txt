Vampires, sexy guys, weapons and some blood. Who could ask for more? Moon Child delivers everything in a beautifully packaged movie! Gackt is the innocent Sho - who befriends a vampire Kei (HYDE), his relationship grows over time, but as Sho ages, Kei's immortality breaks his heart. It does not help that both fall in love with the same woman. The special effects are quite good given the low budget. It is a touching story full of human emotions. You'll laugh, cry, laugh, then cry more. SEE THIS FILM, even if you're not a fan of their music. It is ideal as a stand-alone vampire movie. <br /> <br /> 9 out of 10
