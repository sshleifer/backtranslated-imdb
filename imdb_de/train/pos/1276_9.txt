I love this movie. The Noir imagery combined with Spillane's understated character Mike Hammer works wonderfully to create a mood and rarely to be found in low-budget detective films of the early fifties. It may not be "The Maltese Falcon", but this film adds its own contribution to the genre. Spillane is often criticized for alleged misogyny, etc., but his "dames" are far above their male counterparts in terms of cunning and intelligence. Poor old Mike Hammer, as effectively played by Biff Elliott, is dazzled by the beauty of the mysterious psychiatrist he encounters when investigating the death of an army colleague. When the penny finally falls, his face is a picture. Good to see that the censors of the 50s did not force the filmmakers to omit the famous last line. A true low budget classic.
