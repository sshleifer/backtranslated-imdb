Stephen King movies are a funny thing for me. I either really love her or I detest her. I did not like some of the fancier productions (like Desperation and Storm of the Century). I really loved some of the smaller ones. Sleepwalkers is one that I really enjoy and watch regularly. <br /> <br /> The story revolves around Charles Brady and his mother Mary. They are sleepwalkers, shape-changing creatures that, though looking human, turn into a feline creature. They are insensitive to scratches in cats. When they move to a new city, they set traps to catch and kill the animals. When they move to their last city, they have to go to a virgin, and when Charles finds one, he actually falls for them, but his mother has to feed on her to maintain her power. The story is about what will happen to the girl. Will Charles spares her or uses her to save his mother. <br /> <br /> Although this story has incest tones that some find unsightly, it actually plays a role in the story and is therefore not simply portrayed in the movie for the sake of scandal. Like most Stephen King stories, she lives in a small town with many interesting characters. Acting is not the best, not even the special effects, but somehow the whole thing tends to "gel" and is very observable and pleasingly adaptable. <br /> <br /> For British Readers: This production has been most recently shown on BBC1, Sci-Fi and Sky Thriller / Horror.
