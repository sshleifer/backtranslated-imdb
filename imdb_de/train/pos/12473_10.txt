A warm, touching film with imaginative quality. <br /> <br /> Ellen Burstyn is outstanding as always. <br /> <br /> Samantha Mathis has done a lot of great things, but it's just something about her memory. <br /> <br /> Most of all, you have to see this amazing 5-year-old. old, Jodelle Ferland. I was so fascinated by her presence that I had to buy the movie to see her again and again. She is a miracle of the creation of God. <br /> <br /> After the high IMDB rating I am not the only one who was fascinated by this young actress.
