Philo Vance (William Powell) helps to solve several murders among the rich for a dog show. <br /> <br /> I usually hate overly kinky secrets (like this), but I LOVE this movie. It moves very fast (only 72 minutes), is wonderfully directed by Michael Curtiz (he used countless camera tricks that only accelerate the narrative), has a very sophisticated story (including a solution for a murder in a closed room, the unbelievable was) and has a very good cast. <br /> <br /> Powell is Vance very polite and great - he does not seem to act - he's Vance! Mary Astor does not have much to do, but she gives the production class and beauty. Everyone else is very good too, but Eugene Pallette is best as Detective Heath. He is a very good actor with a very distinctive voice and some of his lines were hilarious. <br /> <br /> Basically an excellent murder mystery from the 1930s in Hollywood. Worth seeing. <br /> <br />
