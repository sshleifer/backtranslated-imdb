I sit through films like "Tiempo de valientes" and spend hours talking about cinema. The admiration that this film has given me goes beyond my own limits, as I look at the scenes of the film and search my mind for ideas for filming and dialogue innovation that might arise from something greater than Damian Szifron's mind. </ br> <br /> Look at the environment, so uncompromising, so easy, I think; This man is a genius. No wonder he made probably the best television show in Argentina, and then a first film full of elements that some contemporary directors have not yet reached. "El fondo del mar" is the name that evoked (a few years ago) my enthusiasm for our everyday cinema. <br /> <br /> On the way out of people's everyday life, Szifron goes to where Pablo Trapero could never be in "El Bonaerense"; the life of the Federal Police Department. Trapero's film was a journey into the thoughts and experiences of a man, not the places he saw. Yes, there was a detailed training and many crime situations, but Szifron is "in there", it's more of a detective story, like the ones we know and love, with the mysteries and the exciting music. <br /> <But there is a lot of humanity in his writings, and he shows us his investigations through the eyes of his protagonists Alfredo Díaz and Mariano Silverstein. There are many actors of great caliber in the film, but these two actors are the ones the film can not do without. The first character (Luis Luque) is a detective who has just found out that his wife is cheating on him. and has to work on a case. <br /> <br /> The second is a psychiatrist, to whom the detective's treatment is assigned. He wants to contact him on a regular basis, but the sheriff uses the scheduling and suggests he join Díaz in his routine: "It's nothing, the usual stuff, no problem." But it's bigger than that, and it will unfold part of the doctor's personality he did not know. <br /> <br /> The relationship that has developed between the two derivatives can not be explained unless it is considered to be such a complexity that shows how talented men like Szifron are trying today to leave a signature in our history. Díaz achieves points of incredible spontaneity during high pressure and tells Silverstein, "How do we continue our treatment?" And Silverstein answers, "No, I'm not your doctor, they call me for dinner, I'm your friend." We laugh because we can not help it. <br /> <br /> And we do not have to laugh when Díaz smashes a car in the street and does not give importance to him or when he enters it all the red lights on the street, or when he smokes in his police patrol and Silverstein it can not believe (but then smokes too, because he is messed up); or when Silverstein tries to be friends with Díaz's robbers. Magic by Diego Peretti we get there. He, himself a psychiatrist, gives a performance in the plan "Locas de Amor", but impresses with its full range. Luis Luque, on the other hand, is back on track with a first-rate performance reminding us of the great actor he is. <br /> <br /> I have a passion for it, and like I said, I could write for hours, but unfortunately that does not work and I have to be precise and to summarize. Although I have to look at many of the old films and study them, could I assure you that "Tiempo de valientes" is the comedy Argentina has been waiting for and never got? Until now.
