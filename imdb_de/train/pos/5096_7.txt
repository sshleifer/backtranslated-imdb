This is a far-reaching remake (4 hours) of the story of Rider Haggard, with the usual female figure and a subsidiary plot with Russian soldiers seeking a "stone of power" buried along with the treasure of King Solomon. It is very well received, gives a lively feeling for the wide open spaces of Africa and is played very well. Patrick Swayze is an excellent Alan Quatermain and Allison Doody is attractive as Elizabeth Maitland, who hired Quatermain to rescue her father. Sidede Onyulo as Umbopa, Gavin Hood as McNabb and the leader of the Russian soldiers (not mentioned in the list of IMDb) are also memorable. Although Hollywood can not leave a good story behind you when you adapt it, this story is well told and, besides being too long, I enjoyed it. 10.6.
