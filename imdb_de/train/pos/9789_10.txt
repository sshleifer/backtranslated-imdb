The story is told fluently. There are no breaks. The Flash Backs are woven seamlessly into the present. Casting was great. The young Ya'ara looked very similar, as if Ya'ara had looked at this age. Her portrayal of a blind person was made convincing. Director Daniel Syrkin has done a great job in getting the various actors to work together in this story. The camera is very good. You feel with Ya'ara and Talia walking on the ocean to the edge of the cliff. The English subtitles follow the Hebrew Scriptures very closely. It is interesting to note that Out of Sight is not a direct translation of Lemarit Ayin. Both names match the story very well.
