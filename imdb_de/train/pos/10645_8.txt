Adolf Hitler's crazy will to impose his will on the rest of the world is the subject of this second in a seven-part series of films introduced to the Armed Forces by the US War Department as a teaching tool for new soldiers during World War II. Hitler's plan was methodical and well thought out, from the conquest of Eastern Europe, through the heartland of Europe, to the "world island" of Europe, Asia and Africa. His last step would be to reach the oceans for the ultimate conquest of America and the world. <br /> <br /> In 1935, Hitler ordered national conscription as the rest of the country fell under his spell. Schoolchildren praised him and young German boys were trained and trained in military camps. In 1938 he marched unmolested to Austria, followed by the annexation of an area on the border with Germany and the Czechoslovak Sudetenland. In 1939, Hitler captured the entire Czechoslovakia. Later in the year, the world became stunned when she learned that Germany had signed a non-aggression pact with its deadly enemy Russia, a trick to delay Hitler's military involvement on too many fronts. Immediately thereafter, Germany invaded Poland and brought Hitler's conquest right in front of Russia's door. He would deal with her later. <br /> <br /> At that time, Great Britain still refused to oppose Hitler's push across Europe. Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain felt that he had won his country a big victory by accepting a treaty with Germany, his notorious statement entitled "Peace in our time". It did not turn out that way. <br /> <br /> The most intriguing information that I have come across in this episode was at least a small portion of a German pro-Hitler rally in the mid-30s. It was headed by a German American who jumped straight out home came. The venue - Madison Square Garden!
