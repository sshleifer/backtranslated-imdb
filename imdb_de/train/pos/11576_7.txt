It tries to be the epic adventure of the century. And with cast such as Sh√¥ Kasugi, Christopher Lee and John-Rhys Davies, it's really the perfect B adventure of all time. It's actually a pretty fun, daring adventure that, despite its shortcomings, arouses your interest. It must have felt like the biggest movie ever made for the people who did it. Even if it was made in the 90s, it does not look modern. It has more of the same feeling that an old movie by Errol Flynn had. Big adventure movies are the big thing in Hollywood again, but I'm afraid the feeling in them will never be the same as those old movies. This in turn only has the real feeling. You just can not hate it. I think it's an okay adventure movie. And I really love the soundtrack. Damn, I want the title song.
