An extremely humorous but honest comedy about a few adults (Bill Paxton, Julie Warner, Kevin Pollak, Elizabeth Perkins, Vincent Spano, Matt Craven and Diane Lane). Canada from her former consultant (Alan Arkin). The author / director Mike Binder has used his experience in the same warehouse as the main source for creating a soft and understandable yarn that makes sense. The movie also has many funny moments, some of which are totally bizarre, like my favorite, which includes one using tape. Newton Thomas Sigel ("The Usual Suspects," "Three Kings") provides the film with impressive shots of the Canadian wilderness. Among the cast members is Sam Raimi, director of "THE EVIL DEAD" movies and "The Gift," as Arkin's limping right-hand man. One more thing, this movie has assured me that a camp does not have to be a place of bloody murders.
