The life and time of Little Richard, as told by Little Richard and produced and directed by Little Richard, was about as one-sided as one of his songs. This is not a biography or even a docudrama, but has good writing, great energy and a great lead actor playing Richard. All the music is from Little Richard, so there's a tight lipstick in every song. <br /> <br /> The film covers his early childhood, the musical career through the formative years of music, the wild success and Richard, who throws away everything to praise the Lord. Everything is well connected, and the obvious comeback of 1962 manages to turn away from the idea that Little Richard has discovered the Beatles who have opened up for him. <br /> <br /> My main objection is that his outrageous behavior against cultural behavior is underplayed and you can not get a sense of how his audience experienced him back then. Some of his energy that he still has is not used with full force. He seemed tame compared to what I remember of him at the time. <br /> <br /> The best scenes are how Richard is hit by Lucille and writes a song about it and the strip bikini shorts during the performance to do that Imagine there's no decent place where you can change. <br /> <br /> If they had gotten into the "Bronze Liberace," as Richard himself points out in interviews, then there is a story. Trust me, I saw him a few months ago. He is still flirting with the pretty white guys and gives his headband to the one very good dancer in the audience. Almost 68 and still strong, I recommend this movie and any concerts or TV performances you can find. Little Richard is always on
