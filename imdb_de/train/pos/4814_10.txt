I saw that on the big screen and was encased in it. The time of Queen Victoria's younger years is a mystery and this is a perfect description of how a young girl was pushed into one of the highest roles in the world. <br /> <br /> The script is perfect, the drama is incredible, the story and attention to every detail is out of this world. Emily Blunt is perfect as Victoria. Funny how her mother is played by Elizabeth I and William IV by Prince Albert! (Think of Blackadder). <br /> <br /> This depiction of Victoria shows that she was once a rebellious young woman - I'm sure she would have been in the Jeremey Kyle show, if it had been then: "My mother and her boyfriend are trying to steal my life ". <br /> <br /> A perfect piece of much of British and Commonwealth history.
