Apparently, Ruggero Deodato found out early on that his story would not work if he approached her too seriously, so he decided to keep it. The result is a movie that can be considered either a ridiculous epic with sword and sorcery or as a very entertaining comedy! And I think I go the second way. The short gore moments are well done, the Paul Brothers openly mock the material (they even bark at a scene!) And there's also a charming, spirited, good-natured image of Eva La Rue as a girl with the "boys" coincides. And where else can you see the inside of a dragon lit like a nightclub? (***)
