I do not understand why the other comments focus on McConaughey. He has never been a very interesting movie actor. <br /> <br /> The best part about this film is the writing and the joke. Alfred Molina and Patrick McGaw make up an unusual comic duo, definitely not camp types. Although you can not say that your characters are well-developed, they are no less funny. <br /> <br /> The version I saw was HDNET and had subtitles for the Spanish dialogue, so that was not a problem. The use of Spanish gives it more authenticity. <br /> <br /> A very underrated film judged by the unusually low ratings of IMDb members. I found it funny and interesting and worth at least a 7. Less good movies with a higher score and a lot of cash at the box office are much less interesting.
