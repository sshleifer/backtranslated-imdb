Jason Bourne is sitting in a dusty room with blood on his hands trying to figure out what he just did. A CIA chief in NYC describes the agency's reaction to what has just happened on the screen. An American flag proudly stands on the center of the desk in the foreground of the dash, but as he speaks, she falls out of focus as his plan breaks off into a morally questionable area, as if she did not want to be associated with the course of action the government man considers necessary is necessary in the interests of national security. <br /> <br /> This setting effectively captures the mood of the movie. Ultimatum is not just a portrayal of Borourne's quest to find out how he became Jason Bourne, but also an examination of the human cost of the measures taken to protect us for the sake of stability and security. <br /> <br /> This is probably the best movie you'll see in the cinema this year. <br /> <br /> It's just so intense. Bourne says to Simon Ross (Considine) "This is not a newspaper story, that's real" and you almost believe it in the audience. The camera wobbles, but remains so calm that you can see everything and feel like Bourne as he tries to escape his pursuers, and the performances are so good that these guys seem like they are the characters they are portray rather than just being actors who play well-written roles. The action scenes are so brutally fast and well choreographed that they seem instinctive and are not planned to the smallest movement. The stunt work is just amazing. <br /> <br /> The pace is amazing. It keeps on going to graduation, but not so fast that it's hard for you to put it together; The script provides the information you need as quickly and clearly as possible before proceeding to the next exciting action set. While they are often simple (the Waterloo sequence is essentially just a man on a phone being watched by a man on a phone), they are charged with such dramatic intensity that you can not take your eyes off them. The movie is so focused on powerforwards that you can not help being swept away by it. <br /> <br /> With intense action sets, a brilliant story, and an intelligent examination of the decisions made in the film premiere, the Bourne series is the name of national security and captures the ambiguity of our time. Ultimatum is its highlight.
