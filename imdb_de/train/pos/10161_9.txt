I took a flyer to rent this movie, but I have to say it was very, very good. On all fronts: screenplay, actor, director, photography, and high production values, etc. Evidence Eva Longoria Parker is in Rome / Com head and shoulders with bad actors like Kate Hudson and Jennifer Aniston, who call her a performer. Who was thinking? <br /> <br /> Parker and Isla Fisher are in a class of their own in this respect and should try to get on projects as good as "Over Her Dead Body". Lake Bell is also excellent, and I have seen it for the first time. And finally, Paul Rudd can shine in a really good movie, rather than in smaller films. <br /> <br /> A film like this never gets its price from close-knit men. This is a pity. As other IMDb reviewers have stated here, there is nothing wrong with this gem - not a hack writing or drama. <br /> <br /> And by depicting the contemporary architecture of LA and California in general, every scene is bright, beautiful, clean, and outstanding in every way. Never before has a movie made L.A. so good. Ah, what a bit of talent and a lot of care for a movie can afford. <br /> <br /> I will not divulge the action, but as a longtime and persistent atheist, I was ready to set the attitude of disbelief and purchase into the supernatural subject to enjoy an excellent and carefree conversation. It reminds me a lot of the old "Topper" movies, which were also very enjoyable. <br /> <br /> This movie features popular but otherwise hackneyed movies like "Ghost" for the mediocre and overly sentimental manure festivals. We already know that the popular taste tends to be mediocre. However, some of us save our praise for the truly worthy. <br /> <br /> If you've enjoyed other overlooked gems like "Into the Night" with Michelle Pfeiffer, Jeff Goldblum and Clu Gulager, "Blind Date" with Bruce Willis and Kim Basinger, "American Dreamer" with JoBeth Williams, "Chances Are" with Robert Downey Jr., Christopher McDonald and Cybil Sheppard, "Making Mr. Right" with John Malkovich etc., you will enjoy this. <br /> <br /> All around a first-rate job (even though it's pretty hard to believe a heterosexual can be gay for more than five years.) But even this plot does not hurt the movie's overall quality.
