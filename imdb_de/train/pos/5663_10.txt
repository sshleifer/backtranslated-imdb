14 years since this show was made, it's still the best show ever made. The writing was 1st class and the production second to none. This show would never be done today and that's a shame. I hope if you remember to find this show you can watch. <br /> <br /> AG came out the year I left high school when my favorite TV series was the x-Files. This will give you an idea of ​​why I came to this show for the first time. AG was a much better program with better writing, but had only one reason? I know that this is not the only program that has only one season. Another example that comes to my mind would be the Lone Sagittarius (x files are spinning). It does not seem right! <br /> <br /> We also need to remember that there was this show before shows like Twilight dark shows were made "cool". <br /> <br /> Take a look at this program and enjoy it! 10 out of 10 points for me.
