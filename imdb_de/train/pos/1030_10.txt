I nominate this and BABYLON 5 for Best TV Sci-Fi Series. Both come to my mind, because in contrast to the early STAR TREK series, there is a consistent evolution of the actions and characters. If you look at the original STAR TREK and STAR TREK: TNG they were good shows, but there was no overarching theme or action that linked all the episodes together. In many ways, you can usually see the broadcasts in their entirety without having trouble understanding what's going on. This was less the case with DEEP SPACE 9 (with its huge battles that lasted the entire season) and the other TREK shows, as there was a bigger story that united them. This coherence seems to have evolved as a concept with BABYLON 5, and even more so with SG-1. The bottom line is that in many ways this series was like watching a family or a long novel that is slowly taking shape. Sure, there were a few "throwaway" episodes that had nothing to do with the rest, but these were very few and far apart and usually pretty funny as well. <br /> <br /> And when you talk about fun, I loved that SG -1 kept up the mood light from time to time and was not meant to be so terribly serious. That's why I really enjoyed it more than BABYLON 5. Jack O'Neill was a great character with his sarcasm and love for Homer Simpson - it's too bad he was slowing down from the series in later seasons. <br /> <br /> To really appreciate SG-1, you should watch it from the beginning and see how complicated the images are. This consistency gives the show an extraordinary staying power. If you do not like SG-1 after giving it a fair chance then Sci-Fi is probably NOT the genre for you.
