First, the release date is 2009, not 2007 for this documentary. It should be more accurately referred to as "Earth 2009". Secondly, let me respond to the complaints of some reviewers who saw the television series "Planet Earth" in 2006. <br /> <br /> I have not seen this TV series, but here I have learned that this movie is full length version of this 2006 television series. I rate each film according to its own merit and not its source. I appreciate the results myself and the results of "Earth 2009" are indeed outstanding. I reject this trivial complaint of some critics: It is merely an extended version of the 2006 television series "Planet Earth". So what? It does not really matter. <br /> <br /> As a film fan and one who has seen dozens of nature documentaries in my life, I was surprised and very impressed by "Earth, 2009". This is the debut feature of Disney's new DisneyNature division, following in the footsteps of Walt Disney's groundbreaking and Oscar-winning science documentaries from the 1950s and 1960s. <br /> <br /> Cinematography, movie editing, music score, sound and narration are all excellent. There have been several other nature documentaries that have excelled in these categories as well. What truly distinguishes "Earth 2009" is its reach. It literally covers the entire planet and covers all seven continents. <br /> <br /> After my first visit, it was obvious that this documentary requires a lot of effort and time and talent. <br /> <br /> Three production companies had to shoot this amazing documentary. <br /> <br /> "Earth, 2009" convincingly recounts the stories of four species on their large migrations during one year. The seasons started in January and ended in December, from the North Pole to the South Pole. <br /> <br /> Two special new high-tech cameras were used for this film: One camera has a computer-controlled 360-degree rotation lens system, and the other is an HD camera with an amazing 1,000 frames per second. This technique really added drama and beauty to some scenes from "Earth 2009", especially the cheetah hunt and the great white sharks that jump out of the water to catch sea lions and an aerial view over the edge of the highest waterfall in the world. There are many breathtaking shots in this documentary. <br /> <br /> There is drama, grief, humor and great beauty in this documentary about cinematography, music and narration. With a great musical score by the world-famous Berlin Philharmonic, outstanding creative and technical cinematography, and James Earl Jones narrative, I consider Earth 2009 to be the largest documentary ever made in the length of a natural feature film. Five years of hard work, patience, talent and dedication have paid off very well here. This movie should be seen in all schools in the world. I predict, among other things, an Oscar for the best documentary. Truly an amazing, amazing, exciting and magnificent documentary. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended
