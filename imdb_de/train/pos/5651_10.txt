It was a bit bizarre and evil and I enjoyed it very much. The characters in the show were also great and compliments. I was sorry to see that it was cut off .. I would have liked to see where it could have gone. Lucas was scary and seductive. And I would like to have seen more of him and how his character has become. However, I will only buy the show to enjoy it, it was great to see something different on TV. And Paige Turrco, Caleb's cousin, was a big mystery where and what she meant to Lucas. It is a shame that it is not still there ... or never finished, I would have liked to see what happened.
