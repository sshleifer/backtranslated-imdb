Time for a stroke! <br /> <br /> Waqt Dir - Vipul Amrutlal Shah Cast - Amitabh Bachchan, Akshay Kumar, Priyanka Chopra, Shefali Shah, Rajpal Yadav and Boman Irani. Written by- Aatish Kapadia Rating- *** <br /> <br /> Eureka! We have it! Yes, ladies and gentlemen? In Vipul Shah's "Waqt" we have probably found the first real success of this year. "Waqt" comes with all the ingredients needed for a commercial Bollywood offering and has everything a movie needs to reach the Indian audience. It's the movie that makes a distribution partner happy and thinks about his next visit! In this "story of Indian feelings" we have a happy family (not always?) Of three. Ishwar (Amitabh Bachchan), the postman millionaire (does not ask how !!) There is something about selling toys while delivering letters and all that? Seriously - who the fuck? ) is an in love father of Aditya (Akshay Kumar). Ishwar has to make a serious decision about his son's careless attitude towards the responsibility of life. His love for Aditya, however, leads to the serious matter being abducted. However, in a situation that will challenge his race against time, Ishwar has no choice but to knock Aditya out of the house, hoping the new situation would make him more conscientious in his own life. However, this suspected solution becomes a problem as the distance between the loving Father Son increases and the fences continue to grow. <br /> <br /> You do not have to be a rocket scientist to realize that such a story offers ample opportunities to penetrate comedy and drama alike. So, before the interval you have the initially funny, later annoying comedy track by Boman Irani and Rajpal Yadav; and after the interval are the moments for your scarf between Aby and Akki! Writer Aatish Kapadia (he also wrote the original Gujarati play "Aavjo Vhala Fari Malishu" on which the film is based) does a good job of keeping the narrative fluid. The dialogues sometimes become inconsistent. It does not help that songs on a teenager's face look like acne and affect the process. Sure, a few numbers could have dropped out. On the direction Vipul shows that he has a natural sense of storytelling. "Waqt" as well as his earlier debut "Aankhen" manage to interest you to the last role. On a personal note - the rocking of the emotions was a bit jerky for me. But the audience's reactions showed that it worked to the limit. <br /> <br /> Finally, Waqt is concerned with its achievements, which are a big point in the overall standings! Amitabh Bachchan is reliable as always. His energy is visible and his age! Shefali plays a finely nuanced performance and fits with every step to the superstar. Boman and Rajpal bring the house down with their histrionics. Priyanka has little to do but fulfill the superficial role of a heroine. If everything goes down, "Waqt" is the vehicle of Akshay. I have always said that Akki is as good as the role that suits him. Put him in a "Mujhse Shaadi Karogi" and he is fantastic, but in an "Bewafaa" he is angry bad. Here is Akki probably the best. Whether it's his comic timing or his emotional renderings, he's almost perfect. There is also an action scene for his fans! Ironically, his best venture so far was in "Aankhen" - with the same director and Big B at his side! <br /> <br /> 'Waqt' is by no means a memorable movie. There will not be any in the better films in our industry. But it's one for the masses. At a time when the industry is desperately waiting for a universal hit, 'Waqt' might do the trick! <br /> <br /> - Abhishek Bandekar <br /> <br /> Worth Knowing - This is Akshay Kumar's second sequel after Bewafaa, performing on stage during the climax! <br /> <br /> Rating- *** <br /> <br /> * Bad ** Average *** Good *** * Very good ***** Excellent <br /> <br /> April 22, 2005
