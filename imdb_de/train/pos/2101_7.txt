Forget Neo and Bourne and all the half-baked modern heroes. They look only 12 years old to please the general public of freaks who want to be their heroes. Since it can not be Rambo or McClane or even Indiana Jones, Hollywood allowed a series of fakes that did not have a beard yet met the teenagers' desire to see something that looked like an action movie. <br /> <br /> "Action sets" are just painful to look at and every girl can undoubtedly challenge her masculinity. This explains the reclamation of oldies on our screens in recent years. For the better (Rocky, Rambo) or worse (The Hard 4 - where John McClane rests on himself .... did not have a beard !!) <br /> <br /> I say, it's high time that a new hero showed up is and ends their rule. This "Largo Winch" movie is far from perfect and sometimes too predictable, but at least Tomer Sisley was a very promising performance hero. And the only time he was weakened was when MÃ©lanie Thierry shaved his beard! I rest my case. <br /> <br /> I did not know when I entered the theater room, but this could be the movie I've been waiting for a decade. For the first time in France since Belmondo, a film can be both well-made and rooted in the B genre without blushing its performance. In the meantime, we just had to chew a huge pile of crap or a bit too little for a wider audience ... In other words, "Le Pacte des Loups" or "Doberman" (I like Doberman, mind you) ... I think, " Largo Winch "has what it takes to be both popular and of high quality. <br /> <br /> I left the theater very satisfied and hungry for more.
