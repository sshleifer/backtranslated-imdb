"Death Lends A Hand" is one of the first early episodes of "Columbo" that has shaped the show for the next thirty years. It is the first of four appearances by Robert Culp (three murderers) who play the same role in each show. In this case, Culp Brimmer, the head of a large private detective firm, asks if the wife of a wealthy newspaper magnate, Mr. Kennicut, has an affair. Although she is, Brimmer decides not to tell Kennicut in the hope that he can extort his wife in return for information about her husband's business partners. She reacts badly to this suggestion, an argument that quickly becomes violent when Brimmer slaps her face. As he wears a large ring, the blow hits her and kills her. <br /> <br /> There are some priceless moments in this episode. In one of my favorite scenes, Columbo pretends to go palm-reading, though this is indeed a cunning to discover the shape and size of Brimmers Ring, without having to admit he knows the killer wore a ring. Since Columbo is Columbo, he only reveals what he really knows when it's time to turn the screws a bit. Initially, the Goofilie plays the role of a rather simple-minded man, excited by the "life-line going over the moon-hill," or an equally ridiculous ghost of the brain reading the Palm. <br /> <br /> Another great scene is when Brimmer offers Columbo a job for his company and is supposed to bribe him to stop poking his nose around. Columbo does not reveal that he knows what's going on, he pretends to be honored and excited by this job offer. <br /> <br /> And there's another one in which Columbo says to Kennicut before Brimmer says the killer could hear her conversation. He wants to announce Brimmer that he's on him without directly charging him, and decides to play more cruelly (but understandably under the circumstances) mind games on Brimmer, to panic him and do something stupid. What does he do of course! The mourning Kennicut is not aware of the subtext of this conversation. It's only about to end that Columbo Kennicut explains everything (not shown on the screen). <br /> <br /> I will not tell how Columbo nails the killer bang after all. A really good episode, possibly the best of the first series. If you like it, you will also like "Double Exposure", also with Robert Culp.
