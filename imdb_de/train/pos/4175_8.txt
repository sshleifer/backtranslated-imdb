I've always wondered what happened to that magical feeling the old Slovenian movies seemed to have in them ... Well, I wondered over time if that feeling was just nostalgia. Or has this "feeling" decided to pack his bags and say "Goodbye" somewhere in our film history, and never came back? Or has it Because for me it came back when I saw "Ekspres, Ekspres" for the first time. And it was the old me again. <br /> <br /> There are three qualities of this film that make it something unique and enjoyable, what it's like to watch - the smooth flow of history, the warmth of colors and what I appreciated most - the lack of excessive use of verbal communication (something that many other (not only) Slovenian scriptwriters should at least consider). There is no sense in words if you can understand each other in the same way (yes or better). See only Bakovic and Cerar. Uh. <br /> <br /> So, in just so many words, I would recommend "Ekspres, Ekspres" to any of you as an unconditional Slovenian movie, regardless of what you might hear from Slovenian movies (if you've ever heard anything, this means ...). Oh, and this scene where Bakovic dances to Vivaldi's music ... A pleasure. <br /> <br /> Treat yourself. Look at it.
