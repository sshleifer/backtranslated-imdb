Ecstasy full of symbolism and full of wonderful cinematography is so much more than the erotic drama we all expect. It's almost a silent movie, with which dialogue there is German and much simplified German. Perhaps the filmmakers had the intention that the film should reach the widest possible European audience, as anyone who has even a little high school German can easily do without the subtitles. The story is of little importance anyway, since the film is successful on a cinematic level and not on a narrative level. Symbols of fertility and the power of nature overpower the human figures - there are even scenes in which flowers obscure the face of the supposed star Hedy Lamarr - and there are moments that remind the viewer of the works of Dreyer, Vertov and Riefenstahl. If the film has a message to convey, I think it's a political one: the bourgeois is shy and powerless; The worker of the working class is a happy, productive creature. and the woman is the creator destined to remain unfulfilled until she has given birth to a child. This mixture of Soviet socialist realism and National Socialist dogma does not overpower the film - it's a beauty that you can see from beginning to end - but it puts it in a very different artistic era. And, oh yes, Hedy gets her jersey out.
