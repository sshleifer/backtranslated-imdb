From the beginning to the end of the film, we observe the fallibility of the various characters; we learn of their shortcomings and their desires, of the overall complexity that is captured in human life (and yet by the simplicity of humanity). Although the film moves slowly, it can be very thoughtful. It does not force ideas, but lets the ideas emerge, the concepts show themselves. <br /> <br /> The movie ends just as suddenly as it starts, and you really understand the meaning alone, love is often an act of selfishness and the many mistakes we make. It's an insight into everyday life, very well done and nicely done. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for action or intense drama, this is not the movie for you. However, if you enjoy honest, original and meaningful films that are not informal and glamorous, this is a great movie to watch.
