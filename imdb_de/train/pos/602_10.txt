I've never danced flamenco before, but somehow I think this movie was perfect. The colors, how crass the dances were, the Gypsies and the rivals together made a movie that seemed to end too soon. I have seen other Carlos Saura films and agree that this film may be his best production. I believe the best features of his recent films on Iberia have been put together and matched. I appreciate the use of mirrors to make the activities behind the cameras visible. As I watched this movie, I felt like I was sitting in a small restaurant in Madrid, watching the dancers comfortably knocking on a wooden board over a delicious fruit cocktail. For me, this movie fit like a glove. I do not know how to get a copy of this movie in the US in the next few years. I recommend this movie to anyone who is interested in the livelihood of other cultures. It's safe to say that this movie is certainly on my favorites list.
