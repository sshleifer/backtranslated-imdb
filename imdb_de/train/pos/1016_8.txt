I would have given this otherwise terrific series a full 10 votes if Claudia Black had not continued! Her recording as stupid 'Vela' has pushed down the series of my assessment. It was a mistake to bring them in regularly at the same time as Ben Browder to replace RDA. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately we had just experienced the loss of "Jack" and did not really need that series to become new episodes of "Farscape". <br /> <br /> I was a big fan of the movie "Stargate" and when the series was first announced, I had reservations that it could do the movie, but after watching the first episode, I had to I admit that I was addicted. I was always looking forward to new episodes with great anticipation
