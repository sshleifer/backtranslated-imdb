I'm a big John Denver fan. I have a large collection of his music on vinyl. I saw this Christmas special when it was originally on TV and I really liked it. I have the original vinyl album and the CD. I have the original CD and a later release. In the later version, however, some songs are missing. I see that it was released this year with all the original songs. To my surprise, I found the original CD for $ 75.00 for sale. WOW - to believe that a Christmas CD would be worth so much. For me it is not worth selling this treasure. It's my favorite Christmas CD. I have never found it on VHS or DVD. I would like to have both versions. If anyone has one, please let me know. Many Thanks
