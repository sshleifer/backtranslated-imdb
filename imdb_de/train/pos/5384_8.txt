I thought the movie was pretty well done for a movie produced for the TV and contained both action and humor. I found the entertainment value worth watching and would like to watch it or a similar show again. I am disappointed that Sean was not credited here on IMDb. <br /> <br /> I see a possibility for an action series based on this concept, or a sequel in which Sean plays again for even higher "money" stakes. because his life would be at stake again anyway. <br /> <br /> I felt like Sean played the role very well, and reminds me of an actor named Matthew Ashford playing Jack Deveraux on Days of Our Lives - the soap opera.
