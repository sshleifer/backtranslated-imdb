This is a very dark, hard-hitting, even brutal movie about a death-row break that goes awry. It's black-and-white photography so it does not get outdated. Mickey Rooney is excellent as a twisted but strangely sympathetic leader. One of the first films depicting the psychological devastation of the death cell. It is also pretty moving.
