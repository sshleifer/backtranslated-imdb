It is not the job of any film to superficially stimulate you. I will face an ambitious failure for a mass market hit every day. Although this can not really be called a failure, the sum of its parts remains ambiguous. This incomprehensible quality makes me see it again and again. This is a challenging, provocative movie that does not finish things properly. The problem with the film lies in its structure. His impenetrable conspiracy seems to end just as a second end is being tackled. Although technically everything is dazzling, the film is just too long due to this unit. The long-delayed peak of Leo's awakening comes about 20 minutes late. <br /> <br /> Great cinematography often comes at the expense of a decent script, but here innovative camera technology offers a wealth of visual ideas. The artistry is provocative and captivating; A character is projected backwards, but his own hand is not in the foreground. The depicted world is deliberate, treacherous and absurd. Keep your eyes open for a memorable, technically amazing assassination that will drop your chin. <br /> <br /> The compositions are breathtaking. Anyone who has decided to publish the (out-of-print) videotape in Pan & Scan format, must never have seen it. Where is the DVD? <br /> <br /> It is unfathomable how anyone can rate so much originality badly. You should see it at least once. One has the feeling that more of Trier was bitten off than he could chew, but this film becomes richer. I suspect that he is familiar with Hitchcock's Foreign Correspondent, in which insidious Europeans manipulate an American fool and several Welles films that, like him, are passionate about technology and technology. All of Trier's films explore the plight of the Naif in the midst of unforgiving societies. After Zentropa Trier moved away from this kind of courageous technical experiment to drab, overvalued, non-nuanced juice like Breaking the Waves and Dancer in the Dark.
