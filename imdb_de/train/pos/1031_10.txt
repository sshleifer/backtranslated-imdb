This series takes place one year after the mission to Abydos in the movie Stargate. It explains much of what the movie did not mention. How was the Stargate activated without a human computer? Where did the Goa'uld (Ra's race) come from? How many are there? <br /> <br /> In the first episode, a retired Jack O'Neill (spelled 2 Ls) by General George Hammond was recalled into active service following an attack by the closed Stargate of Apophis, a powerful Goa'uld Killed four men and kidnapped a woman. We meet Samantha Carter, a brilliant scientist who claims to have gone through the Stargate for the first time and is now determined to do so. We learn that Daniel married on Abydos and that there are hundreds of gate addresses to choose from. Then Daniel's wife is captured by Apophis and becomes his new queen. <br /> <br /> It continues in the second episode, in which General Hammond announces the formation of the SGC with nine teams in which Jack's team will be SG-1, which consists of Jack, Samantha and Daniel. They go to Chulak, a homeworld of the Goa'uld, to rescue Daniel's wife and another, captured in Abydos, called Ska'ra. They are captured and when Apophis orders them to kill them and many other prisoners, a Jaffa named Teal'c, the first prime minister of Apophis, rescues them and goes to Earth with them, becoming part of SG-1 , <br /> <br /> That was just the beginning of the adventure. Throughout the show, they have gone into the past and into the future, transposed into other realities, changed bodies, grew old, met alien races, including a rebel alliance of Goa'uld known as Tok'ra Samantha's dad becomes a member, the Asgard, a cute little race where we see Thor most often (he's Jack's mate), and countless times avoiding a global catastrophe through her teeth. <br /> <br /> The show was canceled recently. but lasted ten seasons. In the ninth season, a new enemy named Ori came to light with all-new forces, new dangers, and new secrets surrounding the Stargate and its creators, the ancient ones. In the ninth and tenth season, two new characters were introduced: Ben Browder as Cameron Mitchell, the new leader of SG-1 and Claudia Black as Vala MalDoran, a woman from another world, which gives the team a new sense of fun. <br /> <br /> Very well produced, interesting characters, fantastic special effects and a subtle love interest between Samantha and Jack, this one has it all. Another way to travel the galaxy and different types of adventures. This is a show you do not want to miss. Open the gate and go through. You will not regret it!
