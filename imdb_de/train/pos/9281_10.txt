I do not know how and where the Iranian directors get their inspiration for such a conspiracy. In fact, it is a very simple act that many directors could put on, but it may not be able to project on a film as Jafar Panahi did at one and the same time - the football game and the sex struggle, the happens behind the walls of the stadium. <br /> <br /> You feel like in the movie and you. 'Are you one of the characters and watch the movie as if you also want to take a look at the football game? You will feel exactly the same excitement and feelings as these female actors in the movie. It is so exciting that you wanted to see the end, you will want to find the verdict, you will die to see what will happen to the girls. <br /> <br /> I like the intermittent conversations between both the smoking girl and one of the military trainees. It's like Venus VS Mars, it really shows the difference in thinking of men and women and the struggle of women to have equal rights and opportunities, especially in a very patriarchal society like Iran. <br /> <br /> This is the second Jafar Panahi movie I've seen (the first is Crimson Gold) and I'm looking forward to seeing more. <br /> <br /> I am already bound with Iranian films and this one is a must!
