Fascinating but disturbing look at Edith Bouvier Beale (Big Edie) and her aunt (Little Edie), aunt and first cousin of the late Jacquelyn Kennedy Onasis. They live in a rodent-infested run-down mansion that the city classified as harmful to health. It quickly becomes clear that these two are eccentrically over. Little Edie seems to go best because she plays with the mindset of a ten-year-old, although she is actually 53 years old. The content consists of two things. The first was the conversation in which Little Edie Big Edie Lambastes had driven away all her potential applicants and ruined her writing, acting, and dancer career. These discussions are usually very rhetorical, nonsensical and often amusing. The second part consists of long vocal attempts of both parties. Of course everyone thinks that his singing is perfect and only the other one sounds bad. In an amazing scene, Big Edie physically attacks Little Edie with her cane just to make her stop her trampling. Very intriguing and yet you get the feeling that there is serious exploitation going on here and the issues just went too far to know. The filmmakers seem to treat this as a freak show in the circus that comes every day to take on (and laugh) bizarre behavior. After all, this is a sad picture as it shows how the world is past these two. Their hopes and dreams fell as much as the mansion in which they live. Despite their quarrels, the two need more than ever. For without the Other there would be no refuge from loneliness. The most amazing line comes from Big Edie, whose many cats relieve themselves in their bedroom. Your answer to a complaint about the smell is just unbelievable.
