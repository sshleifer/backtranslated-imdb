Whenever people call me after the scariest movie I've ever seen, I always answer "Black Noon" and to this day nobody has heard of it at the tender age of 13 when my parents left for the evening. As far as I know, it has only been shown once in the UK and unfortunately is not available on DVD or VHS. <br /> <br /> If someone can track a copy, please let me know. <br /> <br /> If I look at it now, that would probably be a big disappointment, but it has always been remembered as a particularly disturbing little movie!
