I've just seen The Saint Strikes Back for the first time and found it pretty good. This was George Sanders' first appearance as Saint, where he replaced Louis Hayward. In this, the Saint is sent to San Francisco to investigate a shoot in a nightclub. With the help of his friend Inspector Fernack, who came from New York, they help a daughter of a criminal boss. The Sanders in the cast include Wendy Barrie and Jonathan Hale br /> Not a bad Saint movie. Worth seeing. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3 out of 5 stars.
