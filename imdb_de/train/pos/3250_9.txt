Another for the Babes & Bullets audience. The story is a lot more edgy than any other musical I've ever seen: cannons obscure the missing legs of women and place themselves generatively in the other in a way that comes closer to a smart commentary than we would expect for the locale , More effective than contemporary drama. It's hard to identify with a woman holding a cannon in her pants - on loan. Quite remarkable if you consider the context. <br /> <br /> Although the cannon thing at the top of the leg accounts for 90% of the surprises, this movie also documents how greed replaces all other considerations in the life of a group of yakuzas who are following a woman who her leg held upright is a hidden cannon / rocket launcher (hence no cluster shower scenes or belts) The hidden projectile launcher being pulled out of nowhere behind the protagonists, seemingly out of nowhere, in Miike's Dead or Alive (1999)), The Torch That The heroine at the end of the original Tomie (2000) or the shattering flame thrower scene in Sunny Gets Blue (1992) has come out of nowhere, testifying to an almost third-party space from Cantinfla's influence on contemporary Japanese cinema, whose explanation I can not explain, but I can not complain. <br /> <br /> You will not see high-quality films of this Hollywood-made essence, anything but extinct, and the cheap crap they pump out for a cheap thrill is anything but ridiculous. This is a real movie, and although it is great, the end is a brilliant, if not blunt, distortion of certain images of Sergio Leon involving cannons that should be on your legs and are quite appropriate!
