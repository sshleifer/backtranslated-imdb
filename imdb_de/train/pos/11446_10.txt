At that moment, I see this movie for the second time (on TV) and the second time I fall in, when it's been running for an hour (I think I've seen 2 minutes more this time) The way Goldsworthy looks at nature, Change nature in ways you would never even think of. This whole movie gives you a warm feeling when you see him playing with so much love for the world around him. Or you only see his hands covered with dirt and covered with broken fingernails.
