What about all the negative comments? After watching this movie for the first time today, all I can say is that this is a good holiday comedy that will surely lighten the day of every lonely person. When I saw that Drew (Ben Affleck) was spending the holidays alone, I wanted to cry. You need to see the movie if you want to know why. Although I liked Tom (James Gandolfini) and Alicia (Christina Applegate) after some time, they were, if you asked me, real snobs. However, this movie made me smile and felt good. Before I summarize, I would say that Mike Mitchell has achieved a pure holiday hit. Finally, I commend this good holiday comedy, which certainly beautifies the lonely person every day, any Ben Affleck or Christina Applegate fan who has not seen him.
