This is truly one of Hollywood's "Golden Age" as it no longer exists. It's a unique, funny movie that lets you guess what's going to happen next. <br /> <br /> All the actors are perfectly staffed and they are great supporting actors. This is the first movie I've seen with Ronald Colman and since then I'm a fan of him. Reginald Gardiner has always been a popular supporting actor of mine and gives every film in which he is in a certain quality. Although he played a different character here, he added something to the film that another actor in this character would not have added.
