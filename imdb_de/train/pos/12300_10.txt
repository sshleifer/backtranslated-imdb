This version of Anna Christie is in German. Greta Garbo plays Anna Christie again, but all other characters have other actors than the English version. Both were shot in succession because Garbo had such a following in Germany. Garbo himself has her Anna Christie in this version supposedly the English version preferred. It's a good story and a must for Garbo fans.
