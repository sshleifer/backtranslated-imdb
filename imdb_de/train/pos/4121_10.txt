This is rather ignored by many critics and Kurosawa fans, but I thought it was wonderful. It's an episodic multi-character study of the poorest people in Tokyo living in a city literally made out of garbage. Although it looks as if an A-bomb is just a hit, the film has a kind of serene beauty thanks to the magnificent use of Technicolor. The title comes from the sound of the insane young man driving an imaginary car through the slum. All the characters were wonderful and all the stories were captivating, but the most tragic aspect may be the man and his little son living in a deserted car. When they are not looking for food, they spend their free time building their dream home. An emotionally moving and beautiful movie.
