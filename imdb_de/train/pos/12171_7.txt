I was literally preparing to hate this movie, so trust me when I say this movie is worth seeing. All in all, the story and the gags are invented, but the film has the charm and the finesse to dissuade it. The gag, where Jason Lee thinks he has crabs, and does not try to see his boss / future father-in-law and his colleagues scratching him, is not very smart, but he's got me into an insane laugh. Very few of the gags of the film are of great forehead, but they made me laugh. As I said, the movie has charm and charm can go a long way. <br /> <br /> Also the characters are sympathetic. I must say, I wish I could see more of James Brolin's character because he was screaming in the few scenes he was in right now. In addition, I admire any romantic comedy that has the courage, not the character of the woman (who serves as an obstacle in the plot) a total witch. The Selma Blair character is hardly unlikely, and there never was a scene where I thought, "Why did he even want to marry her?" The end is Hollywood, but it could have been much smoother. <br /> <br /> The cast is talented. I did not judge most of Jason Lee's mainstream work positively. I loved him so much in Kevin Smith's films that I'm not disappointed when I saw him in those stupid roles. And he never looks comfortable in those stupid roles. He does not look too comfortable in this movie either, but he contributes two cents and effectively takes care of every scene. But I still miss his work in independent films. Julia Stiles proves once again why she is so damn sympathetic. Of course, she is a very beautiful girl with a radiant smile that makes me faint, but she also has a unique charm and seems to have a good personality. In other words, her beauty shows inside and out. I do not know the name of the actresses, but the woman who plays the drunken grandma is funny. Julie Hagerty also has a small part and it's always nice to see her, which makes me want to get better roles. I loved her so much in "Airplane" and "Lost in America" ​​that it's a shame she does not have the same opportunities to display her abilities. <br /> <br /> Do not let the terrible followers and even worse cash records put you off. This is a funny, charming movie. Romantic comedies are becoming so predictable today that it feels like the genre is ready to flush down the toilet, so there's always a good one among all those bad apples. <br /> <br /> My score: 7 (out of 10)
