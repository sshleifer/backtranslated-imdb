The events of September 11, 2001 have cast their shadow on this Oscar ceremony with a one-minute silence before the memoriam assembly. The all-singing, all the dance-comedy extravaganza we'd expect stood a little in the way of the Award Show, but that was not a bad thing by any means. The conversation was more or less limited to a LOTR meeting with Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson, and that was it. The rest of the show was recorded with clips from the nominations, and I have to admit that this was actually more fun than the crowded song and dance numbers we've seen over the years. Whoopi Goldberg, unlike the others, was not a bad moderator esoteric David Letterman from a few years ago, and the one-minute silence for the 9/11 victims was haunting and dignified. <br /> <br /> New Zealand was completely robbed at the awards. FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING received four minor awards, while A BEAUTIFUL MIND had wrongly earned the top prizes except the best actor who should have gone to a tough New Zealander. The only Oscar awards I accepted, with the exception of those awarded to FELLOWSHIP, were the awards for Best Supporting Actress and Best Supporting Actor, both right-hand calls.
