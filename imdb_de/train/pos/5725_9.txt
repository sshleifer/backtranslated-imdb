I wrote this to some friends earlier: <br /> <br /> HOLY CRAP, The Grudge is, honest to God, one of the scariest movies I've ever seen! I either get very soft at my age or Sam Raimi and Ghost Pictures did a KICK A ** job! (I can not wait for Boogeyman!) <br /> <br /> I was very scared to sit in the dark theater wishing I had someone, anyone, sitting next to me (except the protagonist in Grudge.) I saw the film to myself.) I swear, there were many jump scenes that were NOT expected! I felt stupid, but my nerves did not care! I loved the whole movie from the beginning and the music was fantastically scary. I keep thinking about this noise, and I do not like it! <br /> <br /> I actually got a couple of loud shouts and shouted "Oh" on a scene !! Oh yes, I even covered my eyes a couple of times! A word to the wise: I thought some scenes would be a bit psychotic. My DH hated Event Horizon and thought whoever wrote it was sick and mentally, but I can not remember the movie, so I can not compare it. <br /> <br /> I can not say that I "enjoyed" this movie. B / c I was scared but it was very good and scary. The final scene too ... whoa! For a 32-year-old mother, I think I might have nightmares from this movie, especially because of this noise. Please get out of my head;) <br /> <br /> In summary, this is not a Slasher strip I grew up with (Jason, Freddy). This is a mostly spooky movie. Perfect for Halloween. <br /> <br /> Two great trailers for this movie were Boogeyman and The Ring 2 !!
