All I can say is, if you do not fall in love with Big and Little Edie after the movie, then you're not human! Even after seeing it for the first time, I was addicted. It's a fascinating experience that's hard to describe as I'm sure other fans will confirm it. After seeing it, you will believe that these two beautiful ladies are no longer with us. At least we have Gray Gardens to remember them! I think we all long to own the wild independence of these two ladies. Although I've always admired Jackie Onassis Kennedy, she does not stay in your heart like Big and Little Edie. What a rare pleasure to meet such people; I only wish I had!
