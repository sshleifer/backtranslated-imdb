Let's be honest; Nancy Drew was never great literature. It is in the same category as Babysitter Club, Magic Tree House, Goosebumps, ABC Mysteries. In fact, it was one of the original recipe stories. Nancy is perfect, pretty, thoughtful, "nice", has no inner conflicts! and never changes. Ned is pretty much the same. The film was true to this style and I have to say that I liked it. It will never be a great movie, but it had the same nostalgic taste as the books. It had just the right tension for my kids (8 and 10). There was almost no offensive language. I liked the urge for more conservative clothes. <br /> <br /> Corky was a bit annoying. He was a bit inappropriate on a high school campus. I never quite understood why he was there at all.
