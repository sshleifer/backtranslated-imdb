After reading the original piece, I thought it would have been much harder to adapt to the screen than it turned out. Donal McCann performs a once-in-a-lifetime performance as Public Gar, the oppressed antagonist openly screened by his extroverted (but invisible to others) Alterego-Private Gar. Eamonn Kelly also plays an excellent "screwballs" whose inability to communicate his emotions is only achieved by Gar. <br /> <br /> Definitely worth a rental if you can find them. (Probably not available outside Ireland and the UK)
