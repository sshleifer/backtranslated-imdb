There are enough sad stories about women and their oppression through religious, political and social means. Not to belittle the movies and stories about genital mutilation and reproductive rights as well as wage inequality and social marginalization, all in the name of Allah or God or some other ridiculous justification, but sometimes it is helpful to choose a different approach to throw light into the subject. <br /> <br /> The venue is the 2006 game between Iran and Bahrain to qualify for the World Cup. The passions are high and several women try to disguise themselves as men to get into the game. <br /> <br /> The women who were caught (played by Sima Mobarak-Shahi, Shayesteh Irani, Ayda Sadeqi, Golnaz Farmani and Mahnaz Zabihi) and detained for criminal arrest offered a fun and insightful look into the customs of this one Country and most likely all Muslim countries. Their interaction with the Iranian soldiers who guarded and transported them, both the townspeople and the villagers, and the father who was looking for his daughter, provided some funny moments as we reflected on why they had such unwritten rules. <br /> <br /> It's all about a paternalistic society that believes it has to save women from the harsh behavior of their husbands. Instead of enlightening the male population, they deny the women the privileges and rights. <br /> <br /> Given the changes in the responsible soldiers and the reflection of Iranian society, it is no surprise that this movie will not matter I ran. But Jafar Panahi has a winner for those who can see it.
