CAROL'S JOURNEY is a pleasure for many reasons. The acting of Clara Lago is just amazing for someone who is so young and she is one of those special actors who can say a lot with facial expressions. Director Imanol Urbibe presents a tight and controlled film with no disruption of continuity, which drives the action at a steady pace with enough excitement to ask what the Nest scene will bring. The script by Angel Garcia Roldan is a story that is at its best, which, though, is the main purpose of films. The plot is unpredictable, but the events are completely logical. Perhaps the best feature of this film, when you tell a story of the Spanish Civil War when it concerned the people. It was a significant event of the 20th century, but hardly Americans know about it. In fact, in 40 years of university education, I have averaged one student per semester who even heard of it, let alone anyone who could say anything to compliment it - and the overwhelming number of students were deserving scholars, all of whom spoke of the enormous censorship in American education. In a way, this movie is a great way to start exploring this event, keeping in mind that when a thread is pulled, much of the story is decrypted. The appreciation of this film is therefore directly related to the amount of knowledge. To watch this movie as another upcoming movie, the movie is completely missed. The Left Elbow Index takes into account seven aspects of the film - drama, production sets, character development, plot, dialogue, film continuity, and craftsmanship - on a scale of 10 for very good, 5 for average, and 1 for help. CAROL'S JOURNEY is above average in all respects, with the exception of the average screened dialogues. The LEI average for this movie is 9.3, increased to 10 if it complies with the IMDb scale. I recommend this movie for all ages.
