I teach Japanese for an online high school and add cultural activities so students can learn both the country and the language. And to see "Gung Ho" is one of the requirements. Students can buy or rent the movie. Stereotyping or not, this helps students recognize that other people see the world and their lives differently than we do. Many of my students have told me that they enjoyed the movie so much that they will get a copy for themselves. It's really interesting to see what we value about this culture and what they appreciate about their culture. I just wish I could get a tidy TV version. I'm not really in the raw language the auto workers use all the time.
