This was the eighth and final Columbia Whistler movie and the only one without Richard Dix who retired from the movies and was dying the following year. It's still a competent thriller, the machine went on perfectly without it, but ?? something was missing: Dix! The stories in the Whistler series were always interesting, sometimes brilliant, the scripts were often very atmospheric, but not only the Whistler itself hung everything on the canvas, but also Dix. <br /> <br /> Young A pair who has been away for fourteen days gets the urge to marry in the pouring rain, but is thwarted when the potential bride first disappears and then finds herself already married, before she obviously goes crazy. Is the prospective bridegroom a deterrent, even if the private tail with which he found her suddenly beats him and the lambs or the love is blind? Who twists, who is the question. Michael Duane in his penultimate movie is fine when a bit of eyelash, Lenore Aubert's most beautiful moments came to Abbott & Costello Meet Frankenstein's next best movie, and Richard Lane was as always wonderful, on loan from Boston Blackie. Also the only excursion where the Whistler must have gotten wet even in the rain, unless he was sprayed in voice with meerschaum. <br /> <br /> In this last hour, a lot has happened, and it's worth looking over it again and again as usual for fans of the genre like me. The Whistler radio series, which began in 1942, lasted until 1955 and produced almost 700 half-hour shows, almost all of which are available in MP3 format. They're based on what I've heard so far, and almost all of them are worth listening to.
