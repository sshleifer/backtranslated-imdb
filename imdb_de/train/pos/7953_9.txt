Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey (1993) is a family adventure staged by Duwayne Dunham. It is a remake of a film from 1963. This film received a sequel three years later. Michael J. Fox is the perfect man to take the vote for chance. Fox has some youthful energy that he lets into the role. Sally Field is a great voice work as Sassy.Don Ameche is awesome as a Shadow. This was the penultimate movie of this veteran actor. Even the visible performers are great Robert Hays is Bob Seaver. Benji Thall plays Peter Burnford. Veronica Lauren is Burnford's hope. Kevin Chevalia is Jamie Seaver. Jean Smart portrays Kate. It's pretty amazing how these animals want to survive in the wild river and it seems like an ag The bear scene is exciting and funny. Chance has no chance with this big, hungry bear. And his meeting with the porcupine looks painful. This is great fun for the whole family.
