This is 2009, and in this way, the underrated gem has lost none of the power it had 31 years ago. It combines a great variety of different characters and stories without being confusing. <br /> <br /> Clothing and music may have changed over time, but in the end this is a story that never loses its skill -dateness. And especially this movie does the job pretty well. Of course it is sometimes cheesy, but also very touching. <br /> <br /> The performance of Jodie Foster is remarkable, showing that she is a born actress who has shown her true potential, especially in her previous films. <br /> <br /> Do not miss these.
