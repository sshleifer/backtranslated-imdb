It's a good show and I think it's funny. Finally, the bad Latin stereo types are over! ¡Gracias, Señor Lopez! I love this show and I started it about three months ago. The whole concept of a Latin American TV show really impressed me. I am surprised that Latinos finally have a good chance to be on TV. This show is probably one of the best I've ever seen. She is funny, heartwarming, vulnerable and nice.
