Jiří Trnka made his last animated short to a charge against totalitarianism, which caused him problems in his native Czechoslovakia. There are few elements, the imagery is simple and its hallmarks are almost non-existent, so the viewer can focus on the fable. A man in his room is dedicated to the pottery and takes care of his only plant. But suddenly a huge hand enters the room and orders him to make a statue. The man refuses and is pursued by the ominous gloved hand. In these days, when the reality factor seems to be erased from most animations trying to replace the real world, it is refreshing to watch a movie, making its technique a pleasure.
