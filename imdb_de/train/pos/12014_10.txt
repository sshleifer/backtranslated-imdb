This is by far the most incredible movie I have seen in a long time. The actors gave wonderful depictions of the characters in the film. The story was exactly illustrated. The story begins with a young woman from the British Isles and her father traveling by steamboat to Nauvoo, Illinois. She has become a member of the LDS Church and he does not have it. He finds her ridiculous for the journey and discouraged. She encourages him to read about Joseph Smith, the Prophet. Here begins the story of the Prophet Joseph Smith. The film shows exactly his life and at the same time the history of the LDS Church. It was at times graphical, but was needed. The emotional expression was very believable, which caused my emotions to spread. The shoot was great. The way the story was presented was touching. After the movie was over, we just did not sit there anymore. I was shocked. For people who know very little about Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet, I want to encourage you to see this. If nothing else than to gain some understanding of his life. For those who are members of the Church, I would encourage you to see it. It will increase your testimony of this most incredible man. This is a must.
