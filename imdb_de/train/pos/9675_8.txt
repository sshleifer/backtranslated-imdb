Most people might say that if you spent a movie on a Saturday night, you really have to be bored. Actually, I had just returned from home and turned on the TV and there was "Paulie". <br /> <br /> I had missed the opening credits, so I did not know the name, but I saw that Cheech Marin was in it, and of course I thought I had "Born In East L.A." When I saw him talking to a talking parrot, I was ready to dismiss it as the kind of flop movie they show late at night. Fortunately, it was better than that. As you know, Paulie is lost and tries to return to her original owner. It seems like years before I find them. What Paulie's advantage should be, in a way, is a disadvantage. People come across a formed parrot, and everything they see is a way to earn money or help themselves. <br /> <br /> While Cheech Marin's character "earns money with him", he is not mean for him. The dance sequences with the parrots are something that children will love to find. I found her amusing. Paulie, who is naive, quickly learns that not all people are nice people. Especially the owner of an animal research laboratory. The man lies to him and says that he will help him find his owner as long as he helps in his animal communication research. Paulie is now stuck, but decides to fool the man in a demonstration of other people about Paulie's vocal ability. Throughout the film, Paulie tells his story to the caretaker, who eventually freed him, several other animals and the search for Paulie's owner. It is a touching reunion. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10 would have accepted the wing cutting scene and should not be shown. This part could disturb younger children. Otherwise, it's a great movie for older kids and adults who are a kid at heart. (THE END)
