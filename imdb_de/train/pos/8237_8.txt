Why did this movie get an R rating for my life ?! Whether it's carnivorous zombies, believe it or not, it's actually a pretty good family-friendly movie - at least when your kids are 10 or older. Unlike the traditional zombie movies, this one has an excellent sense of humor as well as traditional values ​​- albeit a bit twisted! The language is not a serious problem, there is no nudity and the film style is definitely aimed at children (similar to the old TV series "Eerie, Indiana") - and yet some racquet has given an R rating. Believe me, most children have seen worse acts of violence than these and it just seems stupid to think the audience, this is an adult-only movie. <br /> <br /> The story takes place in a parallel world. While fashion, cars and customs appeared around 1953, there was a fierce zombie epidemic in this bizarre world that led to a "zombie war" and massive changes in everyday life. At school, children are trained in armed combat, and late in the movie, there is a cute scene where the father gives his son a handgun and asks him to keep it in his backpack, "just in case"! As for life outside of school, it's also pretty weird as people have learned now that zombies are NOT that bad! Heck, with shock collars and training, they can be made slaves to do their housework, clean the streets, deliver milk or, in the case of a really sick man, be your "special friend". <br /> <br /> This film is about a particular family who eventually buys their first zombie slaves (played by Billy Connally). Mom is excited and her son is slowly becoming the zombie's girlfriend. Dad, on the other hand, is not convinced - he was forced to kill his own zombie father years ago, and he's not done with it yet !! Funny, irreverent and unique - this movie has to be seen by a much larger audience.
