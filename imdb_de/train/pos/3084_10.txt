Oh man, why? "Six Degrees" is a show about this so-called theory that we are all connected by someone. When I focus on the life of a group of people and the consequences of their actions. <br /> <br /> When I heard about this show for the first time, it did not strike me at all. It actually seemed too common. Then I saw some episodes ... and was thrilled! Especially the characters. They are all well written and different from each other. There's an alcohol addict, a wife whose fianc√©e cheats on her, a wife who has lost her husband, a driver who has a restless brother, and so on ... Contrary to what we're used to, most characters interact in sacrifice, as in our everyday life. Great! My favorites are Mae, Carlos and Whitney. Then the cast. They are all great. Jay Hernandez from "Hostel" here shows his acting skills in more 3D character than his previous work as Paxton. The others also do great, especially Campbell Scott, who plays Steven, and Bridget Moynahan, who plays Whitney. <br /> <br /> If I came to IMDb after seeing some episodes I could not believe it was canceled Seriously, I can not understand the low ratings. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that there was not more than one season. It would be really a good show to follow!
