I have just returned from an exhibition of "My Left Foot" in our public library. What an emotional experience - I feel drained and uplifted. <br /> <br /> It is the story of Christy Brown, Irish writer and painter, based on the autobiographical text "My Left Foot" by the author. Christy was born with a form of cerebral palsy with only his left foot. The doctors advised his parents that he was hopelessly mentally retarded, but his mother did not give up and, as Annie Sullivan had done with Helen Keller, he helped him make a breakthrough by learning the alphabet and then reading, could write and read paint. <br /> <br /> This film was awarded Oscar for Daniel Day-Lewis (Best Actor) and Best Supporting Actress for His Mother's Actress. It also received Oscar nominations for Best Picture, Best Director and Best Adapted Screenplay. <br /> <br /> As a retired clinical psychologist and family therapist, while many films can entertain me, many often brutally let me forget fictions or improbabilities in realistic psychological responses. <br /> <br /> Not in this film - it was absolutely on time to portray typical Irish parenting roles and behaviors (see, for example, typical Irish families in McGoldrick's "Ethnicity & Family Therapy") as well as Christy Brown's uneven emotional maturation - some immature ones Personality reactions that became even stronger when he picked up features of his father. <br /> <br /> The film presents the greater truth, while he changes certain sequences of his development (painting and writing) and the merging of several important people to a person to tell a coherent, credible story, not by small , distracting, less important facts is charged. (See Christy Brown at Wikipedia for more accuracy.) The DVD version shown to us had some English subtitles that were very helpful in understanding Christy's speech (and some of the Irish language). the first release of the film may have been missing. (If you watch this on DVD, enable this option.) <br /> <br /> The performance of Daniel Day-Lewis is one of the best, most credible acting jobs I've ever seen. Really great, outstanding and superlative. <br /> <br /> "My left foot" has more than a little resemblance to a recent movie, "The Diving Bell & the Butterfly," in which everyone represents the life of a real person overcoming the imprisonment and isolation of an extremely serious physical person Handicaps successfully overcome. <br /> <br /> And it all starts with William Ernest Henley's "Invictus," which begins, "From the night that covers me, // Black." as pit from pole to pole, // thank all possible gods // for my invincible soul.
