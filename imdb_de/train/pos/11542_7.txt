When I saw this for the first time, I did not laugh too much. At the time, I was only fifteen, and I thought maybe a little deeper sense of humor was too mature for me to understand then. I had the same reaction when I saw it a second time a few months ago. This time, because Felix had stopped the attempted suicide at the beginning of the film, the movie darkened somehow. This scene made some of the things that Oscar said and Felix later did in the movie unnecessarily cruel, and their arguments were not as amusing as they could have been. If I did not already know the story, I would have feared that some of Oskar's antics against Felix could push him over the edge. I did not laugh or smile like the television program with Jack Klugman and Tony Randall. All in all, a pretty good movie that produced one of the best sitcoms on TV. 7 out of 10.
