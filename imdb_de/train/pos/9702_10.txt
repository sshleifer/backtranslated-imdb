The town of Royston Vasey is a strange but wonderful place. The characters would be just wrong and too annoying, but the fantastic brilliant writing means it works and it works very well. Most people will know others with a touch of character, but hopefully no one knows people with extreme personalities like Tubbs and Edward, the xenophobic owner of the local shop or the pen-obsessed Pauline, the "fool" with much contempt. These were only a few of the foreign inhabitants. The TV works consist of 3 series and a Christmas special. There are indications of many horror films, such as the willow knight. A recent addition to the work spectrum is a film, the League of the Gentlemens Apocalypse, of which I can not say much, but only recommend. All in all, the League of Men is a funny comedy show with ingenious writing and brilliant bonkers. I would definitely say that it is worth seeing as you will not regret it!
