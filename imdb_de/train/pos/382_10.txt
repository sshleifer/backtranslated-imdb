One of the most beautiful films ever made! Why it only received a rating of 7.6 is a mystery. This movie is a window into the world of black experience in America. Should be mandatory for all whites and all children over 10 years. I recommend watching it with "The Long Walk Home" as a companion piece. If you think Whoopi Goldberg's work is about "Homer and Eddie" or "Hollywood Squares," think again. Do not miss this movie that should have won the Oscar. (And also read the book!)
