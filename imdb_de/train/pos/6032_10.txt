Antonioni really showed some "cojones" when he made this movie. He went to America and worked under a contract from the richest studio (MGM). He made the rottenest portrait of American society I've ever seen. LA at first hand, this is the most accurate representation of the crowded, overheated and impersonal city. If only Antonioni had met Bill Hicks ... <br /> <br /> The ensuing burial by the studio is understandable after such an incredible investment and bleak returns. It is sad that people do not see this movie anymore because I believe that Antonioni is right. Here he predicts the end of the hippie / civil rights movement in American politics. Everyone is more interested in what's in the bag and in the inexorable expansion of habitat into the inhospitable (and yet beautiful) desert and beyond. How I would love to be interested in this movie and a lavish DVD release. <br /> <br /> I ask people to look at Zabriskie Point with an open mind and an open heart. We have a truly unique film that marks a turning point in the history of Earth's most powerful nation, and we've forgotten it. <br /> <br /> An unexpected gem.
