Given the time of publication, the story unleashed by the thriller Panic in the Streets (1950) was hardly surprising. The corpse of a mysterious illegal immigrant is given up as a nobody until further investigation by a public health inspector who claims that the body is hit by a bubonic plague. However, with today's drama in today's world, this strangely adds to the credibility of the film for today's viewers. Cast and crew are impeccable. Richard Widmark in his first role following his breakthrough in "Night and the City," Jack Palance, in his film debut, which also features Paul Douglas and the young (and pretty cute) Barbara Bel Geddes. A whole range of unrated, non-professional actors (typical of director Kazan) fill in the remaining slots. Elia Kazan directs, Joe MacDonald films (he would later work with Richard Widmark in 1953's far superior Pickup on South Street) and the great Alfred Newman scores with it. Almost everyone involved has done a better job, but "Panic in the Streets" is still a worthwhile watch. Especially for the film noir enthusiast.
