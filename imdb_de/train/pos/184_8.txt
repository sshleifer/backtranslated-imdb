There are no such people as "Show People", Marion Davies (as Peggy Pepper) and William Haines (as Billy Boone). My introduction to Ms. Davies was a "clip" from that movie; the delightful spoof, in which she lowers a scarf to reveal different emotions. My introduction to Mr. Haines was when I saw this movie. It is possible, however, that I have seen him in a less memorable role. Haines makes an incredible impression when he meets Davies for a commissary meal - throwing his hat into the ring with wonderful pieces at the dining table. In fact, Haines and Davies deliver great comic book performances. <br /> <br /> The story begins with Dell Henderson (Colonel Pepper) daughter Davies going to Hollywood, which is sure to make her Tinseltown's latest sensation. In fact, Davies and the already arrived Haines become comedy stars. But Davies yearns to become a real drama queen. Davies leaves Haines and collaborates with raging drama Paul Ralli. But viewers prefer Davies in rather strange roles. Maybe the director King Vidor offers a case for art that imitates life? <br /> <br /> Full of great Hollywood footage, both on set and on the go. Full of big "kamos"; During a studio lunch at the Stars table, Davies sits between Douglas Fairbanks and William S. Hart. But the best bit player is Charlie Chaplin, who has enough nerves to ask Davies for an autograph! While the cameos are fun, they help and the episodic sequences make "Show People" less of a major movie and more of an important historical document. <br /> <br /> ******** Show People (11/11/28) King Vidor ~ Marion Davies, William Haines, Dell Henderson
