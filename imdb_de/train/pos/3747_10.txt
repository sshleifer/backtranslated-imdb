I have never seen many online movies in my life, but if I chose one of them, I would choose Spatula Madness, a clever reference for most movies like Star Trooper (etc.), with a camera and Jason Steele mastered the art of transforming a normal picture into a painting and then assembling it with frame-by-frame animation to create a world inhabited by spatulas. The story starts in the middle. How excited are the directors? then the middle is in the beginning, and so on, when I saw it for the first time, I expected a muddy, pixelated look, but Jason, as I see Loves, took every detail to the utmost. While I do not recommend it for children or anyone else but me, please check it out on the net (it's a short film, look at the movie cow), its style reminds me of South Park, but less violent. 10 for the look, 6 for the laughs and 6 for the story, it all comes down to 10/10, good work, Jason Steele, I'm curious about the movie.
