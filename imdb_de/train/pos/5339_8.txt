I just saw "Behind Bedroom Doors" and this was the first softcore movie with a solid story I've seen for some time. <br /> <br /> We start with two neighborly couples - Vivian and James Fenway (Julia Kruis and Eric Carrington) and Lillian and Gabe Harris (Nicole Sheridan and Chris Gustafson). Vivian seems to be a housewife, James is a solicitor for a prosecutor, Lillian works in real estate, and Gabe is a successful plastic surgeon. Do you have it all? Now let us get started. <br /> <br /> Enter Abby, beautifully played by pornstar Chelsea Blue. She rents the house across from the Fenways and lives alone. At the beginning of the film, James looks out the window and sees Abby playing with her friend Gigi (played by porno lady Monique Alexander), and secretly starts wondering what it would be like to be with her. The next day, Abby meets all four and seems to be a nice woman who happens to be living an alternative lifestyle. She makes a pass with Vivian, who seems to be startled and says to her: "Oh ... I'm ... not like that." Everything seems to be in order ... until the plan is set in motion. First, Abby shows up naked in Gabes office and asks Gabe if she should get a jerk job. Here's our quote from the movie: <br /> <br /> "Tell me about Gabe." "What do you want to know?" "Is Gabe happily married?" "I am married." "There's trouble ... let me guess, your wife stays home and does whatever you ask, but she's a good girl." "Yes." "She is not a bad girl?" "No." "Does this door have a lock?" <br /> <br /> You know what happens next ... Abby does it with gift, right there in the exam room. Then she shows a little show for James, who comes to her and wastes no time to have sex with her. What James does not know is that the teddy bear on the piano with the blinking red eye is really a camera that records all the celebrations (it's so obvious anyway). Abby has sex again with Gabe later on, and this time Gigi makes a threesome. Now that Abby has something on both men, she demands $ 100,000 each to buy her silence. Not only could she ruin James's campaign, she could also destroy Gabe's practice. <br /> <br /> As Gabe and James wrestle with their guilt, Abby finds time to seduce Lillian, who "experimented" with women in college. That was a long time ago, but you would not know that she was in action with Abby - she looked like an old professional. <br /> <br /> While Gigi sticks to the plan, she is jealous of the sex her friend has. "It's just a business," says Abby. Confessions and apologies will surely follow, as well as some startling information about Abby's true identity - it seems she has done the same thing in different places in different places. Gabe and James use this information to fight Abby's blackmail. <br /> <br /> Now for sex. The sex scenes were pretty good, and considering that all women except Julia Kruis have a long porn background, I would not have expected less. Nicole Sheridan's four scenes were the best in the film, with the three-way scene just behind. Monique Alexander was only once naked, but she was a relatively insignificant figure. Julia Kruis was a main character and has undressed often naked. I think since she was surrounded by experienced hardcore pros, she did not have to have so many sex scenes. <br /> <br /> Finally, "Behind Bedroom Doors" had a great storyline that supported the overall score of the movie. I think that's tapeworthy. <br /> <br /> Women: A- (Nicole Sheridan was good in this movie - better than her later portrayals in Fred Olen Ray's comedies.) At least she can do some drama Scene Stealer - she was not as bad as that Antagonist, I would give her alone all A. Julia Kruis was her usual self, I wish Monique Alexander had more time for the face in this movie. <br /> <br /> Sex: B (Solid, very solid sex scenes Nicole Sheridan's performances were almost hardcore, and Chelsea Blue looked good in her scenes as well, the two girls-girls offerings did not burn, but they made the screen warm.) <br /> <br /> Story: B + (I liked the dialogue and the main story, the performance of Chelsea Blue was good for the genre, and I was impressed with how Nicole Sheridan's drama was doing.) <br /> <br /> All in all: B ( This was a nice softcore strip, so I'm glad I could watch this as I approached was surprised. If Chelsea Blue ever wanted to do more, she would be welcome anytime.) E. This also applies to Nicole Sheridan - even though she probably does better comedy. I do not mind hardcore girls who can make softcore movies.)
