THE JIST: See something else. <br /> <br /> This movie was rated highly by Gene Siskel, but once I've seen it, I can not understand why. The movie is definitely original and different. It sometimes even has interesting dialogues, some cool moments and a scary "noir" feeling. But it's not exactly entertaining. It also does not make much sense in the plot, but especially in terms of character motivation. I do not know anyone who behaves like these characters. <br /> <br /> This is a difficult movie you can record - I suggest you do not accept the challenge.
