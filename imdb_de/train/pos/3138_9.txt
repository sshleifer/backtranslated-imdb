Yes, when I sat here with the red face, I remembered that I almost felt guilty when I saw it a few weeks ago, while my wife decided to do something trivial (in comparison) as " Mommie Dearest "<br /> How to explain the appeal of" Batman and Robin "- I mean the only ones who really counted, Adam West and Burt Ward. It was a terrible show with terrible acts and terrible drama - and, oh yes, it was terribly funny! The same goes for this movie "Reunion" and "Flashback". Adam and Burt are invited to an auction selling the old Batmobile for charity. But it is stolen, and our friends (as themselves) jump into the personas of their old characters (if not their costumes) and set out to find out what happened. Along the way, they remember the show, and we see how everything came together in flashbacks. Jack Brewer and Jason Marsden played the young Adam and Burt of the TV series. It was really interesting to look behind the scenes of the old series, and Adam and Burt just returned perfectly to the character (even though they were not really in character, well, you'd have to see it to see what I mean. ) It was also great to see Julie Newmar and Frank Gorshin. <br /> <br /> If you are not a fan of the old series, you will not hate it. If you had actually forbidden, in heaven forbidden, that Michael Keaton and George Clooney have made acceptable "Batmans", then you will hate this even more. But if you grew up with Adam and Burt and are still ready to admit that you've never missed an episode - well, this is for you. <br /> <br /> Yes, that's right - 9/10
