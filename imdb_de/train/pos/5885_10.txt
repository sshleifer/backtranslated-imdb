This movie surprised me a lot. I did not have very high expectations, but I was wrong. Mary & Rhoda were very funny and well written. They did not spend much time reworking the past, and they did not depend on the success of the old TV show to wear the movie. All in all it was very entertaining. <br /> <br /> My girlfriend said this could be a weekly sit-com and I think I might agree.
