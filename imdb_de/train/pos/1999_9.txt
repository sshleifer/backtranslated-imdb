Oliver! the musical is a favorite of mine. The music, the characters, the story. Everything seems to be perfect. Director Carol Reed brings the Broadway hit to life on this movie screen. <br /> <br /> The transition from musical to film music is no easy task. You have to have the right voices, the right set, the right script and the right game. All characters are Yes for this game. It almost seems like it was written for the screen! <br /> <br /> Our story takes place in old England, where a boy named Oliver manages to extricate himself from the orphanage. He winds his way through the country to London, where he meets a group of juvenile delinquents, led by Dodger, the wise talker with quick hands. The leader of this gang is called Fagin, an elderly man who sells all the stolen goods. <br /> <br /> But in London, not all is well when Bill Sykes, Oliver Reed and his affectionate friend Nancy get tangled up with Oliver, Fagin and his young troopers and the law. What follows is a wonderful story of love, affection, and great musical numbers. <br /> <br /> Whether you like musicals or not, you will hear these tunes and you will be buzzing all day long. Oliver! is a triumph on and off the stage and a timeless work of art.
