Gandhi the Great: The greatness of the world is associated with people like Alexanader the Great and Ashoka the Great because their greatness lies in their being glorified as more than human beings. Gandhi is called great because he is not really great, but more human, because I always believe that humanity is expressed in us, where the greatness lies in being human lies in the struggle for humanity, but not his enemies. Let me now turn to the film review. <br /> <br /> About Gandhi My Father: <br /> <br /> Gandhi My dad is a movie that does not go about Gandhi but about his son Harilal Gandhi From a son whose father is one of the greatest people was, who lived on earth, the director manages to portray the story. The film manages to tell the story of a misleading son of a father who leads a nation to greatness As a criticism of Gandhi's failure as the father of his son, I would rather say that it is a sacrifice that sacrifices Gandhi as the father of a son had to render justice as the father of a nation. I Wish It The essence of this film is prevalent not only in India, the Gandhian country, but by the hearts of all the people of this world. <br /> <br /> Gandhi, the true man. Jaihind
