"Silverlake Life" is a documentary that was simple and straightforward. Actually, it was more like a home theater, and if you want dramatic illuminations, you'll see something different. And it's by no means a tearjerker. But I mean that positively. It shows two men who love each other and how AIDS affects their everyday lives with the disease. It's almost hard for me to say if it's a quality movie or not because it was so stripped that I had to look for other ways to react. It's an admirable movie, actually one of the most admirable, sincere documents I've ever seen. These two men have incredible integrity because their lives are reduced to the most basic parts. Hollow Wood productions on AIDS are hipless and heartless. These guys made this movie for themselves, which is one of the best reasons to create something. The scene where Tom sings "You are My Sunshine" to Mark and says goodbye to him is the real thing.
