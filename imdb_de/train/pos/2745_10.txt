I've seen a lot of movies, but "In Cold Blood" is in a class by itself. It excels in every department. The fact that it contained only a few big stars helps outsmart the character if you pay more attention to the characters and their story than the name on the marquee. Blake and Wilson show great performances by the killer duo. The fact that most of the films are filmed in the places where the crime took place, even in the house, creates additional horrors. The black and white photography darkens the mood and the photography is great. There are many outstanding cinematic works, but if I could only vote for one, it would most likely be "In Cold Blood."
