I will keep it short. I think that this is an extraordinary movie. I see other reviewers who said that they are badly written, badly shot, have a terrible soundtrack and, worse, that they are not real in their portrayal of life. Okay, it may not be quite believable for its entire length, but this movie carries a message of hope that some others seemed to have missed. I hope it's not too late to save people from the horrible things that are going on in so many lives. Gangland violence is real, right? Is it right, no! This film contains an important social message that the cynics may not like but should be praised rather than vilified. I have watched this movie with great pleasure at least eight times, each time with equal enjoyment and each time with the feeling that perhaps the world could be made better and not go beyond saving (at least not before 2008). 9 out of 10 for me. It is almost perfect in my view. JMV
