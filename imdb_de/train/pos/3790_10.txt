I did this by chance on the independent film channel and was thrilled. I am a professional actor and the performances have amazed me. They felt totally improvising, absolutely without influence. I could not say if it was a script or how it was filmed and waited until the end to see credits, then spent half an hour with the IMDb to find this movie. Do not miss. I see that the director has also made a very good movie titled Everyday People, which I really liked. The shame of the movie business is that projects that are so outstanding do not get the distribution and advertising they deserve and live under the radar. This movie deserves to be flown high and proud. I urge people to look it up and watch.
