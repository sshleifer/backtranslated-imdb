Streetfight (aka Coonskin) is a very unique film directed by animation pioneer Ralph Bakshi. It is a curiosity of the cinema and very worth seeing. It's live action, mixed with animation that seems to have been influenced by Disney's legendary Song of the South as if it were a reaction to the movie. Philip Michael Thomas, who later became Don Johnson's sidekick at Miami Vice, and Scatman Crothers, famous for their role in Kubrick's The Shining, are prison inmates. Charles Gordone and Barry White (yes, Barry White) are Thomas's friends and plan to help him escape from prison. They are being held at a police curfew, and Crothers tells Thomas a story about a black rabbit, a bear and a fox moving south from Harlem to find a more peaceful existence. The story is animated and offers many wonderful things to see. Like all of Bakshi's films, most will be annoying and dislike the animation. Real animation lovers will forgive their awkwardness and fall in love with their ingenuity. The film is very violent, very sexual and it is mainly about battles between the races. For a long time, I thought I was looking at something extremely important, but after a while, especially after I finished watching, it looked more like a regular blacksploitation strip, similar to Superfly's. It is very sloppy and says nothing. Besides, Bakshi is not white? Whatever the answer, Coonskin / Streetfight is still well worth a visit for animation lovers and cult movie fans. 10.7.
