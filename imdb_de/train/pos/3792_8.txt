I saw this movie earlier today and was amazed at how accurate the dialogue is for the main characters. It did not feel like a movie - it felt more like a documentary (the part I liked best). The protagonists of this film seemed to me as real as any fifteen-year-old girl I know. All in all a very enjoyable movie for those who like independent movies.
