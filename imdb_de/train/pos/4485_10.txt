This is my favorite of the older Tom & Jerry cartoons from the early 40s. The original version with Mammy Two Shoes is included in the set of Tom & Jerry Spotlight Collection 2, Disc One, and shows the wonderfully detailed animation of the early cartoons. The jokes on this film are not all crazy Avery styles, but rather subtle and are aimed at all those who have been busy late into the night with creepy movies (or radio programs)! Tom listens to a scary radio show and Jerry decides to play a series of tricks to scare him. The Nine-Life Gag is well done, and I do not know how many times I tried to make a vacuum and a leaf that was scary to me as a kid. When Tom's owner is awakened by the uproar - Mammy was NOT the maid, it was YOUR house - she gets a surprise with a big laugh. Get your break button ready, it's worth it!
