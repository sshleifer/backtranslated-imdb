A brilliant Russian emigrant designs the "Stanislavsky" system to win the contract - what makes him and his beautiful wife, the GRAND SLAM Sweethearts of America, fine-tune and excel in the status of a very pleasurable little comedy. A few unexpected touches are thrown in to keep the viewer's attention - the way the lead actor is introduced as faces of a card game; the introduction of a crazy acrobat into action to nothing but a little madness; and the manner in which it is shown that a variety of different types of Americans are banned by listening to the broadcast of the final game. Paul Lukas & Loretta Young are very good as bridge sweethearts - Lukas confident & refined and Miss Young passionate about being nice and beautiful (though the script blows them too much on a cigarette). It's fun to see them, even if their behavior is not always the most credible or compelling. Frank McHugh does another good job as the relentlessly cheerful ghostwriter who loves Miss Young. The adorable Glenda Farrell abandons her usual wisecracking personality in a small role as McHugh's ditsy gal pal. Roscoe Karns handles the fast-talking dialogue as a cheeky broadcaster. Diminutive Ferdinand Gottschalk is excellently suited as a snobbish expert. <br /> <br /> Movie stars will recognize Dewey Robinson as a bellicose nightclub patron. Emma Dunn as a sobbing reporter; Paul Porcasi as the owner of the Russian nightclub; Charles Lane as a Russian waiter; and Jimmy Conlin as Kibitzer in the last bridge game - not in the credits. <br /> <br /> The film takes advantage of the fad of the contract bridge, which had spread throughout the country since its development in the 1920s. It expects from the viewer a basic knowledge of the intricacies of the game and makes no attempt to explain something to the uninformed.
