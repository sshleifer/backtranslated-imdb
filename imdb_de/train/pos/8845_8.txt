The beginning of this film is a bit clunky and confusing, but sit tight because you want to join the ride of your life. The concept is convincing, with interesting devices that tell the overall story. Everywhere there are good performances, with Phillip Seymour Hoffman being the best of the cast - no surprise. Ethan Hawke also deserves recognition for a very strong performance. The direction of Mr. Lumet is excellent. The film has a sense of the seventies that risks are involved in narrating this story, but unlike most trivial films that populate the landscape today, this is a thriller that is sincerely based on relationships rather than special effects Product plugs. You will be rewarded for the time invested in this movie.
