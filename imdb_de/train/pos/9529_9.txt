This is one of the best movies from 2002. Maybe it's not the best movie, but it looks the best, has great spectacles and is perfectly directed by Sam Mendes, who debuted with 'American Beauty'. <br /> <br It tells the story of a gangster named Michael Sullivan (Tom Hanks), who is seen by his son (Tyler Hoechlin) at one of his jobs. Michael's boss, John Rooney (Paul Newman), believes that things will be alright, but his jealous son Connor Rooney (Daniel Craig) puts both his father and Michael on fire, leading to the death of Michael's wife (Jennifer Jason Leigh) and the second son leads. Michael believes that Rooney is responsible, and Rooney has to decide for himself and sends a batsman Harlen Maguire (Jude Law) to finish the job. Since Michael is a respected man in the organization, he tries to recruit some friends who can help him, including mob boss Frank Nitti (Stanley Tucci). <br /> <br /> In a sense, "Road to Perdition" is a standard gangster movie but it's so well done that you can hardly see it. This film is good in production design, in artistic direction, in sound, in music and especially in cinematography. All of these elements can surprise and create tension, though the result is fairly safe. The fact that Hoechlin is not an annoying child and Hanks, Law and Newman know how to act naturally helps. <br /> <br /> Based on a comic, this movie is so much better than you would expect, and although it has flaws it is one of the better films in the genre. Sometimes there are events that make you realize that you've seen it so many times before, but for some reason, it also feels fresh. The scenes between the adult Hanks and the child Hoechlin help in this area. Watch this movie, which is sometimes familiar, but completely new in many ways.
