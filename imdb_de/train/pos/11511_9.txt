Sometimes weak scripts? Yes! Sometimes cheesy special effects? Yes! Most of the time delicious guilty pleasure? Yes! More about Carl Kolchak and Darren McGavin? Yes! I've always enjoyed science fiction as a kid but found so much Dracula / Frankenstein / Mummy / horror stuff as just crap. Abbott and Costello gave me a new perspective on the classic universal monsters, and Carl Kolchak took me to the "dark side" of entertainment. The Duke had Rooster Cogburn, Eastwood had Dirty Harry, Garner had Maverick and Rockford, Selleck had Magnum and Darren McGavin had Carl Kolchak. With all these faint scripts, cheesy special effects, this Baroque group of minor characters, actors and guest stars mixed, there was Darren McGavin as Carl Kolchak. He had a dry sense of humor despite the danger, was an idealist in his pursuit of the truth, and a realist in accepting the compulsive incompetence and eventual cover-up by government officials. Other than 98% of us, Kolchak was also willing to stretch his neck and do what needed to be done, even if it meant his death, the end of his journalistic career or the prison term. Carl Kolchak was a man of charm and wit who was driving a beautiful classic yellow Mustang (which at the time was an old used car) to save the day for humanity. Like every other fictional hero, Carl Kolchak, the Everyman Hero had been brought to life for Darren McGavin every week for a season. Now that he has passed away and his show is on DVD, I hope that he has just as much fun watching Kolchak play The Night Stalker.
