I just can not understand the negative comments about this movie. Yes, it's a typical boy-meets-girl romance, but it's done with so much flair and polish that time just goes by. Henstridge (talking about winning the gene pool lottery!) Is as magnetic and tempting as ever (who says the golden age of cinema is dead?) And Vartan claims it may be the two leads; The movie is the liveliest when they share a scene - a lot! It's so well done that you're ready to team up ... <br /> <br /> Ignore the negative comments - if you feel a little blue, look at this strip, you'll feel so much better feel. If you are already happy, you will be euphoric. <br /> <br /> (PS: I'm 33, male, from the UK and a hopeless romantic who is still looking for his princess ...)
