Shintar√¥ Katsu, who played the blind swordsman Zatoichi in 27 films, finishes the Hanzo trilogy with this great movie in which he can love a ghost, Mako Midori (Blind Beast). <br /> <br The big stick, which is often used in the pursuit of justice, is forever retired. <br /> <br /> Katsu was his usual insolent self as he pursued those who would steal from the treasury to those who made usury money I could not afford to pay. <br /> <br /> The usual amazing swordplay and skill of the great man was present, along with the blood. <br /> <br /> I will miss him.
