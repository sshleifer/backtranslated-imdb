This was the first movie co-produced by Joan Crawford and Clark Gable, and they would then make several more. Crawford plays a young rich girl whose father was wiped out by the stock market crash, and there's nothing left for her and her brother. They've never worked before, and their brother, William Bakewell, gets a job with Gable, who's a gangster, and Bakewell thinks this will be an easy job, but gets over his head quickly. Crawford becomes a reporter for a newspaper but wants to work on the big stories, but gets worthless stuff to work on. It's a massacre that kills several Gables men and Crawford witnessed the whole thing. It's a good movie, but none of its best.
