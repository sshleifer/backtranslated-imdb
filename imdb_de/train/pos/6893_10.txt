Gerard Phillipe is absolutely perfect in this movie, witty, tender, brave and lover. It lends a movie, which is even a masterpiece, a paramount dimension of rhythm to both the other actors (Gina Lollobrigida: miaoooou !!) as well as to the story or the movie. Never boring, always generating new emotions: for me the best French film of all time.
