I absolutely love this game to death. Since I was 9 years old (I'm 15 now). It has great graphics, characters, magic, weapons, additions and does not forget the ultimate dragoon shapes! I'm still waiting for a remake, prequel or sequel to this spectacular video game. <br /> <br /> You play as Dart, a young swordsman with the potential to be the hero. In this adventure you encounter wondrous creatures and boss battles. They also meet friends on the go who have their own special element. Like fire, darkness, water / ice, thunder / lightning, earth, light and wind. There are also items known as dragoon ghosts that can turn you into legendary magical creatures. Dragons, wizards, creatures known as winglies, and evil creatures to encounter in this adventure of action and excitement. One of my favorite games, The Legend of Dragoon!
