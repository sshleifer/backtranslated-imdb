The film revolves around a man who believes that all media are outdated. The idea behind his art project is to unmask the ridiculous culture in which we find ourselves. Of course the movie is set in Los Angeles / Orange County. He attacks stand-up comics (Caw, Caw, Caw), rock bands, models, Hollywood blockbuster movies and many other media. Finally, he finds himself in the sights of the weapon he has set in motion. The film is five years old and sounds more true every day. It's the best description of post-punk rage I've ever seen. It's also one of my top 10 favorite movies.
