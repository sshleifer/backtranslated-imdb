The most amazing, spiritually uplifting film about the restoration of the gospel. Far better than any other film or film that has ever been made on the restoration. If you have not seen it yet, board a plane to Salt Lake and see it now. You will not regret it! They really get a sense of what the first saints had to comb through, and have full faith in their Prophet Joseph Smith. They finally get some sort of understanding of the things the Prophet had to endure, and the persecutions he and his people were subjected to. If you have questions about The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and our humble beginnings, just watch this movie. Then it will make a complete sense.
