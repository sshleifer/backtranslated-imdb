Someone has already mentioned "being in the right place at the right time". For this documentary, it was so true that I doubted the genuineness of the scenes and thought that it may involve acting, but it is not. It's all real. History is nothing new to people in developing countries and / or poor countries. It sheds light on the manipulation of people by corporate media, the misinformation, the artificial polarization of the population by deliberately creating tensions on the streets, sometimes to the point of being headed by the army, the secret service or even the government (many believe) The US is using agents who attack "any" side to provoke the masses to violence and thus justify their coup. A naval officer in the movie mentions this as well. That they wanted to see the people on the street. All of these scenarios were played in Turkey (the pet dog of the United States in the Middle East) throughout its history, which has experienced three coups and lately, secret plans of the Turkish army were ironically revealed by pro-state religious / conservative media They oppose each other the army's a-religious teachings in which a very important mosque is bombarded by an army agent to provoke people. <br /> <br /> What makes this movie unique is that it may be randomly filmed from the inside when the events have happened. It is clear that the directors are Pro Chavez. Whether this caused the directors to filter and manipulate the events and information I would not know. <br /> <br /> And if Chavez will defend the people of Venezuela against the dictatorship of the USA and the world economy without Any opposing thought will be suppressed by force, and in the end he will become a selfish tyrant. History will tell. <br /> <br /> But at least Chavez is hopeful and I think it's worth taking the chance.
