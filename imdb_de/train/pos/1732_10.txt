"Sandra, Making of a Woman" is outstanding among the exploitation films for two reasons: (1) an excellent but effortless performance by Monica Gayle and (2) the fact that Gary Graver was at the top of the project , Both of these talents, both of which are quite undervalued, make "Sandra" a movie that should be seen. <br /> <br /> Another key to the film's success is realism - there is nothing wrong or "Hollywood". about this californian movie. It's really a piece of life. The modest house in which Sandra lives at the beginning of the film, the simple dresses worn by the figure, the scene in which Sandra wakes up in the morning and Uschi Digart hops on her doorstep and Sandra sits on the couch without make-up. While Digart tries to sell her some cosmetics, it really looks like she just woke up (but still pretty), and the harmless spinner Sandra, who loves to love her while wearing a bra, the one-bedroom apartment Sandra moves - all these elements of the film seem completely real, and so the viewer is drawn into Sandra's little world right from the beginning, immediately interested in her and wants her to succeed. Sandra also asserts her point of view for free love with eloquence and dignity and she brings a lot of lessons with her. <br /> <br /> This movie could have easily failed in less competent hands and could have gone into one of the movie studios using usual sex ploitation instructions, but the Garver / Gale team makes sure "Sandra" is not just making a woman but highlighting an excellent movie.
