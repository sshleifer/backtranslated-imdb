I really liked this movie! Although it had nothing to do with the books, it was still the classic style of Nancy Drew. I had seen a lot of promotion for this movie and as I was really in the books of Nancy Drew, I had very high expectations for this movie and they definitely fulfilled those expectations. Pretty much all the characters were exactly as I imagined them reading the books. I'm really happy that I saw this movie. All actors and actresses really behaved like in the book series. Since I've seen this movie, I wanted to read every single book by Nancy Drew there. All the actors and actresses really did engage with their characters and it definitely turned out when the movie was aired on the big screen. It definitely seemed like all the actors and actresses were really in the positions where the characters were.
