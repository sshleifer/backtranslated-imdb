This gripping story of generational love, jealousy and revenge was even more enjoyable when the DVD was released on DVD after its PBS broadcast, with a sharper image and crisper sound. My only reservations are that the storyline has some unlikely moments and that some of Manchester's stronger accents are sometimes difficult. Fortunately, there is no word here and there, which does not spoil the fun: The main actors are ideally staffed. Robson Green brings an enigmatic smile, temperament and athletic physicality to his role as a young surgeon who falls hopelessly in love with his boss's wife at the hospital he's just started working on. Francesca Annis is one of the most recognizable women you can imagine. Her acting competes with her beauty. (The love scenes between these two show better than words, how little the age difference is of importance to them!) Each of the minor characters is sharply drawn and presented excellently. The mixture of concise dialogue and passionate excess makes this miniseries a delightful affair. As Russell Baker notes in his introduction, watching Reckless may not improve you morally - but you'll have a lot of fun. (The sequel, part of the DVD box set, offers a wild but satisfying two-hour resolution, and you will not want to miss it if you want to enjoy what came before.)
