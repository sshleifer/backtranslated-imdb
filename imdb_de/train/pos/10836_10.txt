I thought this movie was fantastic. It was funny. A bit reminded me of Spinal Tap. This is a must for every 70's rock fan. (I hope my friends and I will not be like that in twenty years!). <br /> <br /> Bill Nighy is an outstanding performer as an off-lead vocalist trying to recapture this ancient spirit. Stephen Rea fits perfectly into the film when trying to keep the band together but not successful is. <br /> <br /> If you love music and have ever been to a band, this movie is definitely for you. You will not regret seeing this movie. I dont know. Even my family thought it was funny and that says something.
