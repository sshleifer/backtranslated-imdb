The sopranos were probably the last best show aired in the 90s. It's sad that it's over, it was the best show on HBO, if not on TV. Not everything was spelled out for you, and you had to think it was brilliant. The cast was excellent. Tony (James Gandolphini) is a great actor who played his character well as well as the others. Each character had shortcomings that made him so real and allowed viewers to connect with them. The last episode was good, I'm not sure how to take it. Many different things can be interpreted by the end identifier. I think Tony did not die, but Wiese went in and sat down with them and the blackout was just for suspense. Tony will have to go to court and deal with that, hopefully not dead, so I feel ... Long live the sopranos and Tony soprano ...
