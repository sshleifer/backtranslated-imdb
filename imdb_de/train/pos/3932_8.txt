In the same tune as his Americana Drums Along the Mohawk, John Ford captures American history in a fictitious yet believable manner. Henry Fonda filmed three consecutive films with Ford during this period, and all three deal with a specific time and place, with a focus on the environment and cultural environment. In Mohawk, Pioneer America is in full bloom, and Americans are fighting against Indians and other powers. Here Ford shows us nineteenth-century America; a time when inventiveness and creativity blossomed and this nation grew really big. Among them was a tall, lanky, young lawyer from Illinois called Abe Lincoln, and this film fictionalized his life as a lawyer and gives an idea of ​​the size he would later accomplish. <br /> <br /> Fonda is superbly the essence of what is considered Lincoln's Persona, although no one knows exactly how he was then. The sets and cast also work well together, providing a unique balance between Ford's scenic dream and its diverse forms. This is not a movie that should be literally recorded, but symbolic. He shows that Lincoln has indeed warmed up for the events in his life that should create his inheritance. We even have a few scenes between him and a young Mary Todd. and it's hard to see how they came together, but that's not the point. I think that's just a tribute to the greatness of Lincoln, widely regarded as the greatest American president. His calm and straightforward demeanor was rare and would be today. In fact, our government certainly needs more men like him.
