One of my favorite movies with a very nostalgic ending. The film is about the Sullivan family, obviously Michael Sullivan (the father) is one of the main members of the mafia, the killer, to put it this way, and an expert. One of the children wants to get to know his father's work (a terrible mistake), so he hides in his father's car and he sees Tom Hanks in action, to put it that way. Mafia doesn In Mafia nothing wins, if they want to get you out, take them out. Of course you can see anyone working in the mafia with a huge house, the best car in the world, whatever you like, but you're doing a wrong job or doing something your boss does not want, and you're fired and killed. <br /> <br /> You can see what I mean in the movie, Sullivan Jr. sees something he did not have to see, and well, almost his entire family is killed for this "wrong thing" his son did , The movie is really entertaining. You see how the Sullivans live after being persecuted by the Mafia, or somehow. This movie is somehow sad, shows us something about revenge, these dirty works that make people almost anything you like. Hopefully the guy will not read this comment for the mafia, and if you work at the mafia, do yourself a favor and bring the hell out of the country before being killed by your boss and their workers. 10/10
