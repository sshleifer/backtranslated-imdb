The story is about Ankush (Abhay Deol) - a professional maid of honor, in short, she is witness to couples in a marriage register - and Megha (Soha Ali Khan), who fled her home in Nainital to marry her love interest Dhiraj (Shayan Munshi). The story begins with Megha waiting in the marriage registration office on Dhiraj, but for some reason he does not appear. Here comes Ankush, who approached Megha with the intention of earning Rs. 200 for his witness job, and he helps her by offering her protection. Ankush grows on his side by working in a bank as an agent ... Ankush falls in love with Megha and she too falls in love with him (or a kind of love), both agree on the marriage and Dhiraj comes back into the picture. Unexpected circumstances happen, I should say, expected circumstances with unexpected reactions and then .... <br /> <br /> Actually the movie story is a bit different from the movies we see and I do not think they are accepted by the filmmakers crowds, but if you are a movie freak like me and like to see something different, then you will definitely like the movie. The film is just an innocent love story that was designed very well by the characters of Abhay Deol and Soha Ali Khan. The characters are so natural that you have the feeling that something is happening to your neighbor. The background music of the film also plays a very good role, it is just too good. The way Delhi is shown is very good and gives a fresh feeling. <br /> <br /> So we skip it and summarize it. <br /> <br /> Story: A very common story that is carried very well Turns into a wonderful experience. <br /> <br /> Music: Well, since it was Himesh Reshammiya, so I did not expect much, but still I liked a few songs of the movie, including the Qawwali. <br /> <Act: Abhay Deol was the most impressive, very natural and innocent spectacle, but he should not sing in the songs. Soha Ali Khan, she is a doll, I have to say a very cute doll. Again very innocent and natural spectacle and these two actors fit perfectly with their characters. Apart from these two, Shayan Munshi needs some drama lessons and possibly only a few layers of fat to cover the bones. Other actors did a good job. <br /> <br /> Stars: I would also give 3.5 out of 5 stars. You will enjoy the movie when it is seen in the theater. I would recommend to see him in the theater if you are an actor movie freak and accept unusual stories. Otherwise, wait for the DVD. The movie will definitely not be liked by the masses and the business it can do is through word of mouth.
