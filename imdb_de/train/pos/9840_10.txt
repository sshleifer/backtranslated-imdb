Born Again the Limerick: <br /> <br /> If a man could come back from the dead <br /> <br /> And live in a little girl's head <br /> <br /> He would get revenge <br /> <br /> For the murder he met <br /> <br /> From the man who is now in his wife's bed. <br /> <br /> For me, Born Again is an extremely underrated classic episode that is part of the definition of The X-Files for me before I started to watch them. I've seen a few scenes before, when the show first appeared, and I was far too young to see them as parts of The Jersey Devil, but I remember exactly how I saw this episode as a 11-year-old and was absolutely scared of the scene where the guy gets smothered by the bus and then the hypnotic scene with the little girl. I tell you, I could not sleep for weeks! For this reason, the episode now has a special aura of horror factor that I can enjoy ever since. It is enough to look past some obvious mistakes in the plot, such as why the girl had to wait until she was nine before his earlier spirit of life really began to take revenge. Or what she was doing when she happened to be sitting in a bus in the middle of the night. They would think their parents were worried. And maybe we do not really see that part of the story. And was with the telekinesis? Apart from adding the really cool Carrie factor to the already scary story, there was no good explanation for that. But even with its small mistakes, this is a classic episode in my eyes and has little or no reason for me not to like it. 10 out of 10.
