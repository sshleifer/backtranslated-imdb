I put this on my TIVO because of my cast for a rainy day, some really hard-working people in the industry, and when I finally watched, I was NOT disappointed (He is mentioned in the credits as a thank-you), seeming to be independent, uses non-contiguous storylines that interweave as the movie reaches its climax. Macy is clean, clean and honest like a man who can not resist his fate. Sutherland plays and portrays as little as possible. Neve adds a buzz to a deliberately subdued environment Impossible on TV?), Not to mention John Ritter, and you have all the ingredients for a good movie. The script is clear, the dialogue is free of clich√©s and thoughtful (especially between Macy and David Dorfman). Exposing and enjoying faith is a really good time.
