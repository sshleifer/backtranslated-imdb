A quiet, sweet and beautifully nostalgic film about what it's like to confront old friends and the environment of your youth with all the memories and problems and worries of the present. A movie that makes you feel good. All the ingredients are here: old serenity, rivalry, friendship and loyalty. Mischief, nocturnal fridge attacks and all the other funny things that we all remember from our summer camps. All characters have the opportunity to experience this for a week, as the old camp leader now wants to retire and meet the children from the golden years of the camp. Everyone is now in their thirties and in the middle of their careers.
