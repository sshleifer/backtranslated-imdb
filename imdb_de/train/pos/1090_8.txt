One of Cary Grant's most enduring comedies is Mr. Blandings building his dream home. Although the apartment would be judged by its size, today it would be a dream villa. Even so, Cary had a good life in the advertising industry, even though he had a fiendish attempt to find a slogan for Ham with the brand name Wham. What did this movie do? popular was the lack of housing in the post-war years. Returned veterans from the war claimed their claims under the GI Bill of Rights, which included home loans. The problem was that there were literally not enough houses to meet the demand. By the time the book of Eric Hodgins and the movie was so popular, Congress entered and President Truman signed the Taft-Ellender-Wagner Housing Act, which brought the government into the housing industry for the first time. I had one uncle and one Aunt who built her own house at about the same time as she moved to in the early fifties. Like Cary Grant and Myrna Loy, they had two daughters and wanted to get out of downtown Rochester. Their place was not quite as grand as a Connecticut house with eighteen rooms, but they lived there the rest of their lives like Cary and Myrna. <br /> <br /> Of course it was expensive and all this The cost just adds up and threatens to send Cary to the cleaners. Cary and Myrna also have Melvyn Douglas nearby to consult, usually too late. Honestly, he's kind of cute on Myrna and Cary knows it. Myrna Loy's role is simply an extension of Nora Charles. If you can imagine Charles pulling into the country and William Powell has the headache that Cary Grant is doing, the movie would still work well. <br /> <br /> Mr. Blandings still builds his dream house as comedy because the situations are universal. And this report is dedicated to my uncle Walter and my aunt Kate, who have lived together in their dream home for over 40 years.
