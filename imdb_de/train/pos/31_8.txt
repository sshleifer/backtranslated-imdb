Once upon a time in a castle ...... Two little girls play in the castle of the garden. They are sisters. A blond little girl (Kitty) and a brunette (Evelyn). Evelyn steals Kitty's doll. Kitty is following Evelyn. Walking through long hallways, they reach the room where the grandfather sitting on a chair reads the newspaper. Kitty complains about Evelyn while Evelyn is interested in a picture hanging on the wall. Evelyn begins to say repeatedly, "I am the red woman and Kitty is the black woman". Suddenly Evelyn reaches for a nearby dagger, kicks off Kitty's doll and cuts her head (the doll). It comes to a fight. And Evelyn almost uses the dagger against Kitty. The grandfather intervenes and the worst is avoided. <br /> <br /> Later, her grandfather tells them the legend referring to the picture on the wall in front of them, in which a woman dressed in black stabs a lady dressed in red: <br /> <br /> " A long time ago a red and a black woman lived in the same castle, they were sisters and hated each other One night, the black woman entered the room of the red lady for jealousy reasons and stabbed her seven times, a year later the red lady left her Grave, she killed six innocent people, and her seventh victim was the black woman, and every hundred years the events recur in that castle and in the castle red lady kills six innocent victims before killing the black lady herself. "Grandfather ends his Story with the statement that the red queen of the legend should return after sixteen years and kill seven times. But he assures them that this is just an old legend. <br /> <br /> Sixteen years pass ..... <br /> <br /> This is the beginning of the movie. There are many twists and turns in the movie. It's better for you to forget the logic (if you really analyze it, the story makes no sense) and just follow the movie with its gorgeous colors, gorgeous women, dresses, tasteful decor, lighting effects and beautiful soundtrack. <br /> <br /> Enjoy Barbara Bouchet, Sybil Danning, Marina Malfatti, Pia Giancaro and other goddesses. There's an act by Sybil Danning on a sofa that you can dream about. And not to forget: the lady in red kills seven times! <br /> <br /> If you liked "La Dama Rossa ...", have a look at "La Notte che Evelyn usc√¨ dalla Tomba".
