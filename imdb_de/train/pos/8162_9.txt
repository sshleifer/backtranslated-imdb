As Dr. Alan Feinstone plays an amazingly confused performance for Corbin Bernsen in The Dentist. <br /> <br /> With his already compulsive compulsive tendencies in high gear, the IRS and a very suspicious woman, who behaves; Dr. Alan Feinstone loses his mind more and more every day. <br /> <br /> When the Doc realizes that his wife is having an affair with the local pool boy, it triggers a series of events that lead to torture, murder, total chaos! "The Dentist" is a solid movie! Bernsen makes the character of Dr. Feinstone at the same time proportionate and detrimental. Although he is completely out of his pumpkin, the audience will still be sympathetic to him. That my friends ..... damn well act. <br /> <br /> A beautiful, solid cast of supportive actors completes this gem of the movie. Excellent direction, good killings and gore and an effective tempo will keep you entertained throughout the movie theater. <br /> <br /> HIGH RECOMMENDED!
