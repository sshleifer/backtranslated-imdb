First and foremost, all I'd like to say is that this movie is more than any of the last shit that Hollywood has boiled out of its guts. McBain is a real action movie with more violence than most viewers. It contains all the classic elements of an action movie of the late 80s / early 90s ... the random acts of violence (ie when Walken and her crew approach the drug dealers to get money that they just show and kill instead of letting them live and easy just taking their money), the cracking of the necks, the burning guys, the guys being blown up by buildings, and of course the guys who burn, who are blown up by buildings. Walken is at its best in this picture and delivers memorable lines like "Let's sit ... sit on the deck." and others who make this film a top prize from the Clearence rack at the local video store. If you are bloody after unnecessary acts of violence, you can rent this movie today and quench your thirst.
