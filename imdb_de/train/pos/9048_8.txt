I refused to watch this movie, and I understand why he was not a big hit in theaters. "October Sky" feels and looks so familiar. And it is. All skills and emotions have been explored in other films - and possibly even better. But despite his familiarity and resistance to all the formulas of Hollywood, this film is winning and sympathetic at every turn. <br /> <br /> Sputnik is the inspiration for this journey of the heart, mind and soul. Just as the characters from Steven Sondheim's musical MERRILY WE ROLL ALONG stood on the roof of their flat agape hoping they would launch their new generation ("What do you call it? They call it a miracle."), Sputnik has a similar impact the youth rocket boys of this true story. While the townspeople of the 50s coal city rejected the event, Homer sees Hickham Sputnik as his ticket to a life in the mines. The masterful direction and casting make the journey of rocketboy Homer and his friends appear fresh and new. Particularly affected are subplots concerning the sick young school teacher Homer. A remarkable restraint is shown in the depiction of her tender relationship. Also noteworthy is the father / son supblot, which anchors the film. All around played perfectly. Even Homer's mother gets her moment without clich√© or intrusion. Her ultimatum to her husband is both dignified and heated. "Myrtle Beach" says it all. <br /> <br /> A big video chain that I despise has a sign beside this movie that you will love this movie or that you will refund your money. For once, I agree with them. You'll never see the October sky the same again. <br /> <br />
