Radiofreccia is a film about us all, about our dreams, our friends, our obsessions, our addictions, our fears. It's a brilliant film in which a group of friends like us all went through the hardships of growing up in a small town in one of the most significant decades of the last century. The movie is not happy or sad, it just tells us a story that we all could have experienced. Happiness and excitement, grief and sorrow. The power of this story is that we love the characters, it's one of those films that you'll see again and again, and you'll feel closer to the little town in which it takes place in Emilia Romagna. Hoping one day to finally be able to walk the streets next to Freccia and his friends, he listened to the music that changed the world, the crackling of an old radio that played Radio Raptus International, his dreams and our dreams. Radiofreccia will make you laugh, it will make you cry sometimes, it will shock and comfort you, it will give you and take you. I personally believe that it has played an important role in my life and that of my friends, and I suggest that you all see it and make it a part of you.
