Maybe the movie itself is not one of Jackie Chan's best films, but I think everyone will agree that the mall fight was one of the best fight scenes ever made. There were also some memorable stunts that were so impressive that they made this movie an action classic. This movie has influenced many other action films, and I think that action filmmakers should learn from this film nowadays (as if they could redesign this chase scene, I think modern technologies could make it even better). There were also some funny scenes that made this movie enjoyable, even though Jackie did not fight. I think they could include more fight scenes in this movie.
