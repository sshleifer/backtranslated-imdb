This might be difficult for some people to get used to Hollywood production styles. The direction is uninspired, it's obviously just shooting the scenery, and the audio quality is poor here and there (the rustling of people's clothing occasionally competes with their voices, etc.) Friends and I watched without knowing what was to be expected, and the first scene almost frightened us off. It seemed very stagy and cheesy. Then we picked up the tone of the content and really enjoyed ourselves. <br /> <br /> It is very funny, despite some dizziness. Be sure to give a chance if you value good dialogue. Helena Bonham Carter is also adorable.
