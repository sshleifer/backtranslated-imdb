Steve Carell comes into his first starring role in the 40-year-old virgin Virgin. He only had supporting roles in films like Bewitched, Bruce Almighty, Anchorman, and his work on The Daily Show, of which we had just a taster of the comedy that Carell truly makes his. It can be said that Will Ferrell has influenced his "weird mood", but Carell takes it to another level, everything he does is innocent, loveable and hilarious. I would say without hesitation that Steve Carell is one of the next great comedians of our time. <br /> <br /> The 40-year-old maiden is two hours of nonstop laughter (or 4 hours if you see it twice.) as I did), a perfect supporting actor, and great leads that captivate audiences throughout the movie , The script was perfect with so many great lines that you want to see the movie again, just to remember everyone. The music goes well with the sound of the movie, and the director knows exactly what he's doing. <br /> <br /> Filled with sex jokes, a bit of nudity and a lot of language, this movie is not suitable for everyone, but if you like the wedding crashers, anchorman or a movie like this, you'll absolutely love the 40 year old maiden ,
