Russell, my darling, is great in this movie. In addition, the film covers an enormous range of human passion and sadness. Everything from marriage to homosexuality is addressed and respected. The film shows the viewer that tolerance for other people is the way to save humanity. Fabulous love story between Lachlin and Lil. I play their scenes over and over again. Anyone who has ever fallen in love will empathize with these people. All characters are superbly staffed and presented.
