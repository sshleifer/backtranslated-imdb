I wanted to see Valentine since I saw that Denise Richards and Marley Shelton were there because they had already starred in some of my favorite movies. When I saw Valentine, I was amazed at how great the plot was. It kills me to see that it has a low rating because it was not terrible at all. The actors and actresses played the games wonderfully and the ending was so brilliant and clever. Some scenes were a bit unbelievable and bad, and I admit it got a bit boring in some smaller parts but overall it was entertaining and exciting all the time. There was a startling story to guess all the way through, and it does not deserve all the crap it gets. I recommend to watch this movie at any time, but especially on Valentine's Day because it will certainly give you a lot of chills. Oh, and do not pay attention to the trailer OR the rating, please do not ...
