"GEORGE LOPEZ" is in my opinion an absolute ABC classic! I have not seen every episode, but I still enjoy it. There are many episodes I have enjoyed. One of them was where Amy (Sandra Bullock) stepped into a moving machine. If you want to know why, you must have seen it yourself. Before I summarize, I would like to say that everyone has always performed well. The production design was spectacular, the costumes were well designed and the writing was always very strong. In summary, I can say that new episodes are currently in progress, but I strongly recommend catching them, just in case they ever go out of breath.
