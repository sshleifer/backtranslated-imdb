So should a movie be when trying to grasp the essence of what is very surreal. It has this hazy overtone, which is rarely captured in the film, feels like a dream sequence and really puts you in a dark haunting memory. The children were extremely credible and I expect that in the future some things will come out of it. Very natural for such young people, I do not know if Bill pulled it out of them or just so well, but no less excellent. Bill scored for me, and for KevNJeff's comment about Mr. Paxton's bad acting, what can one do in that role? He played the role pretty well in my opinion. This comes from someone who said Hamlet was good (The Ethan Hawke version?) Wow ......... Do not listen to his comments. Great movie, so you feel really uncomfortable, if you want that? The cinematography also receives an above-average rating.
