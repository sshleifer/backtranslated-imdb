I love this show, it sure is a winner. Jessica Alba is doing a great job, it's about time that we have a crazy girl who is not the cute guy. The entire cast is wonderful and all episopes have good actions. Everything is well laid out and considered. To put it together, it must have taken a while, because it was not someone who was in a hurry to hit something. It's a great show.
