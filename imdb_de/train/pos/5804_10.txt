Michael Jackson is no longer very popular in the US, but in Europe (especially in Germany) he still has many fans. Many will say that this is a bad movie and that is: it has no plot, it's full of stereotypes, Michael is constantly praising himself. <br /> <br /> BUT, you can not expect any action or non-clich√© in this kind of movie! It has entertaining visual effects and the music is perfect. The Smooth Criminal Fragment - the biggest song of all time, full of moonwalks, group dance acts and even the famous "Michael Jackson's Bench-Over" - makes this movie a masterpiece of Jackson with an even good-looking (and white ...) Michael Jackson! <br /> <br /> A must for Jackson fans, a must for music fans, a must for Dance Act fans. <br /> <br /> As an MJ fan, however, I should warn all Michael Jackson haters out there: DO NOT look at this movie, you would only increase your hatred ...
