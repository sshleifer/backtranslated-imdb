Lily Powers works on a speakeasy until her dad dies. Then she goes to New York to work in an office building. There she realizes that she has to give the men what they want, if she wants to get higher... Well, you know that. Alfred E. Green's Baby Face (1933) is a movie with a high sexual content. For a movie from that time anyway. This was one of the last pre-code movies that were made Stanwyck gives a very sexy performance as Lily. Other actors in this film are George Brent, Donald Cook, Alphonse Ethier, Henry Kolker, Margaret Lindsay and Theresa Harris. The young John Wayne is seen as Jimmy McCoy Jr. This movie is about a courageous topic and does it well. Baby Face is a historically significant movie and therefore good to look at.
