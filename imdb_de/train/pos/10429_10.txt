Normally, I'm not a fan of strictly romantic movies, but I've heard that was good. I was shocked. The most romantic thing I've ever seen in my life. Breathtakingly brilliant, sweet, funny and full of hearts. The chemistry is impeccable, as well as writing and governing. <br /> <br /> Ethan Hawke and Julie Delphy are so natural and sweet that you really think they are a couple. <br /> <br /> The movies grab you right away and will not let you go. They can not look away and stop listening to them. Even the little moments just melt your heart. <br /> <br /> This has jumped into the ranks of one of my favorites of all time. A masterpiece.
