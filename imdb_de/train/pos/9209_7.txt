STAR EVALUATION: ***** The Works **** simply misses the mark *** The little bit in between ** afterward * The box Mike Atherton (Dudikoff) peacefully makes his way in the Wild West when he discovers a group of men who abuse a lady. As a gentleman, of course, he steps in and stops, killing the son of a disgusting executioner. This is just the beginning of a fervent battle to the finish, of which there will only be one winner. <br /> <br /> M Dudikoff is an action star who has never managed to stand out with me. Maybe I discovered him too late, and after the other movie I saw with him last Monday, The Human Shield, it was just another dud (ha ha) added to the list. But I have something for westerns to be movies that somehow transport me to a different time and place and offer real escapist entertainment. This Dudikoff has chosen one of his better scripts, since his films are running anyway. The film achieves a few low points in the form of a Naff villain who sounds like an empty Marlon Brando and generally looks silky to some performers, along with compulsory, inexpensive sets. But if, for some strange reason, your life ever depended on a Dudikoff movie, that would be one of your best decisions. ***
