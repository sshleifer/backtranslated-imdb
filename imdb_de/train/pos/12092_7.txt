I remember the first time I saw it in the 70s when it was shown on late night television. I was scared to hell. But then I was still a teenager, not so much with movies as I am today. <br /> <br /> CASTLE OF BLOOD (aka DANSE MACABRE) is a great example of the Italian horror genre of the 60s. together with Mario Bavas BLACK SUNDAY (1960), CURSE OF THE LIVING DEAD (aka: KILL BABY KILL) (1966) and Mario Caiano's NIGHTMARE CASTLE (1965). If you want a spooky atmosphere and good writing, then look at them too. I also rate them along with the early Poe films that Roger Corman filmed at the same time. <br /> <br /> I have seen the new Synapse DVD taken from a French print and is a big improvement over this old pan-and-scan print that has been making its way on television over the years , It adds a few minutes of dialogue (in French) that does not really add much to the movie, but it's nice to see it complete without cuts. Unfortunately, the DVD offers no more extras than stills from the movie. <br /> <br /> One shock I noticed was in the opening scene when the man with smoke effects was reflected beside the camera on the glass of the inn's front door. I think the editors did not understand it at the time or it I did not care, but I did not notice it the first time. That's the miracle of DVD. You can see all the flubs, errors and details that did not show up the first time. But no matter. <br /> <br /> But no matter, it still gets a 7 on the imdb meter <br /> <br />
