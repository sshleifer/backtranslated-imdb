Well, the main reason I saw this movie is that it was made by Trey Parker and Matt Stone from South Park. But as soon as the movie started, the laughter broke out of my stomach. From the subtle gestures in the direction of a joke to the crass toilet humor and a constant reliance on some very funny allusions. This movie could ruin the most serious mans poker face, let alone its poker underwear. Some of the funniest eyelashes, and you'll miss the jokes that have ever been portrayed in Hollywood, along with a constant criticism of yourself in the trade He is also not too shabby in the old drama. I was surprised with the amount I recorded in this film. However, I am quite worried that it is not available on the internet here in the United Kingdom. All right, boys! <br /> <br /> It's me, and I'll continue to show it to all my friends, who annoyingly point out the funny parts and occasionally snort into my bed. All in all an excellent movie if you are a fan of unnecessary comedy. However, if you do not have a sense of humor in stupid or rude things, steer it clearly! However, I am sure that by including Jenny McCarthy and Jasmine Bleeth you would be able to gargle past these prejudices.
