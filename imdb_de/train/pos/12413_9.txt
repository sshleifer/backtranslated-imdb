The story of a fake prisoner following the jail in which he was electrocuted and killing indiscriminate prisoners as he waits to avenge the man who framed him. <br /> <br /> Viggo Mortensen is great and the acting is pretty good overall. Lane Smith is deliciously evil, like the guilty guardsman. This movie also has some great pain, including death from barbed wire mummification.
