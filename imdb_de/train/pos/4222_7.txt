I like this episode a lot, Ruth Gordon is good, if not a bit of a hammy like she always was. As already mentioned, the music is very good and she has a mood that does not exist in all episodes. <br /> <br /> However, there is a large plot hole so far that you can drive it through a fleet of trucks. It is found that the light in the vault does not work. Do not you think the very smart Columbo or the rest of the police would have thought to check if the light bulb works? They would think in a very short time that they had unscrewed the light bulb and found the note. Granted, this is a TV fiction, and many holes are always found, but that seems too blatant. <br /> <br /> It really does not make Columbo a hidden genius when the light does not work, but the statement about the "death bed" seems to be unfounded for days.
