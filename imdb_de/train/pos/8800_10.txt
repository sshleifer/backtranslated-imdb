At first, I do not understand why some people find this movie so anti-American. Sure, there are moments when the US is being charged directly, as in the segments Youssef Chahine, Ken Loach and, to some extent, Mira Nair. But come on, they are not naive accusations; Instead, they are based on real and documented facts, and all the documents that the CIA has published about Chile confirm this, for example. <br /> <br /> But when I return to the film itself, I like it the most. There are many different moods in it. We find that children are educated for the respect of all people who died in the event. We find an unhappy couple who is changed by the tragedy of that day. We find normal people whose feelings have been downgraded in the shadow of the events of 9/11 and react differently, with dignity or frustration; We even find someone in the film for whom the fall of the towers establishes a moment of real happiness. <br /> <br /> All these visions and others - as powerful as these or even more - form a consistent mix and help. The viewer should take a look at how different people around the world are looking at the events of the 11th century. September responded. What we see is a panorama that is much more complex than white and black, and this can make some people angry. But this is the world we live in, and there is no place for Manicheist ideologies, no matter what we presidents or priests say. <br /> <br /> Finally, it's a pity that there is not even a release date for this movie in the United States of America. It's a shame because most Americans ask why this disaster happened, and this movie could give them clues. Clearly, unlike some people in this forum, this film clearly states that everything we do today determines our future and that the mistakes of the past will affect the way we live today.
