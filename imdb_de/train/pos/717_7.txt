great Ramones fan. I like the Ramones, and I think if you hate them, you do not just like this classic as an avid Bush fanatic like the 80's. infinitely better than the American pies who are plaguing us now. <br /> <br /> There are other great high school movies: Switchblade Sisters, Fast Times ..., Class of '84, Three O'Clock High, and the cheesy yet arresting (does not seem) River's Edge. But RnRHS will always be my favorite because it's the funniest and funniest. You can also get up and dance with it. <br /> <br /> I love you, reef Randell. <br /> <br /> 10/10
