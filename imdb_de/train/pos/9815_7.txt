As the first feature film with Robert De Niro (although he was not released years later), this is worth the clock. De Niro's role is not great, but amusing as one of two friends who first try to prevent another friend's marriage, only to persecute him later, to force him to do so. Every die-hard De Niro fan will get a kick from one of the best actors today.
