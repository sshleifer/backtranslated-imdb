Gene Kelly had some really great ideas for musicals in MGM. Here he is at the forefront of his creative abilities, working with the Arthur Freed music unit. Hard to believe, if you look at an American in Paris, that the players have never lost their backs at MGM. <br /> <br /> The magic of An American In Paris is based on a creative cut led by Vincent Minnelli and the sets developed by MGM combined with some background shots. The idea for the film came with Kelly, who just wanted to make a movie with a long ballet sequence that included George Gershwin's tone poem An American in Paris. It sounded good to Arthur Freed, who had turned to Ira Gershwin, who said well with him as long as he used other Gershwin material. Not a Gershwin sound is heard in An American in Paris. Listen to some background music and you'll hear things like Embraceable You and But Not For Me that are not real musical numbers. <br /> <br /> Another guy who had a good hand writing texts, Alan Jay Lerner, wrote the story, which admittedly is thin. Everything about a former GI, played by Gene Kelly, who had never left France after World War II, settled in a flat on the left bank and became a starving artist. He lives with the eccentric composer Oscar Levant and always sounds like a redundancy. <br /> <br /> Two women are interested in him. Another American American played by Nina Foch, who wants to sponsor him as a painter if he opposes in other matters. But Kelly falls in love with a movie girl who plays Leslie Caron on her film debut. Caron also has the musical comedy star Georges Guetary who cares. <br /> <br /> Of course, the plot is just an excuse to sing and dance to George Gershwin's music. An American in Paris happened to be the first film I saw on the first flight I ever made as a movie. I remember flying from Phoenix Arizona to Kennedy Airport and seeing Gene Kelly doing I Got Rhythm. However, my favorite movie number is Tra-La-La, which Kelly sings and dances throughout the apartment, with Oscar Levant playing the piano. At one point Kelly dances on the wing of a baby. <br /> <br /> In a book about Arthur Freed I read a quote in which he said that the ballet sequence of the American in Paris with the background of The French Impressionists, of whom he believed that they are not the audience for a realistic setting on the street or behind the house would take. That's how it happened. Kelly had long ballet sequences in Words and Music, The Pirate and On the Town. But this has surpassed them all. In my opinion and also in some later films by Gene Kelly. In a surprise at the Oscars, An American In Paris was voted the best picture in 1951, beating the heavily favored A Streetcar Named cravings. I think fantasy has trumped realism this year. Big budgets are also paramount in these matters. <br /> <br /> Still an American in Paris is one of the best movie musicals ever made, and as the studios no longer have all these creative talents under one roof, they're less likely to be repeated.
