Capra was quite successful at the beginning of his career with his camera work and his timing. This is a small story - and sometimes quite predictable - but it does deliver very good performance from his cast and has some pretty complicated camera moves that connect the viewer closely. The first part looks like a Cinderella story, though everyone can see with sense that the ground falls under it - the rich "prince" will lose his fortune. <br /> <br /> Despite its good cast and fast pace, it's easy to get caught up in stereotypes. Then the movie becomes more original as the couple has to find a way to make a living. The end is very predictable, but satisfactory. I would also like to congratulate the title letter: very funny and funny.
