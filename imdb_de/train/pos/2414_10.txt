Monarch Cove was one of the best dramas on Friday night that has been shown for a long time. I urge the author to write a long series and broadcast them on Lifetime. SOON.Each person was very interesting and did a wonderful job with their lines. The story becomes true. The movie, however, must take a long time. I would love to see Bianca and Jake's child grow up and get an important role in the movie, along with the new grandparents who are planning for their future schooling. Take Kathy back to see her niece and help promote her life. It was great to see how the grandparents worked out their problems, but the family business had to return to working status and show us how Jake and Bianca survive the marriage years.
