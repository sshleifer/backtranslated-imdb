I could not take my eyes off this movie when it appeared on cable. The dialogues and costumes are of a quality that is best associated with softcore porn. In this case, the expedient presentation does not serve as a vehicle for sex, but for serial hits with Nunchuks. (Maybe for sex, but not on Indian TV anyway.) <br /> <br /> Since I'm not a fan of the genre, I could not classify Jeff Wincott and had no clue to the search. It was not until Brigitte Nielsen traded her futuristic nurse-coif (so mayoral!) Against the high-top fade we remember from Beverly Hills Cop II that I made her a positive identification. <br /> <br /> Doubt entertain any admirer of the couture of the early '90s or a nap on Paul Verhoeven. Can we add a genre tag for "so-bad-it-good"?
