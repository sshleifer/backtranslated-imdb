When I bought my Toy Story band when it came to video in the cinemas after the release, I saw a trailer for it, which was said by the makers of Toy Story. As soon as I saw, I knew that this would be a good feature! I was right! A mistake like Toy Story is a great story, great characters, and great animations. My favorite characters are Dim the rhinoceros beetle by Brad Garrett and Hemlich the Caterpillar by Pixar Storyman Joe Ranft. My favorite scene is when Slim, the stick (David Hyde Pierce), raises Hemlich and tries to distract the bird, and Hemlich like You hoo Mr. Early Bird. How about a delicious-tasting worm on a stick and slim, as if I were going to snap! I will snap! I just died when I laughed about this scene. As a big fan of insects, I think A Bug's Life is my favorite Pixar, though I know that many people think it's the worst Pixar movie ever! I do not know how to hate a Pixar movie! I think those are all pretty good movies! Good job, PIXAR!
