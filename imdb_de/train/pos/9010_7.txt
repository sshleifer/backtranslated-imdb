A bit quirky and with a bad taste; but smart enough to be worth seeing. The young woman Jane Hatchard (Helena Bonham Carter), who is sitting in a wheelchair, is accompanied by Richard (Kenneth Branagh), who is reluctant to take care of it. Richard is an artist who dreams of human flight. He builds a plane in his garage and wants to fly it. He wants to revive his troubled life by caring for the independent, dying Jane, who suffers from a neurological disorder that has almost left her linguistic and motor abilities. In a wheelchair and full of mind is her last wish to lose virginity. She offers herself to Richard, who will not help her directly. but is willing to rob a bank to pay a gigolo for the act. I found this strip ambitious and humorous. Carter also has a certain charisma and sympathy in this role.
