The first one was good and original. I was not a bad horror movie. I heard that a second one was done and I had to look at it. <br /> <br /> What really makes this movie work is Judd Nelson's character and sometimes clever script. A pretty good script for a person who wrote the Final Destination movies and the direction was fine. Sometimes there are scenes in which it looks like it was filmed with a home video camera with a grainy look. <br /> <br /> Great TV movie. It was well worth the rent and probably worth buying just to get that nice, weird feeling and watching Judd Nelsons Stanley do what he does best. They have an idea of ​​how Stanley is and get a little background.
