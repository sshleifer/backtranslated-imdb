... if this movie proves so well that they are actually unnecessary. <br /> <br /> Although there were only a few lines, it was kind of weird to see this movie in an unfamiliar language. A friend of mine sent a VHS with some papers with all the lines translated into English. With their translation next to me, I began to look at this story (it is actually a story), and I was stuck by the first melodies of the whistling melody during the opening credits. the colors, the minimalist drama (in most cases), absurd comedy, slapstick, thoughtful, beautiful ... along with some other films (Paris, Texas and Nenette et Boni) this can speak to any heart - without words. Whenever you have the chance, you see it. Whatever you do - do not miss it. It is a unique experience. Oh, drama is great, the soundtrack is brilliant, the story is simple and told a thousand times before - but rarely (never?) Sun.
