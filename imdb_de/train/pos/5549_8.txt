The silent movie The Pride of the Clan with Mary Pickford was to be filmed on a fictional island off the coast of Scotland. In fact, most of the outdoor shots in Marblehead Massachusett on the Marblehead Neck were filmed near several geographically rocky coastal areas, including the Churn and Castle Rock. My initial interest in the film was due to two factors: 1) the Marblehead location in my hometown, and 2) the fact that my grandmother Lizzette M. Woodfin was hired as a substitute for Mary Pickford during the filming of several scenes. Scene". Both women were small in size (5 ') and my dad and grandmother reported that she stood with her back to the camera for the cliff scene as part of the Chiefton movie set. I just wanted to tell this story to future movie historians and those interested. The film itself (my DVD copy is a bit poor) is very well done with lots of action and expressive drama, including some scenes in which Miss Pickford characterizes a strong woman. I enjoyed it and would like to get a better copy of it, though I am not sure if there is one, as I have seen in various movie sites, that remaining copies are dark due to deterioration. A very nice movie of the silent genre with lots of action!
