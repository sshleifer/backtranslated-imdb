The plot: A detective unites three different mafias in a company to buy an island that would then serve as a money laundering agency for organized crime. To prevent this, the FBI tries to break one of the mafia lords. The thing goes awry, and some unexpected twists and turns show us another "cop buddies" who dislike each other ... one is a female FBI agent and the other is a former DEA agent. <br /> <br /> So silly. But the strength of this film is not in its story - at best a bad joke. It's funny. (At least that is the synchronized German version). The action is also good, with a memorable scene that includes a firearm and a rocket launcher. However, the focus is on humor. No smart satire, no slapstick, but somewhere in between you get a lot of funny jokes. <br /> <br /> However, this film is the opposite of political correctness. Legal drug abuse is prominently displayed without criticism and even referred to as cool. This is the part of the film that seriously annoyed me and, in my view, makes it unsuitable for children. All in all, this movie is perfect for a nice evening with acceptable action with some funny jokes. Remember: In this genre, it's common to keep your brain at the door when you enter the cinema / TV room. Then have a good time. 8.10
