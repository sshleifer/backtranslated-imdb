Jackie Chan, who became famous for the first time on Drunken Master, was brought back into the limelight with Project A in 1983, an extremely enjoyable pirate strip that made him a big star again. By the time Police Story was released two years later, the extraordinary hype surrounding Jackie peaked, and people flocked to see that frenetic mix of great stunts, brutal battle scenes, and questionable comedy. It broke many box office records and inspired a 50% increase in police recruits, but after 20 years - is it good? <br /> <br /> As an action movie, Police Story stands indisputably. There are several great fighting scenes, some stunts reminiscent of Han's hero Buster Keaton, and a compelling, if violent, climate-political conflict. Jackie's performance is also very strong, and while the frequent forays into the tedious comedy only slightly diminish the effect of the film, it is sustained by his charisma. In presenting our hero as a border psychopath whose recklessness puts others at risk, Jackie has taken a serious risk ... though no one seems to notice! By praising Police Story as a simple "good against evil," critics fought over the ambiguity of the film, and although it is barely The Brothers Karamazov, the film in this uncertainty represented a remarkable and commendable departure from conventional ideas. > <br /> In short, this is still a high-quality "popcorn" movie * (although you may empty your belly while many scoundrels in the final scene of the movie are bumped into glass showcases or placed in glass cases) potent, exuberant entertaining action movie is one of the best of his time.
