I had never heard of this movie until I happened upon it while surfing the IMDB. I saw that it had received many horrible reviews that contained very colorful explanations of how much it had stunk. That meant, of course, that I had to see it. I was pleasantly surprised, because Whipped is actually a good movie. I saw it with a group of friends and we laughed more than many of the acclaimed Hollywood fluffy comedies. This is an independent film, and as such it presents its theme (sex and dating) without the usual Hollywood counterfeits. I clearly suspect that people's opinion of this film depends very much on their life experience. If you've never dated or celebrated much, you will not get this movie because you did not meet people like these characters. If so, you will recognize many of the situations presented here in a comedic way. The end was also good, as women were not portrayed as unrealistic, helpless, virgin romantics unlike many Hollywood movies.
