Sensitive film lacks brilliance and, to some degree, narrative structure, but is still superbly recorded and performed. The narrative structure point is however controversial. While in the closing scenes it gives the impression of a casual ending and connects his thoughts with what the modern viewer might call "history," I am skeptical as to whether this feeling needs a narrative structure "that is unequivocal and demonstrable It's compared to SOMERSAULT because its central protagonist (I'm not sure this is the right word!) is a young and very young-looking woman whose newly discovered sexuality confuses and strengthens her - though of course Cate Shortland's film addresses that aspect Although reckless viewers may dismiss this film as a clich√©, PEACHES is in some ways much more ambitious than SOMERSAULT, and perhaps that does not quite work out - it certainly is very different from Monahan's first feature - THE INTERVIEW! I'm not sure how the sex scenes between Weaving and Lung contributed to the story Who knows - maybe they did. You've certainly rammed the compromised and flawed nature of Weaving's character home - although I personally think that this was achieved without the need for those scenes. <br /> <br /> ***** JUST SAW THE FILM AGAIN ***** ****** <br /> <br /> In a second look I can see how some dismiss it as telemovie, which is disguised as a function. However, I'm not sure how different these "categories" are or whether we should make that distinction. In any case, I think the film has enough layers to distinguish it from Hallmark's efforts. On the other hand, the structure of the film is very formal and the content is barely challenging, at least in terms of SOMERSAULT, TOM WHITE, THREE DOLLARS, THE ILLUSTRATED FAMILY, LOOK BOTH WAYS, and THE MUMAN TOUCH. The performances are all good, but I came to realize that the main reason why I enjoyed the movie was because it suited the "Australian" genre without necessarily adding anything ... and I can understand that this may be pretty good reason for another person * NOT * to like it! In fact, only when Lung enters her room in her Vietnamese robe does the movie really start to hit. But that leads us into another debate - should we expect a film to constantly challenge us? Of course, I enjoy being challenged by a movie (or a book or other people), but is there no room left for a beautiful story? <br /> <br /> I did not delete my first post on film because I'm all too aware of the Orwellian undertones of such an act. But I would downgrade my initial rating from 8 to maybe 6.5. <br /> <br /> As far as nominations for AFI Best Film are concerned, my voices go to THE MUMAN TOUCH, THREE DOLLARS and LOOK BOTH WAYS - and I think LOOK should win both ways.
