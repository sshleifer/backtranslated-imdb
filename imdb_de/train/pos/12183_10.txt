A reviewer notes that it obviously does not matter what Welles actually says or does, he moves you. I agree. He was and remains a unique force in the film. More than a threefold threat that could act, write and direct, he had a genius unique to the film. One can think about whether he used to be a painter. This film certainly reinforces this impression. A musician, a theatrical actor, a heir to Shakespeare? hard to say, but I am very grateful that he filmed his time with film and he recorded it cinematically. I like the accent. I like the face, the size, the style, the mind and the games. I love all his films and wish there was more. I especially love how other actors interact with him cinematically. Many were never better or at least somewhat different with him because he was stuck. Even toward the end, when his beauty might have been ruined by his own will, he was impossible to ignore and made every scene he was in. Rita was a beautiful blonde - a Lana Turner look, but maybe even more beautiful and even more beautiful eye goes to Welles and one wishes one more minute, another movie, another hour in his company. That's why we all wish we could find the lost bits of his films because we know we all know that there is no part of him that is not worthy of our time. Look at it and be grateful for the opportunity.
