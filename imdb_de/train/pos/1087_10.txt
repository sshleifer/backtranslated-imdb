There is so much to love in this sweet little comedy. Anyone who has ever built or bought a home, or even been short of space, will find that in the plight of the devious Mr. Blanding, there is more than a grain of truth. Melvyn Douglas tells with a great comic flicker and acts as a lawyer and voice of reason by Blandings. Myrna Loy is best as a rather absent-minded, but extremely patient woman. But the best performance is Grant. He is the American Jedermann, especially relevant at the time of publication of this film, when the nation was in a housing shortage after the end of the war. The topics are universal, lack of money, workload, fear of infidelity. Yeah, it's really neatly packaged, but you have to keep in mind that this was the time when the world was just recovering from a terrible war and wanted a happy ending. It's still relevant today, and I have to see the bad reviews I see as a fondness for dumb, rough comedies. The look of the film is smooth and there are some great comedies, especially in the beginning. If he has lost anything of social relevance, he is a jewel almost sixty years after its release.
