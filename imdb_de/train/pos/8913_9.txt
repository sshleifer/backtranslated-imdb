This is my favorite classic. It was filmed a little west of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, when I was 13 years old in 1957, and released the following year. In 1970, I worked in the same district as a rookie PA State Trooper. I have always enjoyed exploring the different places where scenes were filmed. I knew the owner of the Downingtown Diner well, and he had a sign outside the door where all passing car drivers said this was the "home of the blob". The theater scene was in Phoenixville, near Valley Forge Park, and there are still films showing today!
