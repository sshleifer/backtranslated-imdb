This is undoubtedly one of the funniest movies ever made. Amitabh as a fagot, Arjun Singh, is funny. The best part is that the laughter never stops. The plot is an old story in which the child is separated from the mother, who sacrifices everything for her service - with a happy reunion in the end. There are rogues (Ranjit) and there are brothers (Sashi Kapoor) and there are vixen (Parveen babhi) and there are lovers (Smita Patil), and there is a blind brother and a grandfather who are thrown for good reason. But this movie is about Amitabh and that's all you remember in the end. <br /> <br /> Amitabh comes to town to earn a decent living, and his willingness to talk and behave is hilarious. Later in the film, he transforms into the Angry Young Man, for whom he is famous, but the humor is preserved. Memorable parts include walking, speaking and speaking English, the song (pad gungaroo re bhand, meera nachi thi) and everything with his dadoo. <br /> <br /> All in all, I was laughing during the movie. If you want to have 3 hours of entertainment with Amitabh to its absolute best - that's it. It will easily give 10/10.
