This was an absolutely addictive series and I was sorry that I only saw a few shows when it aired late in the UK. The style was so different from others of its kind, and the whole had a disturbing atmosphere of stylish fear. All you have to do is read all the positive comments (not a single negative I can see) to realize what a truly innovative show this was and how it caught on in the imagination. I now understand from reading the comments that CANCELED is so incredible. What a bunch of "Headless Overpided Turkeys" had (or may still be) walking around to do that.
