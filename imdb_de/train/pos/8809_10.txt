This document really opened my eyes to what people outside the United States thought about the 9/11 attacks. This film has been expertly assembled and presents this disaster more than an attack on US soil. The consequences of this disaster are predicted from many different countries and perspectives. I believe that this film should be more widely used for this point. It also helps in the healing process to finally see something other than news about the terrorist attacks. And some of the pieces are actually funny, but not abusive. This film was highly recommended to me and I pass on the same feeling.
