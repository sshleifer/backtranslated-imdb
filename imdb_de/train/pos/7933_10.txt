Good times working with the Quiroz brothers and the entire cast of this project as "Guy on the Bench". I was amazed at how well they managed to capture all the recognizable features of a true "B" horror movie. I hope to be able to work with the Pumpkin Patch Pictures team again in the future. I moved to Detroit shortly after completion and have been publicly known since its release. Once it was actually in the video library and the girl had almost lost her mind. It was pretty funny and that was my first real autograph moment when I signed her receipt. One day I asked the girl at Blockbuster if the movie was often on loan, and she confirmed it by looking up the computer. At the time, it rented more than Ring2, which was also a re-release at the time ... The title immediately arouses interest in the more urban markets. She also noticed on many occasions that the film was not returned by the client, which led me to believe that the movie was just so good that people did not want to return it ya!
