Walking between comedy and drama is one of the toughest acts in the cinema. How can one laugh from the misery of other people and not feel bad if it takes too long? <br /> <br /> Well, this amazing little gem of a movie will deliver great laughs, beautiful scenery and much more. Also a good madness. I especially like the concept that a trick of history made alcohol legal because white Europeans liked it, and marijuana is illegal since "these other races" have used it ... undoubtedly true and the racial sides of the marijuana laws, so tormented by the public, exposed all over the world An extraordinary "DVD Extra" commentary ... two of them ... running through the movie with both actors and then again with the authors. I kept seeing things that I was sure were not in the first movie, but then I realized how easy it was to miss much of the subtle comedy on the first take. What a scream! Do not miss it! 9/10 stars
