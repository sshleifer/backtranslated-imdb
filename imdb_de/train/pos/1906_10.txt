Unfortunately, the 8 simple rules I shared with my teenage daughter were the last sitcom on which John Ritter worked after his tragic death in 2003. He was one of my favorite actors. He had everything comedy (who can forget him in Three's Company), but he was also an excellent dramatic actor (Unforgivable - worth a TV movie). As much as I loved all the other actors in the series (Katey, Amy, Kaley) and Martin) John was THE star, he was the main reason why I was approached by the show, and it was his perfect comedy that broke me down every time , <br /> <br /> I loved that the show was not just sugar sweet (as much as I loved the Cosby show, well, they were too nice to each other, lol). They brilliantly portrayed the typical family dynamics. It was realistic enough with all the sibling rivalries and the quarrels between the parents, but they still made fun of it. Many American sitcoms try to fill the shows completely with morals and what not, and this show has not done that. Yes, there have been some, such as coping with issues such as drugs and bullying, but they have not tried to be anything but a funny family comedy. The way they wrote John's death in the movie The show was done well, I still sob like a baby when I see it. You could feel how raw the emotions were during these incredibly hard episodes. <br /> <br /> I am sad that the show has been canceled, I still enjoy the repetitions and never get tired. <br /> <br /> John Ritter, will you always be remembered for making fun of this protective mother, who prefers to have his daughters locked up in their room rather than meeting a boy? =) You rock knights !!!
