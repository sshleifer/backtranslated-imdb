I saw the film a few years ago at the Viennale, where the audience liked it. I liked it too, the performance of Summer Phoenix is ​​still in me, so I decided to write a comment. <br /> <br /> The story is shown around 1900 in London, where a Jewish girl decides to act. She desperately tries to become one, but it is not until a man treats her badly, that she realizes on stage that she has talent and that she connects with the audience and emerges as a stronger person. <br /> <br /> There were certain reviews that had broken their performance, accusing them of being boring and not being able to bring their character to life. I think that's her strength, that's what Esther Kahn should be and Phoenix makes a brave decision to make Esther a pretty boring girl. Your transformation in the end is thus more powerful than it could otherwise have been. <br /> <br /> The cinematography is great, the pictures of London at the turn of the century are very dark and sad. You can see how uncomfortable life was back then. <br /> <br /> The only mistake in my opinion is the length of the movie. They lose contact with the characters. After all, it's all about finding the actor within, so the movie does not contain any dramatic action. It is thanks to Phoenix that we do not lose interest in the film after the first hour.
