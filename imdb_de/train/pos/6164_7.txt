Are we really doing "video nasties" again? In the form of a widescreen digital widescreen remake of 8MM, this is quite a ride. Unfortunately, there is a bit too much history and sometimes this becomes a travelogue while our heroine searches the Sleaze spots of Paris, Hamburg and Amsterdam. However, I'm rather bizarre for the "depraved" scenes, from hot wax to hard whipping and hard sex, to drowning, beheading and some. These scenes are immaculate and it is a pity that Bruno and his budget were not enough to make all the many characters that were introduced more than just cartoons.
