I first saw this movie when I was about 6 or 7 years old and did not think it was special. As the time progressed, I saw it a few more times and it began to develop as I began to understand the moral of the film, which I will come to later. For a while, I left this movie alone and did not see it for a while. Looking for an old classic movie that I saw a few weeks ago (now 15 years old), I dug up the VHS from home. After seeing that, I stayed at a natural peak that I could not really explain. The movie gives an overwhelming sense of joy that you never really expect. The movie character of three completely different animals working together to find their way home sends a message home, no matter how different you are, you can always find common ground, something you all need. The way the personalities of the characters are chosen is really fantastic. You have an old, knowledgeable Golden Retriever who takes care of the fun, albeit awkward young American Bulldog, with a cheeky, clever, vulnerable, self-assured tomcat. The film follows these three friends or companions on a journey so realistically impossible that it produces magic, believing that this journey can happen. <br /> <br /> I do not want to sound like a soft handkerchief when it comes to movies. I assure you that I am quite the opposite, but the most uplifting part of this film is undoubtedly the return of shadow, when Desperate tries to flee shadow and by chance and cheeky, he is painfully told to leave. When both animals return to their beloved owners, silence reigns until the shadow lags to the horizon to the awe of everyone. There is a fine line between heartwarming and grumpy garbage, but this movie is magical even at the age of 15. This movie might not be Lord of the Rings but for Disney to produce and make such a fantastic movie with animals. As it does at this age, it deserves 10/10.
