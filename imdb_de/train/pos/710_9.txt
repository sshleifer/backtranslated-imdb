Although I disagree with Bob's and Tammy's decision to give birth to Baby Jesse, and that's something I would never do, they tried to do the best for the baby. As this film is written, you will see how you wrap yourself up in history and wonder what you really believe, from all different aspects. Patty Duke? Opponent? For me almost unheard of. But during the movie, she really convinces you that she is psychotic, or at least something serious about her. Her character is the meaning of "emotionally disturbed". The movie seems to end quickly, and things remain unresolved. Apart from that, this movie is really great. It really makes you think. It's not a movie to watch if you just sit back and relax and watch something sweet that makes you laugh. But it's a good movie if you want to challenge your own beliefs, see things from the perspective of others, and learn about yourself. Note: you can even grow if you watch this movie! And it's worth it in the end.
