The rookie made me smile from start to finish. Dennis Quaid played the role perfectly. The little boy who plays his son was fantastic. He made a father-son movie that he can remember. The messages are good. Follow your dreams. Failure in the pursuit is fine as long as you try. The excitement is palpable. I think this movie will be a classic.
