All in all, this movie is not perfect. It does not hang well because the story is basically a bunch of hooks for hanging jokes. <br /> <br /> Some of these jokes are a bit '80s' and tend to date the picture. <br /> <br /> But some of these jokes are classic. <br /> <br /> You know a film has something special when you and your friends refer to stupid quotes from it over two decades later. <br /> <br /> There are also a number of familiar faces. Michael Keaton, Danny Devito, Joe Piscapo, Peter Boyle, Marilu Henner, Maureen Stapleton, Bob Eubanks, Griffin Dunne and one of the final roles of Alan Hale Jr., the skipper of Gilligan's Island. <br /> <br /> There are also some absurd moments, such as when Johnny labels the puppies with a prize award or the pope appears in Johnny's neighborhood. Outstanding is also the scene in which the false priest forms many Latin words. ("Summa cum laude, magna cum laude, the radio is too loud ... Postmeridian, Vormeridian, Onkelmeridian"). Other classic scenes include Ramone Maroney slaughtering the English language Danny Devito, the Griffin urging Dunne to "play ball" Peter Boyle believes he has lost his manhood The fake VD movie This movie is not a home run. But like "Porky's" it has enough classic comedy pieces to make it memorable.
