I have not seen this 1958 movie for a long time and enjoyed Kim Novak as Gil Holroyd, who is a real witch and has an aunt named Queenie Holroyd who is also a witch Jack Lemmon. When Gillian looks at Shep Henderson (James Stewart), who is engaged to a girl, he will marry. Gillian performs some spells with a cat and changes his mind about his intended bride, then becomes very pleasurable and falls in love with Gillian. The story goes that a true witch can not fall in love, blush, or cry, and this turned out to be a big problem between Shep and Gillian, so Nick and Auntie Queenie decided to do something about the situation. Great movie to watch again and again and a great classic movie from 1958.
