A witty Neil Simon comedy that causes laughter from start to finish. The late Walter Matthau is the grumpy ex-comedian who is persuaded to go on stage together with his ex-partner (the late Oscar winner George Burns) for a final reunion show agent and nephew, and they have just as much Chemistry like Matthau and Burns. I love Matthaus grumpy character - he is just as he always is, and yet very different. <br /> <br /> Burns, as the absent old man, is just as funny as Matthau. <BR /> Matthau: Do you want crackers? I have coconut, pineapple and graham. <br /> <br /> Burns: How about a simple cracker? <br /> <br /> Matthau: I'm not clear. I have coconut, pineapple and graham. <br /> <br /> Burns: Okay. <br /> <br /> Matthau: You're in the closet in the kitchen. <br /> <br /> Burns: Maybe later. <br /> <br /> Or how about this: <br /> <br /> Matthau: When I went black, the whites knew what I said! <br /> <br /> You have to watch it in the movie to understand it! All in all a refreshingly funny, sweet, warm, warm, invigorating character comedy with heart and some of the most memorable quotes of all time. <br /> <br /> They just do not do it anymore! At a time when all the latest comedies are raw, youthful, and stupid, it rejects the delicate essence of comedy itself - funny characters, clever and funny dialogues, and great entertainment. <br /> <br /> One of the best buddy comedies of all time, at the top with "planes, trains and automobiles", "Lethal Weapon" and "The Hard Way". <br /> <br /> It can be hard to find this rental or on TV, but trust me, it will be well worth your time! <br /> <br /> 4.5 / 5 stars. <br /> <br /> - John Ulmer
