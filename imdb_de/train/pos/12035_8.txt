I recently stumbled into this movie over TNT in five minutes while vacationing in Florida ... (hey, there must be a break at the hotel, right?) I was initially surprised, Melissa Joan Hart at any length to watch movie about TNT. I mean "Drive Me Crazy" is not that, is it? <br /> <br /> But I stayed with it and was totally surprised and entertained. Melissa plays her role as psychotic Jennifer outstanding. The side cast (Nick, the former boyfriend, Karen, her best friend, and her parents who control life) added credibility to everything. The turn at the end was a nice end to this story of the girl who always seemed to be one step ahead. <br /> <br /> If you have a chance, give it a try! <br /> <br />
