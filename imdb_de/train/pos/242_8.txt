I thought this movie was done very well, Heath Leger was very convincing and his Irish accent was spotless. Orlando Bloom and Naomi Watts were also really good and believable. How true is it for what really happened, I have no idea, but it has shown why people sometimes become what they do. Maybe the authorities were always corrupt and I found it interesting that more than 30,000 people have signed a petition for Ned Kelly that should NOT be hung. Maybe this movie was more truthful than first thought? In many ways, it reminded me of Cold Mountain, another good historical movie. All in all, I can highly recommend this film and am a bit baffled, why it did not go better in the cinemas.
