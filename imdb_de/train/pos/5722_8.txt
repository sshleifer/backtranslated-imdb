That was great. When I first saw the Japanese version, it was probably the scariest movie I've ever seen. It was not blood and courage, it was scary, atmospheric and terrifying. When the mind of the mother in the Japanese version was borrowed over the bed, I almost had a heart attack ... I was worried that the American version would be watered down and that Buffy would take away the dark, spooky nuances of the original version. I should not have worried. The creators of this film wisely provided the same Japanese involved in the original film, and gave the same man the direction of the film. You have it in Japan in the same place in the same house. In fact, the Japanese director tried to make the same film as the original, the only difference being the casting of American actors. This actually became an advantage as it added the item "strangers in a foreign land" to the overall horror. Not only were they persecuted by an absolutely fearsome and ruthless spirit, but they were also stuck in a completely foreign land and had difficulty integrating into society. It just added the general anxiety that was built into the movie, and I thought it was an excellent note. Buffy really does a very good job. She looks vulnerable and can express her fear well. There are none of the clever Aleck utterances that are so common in American horror movies, or one that interferes with the general darkness and horror of the character situation. In fact it was easily as good as The Ring, which I really enjoyed. I hope the future of American horror follows more closely. The Japanese New Wave of horror began with the incredible success of Ringu. We finally get movies that can actually be categorized as "horror" !! 8.10
