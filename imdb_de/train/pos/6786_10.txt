Ronald Colman gives an electrifying performance as Tony John, a Broadway actor who can not distinguish his off-stage life from Shakespeare's Othello, the character he plays on stage ... Two key scenes show Tony's dilemma. The first takes place in the office of producer Max Lasker. Acting is a matter of talent for the practical thinking Lasker. But Donlan, Tony's friend, disagrees: "No, no, if you do as Tony does, it's much more, just like he's every day to become someone else ... so perfect. Do not tell me its the whole system is not affected. ".... The other scene occurs in the apartment of the waitress Pat Kroll. Tony tells her that his name is Martin. She thanks him. Then he says, "Or Paul, Hamlet, Joe, and maybe Othello." ... As Tony Othello starts rehearsing, we learn he's trying to separate his real life from his stage life. "The game begins to seep into your life, and the fight begins, reality against imagination." He can not separate the two: in his head is Pat Desdemona and he is Othello, and he wrongly believes that she has become unfaithful to him , He murdered her ... Colman's bravado in a complex and difficult role earned him the 1947 Oscar for Best Actor. Oscar nominations went to Ruth Gordon and Garson Kanin for Best Original Screenplay. Not to be overlooked is the atmospheric spherical cinematography by Milton Krasner.
