A Damsel in Distress is a delight because of the great Gershwin songs Fred Astaire, Joan Fontaine and a great cast led by Gracie Allen and George Burns. A typically silly act for an Astaire movie has him as an American dance star in England with Burns as a publicist and Allen as a secretary. They tell a story that he is a love mistake in which women fall victim to him left and right. He meets Fontaine, who is imprisoned in her castle by a domineering aunt and a docile father. Stupid act. <br /> <br /> Great songs include a foggy day, things are looking up, nice work if you can get it, and I can not bother now. Fontaine does not sing, but makes a short (and decent) number with Astaire. Surprisingly good at a few dance numbers at Astaire are Burns and Allen, including a fun and imaginative amusement park game. <br /> <br /> Also in the cast are Reginald Gardiner, Constance Collier, Montagu Love, Harry Watson (as Albert), Ray Noble and my favorite - Jan Duggan as Lead Madrigal Singer. <br /> <br /> Jan Duggan is in the middle of the swoony trio singing Nice Work, if you can get it. Her facial expressions are funny. She was also a scene stealer at W.C. Fields comedy, The Old Fashioned Way, plays Cleopatra Pepperday. <br /> <br /> Much abuse has been accumulated due to the lack of Ginger Rogers on this film, which, as mentioned elsewhere, would have been terrible missteps. The TCM host notes that Ruby Keeler and Jessie Matthews were considered. Yikes Two more disasters. Fontaine is doing well as Alyce and the dynamics allow the musical numbers to belong to Astaire, with plenty of comic reliefs by Burns and Allen. <br /> <br /> Fun movie, great songs, good cast and Jan Duggan in the rare spotlight!
