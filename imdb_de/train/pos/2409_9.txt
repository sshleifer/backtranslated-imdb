This film has problems in its presentation, may even be offensive to people looking for temporal and cultural loyalty, but encourages viewers to think about a variety of topics. One of them is the nature and character of the relationship between Jesus and Judas. Another is the historical character of the Bible and the faith. And thirdly, humanity is Jesus. The tension of the Christ-traitor relationship is developed and maintained through the film. Judas passion is a dark parallel to that of Christ. When Judas takes his life, the viewer feels the fear. Peter's denial and guilt, as moving as they are, are not as strongly portrayed as the Judas drama. Chris Sarandon offers a novel and provocative Christ, believable or not. I would like to find this movie on DVD or even VHS for use in study or discussion groups.
