I saw this movie for the first time when I was a freshman in high school, and the film has been with me over the years. It's not about the soundtrack or the cinematography or even the dialogue and a little bad action, it's about the educational purpose and the underlying message is the most important. It's not a sin to have a child when you're a teenager and you're still in high school, and it's not a bad thing, but it's a problem. Tons of girls I knew now have all the kids, and I guess they never saw this great movie, and if they did, they obviously did not get the message behind it. It's about taking no risk in a sexual relationship. Every girl can get pregnant the first time. It is not a myth. You do not necessarily lose your dreams, but you have to sit back in your future because you have a child that you need to think about first. <br /> <br /> Behind this film is a clear message: JUST NO SAY!
