Convincing and innovative! At the beginning of this criminally undervalued Whoopi Goldberg strip, the authors draw a parallel between Theodore Rex and the 1941 Orson Welles classic "Citizen Kane". The authors are justifiably entitled to draw a seemingly inconsistent parallel, but the public is too often cheated with the overly-hyped Hollywood punch to recognize the subtle similarities between these two films. In "Citizen Kane" Charles Foster Kane is feared and admired by his colleagues and subordinates, much like Whoopi Goldberg in this film. This movie is about finding love in all differences. It is an epic exploration of the fear of abandonment and the need for love and acceptance in a society ruled by greed and selfishness. Who brought Whoopi Goldberg and Theodore Rex together formulated a dyad for eternity, and the only justifications to justify were Bogey and Bacall, Hepburn and Tracy, and Hall and Oates. If you would like to see an uplifting, celluloidal philosophical study of some of the deepest drives of humanity; Bergman-esqe but not so depressing, Theodore Rex should be viewed immediately!
