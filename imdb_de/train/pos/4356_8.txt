"The Thing About My Folks" came as a surprise. We had no idea what to expect. The film by Raymond DeFelitta, based on a play by one of his stars, Paul Reiser, turned out to be a pleasant time in the cinema. Although the film is predictable and we know what the result will be, this is a journey of discovery where Ben may meet his father for the first time in his life. Ben sees his father as what he really is and not the one mythical figure he has in mind. <br /> <br /> The film seems to be a vehicle for its star Peter Falk, and he runs away with the movie as it was expected. Mr. Falk, one of the loveliest actors to have worked on films in this epoch and the past few years, is an actor of such size he can count on. As Sam Kleinman, the distant father of Ben, he is a man who is clearly misunderstood, not only by Ben, but by the whole family and his wife, who is forty-seven years old. When Muriel The matriarch of the Kleinman clan runs away, everyone panics because this woman, who was the strong personality of the family, is vital to keeping everyone together. Without knowing where she went, Sam appears confused in Ben's house when he suddenly feels abandoned by the woman he's married and has been faithful for all these years. Ben, the youngest son, takes it with his father looking for a house he wants to buy so that he can bring his own family from Manhattan into the country. The journey is the excuse for Ben to ally with his father in a way he never knew the old man had always shown his younger son a detached figure. Along the way, father and son realize how much they love each other and how the old man was misunderstood by his children. The love of Sam to Muriel covers the many years in which they have met. They seem inseparable. <br /> <br /> Peter Falk is great in the movie. He is an excellent Sam Kleinman, the man who suddenly realizes that his life will change for the worst. Mr. Falk shines as an older man and there is never one wrong move in his interpretation of the man whose whole world collapses under him. <br /> <br /> Since we are not a fan of Paul Reiser, we have to admit that as Ben Kleinman, he is right. Ben and his dad discover how much they both have in common, and their love for Muriel, the mother who sacrificed her life to keep the family together. Olympia Dukakis can only be seen at the end of the film. She makes a good contribution as a fleeing mother. Elizabeth Perkins plays Rachel on a grand scale. <br /> <br /> Thanks to the cinematography of Dan Gillham and the outstanding score by Steven Argila, the film looks beautiful. Ultimately, the film shows a great team effort between its director, DeFelitta, and Paul Reiser, who wrote it for the screen. <br /> <br /> Although this film is clearly intended for an older audience, it should appeal to everyone.
