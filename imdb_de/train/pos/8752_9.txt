I've been waiting for such an original picture like this for a long time. Brokedown Palace has this "hard to believe" aspect, but with the ingenious direction and script. Palace scores big. <br /> <br /> I did not really like Claire Danes in any of her films, but I tell you something, she changed my mind with this movie. Kate Beckinsale goes on a holiday with Danes in Thailand, where they meet a young man who persuades her to travel to Hong Kong. He failed, however, to tell them that they would carry an obscene amount of narcotic drugs for him. Well, eventually they get caught and end up in a Thai jail. I know, I know, how could you not know that you have 18 pounds of drugs? Well, if you can get out through this one tiny miscue, you will find a very well-written and well-played story. Lately, I've got drawn into the stories of the movies I see, developing a personal feel for the characters I see. This movie is no different. At the end of the film, I cared more about her than about the other characters in the film. <br /> <br /> Bill Pullman plays Hank Green, a lawyer based in Thailand specializing in international relations. As always, Pullman delivers with great performance and beautifully combines the movie. <br /> <br /> There are a few twists that will make you cry at the end of the movie. This is one of the movies you most likely walked past when looking for the movie you can watch at home. I'm of the opinion that the next time in the video library will not come by this again.
