Hidden Frontier is the longest-starred Internet Star Trek fan series. While production quality is not comparable to fan productions such as Starship Exeter or New Voyages, Hidden Frontier focuses largely on the story, and in that regard, it's really very good sets; Instead, actors are filmed on a green screen and the backgrounds are inserted digitally. One of Hidden Frontier's biggest achievements is the enormous amount of work they have done. One way to accomplish this is to insert the virtual sets at the time of filming rather than post production. While this saves a lot of time, it is also worth noting that the quality of the resulting footage is not as high as if it had been produced in post-production, though it still serves its purpose. <br /> <br /> Even if it's not for everyone, Hidden Frontier is worth a try, even though you might be best at starting season three, as the producers really start to meet them.
