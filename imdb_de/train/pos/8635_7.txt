"California" is a good Hollywood odyssey of suspense and terror told by two couples traveling across California to California to share the cost of gasoline: a pair of losers (Lewis & Pitt) and two would-be artists , a photographer and an author (Duchovny & Forbes). Pitt "nails" his character, who stands at the center of this somewhat predictable thriller. A good watch for those who go into the Psycho Killer Flix.
