A good picture is worth all words. This film has the most poetic scene ever dreamed of by people with Down syndrome. And I will not ruin it by telling you. They want to see it for themselves. <br /> <br /> Pasqual Duquenne is an amazing actor. I did not need to understand a single word he said to understand its meaning. <br /> <br /> The film has its own magic. After watching, I understood better that we put too much emphasis on performance and not enough on the people we love. Passion and simplicity are everything we need.
