This film is a great attempt to revive traditional Indian values ​​replaced by Western ones. His shared family history shows the ethics that every person should follow while communicating with each individual. Desi ties in with Amrita Rao, who is also very desi, and she looks pretty good too ... The genre of the film is the same as HAHK and Such films deserve to be made in India for the revival of old traditional values. The movies do not get 10 because they are not very good in the music, which is very important in any movie, apart from that it is flawless.
