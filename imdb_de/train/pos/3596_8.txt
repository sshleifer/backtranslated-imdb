I finally sat down and watched this movie all the way through and I have to say I was very impressed. Michelle Rodriguez is probably one of my new favorite actresses - it's not just the fact that she * can * act *, but she chooses the roles that suit her best and are more meaningful and important than it seems at first glance , I've read some of the comments that make it easier to say that this was not a dreadful feminist thing as they had thought before, but I definitely do not agree with that. Diana is a feminist. She follows her dreams and believes in herself, contrary to what virtually everyone around her thinks (with the exception of her caring brother Tiny and her coach and manager Hector, who turns out to be more of a father figure than her real parents) "Feminism" is all about. It's nice to see that films like this show the true side of feminism - that they're not a lot of losers - but that they have dreams and can do anything. Diana is faithful while still falling prey to love, and she and Adrian have a more realistic, complicated relationship than something that works magically. Girlfight is a true taste of reality and gives my idea of ​​people faith again. Thanks, Michelle. <br /> <br /> 8/10 - A very important film that is close not only to young women, but to everyone who wants to progress in their lives.
