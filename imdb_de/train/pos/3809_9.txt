Did you hear the story of the reluctant heroes hired by a king to kill a dragon? Oh, do you have? Was it in a world made up entirely of small islands that floated above clouds, and did the heroes have to make dangerous jumps from one island to another on their journey? Did water flow up and float remnants of big cities on the horizon? I did not think so. <br /> <br /> I happened to come across this movie and I am really glad that I did that! It's one of the most beautiful movies I've ever seen. Similar to the Pixar films, this is a computer animation object that is only possible in today's world. The animators have reflected on almost everything that appears on screen, and this attention to detail is stunning (the scene in which the mushrooms in the foreground are smoking green while the characters in the background go unnoticed is one of my favorites). The monsters are also fully realized and wonderful to see in action. <br /> <br /> Even though the plot is not necessarily unique, the movie has enough charm to make sure you continue to watch. Our protagonists are personable and interesting, ensuring that the audience is behind their almost impossible goal of reaching the end of the world and destroying the dragon that could otherwise devour everything on its way. Of course, Hector is the character that most fall in love with. Hector is a small blue creature with a crazy grin and a tendency to speak a mixture of nonsense and English. Hector offers comedy relief in a way that Jar Jar Binks could only dream of. Watch the dragon hunters, if you have the chance. Watch the incredible animation, breathtaking combat scenes, and a glimpse into a world different from anything you've seen on a movie or TV screen. At least, it's a fun way to spend an hour and a half - whether you're nine or twenty-nine (which I'm actually)!
