Although I did not like Stanley & Iris as a movie, I admired the acting. Jane Fonda and Robert De Niro are great in this movie. I have not always been a fan of Fonda's work, but here she is both tender and strong. De Niro is able to transform every role he represents into the action of gold. He does a great job in this movie and there is a great scene where he has to take his father to a home for the elderly because he can not take care of him anymore, which breaks your heart. I would not really recommend this movie as great cinematic entertainment, but I'll say that you will not see much anywhere.
