Six degrees had made me addicted. I was looking forward to it and was totally disappointed when Men in Trees replaced his time. I thought it was just a break and would be back in early 2007. What happened? All my friends were really surprised that it ended. We could relate to the characters who had real problems. We talked about each episode and had our favorite characters. There was no one on the show I did not like and the acting was great. I always like programs in cities where you can identify the local areas. I would like to protest against the cancellation of this show and ask you to bring her back and give her another chance. Give it a good time frame, do not constantly postpone it from that day to that day and make it known so people know it's on.
