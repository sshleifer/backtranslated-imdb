For those who commented on the patriot as accurate (which essentially satanized the English), it was interesting to see this movie. By all accounts, this was the bloodiest war the Americans ever participated in, and they were the only nationality present. It was refreshing, therefore, to see something that resembled the historical accuracy of this side of the Atlantic and that neither portrayed America as a martyr nor as a savior. All in all, what brought this movie home was the real terror of a conflict, and whatever, whatever happens in the war, only leads to worse deeds that often culminate in the suffering of the innocent. This was not a movie in which you hailed someone, but were both compassionate and loathed.
