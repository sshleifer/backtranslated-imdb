One of several musicals about sailors on vacation, it's the usual sailor meets girl, complications arise, cheerful sort of conspiracy. It runs smoothly enough, but also pulls in places. The dialogue is not as zippy as 'Top Hat' and Randolph Scott seems out of place. <br /> <br /> There are compensations. There are some of Irving Berlin's best songs, including "Let Yourself Go," "I'll put all my balls in a basket" and "Let's Face the Music and Dance." There are Fred and Ginger, who bring every film to heavenly heights while dancing and will not be disappointed here. They make a snappy tap dance, a hard-hitting comic dance and a swirling graceful dance, all in the same movie! Great versatility and artistry. <br /> <br /> It also has Harriet Hilliard, who is pretty good in her role. She had a varied career and became the most famous Harriet Nelson with Ozzie. Here she touches without being sentimental. Two songs are delivered simply and effectively. It makes a good contrast to Ginger, but you can believe that they are sisters in the movie. <br /> <br /> More streamlining has made the movie even better. Pretty good.
