A bizarre horror movie full of famous faces, but stolen by Cristina Raines (later of TVs "Flamingo Road") as a pretty, but somewhat unstable model with a rubbery smile, which is supposed to pay for the suicide attempt by the gate to hell! The scenes with Raines Modeling are very well captured, the mood music is perfect, Deborah Raffin is charming as Cristina's friend, but when Raines moves into a spooky Brooklyn Heights brownstone (inhabited by a blind priest on the top floor) things really start to cook . The neighbors, including a fantastically evil Burgess Meredith and the kinky couple Sylvia Miles & Beverly D'Angelo, are a hell of a lot, and Eli Wallach is a smart police officer. The film is almost a cross-pollination of "Rosemary's Baby" and "The Exorcist" - but what a combination! Based on Jeffrey Konvitz's bestseller, "The Sentinel" is entertainingly eerie, full of shocks produced by director Michael Winner, who finishes a thoughtful downbeat with great skill. *** 1/2 of ****
