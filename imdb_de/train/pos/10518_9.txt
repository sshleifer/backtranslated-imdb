Emma is a delicious confection, which is delighted for a fantastic getaway. Emma (Gwyneth Paltrow) is a graceful, intelligent young woman who has just married her governess - and a confidante - to a marriage that recognizes Emma in matchmaking. She strives to use her talent in organizing things for the people around her and decides to compare Vicar Mr. Elton (Alan Cummings) with her handsome young friend Harriet (Toni Collette). <br /> <br /> The result is a series of mixed signals and misinterpretations that eventually self-assemble, but Emma learns that she did not have as much control over the events as she thought. <br /> <br /> The movie is full of Jane Austen's wit and dry characterizations. Gwyneth Paltrow is at her best and portrays this girl from a reserved, polite society with wit and ease. Her growing romance with the incomparable Mr. Knightley (Jeremy Northam) is at the heart of this film. Mr. Knightley is one of the biggest romantic lead actors in movies. He is incredibly pretty, in a modest, relaxed and irresistible way. He's certainly fine with Gwyneth Paltrow. Her charming friendship, which began at the age of 16 and she was a child, blossomed when he, a friendly family friend, grew up with her in an older fraternal fashion that became something more. With a funny look or a discreet jab at Emma, ​​Northamts Knightley is a real pleasure. <br /> <br /> Another wonderful characterization is the comic Juliet Stevenson, Greta Scacchi, Ewan McGregor, Polly Walker and the talkative spinner Miss Bates, who is very funny. <br /> <br /> Emma looks shorter and more fluid than most of Jane Austin's adaptations, and has a comic that promises real enjoyment.
