This wonderfully clumsy melodrama represents Douglas Sirk in his highest cast. She renounces the gentle melancholy of "All That Heaven Allows" and the whiny sentimentality of "Imitation of Life" and instead relies on feverish anxiety and overheated tension. And of course it's all captured in vivid Technicolor. <br /> <br /> The history of the Cornball has something to do with a friendship between Rock Hudson and Robert Stack that becomes a rivalry when Hudson grabs the feelings of Lauren Bacall, but who is that? really pay attention to the story? Dorothy Malone won the Best Supporting Actress Academy Award for her stellar performance as a stack sister who takes the family business into her own hands when no one else wants. A highlight of the film is when this wild child breaks into a hectic dance in his bedroom that can not stand the shackles of bourgeois obsession. As so often in Sirk films, the scene is unintentionally funny in its absurdity and yet strange in its effectiveness. <br /> <br /> Sirk came closer than anyone else to turn pure camp into high art and satisfy the Philistines and the high brows at the same time in the same movies. His talent was a unique talent and I do not know that there was ever another filmmaker who has since been quite similar to him. <br /> <br /> Note: A-
