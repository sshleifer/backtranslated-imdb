When the plague breaks out in New Orleans, Richard Widmark helps in "Panic in the Streets", one of the less acclaimed films of the great Elia Kazan. Kazan keeps the pace lively, and there are many wonderful touches - the scenes between Widmark and Barbara Bel Geddes, who play his wife, and the scene in the police station show family life and working life and the relationships of the average citizen. A sharp contrast to the lives and Relationships of the low lifes, represented by a menacing Jack Palance, his weak yes man, Zero Mostel, Tommy Cook and Louis Charles. There are also some interesting visuals - Palance has a few scenes with actors who seem to be on their knees at height. <br /> <br /> The spectacle is wonderful and the dialogue is sharp, if the story does not stop completely on the direction and the performances. There are some questionable aspects that the viewer can easily recognize. Apart from that, it is worth taking a look. Kazan was a masterful director.
