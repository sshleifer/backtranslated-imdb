For all the haters out there: Condemning a TV series with an episode is like judging an entire book after reading the first few pages. That being said, I was a big fan of BSG and thought it was one of the best TV dramas (not just sci-fi) in the air. But it was time for her to finish and continue the story. I liked the BSG epilogue "The Plan", but he has raised so many new questions as he answered. Therefore, I eagerly awaited "Caprica" ​​and was not disappointed. I was hoping that I would not try. Be another BSG, and I was glad that "Caprica" ​​is something else, and I found the story exciting in a different way than exciting space battles, explosions and Sci-Fi special effects (do not get me wrong, I like the stuff too). Eric Stolz and Esai Morales give solid performances, and Alessandra was just wonderful. I can not wait until next week.
