I can not less agree with the rating given to this film, and I believe that this is an example of just how close most viewers are around the world. Really ... Do you forget that cinema used to be some kind of art before some tycoons tried to make it just for entertainment? This movie is not entertainment. At least not so easy if you get movies like Titanic or Gladiator. It has style, it's different, it's shocking ... That's why most of you hated it so much because it's not trying to please you. It's just a story, a very strange, I admit, but after all, just a strange story. It's not a great story, not even a great movie, but I think it's worth a 7-star rating if both the author and the director have the guts to make a story that the audience does not like and thus Billions of copies are sold and make the big studios even richer. For me, this film is a European-artistic film shot in the US, and everyone involved is worthy of respect. Be it for the courage or for the unique sense of humor.
