Although Lang's version is more famous, Borzage's work is not of interest, far from it: his "heavenly sequences" are even better. The metaphor of the train (borrowed perhaps from the end of Abel Gance's "la roue") is ultimately more compelling than the heavenly world above. <br/> <br/> Borzage's tenderness for his characters shows in Marie's character and love outside the grave is one of his favorite subjects (the ending of "Three Mates"). The Pleasure Park seems to be everywhere: we even see it when we are in Marie's poor house. I do not think the sets are so cheesy they are stylized to a mistake. From afar, the fair gives you a sci-fi feeling. The movie. <br /> <br /> Borzage never forgets his social worries: in the celestial procession the rich can not be confused with the riff-raff, but as the "magistrate" says, "There is no difference here". <br /> <br /> No major work for Borzage (not even Lang's version), but to find out if you're interested in the career of the great director.
