Fast, funny, sexy and spectacular. Cagney is always great. Blondel charms you with her wit and her energy. It is obvious that this is a censorship film that depicts the scriptural allusions, the costumes, and the way they touch. And bikinis, before there were bikinis! This is not fun for everyone. However, I do not understand the problem of John Garfield. Is it important if he is in this movie or not? If so, the screen is so short that it is basically a prop. You have to see him picture by picture to find him when he's there. I'm a big Cagney fan, but I've never seen it before. I found it at Turner Classics. I found it by a wonderful coincidence. Sit back and enjoy the ride!
