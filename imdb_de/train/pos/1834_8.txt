This movie is very touching. I do not care what people say about this movie, this is a very good movie. The performances of Amitabh Bachchan's dying father's role are great because he wants to teach his son how to handle life in case something happens to him and that Akshay Kumer was great in his role as spoiled Aditya Thakur. The supporting role of Shefali Shetty, who played the role of Sumitra Thakur, was great. Priyanka Chopra was good at her little role she had in the movie. Ragpal Yadav as the brain-dead servant and Boman Irani as father-in-law have a very good connection and the comedy scene was hilarious. The direction is very good.
