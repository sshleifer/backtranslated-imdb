CAT SOUP has two kittens of the "Hello Kitty" type, embarking on a bizarre journey through the hereafter where anything can happen. These Asian Mind Trip shorts do not use dialogue, replacing word balloons instead. There is no way to describe this denied caricature, unless you should see it for yourself. Make sure that no one under 10 is in the room. Dismemberment and cannibalism and cruelty and cruelty, as well as sudden death and callous disregard of others are common themes. Honestly. Perhaps the most memorable image is that of an elephant made of water, through which the kittens swim and ride. But like almost everything else in this movie, this stupid, picaresque interlude soon ends in a terrible end.
