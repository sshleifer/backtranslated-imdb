The first time I had the opportunity to see this as a forgotten classic was in the beginning of the eighties in one of our art houses as a rebirth. When I dreamed this fever of an exercise in the sexuality of the thirties, I thought of YOWZA! They got away with murder in Europe at that time. Unfortunately, this movie was heavily edited in its original US release by the Hayes blue-nosed office (the government's coveted government department, the "holier than you" bible killer, Will Hayes ... a former postal official, if possible, it was believed that) because of its general theme of human sexuality (the sky forbade people to actually have sex in the 1930s). The plot of ecstasy concerns a young woman (played by Hedy Lamarr) who marries a much older man and later regrets it. She (Lamarr) meets a handsome younger man and has an affair with him, leading to a divorce from her former husband (another no-no in Hollywood movies at the time - divorce!). Despite the fact that the film was produced in 1933, it probably worked for the first time in sound format (ie The film seems to have techniques that were mainly used in silent films - ie in Expressionism of the 1920s). It is still worth looking for windows for early European conversation pictures, together with Luis Bunuel's L'Age Dor (1930) and Karl Gustav Dryer's "Vampyre" (1931). Not rated, however, does contain this infamous naked bathing scene and some faintly veiled sexual references that would be a bit more of a PG-13 by today's standards (but would easily have landed the dreaded "X" in the 1930s if it existed)
