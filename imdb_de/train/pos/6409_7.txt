I had heard nothing from Brashear before I saw that. This is the story of him and the man who trained him to help him become the first African-American US Navy diver. A story of willpower. The plot is well written and develops consistently well. This is, it seems, the typical underdog thing, and it does not hold too many surprises in store. It's all Hollywood too, but hey, I do not know the man, maybe it's almost as if it happened. Still, the work is done with dramatic scenes and adversities, and that's inspiring for anyone who has ever spoken the words "no, you can not" about their lifelong dream. The acting performances are all excellent. DeNiro and Gooding Jr. both light up on the screen. Rapaport is also wonderful. The characters are well written, credible and consistent. This is well edited and offers good cinematography. The production values ​​are high and this brings us pretty convincingly into the 50s. This is the only movie I have seen of this director and the author, even though I am now considering whether he will find out more for her. There is a moderate amount of strong language, otherwise no insulting material. I recommend it to anyone who finds the topic interesting, and / or fans of those who did it. 10.7
