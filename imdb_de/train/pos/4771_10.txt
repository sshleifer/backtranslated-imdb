The culmination of two brilliant careers. David Lynch, better known for less accessible material, tells a filigree and exquisite story about the most unlikely conditions. A man travels to his estranged brother. Since he has no other means of transport, his journey on a lawnmower takes over six weeks. Richard Farnsworth delivers an astonishingly complex and differentiated performance in his latest film in the title role. Straight Story is a classic cinematic experience that is extremely enjoyable in its enjoyment of little things and should not be missed. Sissy Spacek is a notable daughter of Farnsworth, a middle-aged disabled woman living with the loss of her children.
