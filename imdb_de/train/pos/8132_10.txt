I can not remember the first time I heard about this movie, but I rented it about six years ago, and it's still one of my favorite comedies. I admit, you'll probably despise this movie if you do not know about rap music. But if you're a rap fan, even an occasional one, you'll love the insider jokes and clues. In one of the best lines of the film is about the difference between a b **** and a h **; I still use that line today and laugh a lot about it. One of the best performances comes from Larry Scott, who played Nerd Lamar in "Revenge of the Nerds". It's unfortunate that this movie is unlikely to ever get a DVD release.
