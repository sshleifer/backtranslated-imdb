But the rest of us, who love a good sentimental and emotional story, is a barrier that makes you cry. <br /> <br /> Tom Hulce is great as Dominick, a mentally slow trashman who loves professional wrestling and his brother Eugene, played by Ray Liotta, a doctor who works for a long time. <br /> <br /> Due to Eugene's work schedule, Dominick is left alone for a long time and tends to make questionable judgments. He really just wants to be a good boy, do the right thing and make his brother proud of him. He stops in the church to pray in one place and expresses his feelings so openly and so well that the character makes you cry before the damn movie even starts. <br /> <br /> I will not give anything away here, but the movie is extremely stressful, sad and heartbreaking. Those who are not afraid of these things will have a field day with this beautiful story, their lovely characters, and a great song that I can not quote here. This has nothing to do with the film, but it is strangely appropriate. <br /> <br /> I thought Tom Hulce would be nominated for this film because he was for 'Amadeus'. I figured that could give him the right way to actually win. No such luck. Liotta is just as good, but less emotional, but later. All I can say about Jamie Lee Curtis is that she does not play a big role here, but it was nice of her, a small drama set in Pittsburgh about two brothers you'll never forget to give their name.
