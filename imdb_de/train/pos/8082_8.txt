It has been some time since I looked at the LOTR. I am currently looking for a copy that I would like to buy. Bakshi's work corresponds to the original work. The visuals are serious and sometimes insistent. <br /> <br /> Disadvantages? Occasionally the film is confusing or confused. There are one or two times when the action slows to a crawl. But overall - buy this movie. It's great for kids, adults and collectors.
