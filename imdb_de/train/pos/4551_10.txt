I had never seen such an incredible acting job in a movie when I saw Daniel Day-Lewis playing Christy Brown in My Left Foot. Actually, his role was not even over. He played the role of Christy Brown, or at least was hampered during filming of the film and had to undergo surgery for the damage his superior acting had done to his back. It's remarkable to me, and with all the pain he has taken on this role, I think it's true that he's done the most Oscar-worthy thing in history. He was so masterful in this hard part that I believe that no one could have done it better or with more impact than he did. Although I can not say that this is the best movie of all time, I can say that it is undoubtedly the biggest feet I have ever seen, playing this impossible role, and then playing until he does not even play anymore , Probably a man for that matter.
