updated January 1, 2006 <br /> <br /> Parsifal is one of my two favorite Wagner operas or music dramas, to be more specific (Meistersinger is the other.), though it's hard to imagine it as " the libretto of the composer is, as usual, a jumble of religion, paganism, eroticism, and possibly even homo-eroticism, and its length may make it appear dry to the audience. <br /> <br /> Wagner As a famous anti-Semite (Klingsor could be one of his Jewish deputies.), of course he broadcast the premiere to a non-converted (not because of RW's attempt!) Hermann Levi, who was his favorite conductor! (Go to the character!) Kundry , a highly mixed and likely Jewish surrogate, is both vicious and benevolent depending on the scene. <br /> <br /> Considering that many video versions of Parsifal seem to be on the cleavage whose side, this film of opera is a breath of fresh air. The director Hans-Jürgen Syberberg has brought a lot of imagination, but it's hard to know why he made some of his decisions. For example: the notorious double parsifals (of each gender!), The dolls, the Wagner mask mask and various dolls and symbols such as the Nazi swastika in one of the travel scenes. (If I remember, the "real" Engelbert Humperdinck wrote the actual music to refresh the scene change.) Although Wagner himself died too early to be a true Nazi, many of his descendants (as well as his second wife Cosima.) were at least fellow travelers, including her grandson Wolfgang Wagner, who leads the Bayreuth Festival still in old age. Wolfgang Wolf's son Gottfried Wagner, in complete opposition to his father, has tried to be honest with his great-grandfather. Syberberg also seems to be politically ambiguous from what I have read. In 1977 he made a well-known film about Hitler: "Hitler: a film from Germany". Since it takes 8 hours and is not widely used, most people have not seen it (including myself). <br /> <br /> Armin Jordan, the conductor of the audio CD on which this film is based, plays Amfortas (sung by Wolfgang Schöne) Edith Clever (Yvonne Minton) plays Kundry, Michael Kutter and Karin Krick the double parsifals ( Both sung by Reiner Goldberg. Robert Lloyd and Aage Haugland play and sing Gurnemanz and Klingsor. <br /> <br /> Although the opera takes place over a long period of time and all (with the exception of Kundry?) have aged considerably between acts 2 and 3, at the end of the day nobody sees the opera one day older. (The magic of the Grail?) In this opera, the Grail is the goblet from which Jesus drank at the Last Supper, and not Mary Magdalene as in recent times, an idea I find absurd!). <br /> <br /> The conducting and singing are quite useful and the DVD seems to have greatly improved the sound, if not the picture. (Yes, I agree that "Knas"'s approach is superior even in the second stereo version, but it's probably superior to all recorded versions altogether.) No Parsifal for any Wagnerite, but I think so It works well as a filmed opera.
