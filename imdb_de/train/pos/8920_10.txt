Steve McQueen was unaware of me in 1958. All I knew was that I was very scared to see this movie. (The movie "Trantula" had been devastated at the age of seven ... but I was now ten years old). The first scene, when the blob crawls up the farmer's probing stick and devours his hand, was enough to leave the theater. But I stayed and suffered from every attack of our monster. I was so horrified when Steve and his girl barely managed to leave the doctor's office (poor doctor), and more when The Blob entered a movie theater and devoured a large section of the audience. , , So many, in fact, that the ITooo pulled out of the front doors, too big to fit through just one. It seemed indestructible and unlimited in terms of growth potential, and when it caught poor Steve in a sieve-like diner, it seemed a safe dinner. <br /> <br /> To say the blob was cold would be a modern description, but in the end better icy than frightening and mentally-minded little kids. <br /> <br /> I remember going home evening with my uncle Nick trying to be brave. He knew I was in trouble, and when I went to bed that night, not only did I feel the blob in the room, but when I got the courage to look down at the floor, there was the red-hearted, hungry hungry guy I waited for me to try to get up and go to the bathroom. It took months to recover. <br /> <br /> I am now 57 years old. , , I did it. <br /> <br /> Of course, The Blob was not destroyed.
