Not to be confused with the British black comedy of the same name, which came out in 1994. But this Shallow Grave is a worthy addition to the hillbilly of the 80s. <br /> <br /> The plot is made up of = 4 female college girls The monastery is planning the spring break of a life in Florida, but the plans are put on hold when one of them witnesses a man murdering a local woman and when he realizes he's been seen, let's just say it's getting deadly The game of cat and mouse and things gets worse when it turns out he's the local sheriff. <br /> <br /> Shallow Grave is, in my opinion, one of the more enjoyable slashers that hit the market in the '80s, especially in the late 1980s, when the Slashers went downhill a bit, this was one of the few who did not, and this movie should be better known, too bad it is not. This is a movie that confuses stereotypes (just try to guess who the last girl is going to be - I totally misunderstand it). The main characters are all sympathetic and it is one of those films that is hoped to get them all off, which of course they do not. This paired with the fluffy first half-hour glasses of the movie (in a good way) with some flashes of real wickedness (the second murder is a real jolt) and some unexpected sloppiness (though this is not high budget thriller I had the topless scene in which a woman is strangled with her own bra (accompanied by a hysterical religious radio show), in a movie from the late '80s not expected. <br /> <br /> There are one or two bad things about this movie, well yes, not bad, only slightly, such as the negotiation with the two teenagers who go nowhere, and the stupid end and inability of the deputy to follow the logic In SHALLOW GRAVE there are no sharp tools, but in my opinion it is A Slasher Blow Through The scenes where the girls are being chased through the forest by the malevolent sheriff are tense and exciting. <br /> <br /> All in all a very entertaining and rewarding slasher with great performances from all four main girls and this psycho sheriff.
