I have seen a lot of Disney movies in my life, although absolutely none of them are in any way consistent with bedknobs and broomsticks. Although I personally did not have any animated live action, it was an improvement when I tried to disguise people as animated characters. The film consists of three World War II evacuees who are to be sent to a quiet and socially awkward woman in the country. I have to say that the casting was brilliant. Angela Landsbury made a perfect Miss Price while David Thomilson made a big desperate entertainer love interest. Endings always surprise me and that was no exception. It was neither happy nor sad, although I do not know if that was intended. The dialogue was not great, but considering that it's a children's movie, that's fine. Overall, I would give the performance nine out of ten, the dialogue six out of ten, the casting nine out of ten and the costumes eight out of ten.
