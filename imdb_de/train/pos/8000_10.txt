... do not read action summaries, because the action in words can seem banal, brain-dead and meaningless. The movie is excellent, the acting of both Denzel and Dakota (she'll go sky-high, trust me) is just fantastic and the action is mind-blowing. Actually, "fabulous" is a small word for such talented actors. The movie is based on actual facts only and some characters are not fictional, which sums up the shock I had during and after the movie. If you like both actors and some confused movies, you have not seen your favorite movie yet ... trust me, in the end you'll have a funny and inexplicable feeling. The movie is great, see it, rent it, buy it or whatever ... just do not miss it
