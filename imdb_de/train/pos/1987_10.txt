This movie was great! I can not overcome the songs. I think I'm a bit too old for musicals, but this movie deserves a lot of recognition, guys! My favorite was Jack Wild. I am a British actor, and you can not keep me from all the young men with fresh faces. I never knew that when Jack made this movie, he was sixteen! He looks like an eleven-year-old. He is short, that helps. Try uploading your answers, other posters, so I can share your experience. Oh, and about Oliver Reed, guy Bill Sikes, I think the drone look is really familiar. Do you already have an idea where he played before? If so, post it, I really would like to know.
