I always like to watch films that make you think, not just deliver the answers to the audience. "Revolver" is one of those films, and although many critics have stated that it is difficult to follow with some concentration and open-mindedness, I have understood it. First time. While not comparable to other thinkers such as The Usual Suspects or Memento, it is in itself an intelligent and thought provoking film. <br /> <br /> Another thing I really liked about this movie is how damn handsome it is. Every scene, every camera angle seems to have been thought for ages. If you see it, you will know what I mean. <br /> <br /> So, in the end ... look at it and enjoy it. If not, well, nobody said "revolver" is something for everyone. And these are my 2 cents.
