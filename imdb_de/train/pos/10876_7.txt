I was really excited to see this movie. I thought Australia had finally made a good movie ... but I was wrong. <br /> <br /> This was the most pathetic attempt of a Slasher movie ever. I am sorry that Molly Ringwald has come all the way to Australia to make a horrible movie. <br /> <br /> The acting was awful (especially the Australian guy trying to speak American accent) and the plot was pretty bad too. <br /> <br /> When I first heard this movie came out, I thought the title was pathetic (because it sounds like the cheesy movie "rod" in Scream 2), but I was ready to to let it slip, if it was a good movie. <br /> <br /> Attention! IMPORTANT SPOILER !!! <br /> <br /> Probably the worst thing about the movie was the end. I expected a big surprise who the killer was ... but the killer was not even human ... which made this realistic Slasher movie a terrible horror movie. <br /> <br /> Do not see this movie. You will probably be disappointed!
