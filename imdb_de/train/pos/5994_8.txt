I had the pleasure to see the short film "The Cure" by first director Ryan Jafri. What really impresses me is the camera work and the music. <br /> <br /> I think a lot of young filmmakers (since I'm one of them myself) would have a difficult time with cinematography when they're just starting to make an indie. We see that the output is not exactly what we have pictured or under our ambitions. This film, directorial debut of a young director, went very well on the screen. The camera movement, color, lighting and compositing all contribute to the story and emotion of the film. <br /> <br /> Music as a key element of film language also helps a lot. <br /> <br /> It's hard to briefly describe the heart of a woman, her desire, her fear of everything. Still, I have to admit that I'm not a fan of V / O (narration), especially if the film is brought forward through narration rather than shots and cuts. My personal feeling for a part of the narrative part is, I think the narrator tried a little too hard. So the energy pushes the audience away from the emotions of the movie. All in all, it's a short movie that was well done. I could see the input of a director. Keep it up, Ryan! Greetings from China, we look forward to your next. <br /> <br /> Tim
