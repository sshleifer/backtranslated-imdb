An excellent portrayal of one of the most unwholesome aspects of this time. I loved the visuals - very appropriate for a story connected to a graphic novel. <br /> <br /> I thought Tom Hanks was really great. He came very well to someone who was hardened by his work (he has not quite decided himself), but still wants to lead a normal life for his family. He is doing the best to see that. You do not want to spoil the plot - but you MUST see this movie if you're a person who wants more of a movie than the usual action / gangster format. (It's violent.)
