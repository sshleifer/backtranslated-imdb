I have NOT seen this movie, but I have to. After reading all three books by Thor Heyerdahl (Kon Tiki, Ra and Aku Aku), I am actively seeking a copy of this film. <br /> <br /> The thesis that Peruvians have migrated to Polynesia is alive. Considering that this crew had NO GPS and just a 6W old-fashioned tube radio, their journey was, to say the least, heroic. <br /> <br /> Please respond to this message if you can Tell me the location of a copy of this video. <br /> <br /> I would be interested in the purchase.
