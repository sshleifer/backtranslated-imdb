<br /> <br /> If you like rap or hip-hop, watch this movie, though it's funny if you do not get the credentials as a mere comedy. Have not seen much of the much hyped CB4, but what I've seen has not had the heart that little Stormer has. <br /> <br /> I have not heard from the participants since then, which is a surprise. The movie is very similar to Spinal Tap, which is not bad, and I think many dialogues are priceless, but in Tap it's priceless, probably because I'm more concerned with rap than rock that point. <br /> <br /> The rap songs are damn funny, and it's basically the reference for most of the movie, not all of which are in-your-face, which gives priority to the physical comedy and the one-liners the starts. <br /> <br /> Great fun, twice to see if there was ever a movie.
