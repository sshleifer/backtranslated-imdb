This is one of those westerns who are practically lonely in the uninvited quality of their dialogue. Only a few can withstand this in the long run. The rest is pretty bad. Still, I'll pay attention, because there's no other Western with such consistently good dialogue, except The Wild Bunch, Junior Bonner, and maybe a few more. <br /> <br /> It is most vulnerable to weaknesses, John Drew Barrimore. However, there is a really memorable scene. Nothing like that. Right after Kid Wichita killed the sheriff, he goes to Jack Elams and tries to get him involved in a fight. Wonderful stuff. With the best in every west.
