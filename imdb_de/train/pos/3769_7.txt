Come on, learn a little bit of fun. When I was a kid, this movie was Oscar-worthy for me. I found it absolutely hysterical. One of the best movies I have seen. <br /> <br /> Well, it's a little stupid, but come on. If you enjoyed "Excellent Adventure", you should probably have a lot of fun with "Bogus Journey". That was the movie before "Dude, where is my car?". Only this one is actually funny. As I said, it's just a good time. It should not be taken seriously and if you had the first fun, you should like "Bogus Journey". It's just a funny movie with some memorable characters. Just for your enjoyment, watch, let go, and remember that it's a stupid comedy. That's all. <br /> <br /> 7/10
