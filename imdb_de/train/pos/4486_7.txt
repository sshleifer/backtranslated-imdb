SPOILERS <br /> <br /> Tom and Jerry is a classic cartoon with a flawless idea, and almost every short is a gem. I have to say that this is definitely a worse short compared to other classic Tom and Jerry Shorts, but there's no way to hate this cartoon. Sure, it's understandable that this is one of the worst of the first Tom and Jerry episodes, and I can say that I agree, but the fact is that all the Tom and Jerry episodes are great, but Some are only just better than others. Well, that would fit in "others". <br /> <br /> Here is the plot of Fraidy Cat. Tom hears an old scary radio show and gets scared. Jerry watches how scared he is and tries to scare him even more than he already is. He creates scary dilemmas for Tom, and Tom gets scared out of his mind and his life. Jerry then lays a leaf over a vacuum cleaner and controls it, making it look like the vacuum is a ghost. Tom finds out that Jerry did all this and persecutes him. Tom then accidentally bites the maid. But in the end Jerry is the one who gets scared after seeing his reflection in a flour jar. Overall, this is far from the best of Tom and Jerry Short out there, but this is still a fun and entertaining piece of time. I wish there were more cartoons like these. The slapstick and gags that make Tom and Jerry famous are as good as never before in this short edition, but it felt like something was missing in the matter. It felt slower than most Tom and Jerry shorts. Anyway, this is a good pair of shorts that does not quite live up to some of the other Tom and Jerry cartoons, but it's still pretty. <br /> <br /> 7/10
