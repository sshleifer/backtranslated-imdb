It's very easy to qualify this movie: "A PURE MASTERPIECE". This opinion is formulated for the following reasons: The performance of the actors, they seem to be citizens of this epoch, 1100 BC. They personalize the characters perfectly. A second reason is that the poetry expressed by Homere in his poem is well given by the staging. Among other things, the narratives of the chorus give a special atmosphere that makes us a party of artistic reproduction. Third reason: The reconstitution of the d√©cor is absolutely perfect in the Mediterranean regions where the poem has taken place. And above all, the feeling is on the rendezvous. I repeat my appreciation: "A PURE MASTERPIECE".
