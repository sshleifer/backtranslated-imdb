King's Solomon's Mines brings us Patrick Swayze (Allan Quatermain), who has spent time in Africa, but decides to return to England and be a father to his son. He notes that his wife's parents have taken custody of his son and that he has little chance of getting him into court for a lot of money. In it comes Alison Deedy (playing Elizabeth), whose father is in Africa and is being held by an African tribe for ransom of the card Elizabeth's father sent her. Elizabeth visits Quatermain to bring her back to Africa to find her father. <br /> <br /> There is a good cast of minor characters that fit Quatermain and Elizabeth, and of course there are some enemies (Russians) who want the card too. <br /> <br /> The movie keeps your attention to the end. Patrick plays again a rough, handsome, honorable man, who comes in need to rescue the young woman. Patrick is a great dramatic actor who can easily portray passion, loss and despair, robust, dumb good, anger and strength. In King Solomon's Minds, his character actually smiles a few times. I would really like to see Patrick Swayze in a relaxed, fun-loving story where he does not have to bite his jaw and is so strong. Maybe a little dancing would help. However, this is a good movie for the whole family and worth the time to watch it.
