I saw this movie about a week ago and I still think about it. This movie has moved me a lot. I found the characters very believable and sympathetic, almost a mistake. As in real life, people sometimes disappointed, as in the case of Leo, who, though I liked his character, could not be disappointed if he wanted to have unprotected sex even though he was fully aware of his HIV status. I was also disappointed with Leo for refusing the medication and the terrible treatment of Marcel when he decided to send him home by train. I think this movie has shown in a very real way why the HIV numbers are rising in young gay men. This is in no way intended to beat homosexuals (I'm gay) and a movie could have been done very well through a young, direct human who makes bad decisions and does not seem to know the consequences for himself and others. The only part of the film I could not understand was why the (gay-friendly) family did not want to include Marcel in Leo's illness, so he was not admitted to the funeral. <br /> <br /> I think the biggest news from this movie is that, whether gay or straight, I DO NOT HAVE AN UNCREPROVED SEX!
