Above all, I would like to point out that I have not read the book. So there is no chance that I would be disappointed by this aspect. The biggest mistake I discovered was a historical detail with several cars, trains, clothes, etc. I do not think they belong at this point. <br /> <br /> *** Possible spoiler ***** <br /> <br /> The technical aspect of the movie is fine, nothing to brag about. But I think the acting was great. I have no experience in acting, but I can not believe how people think that is terrible! Maybe they just watched two movies (each), and the other one must have been really good! <br /> <br /> I particularly liked Jeremy Irons and really understood his character, someone who crawled up the social ladder. He then fought very hard work against those who would take his life's work away. He gets involved in this fight just like that. He does not realize that reason is no longer at his side and ends up being a beaten, disappointed man. Irons made it so believable, I sympathized despite his brutality with the figure. <br /> <br /> According to Jeremy Irons, Winona Ryder is also wonderful as a romantic young woman who is drawn into the revolutionary ideals by her boyfriend (Banderas), he had an underdeveloped part, I think, and Glenn Close was also very Well. Meryl Streep had an average performance, it was not bad, just not the standards of other actors. Watch out for Miguel Guilherme, a fine Portuguese actor, among so many stars. <br /> <br /> In contrast to today's films, here only the interpretations matter, only the people are important, but at the same time this is not a presumptuous movie, too anxious to be intellectual. The best proof that I really liked, I write 7 years later.
