In Le Million, Rene Clair, one of the great directors and pioneers of cinema, created a jewel of light comedy that, despite its lightness, is a groundbreaking and technically brilliant film that clearly influenced subsequent filmmakers like the Marx Brothers, Lubitsch. and Mamoulian. The storyline, a witty story of a poor artist who wins a huge lottery jackpot but has to frantically search for the missing ticket all over the city, is basically just a means to support a series of wonderfully funny comic scenes that to be played in a fantasy world of the USA The fantasy of the director. <br /> <br /> One of the most impressive features of this film is that, despite being in the middle of Paris and containing nothing impossible, it achieves a lasting and captivating fairytale / fantasy atmosphere. It seems quite natural that people do so much sing as they speak, or that a fight over a stolen jacket should take the form of a football game. Another memorable element is that Le Million contains perhaps the weirdest opera ever shown in the film (Oh, that blonde soprano with wings! "I laugh, ha! Ha!"!). Another joy is the casting: Clair has put together an amazing group of sharply different character actors, each of whom illustrates with a deadly satirical accuracy a bourgeois French "guy" so that the movie comes to life like a set of Daumier prints. <br /> <br /> The hilarity takes a bit to roll, and I did not find the characters as emotionally captivating as they can be in a light comedy (as is the case in many Lubitsch films, for example). For these reasons, I have waived the highest rating. However, these small caverns should not distract from an enthusiastic recommendation. <br /> <br /> Should you see it? By all means. Recommended if you want a classic and influential cinema or just a fun comedy.
