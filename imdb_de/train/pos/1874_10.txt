Everyone should see this movie because each one of us is broken in some way and it can help us to realize that 1) my life is not as bad as I thought, and 2) how important it is to have a child in it To adopt need. There are so many out there. To think that the movie was actually based on a real person made us think deeply about life and how the world is and always will be. Corrupt, but corruption does not have to reach your home. We all have the choice! I definitely recommend this ... and while you're at it, I'd like to insert "The Color Purple" and "Woman, Thou Art Loosed" by TD Jakes. <br /> <br /> These are all films that are life-based and give an insight into life.
