As a big fan of the original, I avoided this movie like the plague when the bad reviews came out eight years ago, but I just finished this movie and found it a really pleasant surprise. <br /> <br /> Okay, if you're looking for a retouching of the original, this is a big disappointment, but if you're looking for something different, a bit nervous and political, then this is the movie for you. Greg is now thirty-four and works as a teacher at his old comprehensive school, where he is being followed by a fellow teacher and has sexual dreams of one of his students. When the student insists on meeting with Gregory, there are a number of mishaps that include torture, break and intrusion, as well as all sorts of unexpected twists and turns that make me feel happy and moved for something original I recommend this movie. I only wish that more people would see this when it was released, and see it as it really is.
