This is a movie that I can watch over and over again and never get tired. He has lots of laughter, weapons, action, crime, good deposits, and a decent deal, with a towering Donald Sutherland a pretty weird role as Assasain. Tia Carerra looks as hot as she ever did, and Thomas can act as well. Thomas Ian Griffin is great because the lead actor "Max" is a DEA agent's villain "Livingston". The storyline revolves around Max and Diane trying to catch Livingston while they argue and argue over who gets the money for each agency. The Assassin Sutherland, who has pretty much all good liners, is perfect crime in the mix, but there's the usual love story, but it's played quite differently than you would think of Carerra and Griffith. They also cast the Russian mafia, the Italian mafia and the Chineese mafia into a mix here, the film is shot in Boston where you have some great shots, and locals, great photography and music in this movie is just the epitome of a thriller comedy everything you could ever ask for. Take a look at Sutherland's restroom in a particular scene, very unusual. This movie is a riot and will make you 10 hard for me to laugh.
