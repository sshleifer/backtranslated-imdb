Jean Harlow and Clark Gable were a great team on screen and this may be their best movie together. <br /> <br /> Yes, Hold Your Man can be cheesy and predictable, but I do not love that movie. I love seeing Harlow and Gable together and in this movie they are just wonderful. It's obvious that they really enjoyed working together, and that's part of what makes this movie so wonderful. <br /> <br /> The funny dialogue, great script and attention to detail are the other things that make this movie so good movie. I loved this movie the first time I saw it, and every time I look at it, I always notice at least one new detail. For me, that's a sign of a great movie. <br /> <br /> Dialogue and script are better than most movies from that time (early 30's). I love classic movies, but I admit that most are just average and sometimes do not hold my interest. Hold Your Man is one of the exceptions. <br /> <br /> This has a lot to do with the fact that Hold Your Man is a "pre-code" movie. (The Hays code was only enforced one year after Hold Your Man.) This movie could not be created under the code. Well, it could have been done, but it would have been a different story. Luckily, the code was not enforced until 1934. Otherwise, we would have missed this gem.
