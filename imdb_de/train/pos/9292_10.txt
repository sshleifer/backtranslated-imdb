If you like a movie, you should not miss it. If you prefer action, horror or romance, you'll wonder what's going on. Everyone here is stuck in a gangster movie. And what happens is transcendental murder. <br /> <br /> There are only a few similar films. There will undoubtedly be a limited release and hard to find. But the search will be worth it. If you want to study a mileu as a potential symbol, this is indeed a movie you would like to study. If you do, you'll never see what happens. Dark City is better. Joe Vrs. The volcano is more fun. Mad Dog Time, however, was able to transform the gangsta crowd into a symbolism. , , or at least think twice before shooting again.
