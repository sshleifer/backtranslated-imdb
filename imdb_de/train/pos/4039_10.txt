Most of the complaints I've heard about this movie are due to one thing: it's not Versus. Yes, the cast and crew are basically the same. Yes, Kitamura recovers some punches in the fight scenes of the second half of the movie, but here's where the similarities end. Versus mainly takes place outdoors and shows Kitamura's ability to produce an interesting B-movie in natural locations. For Alive, almost everything takes place inside. In small, tight spaces. Here, the art design is pushed into your face and WHAT is art design! We are treated with several very complicated and interesting rooms, and our figures are mostly confined to these rooms. Another major difference is that we do not get much action here until the end of the movie. Versus was all about action and cool, here much more value is placed on the characters and the situation and turned upside down. That's why Alive is a far more interesting film than Versus. You can not throw it in and go to a random scene to watch cool zombie blood for five or ten minutes, but you'll spend almost two hours on the screen watching the interplay of some really interesting characters DVD despite some sayings have ordered. You should too! But make sure that this is a different animal than Versus - it's often slow and requires a bit of thought to make the most of it. I hope Media Blasters will record it for subtitling the R1 DVD!
