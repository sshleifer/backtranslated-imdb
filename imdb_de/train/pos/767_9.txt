Being a true product of the hip-hop and electronic dance music generation, this is undoubtedly one of my favorite movies of all time. Beat Street, though in some ways not as "authentic" as Wild Style, is a movie that will take your heart out to anyone who is proud of the culture of urban sample / DJ-based music and electro club culture , <br /> Although I have to admit that the dialogue is sometimes a bit cheesy, one can not help feeling the characters and ultimately, "wishing you were there" for the beginnings of hip-hop culture in New York City in the early eighties. The b-boy fight scene at the Roxy nightclub (a real-time, real-time contest between the legendary Rock Steady Crew and the NYC Breakers) is just as essential to a hip hop fan archive as any classic album. If possible, watch some breaker movements in slow motion to really appreciate the athletic and stylistic skills of an experienced B-boy / B-girl. All the praise of the Zulu nation !!!
