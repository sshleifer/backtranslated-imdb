The boys work outside of a recording studio when they hear "the voice of an angel". That would be Miss Van Doren, acting under the name of Miss Andrews, because her father does not agree with her "radio singer". She hopes, however, that Mrs. Bixby, a friend of her father, hires a certain big wig, and then he has to give his consent. <br /> <br /> She leaves, but within minutes the boys run amok in the studio causing havoc and other musicians who kill her after they ruined the recording session. Things finally settle down. "Phew, we escaped them," says Moe. "Yeah, we're gone too," answers Curly. <br /> <br /> The boys then go around the studio, put on Miss Van Doren, Curly puts on women's clothes and pretends to sing. Mrs. Bixby comes in, is impressed and hires "Seniorita Cucacha" on site! For an additional $ 500, she is asked to sing at her high society party that night. The rest, as they say, is history, as Curly pretends to be an opera singer, with some funny results. Oh, by the way, accompanied by "Senior Mucho" and "Senior Gusto". <br /> <br /> What happens at the party is simply that the truth triumphs, but not before some slapstick antics take place. All in all a pretty good episode. I enjoyed it, but I would not classify it as something special.
