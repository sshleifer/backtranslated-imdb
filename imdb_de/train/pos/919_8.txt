As a fan of 'Columbo' I was very disappointed with 'Corky Romano'. Although Falk's mob boss character was a funny movie, he was a long way from the lovable lieutenant he had been playing for so many years, especially with the insulting language he used. After 'Corky Romano' I was genuinely surprised and surprised by Mr Peter Falk. Having just seen "Finding John Christmas" and its predecessor, "A City Without Christmas," for the first time in a week, I must say that "Max," Peter Falk's adorable character in both films, is certainly so memorable and lovable like 'Columbo'. While parts of the film are quite predictable, such scenes by no means take pleasure in seeing the story. I also wish I had both recorded heartwarming Christmas films, and I highly recommend them, whether you're a Falk fan, a Christmas fanatic, or just someone who likes the occasional feel-good movie of the week. This movie could be lost among the crowds made for television. So find "Finding John Christmas" before it's too late.
