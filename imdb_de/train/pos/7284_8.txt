When I was young, I had seen very few movies. My parents rented this in all their wisdom. I was very careful about what the movie was about, in fact I was not allowed to watch it. Of course, my brother and sister joined us and that made me very angry. What have I done? Late at night, I discarded the video recorder! He entered the TV screen, called the police, and reported vandals. Of course I was arrested, I could not take my foot off the TV before the police came. I just had a stern conversation and was sent home. My parents, of course, grounded me and forced me to repay the debts for the TV and VCR. This has torn me apart, slave labor really believes me, but I had to do it. Housework around the house. What happened in the end? We have a big screen TV, a DVD player and a surround sound system for my work. How did I get the money? Simply, I made my own films and sold them to Disney! Can you still remember Neno? Well, I wrote this movie and shot my goldfish in their aquariums! Of course, they rewrote the plot and put it into CGI because they could not afford to turn it into a real action picture like I did! In the end I never saw the movie The Head that did not die and the rating I gave is my life rating! It's going pretty well!
