Without a doubt, Tenko is the best British television show ever, the performances, the directing, the casting, the suspense, the drama ... everything is fantastic. <br /> <br /> Although the show has fallen A bit later this past season, this graduation film has picked up on the threads and made a great story for fans of the show and newbies. I can not recommend this movie, find it and watch it. But I recommend watching the show first, as the first two seasons are even better than this fantastic movie. <br /> <br /> An obvious one (10/10)
