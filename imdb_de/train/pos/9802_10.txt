For starters, I have always been a fan of Batman cartoons because the theme is so universal, "that all the living have an alter ego." This applies to the mystery of Batwoman. While the whole story is good, I'm disappointed they did not really contribute much to the franchise with this series. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, throughout the movie, you're trying to find out who Batwoman's identity is. You can find out by simply looking at the cast of credits published on this site (so if you have not seen them yet, go Do not go there). I was kind of disappointed that they did not make the movie any longer. 75 minutes are far too short for any movie. The secret identity of batwoman also comes much too early in the movie, half way and then becomes anti-climatic, because you know that the good guys will always win and that the new character, known as Batwoman, after the end of the Films will disappear. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure what the new animation style in this movie is either. I love the slender new characters, but there should be some more detail where detail is needed. Some parts of the animation look so awkward and rigid that it immediately attracts your attention and distracts your attention from the plot. Neither did I really like the bright atmosphere used in most scenes, it somehow loses its dark and gothic feel that is Batman. Similarly, we should have learned more about the personality of Batwoman so that we can develop the same deep compassion we have with Bruce Wayne. I also believe that the fight with Bane should have been better. In typical children's fashion, the villain too easily encounters his death, either by stumbling, falling, electric shock or something stupid against them. If you consider that not a single drop of blood was spilled in this movie. <br /> <br /> Conclusion, it's a good entertaining movie and I can watch anyone who's a Batman fan. It has a good storyline, a universal appeal and even a great spectacle to top it off. I only wish they could change the story more permanently by letting Batwoman stay in order to make things more interesting. Do not just introduce it and then throw it out as soon as it's done. I also want someone else to finally figure out the mystery of change. To have something other than Batman, solve the puzzle and fill it in later with the details. <br /> <br /> I hope there will be more animated films coming, and we look forward to the time when we will actually see this separation between Bruce Wayne and Barbra Gordan. He took her away forever and does not even like her and I can not believe she was stupid enough to fall in love with someone 20 years older. I also want to see the time Tim Drake leaves because he's tired of the old man. In short, I want to see all the things that brought the characters to where they will be in Batman Beyond. Otherwise, the same repeated formula ends faster than if you had decided to continue with the story. <br /> <br />
