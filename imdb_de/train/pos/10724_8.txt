This is one of those who feel good, Saturday afternoon movies. It's on top with other retro flicks like Flight of the Navigator. Just a sweet movie with a subtle comedy to brighten up everything. And it's fun to see how 20 years have changed stars like Kelly Preston and Lea Thompson. Not to mention Joquin Phoenix. <br /> <br /> I personally like movies like this every now and then. Nothing too deep or too scary. Just a nice story. And I would never have known Mr. Phoenix if I had not read the credits recently. He was really just a baby when he made this movie. Kelly Preston was also the young aspiring actress. She and Lea have done a wonderful job in this film. I agree that this is not an Oscar movie. But very worth seeing. Especially if you have children in the range of about 8 to 11 years. Or those who are interested in the space program.
