Some of his poignant scenes are filled with lofty emotional intensity, such as when Meena Kumari refuses to say "YES" as approval for Nikah (Marriage Bond) and climbs down the hill while running in a traumatized frenzy Berserker. At the moment, Raj Kumar is following her, and a strong gust of wind blew away the veil of Kumari and on the legs of Kumar ........ <br /> <br /> Kamal Amrohi will always be remembered golden words in the annals of indian cinema history for the endeavor to complete this film in a record time of 12 years.
