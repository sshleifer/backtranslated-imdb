I saw this in the theater in the early 70s. The most memorable and scary scene is when the German army crosses for the first time with yellow mustard gas. The Germans and their horses are covered from head to toe (or hoof) with eerie protective suits. The experienced British soldiers (only) wear gas masks and wait again for the gas clouds and the German attackers. The gas clouds are getting closer and wrap the British defenders. The Germans move slowly threateningly forward in their creepy-looking robe. Suddenly a cry from the defenders ... This gas is like no one else they have experienced before. Now you will know why I remember this scene for over 30 years Shiver, I think you will too!
