If you want to watch a movie and feel good, then Tigerland is the movie for you. I love this movie from top to bottom. The perfect scenes of this movie look so real; It's almost like a documentary about something that happened in real life, but with drama. Boy, I'm telling you ... REAL drama, they actually "fought" in one of the scenes (the DVD should hear the comment, that's not obvious). I see this film as a lot of desperate young men trying to escape an unfortunate fate. After seeing Saving Private Ryan, I appreciate what an "unlucky fate" is and know exactly how the men feel in the movie. I see this movie as a cross between "Stand By Me" and "Saving Private Ryan". What do men do when they are in a situation that is "hard" in real life? Some men go crazy, some men cry, some men with fists, others make drugs, others indiscriminately sleep with hookers trying to erase the meaning of love from their lives, some try to drink the pain away, some jump from buildings or bridges , others feel guilty and others feel so agony that they get so sick that they collapse - physically. This movie has all those desperate emotions in a ball. But do not get me wrong, it's not a depressing movie, it's realistic, it's a very humorous movie, the exciting and funny Bozz (Collins Character) makes everything shine, and, moreover, there are about five female actresses in the film; I let you find out what they are for! With dialogue, war / action sequences, perfect scene images and suitable music; This movie has everything, as I said: from top to bottom. I do not know why Tigerland is heavily underfunded. The best thing about the movie is that the cover says "The Best Movie of the Year", and there's absolutely nothing left. Let the rare gems come, Hollywood, 10/10.
