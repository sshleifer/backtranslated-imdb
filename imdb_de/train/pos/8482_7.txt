This is an incredibly colossal, vulgar stupid all-star extravaganza revue of all early talkie stars who could afford Warner Bros. ... and like most other rarely seen films that were actually filmed in the late 1920s, is an unforgettable opportunity to see and hear the exuberant youth of the righteous twenties associated with song and dance. The show's show is pretty gigantic. Vaudeville acts after soliloquy after tap dance after acrobat to comedy fantasia after ukulele madness after Rin Tin Tin, who introduces an 'oriental number' (...), and on and on it lolls, grinning and squeaky fabulous gramophone quality Vitaphone sound. It's way too long, but among his insane delicacies is the fantastic "Singin in the Bathtub" number, created on a scale that the QE2 architects would be proud of ... the funny guy Nick Lucas and never ending grand finale in two-tone color ... that's all set to the song LADY LUCK. , The Tubby Chorus line and jumping teenagers are so excited that they almost always re-enter their own faces with joy and effort. Row after row of "Doll" characters jump over and some even emerge from the floor. I do not kid you, there are even girls who are strapped to the crystal chandeliers, mummified with shiny gauze, and chained with bead ropes that can not move (for days, as I imagine, during production), while those hangovers of toy boxing sportsmanship twitch and convulsively cramp down to the ukulele orchestra. Of course, I loved it and had to watch this finale over and over again and then invite friends and family to the canvas for weeks, just to scare and scare them individually and roll in the lounge with screaming delight every exclamation of their startled reactions. And so you should ... and rejoice that there was an era in which this was created only for entertainment and excitement. It's all so crazy.
