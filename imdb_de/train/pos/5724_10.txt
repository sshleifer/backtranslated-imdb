Massive multiple chills on the spine! I am surprised that there are people who do not like it! I saw it at 10 in the morning and was still scared. And I saw hundreds of thriller / horror movies! I'm 22 for loud crying !!! I mean, OK, voice, not very good, probably even b-movie-ish. But the real look of terror, the sound effects, the river! From the beginning, strike again and again with relentless, unforgiving, terrorist scenes! So many clich√©s, but no one surprised and terrified! You know it's coming, it's coming, it's coming, BOO! and you are still jumping off the chair. Grab a pillow and blanket, call your closest friend and do not look at it at night! Hats off to the Japanese!
