I enjoyed this movie and had very low expectations due to the negative reviews I read. I went there because I was curious what all this fuss was about because some of the posts were so mad at this movie and the Koreans. Oh, and it's from Korea that has released some of my favorite movies. I liked hosts, but not my absolute favorite. Some of my favorite sci-fi / fantasy movies so you can have a taste for my taste: Mirrormask, Stardust, Serenity, Gattaca, Willow, Matrix, Resident Evil Series, LOTR, Stargate, Dark City. <br /> <br /> It was not confusing, as everyone said, and the monsters looked good and the battles were great. There are some holes in the story that were not really important. I arranged something like this and did not ask why I saw Summer Blockbusters a long time ago. The Korean legend was interesting, the reincarnation stuff was different and I thought the main characters were dressed suspiciously like Korean actors in other shows. Ethan's (Behr) hair looked so Asian. <br /> <br /> Yes, it could be better and I hope in the future that Korea, with its unusual, quirky sense of life, intense emotions and unexpected humor, can bring diversity to the blockbuster genre. Maybe a combination of host and Dragon Wars in the future?
