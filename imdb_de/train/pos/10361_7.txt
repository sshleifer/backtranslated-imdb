Once you lift your jaw off the ground and realizes they somehow managed to get the thing together so quickly that it was released in the same year the case ended, you'll find it's not half bad is. The plot is stimulating and interesting, and the tempo is fast, so it covers many situations and so often jumps to the next one after one or two lines have been spoken. Where this really stands out is acting. The services are excellent. Neill and Streep are both perfectly. It's also cool to hear so much Australians in a Hollywood movie, and even those who do not naturally come to it, at least try to put an accent on it. The cinematography and editing are nice enough, but do not go beyond the standard. The story of this film is captivating and the fact that it is authentic makes it even fresher. Although I have not read the novel or heard from what happened outside of this image, I understand that it is very close to the truth. There is some moderate to strong language and worrying content. It is sometimes a big drama in the courtroom. I recommend this to any other fan. 7/10
