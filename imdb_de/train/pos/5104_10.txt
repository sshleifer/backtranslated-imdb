This is a smart drama about the way of life in a Texas honky tonk in the early eighties. John Travolta and Debra Winger show two credible performances as Bud and Sissy Davis. This movie really opens up the country music scene and helped America with mechanical bulls. If you love a good love movie, you will love this movie.
