Essentially, this short film trailer is about Superman and Batman working together to make an uncomfortable alliance. The two characters obviously have very different views on how to handle crime and what constitutes punishment. I'm not coming to the story here. But I'll get involved in acting, which is great. Everyone is well staffed. The two actors who play Superman and Batman are well suited to their characters. The same filmmaker made Batman: Dead End and Grayson has also made this short film. Of the three, I probably liked this movie the least, but I still thought it was done well. For me Worlds is best a 7/10
