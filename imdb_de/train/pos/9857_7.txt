While I loved this movie, the trailers that circulated the internet the year before the theatrical release raised my expectations a bit. <br /> <br /> I own the DVD, so do not get me wrong, I do not say do not look at you or even buy it! I still think that the first scene was the best and nothing that towered over the whole movie.
