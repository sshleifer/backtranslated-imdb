An original, uncensored deduction of this amazing film was discovered in the Library of Congress in 2004 and was shown in 2005 in some specialized cinemas around the world. According to recent reviews I found online, the original has all the nastiest dialogue and intact allusions; They were later either removed or completely re-recorded by the studio before the first release to pass the censors of New York State. I also read that a DVD is "expected 2006" and one can only hope! If we are really happy, comparisons between the two versions will be included. Note that the published censored version was originally available on Laserdisc, which I've seen. Stanwyck rules!
