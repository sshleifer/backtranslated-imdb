I married a Japanese girl 14 years ago. We are still together. <br /> <br /> But in the 50s it would never have been this easy. <br /> <br /> Military life has been reduced to action, drama and comedy for years to this point. Dismounted to death The mixed relationships gave him new ground. This is old hat today, but then ...? Marrying an Asian at the time meant that you owe someone or were a freak. This affected both options along with the third. Maybe it's love? <br /> <br /> Brando did his usual good job. Garner has done a better job than he usually does. He is good, but that showed how good he could be. Umecki-chan made a Helluva debut here, and although I think she deserves her statue, she has not really stretched. It was a role that nobody who had not been abroad recognized, and the novelty was the Corker. <br /> <br /> The real scene-robber was Red Buttons. Red was the best in this movie. Bank on it. And also the Japanese lifestyles showed in an admirable light. <br /> <br /> A classic.
