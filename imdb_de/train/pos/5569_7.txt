Cheech & Chong's Next Movie (1980) was the second film to feature the affectionate duo of Cheech Marin and Tommy Chong. The lovable burnout smokers are now roommates. They live in a condemned building, looking for ways to get more smoke, and are lying around all day. But Cheech is the "responsible person". He has a job and a girlfriend. One day Cheech wants to put on his freak, so he tries to get Chong out of the house. Cheechs brother "Red" (Cheech is a different role) is in town and wants to hang out with him. Fearing that he could kill two birds with one stone, Cheech pawns Chong and Red. In what adventures will Chong and Red dive? Will Cheech hire his freak? How long will Chong get along without smoke? Just take a look at CHEECH & CHONG'S NEXT FILM to see if it really works! He got some experience when he was not working in the credits for UP IN SMOKE. Funny, but not as good as the first movie. But Cheech and Chong fans will enjoy it. Followed by NICE DREAMS. <br /> <br /> Recommended.
