Without doubt, Beat Street is the best movie about the Breakin scene. Everything is perfect, the clothes (puma), the music and above all the dancing! The story is simple, but what is there to tell a story? The point of the film is to show what the kids were doing at the time, what was important to them. It shows that teenagers are generally good, all that matters to these everyday children was music, dance and friendship. After watching the DVD recently, I was very surprised how well she had outlasted the time! The clothes did not look outdated (possibly because Puma is making a massive comeback now), the music still sounds fresh and dancing is still fascinating. A film that everyone should see between 10 and 25 years as part of their youth culture.
