The commentary of the person who says that Pat Robertson is evil and his program evil has nothing to compare with what is evil and just. His definition of evil is the opposite of evil. The Bible itself says that in the last few days people will call good as evil and evil as good! He does not even know that he fulfilled the biblical prophecy! If you do not know God and refuse to know Him now, that's fine. He still loves you, but when you finally bow your knee to Him, and you will do it, it will be too late for you. God does not send anyone to hell, not even you! You will go there by your own decision and your spitting will determine it! May God have mercy on you and give you a Damascus Road experience. The 700 Club and Pat Robertson's service is one of the reasons why I'm still here. On the verge of alcoholism, adultery, and probably death, God grabbed the screen and used Pat Robertson to do it, and thank God he did! You have the right to say what you have said, but you have no right to curse with your words. God have mercy
