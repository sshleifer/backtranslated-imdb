Previously, the flawed "Slaughterhouse Five" was the best. But this screen adaptation of "Mother Night" is very faithful to the book and upholds the comedy, the mystery and the tragedy. Fortunately, it was neither Hollywood idiocy nor the movie "Breakfast of Champions." Another good thing in this movie is that you do not have to be familiar with the book to follow it (as I believe you do for Slaughterhouse Five). That's probably true for Breakfast of Champions, too, but they did such a bad job that it's better to read the book and not see the movie! Nick Nolte has done an excellent job in this film.
