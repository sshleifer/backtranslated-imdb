This is apparently one of Shemp's first shorts with the Stooges. (This excludes his much earlier vaudeville years with the team). But the comic timing of the trio is best here. Apart from the intense slapstick scenes, there are others that are more subtle but equally funny. Look at Larry as Shemp asks him to look into the camera for a snapshot. Or, look at the real object that calls for Moore's exclamation: "Oh ... highly polished mahogany." Emil Sitka is at his confused fool. And the idiot may look weird, but he's weird. He seems as frustrated and stunned with the Stooges as "normal" people in other shorts. <br /> <br /> This is a must for Shemp fans. It will not disappoint.
