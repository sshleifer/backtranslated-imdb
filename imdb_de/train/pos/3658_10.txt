This movie is like an allegory of the gospel. It has such direct honesty and innocence that one can not believe it was made after the World War, when Italy was devastated and devastated and filled by a huge, homeless, impoverished population. It is a monument to the best qualities of the human mind as well as the infinite creative resources of this land of inspiration. <br /> <br /> Toto is a character like Doestoevisky's "Idiot", a modern Christ who finds his way in a big city. He is kindness and purity, strengthened by love, and his deeds change the people he encounters, as well as the wonder that pigeons work. The story is narrated in a natural way and in a simple style, but with a magic that is almost a foreshadowing of Fellini's surrealist fantasies. It's one of the most inspiring and uplifting films ever made.
