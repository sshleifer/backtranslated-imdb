Finally, I have seen the infamous "Ice Age". Apart from the fact that it may not be as funny as I had hoped after seeing the awesome teaser, there is not a bad word I can say about it. Sure, it's not as glamorous as a Disney production (besides, it's Fox's first attempt at a full-length CG movie), but it has a tremendous heart and sometimes (like the look in Manfred's eyes after seeing the sad look have looked at his past)) I was close to tears. But when they reunited the baby with his father, I just could not hold it anymore. A film that has no difficulty walking the thin line of clothes and slaves and making more than the best of it. The end result was one of the most touching animated creations I've ever seen. Great, humorous-looking characters that grow fast on you (and great vocal talents too), and lots of fun, catchy scenes, especially from Scrat's order, make the movie a good reason. Plus the dodo scene, which is my favorite funny favorite scene from the year 2002. <br /> <br /> I honestly do not understand it, but for some reason, it looks like CG animations will gain the upper hand in the future. But if it only means that there will be more films like this (and anyone who can forget Pixar's creations), at least I do not care. 9.10
