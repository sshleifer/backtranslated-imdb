This is one of the boldest and most important of the so-called "pre-code" films shot in Hollywood in the 1930s. In contrast to some pre-code films that occasionally dealt with subjects that would never have been admissible after 1934/195, this film plunged from start to finish into a very dirty but entertaining plot. The usual morals of the late 30s and 40s were definitely NOT to be seen in this film, because it is essentially an engaging woman who sleeps her way to the top - and has no excuse. This "broad" woman enjoyed the sex and used it for any man who could help her get rich - something you would never have seen in movies that were made only two or three years later. The film begins with Barbara Stanwyck working in her father's speakeasy. He is not only her boss, he is also her pimp and encourages her to sleep with a local government official so he can run the illegal bar with impunity. Although it is not very clear here, it seems that Daddy has "rented" his daughter's body for a long time. <br /> <br /> However, after being nearly raped and attacking this man by breaking a bottle of beer, his skull has enough of Barbara and goes to the big city. It does not hurt that she was still blowing up and killing her father, but her sense of wanting to hollow herself out and show nothing seemed to be the impetus to move. <br /> <br /> Despite Depression, Barbara uses sex to get a job in a huge mega-bank. She begins with a modest job as an archivist, but within a few weeks she seems to be moving from one job to the next - until she sleeps with the bank director and his future son-in-law !!! It all ends in tragedy, but Babs does not seem too shaken by the deaths of these two men. Some time later, she is able to get involved in the life of the NEW CEO, and again she is in the lead (perhaps in more ways than one). <br /> <br /> Now this is a wonderful movie because it was so pithy and unreflective. Barbara played a 100% sociopath - a woman with no morality and no conscience - only the desire to take as much life out of life as she could, no matter who hurt her. However, the brave writers and producers "coughed" and considered it important to reach a redemptive end. Considering that this woman was so evil and engaging, her change of heart was a big disappointment in the end and seriously affected the movie. This reminded me in many ways of the end of JEZEBEL - because once again a bad person sees "the light" and changes at the not too convincing conclusion. <br /> <br /> My advice is recommended Try to see RED-HEADED WOMAN and DOWNSTAIRS. RED-HEADED WOMAN is very similar to BABY FACE, but in the end has no magical transformation - the lead actress is really a skunk! In DOWNSTAIRS, a movie similar to RED-HEADED WOMAN, the roles are reversed and a man (John Gilbert) plays a similar engaging personality. Both are classics and a bit better than this movie. <br /> <br /> This movie is an amazing curiosity from a short span of often ultra-thin Hollywood movies, and in this light, it's worth a visit for Cinephiles. Even fans of The Duke take note - John Wayne plays a very minor role in the movie and it's very unusual to see a very young Wayne playing such a conventional role.
