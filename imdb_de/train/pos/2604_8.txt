"Amazing Grace" feels lethargic as it tells a contemporary story of different lives in an apartment building. The spoken language is Hebrew, but the drama could take place in any modern city. It observes family values, romantic relationships and age group characteristics with the same sovereignty. It does not judge the characters, but just presents them in a straight line as they strive to solve their individual problems in this modern world. The quality of the acting is very good and the observations of the characters are sharp and sharp. I really appreciate this flowing movie.
