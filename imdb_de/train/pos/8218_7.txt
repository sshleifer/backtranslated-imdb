When Harry Callahan got up for years, the inevitable "old man with a chip on his shoulder" finally had to come into play. Callahan, who was sometimes fragile and inappropriate, was still unshakeable. Fortunately, this movie took some time to develop a different kind of story that could reinvent Dirty Harry and the entire genre. Although the film was neglected, it was still a great addition to the show, even though it was a bit out of place in a time of stupid fashion trends and New Wave music.
