"I'll take you there," says one man who loses his wife to another and finds an unlikely ally on a blind date. Unlike most romantic comedies, this little indie is mainly a funny sitcom with Rogers and Sheedy, who does not value romance. A kind of road trip with lots of fun and some poignant moments keeps moving, stays fresh and is worth it for indie lovers.
