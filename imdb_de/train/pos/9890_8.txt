Unfortunately, this movie has never made it to DVD. I saw it when it first hit theaters in 1983 and then in 1992, when the VHS was released. When I recently saw a VHS copy at a flea market, I immediately bought it. I was not disappointed. First the obvious: Claudia Ohana is beautiful and a pleasure to see. Then the film takes you into an unreal world where you have to reflect your values ​​and decide what is really important to you. The movie is about many things. It's about how the World Bank and big corporations exploit and enslave developing countries with their capitalist plans to force them into debt they can never repay. It's about how our economic system exploits us by putting credit in debt, mortgages and car payments. It's about trying to save an innocence that we may never have had and may not really save. It's about good and evil and how hard it is sometimes to distinguish one from the other. It raises many questions but gives no answers. I think that's good sometimes. Because of this, this is a movie that can truly be saved and seen.
