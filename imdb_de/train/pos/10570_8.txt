It's hard to say what's on top, the charm and energy of James Cagney, or the opening excesses of Busby Berkeley's three big showstoppers. I make a draw with Footlight Parade, one of the funniest and fastest musicals of the early '30s. Although the movie clearly belongs to Cagney, Joan Blondell supplements the good-natured action immensely. <br /> <br /> And what's the story? It's about Chester Kent (Cagney), who produces musicals, and who's just getting out of business while the talkies take over. He starts making prologues, live music entertainment, which is offered on stage before a movie begins. He comes up with the idea of ​​making bigger and more of them and moving them around the country. He is a fire and ideas, and he needs all the ideas to produce these things inexorably. But a rival spies on him and steals his ideas. Nan Prescott (Blondell), his clever secretary, loves him, but he is too busy to notice him. an office girl in black rimmed round glasses (Ruby Keeler) would like to have a chance to dance; His wife says she did not divorce him. a blond gold digger puts his hooks in him; His partners are cheating on him ... my God, what's next? It all sounds very digestible, but everything happens quickly, with Cagney's jump, tripping, striding, finger-hooking, barking, and occasionally - to the great last number, when he's singing and dancing - taking a step or two, just to show , how it is done. <br /> <br /> Instead of "Let's do a show, gang," we have "We have to build three shows in three days, so lock the doors and let's start the rehearsals." These three super-prologues will feature 40 choruses, spectacular effects and a rich contract, with forty units from Kent in deluxe movie houses ... the entire Apollo movie house circuit! Exhaustion threatens, the feet ache, but all these unoccupied choruses in tight costumes (which include Ann Sothern and Dorothy Lamour, one can quickly recognize Sothern, but Lamour is more general), hold the hearts and dance their hearts out. <br /> <br /> And then the curtains open, while each prologue is shown one after the other in separate cinemas that same night, and the owner of the Apollo circle will find out tonight whether he will save Chester's skin or not , <br /> <br /> The first is "Honeymoon Hotel" with Dick Powell and Ruby Keeler in a 9-minute production number that offers a lot of social flair, with groom and groom (some are even married), bedrooms and beds and doors with signs "Do not disturb". <br /> <br /> Then on to the next theater and 11 minutes from "By a Waterfall", where the Warner Brothers accountants were probably worried about bankruptcy. This number is so exaggerated - dozens of floating girls, trees, fountains, a huge grotto with water slides, a huge pool - you would never believe that there was depression. Berkeley pulls out all his tricks-dubbing, human patterns, legs and arms doing all sorts of precision things-and he does it in the water, with lots of underwater photography. The girls are safe game. They smile smiling with water in their eyes and are still hitting their tracks. The whole thing must have been incredibly difficult and exhausting. Ruby Keeler, who has a few quick punches in the water, is the only one who looks a bit cautious. <br /> <br /> And finally, the ultimate finale ... 11 minutes long Cagney dances and sings with Keeler on "Shanghai Lil" with all sorts of bar girls and their customers, which is unusual because the races are mixed. There are Cagney and Keeler dancing on the bar, dancing on a table and fighting Cagney. There are what looks like fifty or sixty marching marines bouncing around, throwing and catching rifles. Then ... that's true ... a human image of Franklin Roosevelt and the NRA Eagle. This may be the only Hollywood music production to feature Roosevelt, a major federal agency and a throng of sexy Chinese prostitutes. <br /> <br /> That's entertainment, people. It is great! <br /> <br /> Of course Chester Prologes get the big job and Nan gets Chester. The movie is full of juicy clichés that make us smile. Ruby Keeler is so adorable when she seriously blows her throws with flying arms so you can help her. Joan Blondell makes us forget many Hollywood women who may have been more beautiful, but much less wit and personality. The movie, however, is owned by Cagney, who grabs and shakes him, and Berkeley, a man who was never too much for too much.
