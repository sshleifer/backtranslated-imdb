For the full respect and recognition that gets this film Kung Fu historians, lacks blatantly in some critical areas: action and fight scenes. But I have to say that the plot is probably the best and most original I've ever seen in a martial arts film. Undoubtedly, Five Deadly Venoms is a must, not only that, a movie you can see again and again; But I also have to say that after watching you feel it could have been even better. Somehow you leave something, you want more. Producer Chang Cheh beautifully prepares the storyline for a potential masterpiece, but does not give more of the desired action. The fighting styles of the film captured the audience really a (Centipede, Snake, Scorpion, Lizard, Toad), and they are shown, but the battles are noticeably short. The Toad- and Snake styles are particularly fascinating and much should be much more present, in fact, the Toad is killed by the middle of the movie. Interestingly, in this film, the absence of constant action or struggle leads to the development of a great plot. This is one of the few kung fu films that you are really interested in and interested in the story. This movie has a dark and vicious tone and you are drawn into the mood. Eerie weapons and torture tactics are used throughout the movie and add to the movie experience. To start the movie and imagine the producers of the Giftklan manufacturer Chang Cheh, is taken from us in a dirty dungeon. The ending fight scenes are definitely good, but seem muffled and somehow more was expected. Still, this movie is one of the best shaw brothers and fun. My overall impression of the film would complete it: The styles that used the fighters are only shown us and not shown in detail, the sad, the director had the goods for something extraordinary available and did not go further on the matter. I wonder what could have been with this movie, but still one of the best. 8 out of 10 on the scale.
