Impressive. What a wonderful movie. The script is almost perfect, it seems that this is the only film written by Minglun Wei. I hope he has more stories in it. <br /> <br /> The acting is great. Renewing Zhou as a doggie was amazing - a very natural talent, and Xu Zhu was a joy - very believable as the dehydrated old traditionalist. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack was very effective and performed without being overwhelming. <br /> <br /> If only more movies were filmed like in Hollywood or Hong Kong - a family-friendly, well-functioning, well-written, well-directed, near-perfect gem.
