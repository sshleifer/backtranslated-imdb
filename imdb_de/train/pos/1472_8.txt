Lots of digestion information, and if you've seen Zizek, you know his pace. <br /> <br /> Even if you have not seen most movies or at least some other films by the same directors mentioned in this document, you will be a little lost. <br /> <br /> And the movie list is long. The directors include Hitchcock (Psycho, Vertigo, Birds), Lynch (Lost Highway, Mullholland Falls, Wild at Heart, Blue Velvet), Tarkovsky (Stalker, Solaris) and The Conversation (Coppola). <br /> <br /> There are some Segway movies like, Star Wars: Espisode III, Matrix ... but I suspect it's bait. To be sure, Zizek is never boring, but if you do not buy (or mind) psychoanalysis, you'll be annoyed without end. <br /> <br /> But you should not be like setting clips as the movie is nested with these clips, Zizek's points never get boring.
