I had little trouble with this movie, and I've heard a lot of criticism that says it's overkill and overrated. It's been over three hours, but I was amazed it went by so fast. I do not think it's overrated at all, I think the IMDb rating is absolutely decent. The movie looks rich, with beautiful costumes and great effects, and the direction of James Cameron is rarely out of focus. Leonardo DiCaprio gives one of his best performances as Jack, and Kate Winslet is as beautiful as Rose. David Warner, a great actor, steals every scene he's in. The story is very rich in detail and is based on the character development, obviously with the love story, which is very moving, if need be, although in the first phase the movie is a bit slow. The last hour is extremely exciting and I must confess that I was on the edge of the seat when the Titanic sank. I will also say that the last five minutes have been very moving. The music of James Horner was lovely, though I was never a big fan of the song My Heart Will Go On. The miniseries of 1996 were good, but suffered from undeveloped scenarios and some historical inaccuracies. Overall, I give the Titanic 8.5 / 10th Bethany Cox.
