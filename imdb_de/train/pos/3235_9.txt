Excellent film, a realistic picture of today's Finland, touching and profound. One of the best Finnish films of all time. Captures the everyday life in a small town in Central Finland wonderfully, the desires and weaknesses of the people, joys and sorrows. The radiant sunshine of early autumn creates a cool atmosphere for this clear study of people in a charity. Lampela is indeed one of the most promising Finnish filmmakers. He shows that it is possible to make exciting films without machine guns and bloodshed. His next film, Eila, is also worth seeing, though the story of cleaning women who fight for their jobs is not quite as attractive as the destinies in Joki.
