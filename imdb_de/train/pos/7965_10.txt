This movie was awesome ... it made me laugh, it makes a scream and most of all, it has talking animals in it !! This movie should be seen by any people! It's one of my favorite movies, and I love it so much that I just had to comment it !!! it rox! it's such a feeling of heart and a wonderful story that makes a great and heartfelt movie! My favorite character is the shadow. That's because I think he's the most interesting and charming. I had a Golden Retriever like shadow, I miss him so much !!! He was my best friend and I knew he would be in a happier place when he died, but I miss him with all my heart !! This movie is the best I love and everyone should do it! Love your pets, no matter what they do, cherish them forever !!!
