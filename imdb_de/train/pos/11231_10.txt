I really like Star Trek Hidden Frontier. It's an excellent fan-fiction movie series and I can not wait to see more. I just watched this movie last week and can not get enough of it. I have already recommended it to other people to look at, as it is worth the view. I've seen each episode many times and I'm waiting for more episodes to come out. I rated it at ten, but I think it deserves a 12-inch compliment. My compliments to the staff of the Star Trek Hidden Frontiers for an outstanding job. If you like Star Trek, I recommend this Star Trek fanfiction movie. The detail associated with this film series is excellent, especially the ships and planets used in it
