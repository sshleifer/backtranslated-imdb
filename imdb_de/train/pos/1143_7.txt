I do not look soaps. My grandmother still sees that with the hourglass glass. I made fun of her when I was ten (it was so easy). <br /> <br /> But this movie makes parody and spells it out in a new way. I found the story damn funny. The fashions of the 80s - shoulder pads, sequins and polyester - complete the whole thing. The huge hair, the high heels and the histrionics - what a combination. <br /> <br /> And all the actors just go downtown, chewing their pieces together and spitting them out on a big, well-written pile. Sally, Kevin, Elisabeth - wonderful! Whoopi - great! Robert Downey - refreshing to see him in front of the tabloids when he had so much potential. And Garry: Why did we have to wait so long to see him in the movie? Leesa Gibbons - had not missed her, but it was nice to take her in as a real life entertainment reporter (and where do you actually apply for this job?) Sally climbs the drainpipe. Lucy Ricardo did it, how many times ?, like any comedian by Carol Burnett, until I do not know who and I can handle it, I could spit peanuts if I had them. Apparently, that's what you do when you're funny in a tall New York building. I'm just thankful that they did not pull out the flagpole. <br /> <br /> But it was cute, it was funny, it had plot twists, it had a spit before it was common, it was common clothes that deserve a second look, had a great cast and personal memories for me. Really, what do you need more?
