I just saw "The Last Wave" in the Fine Arts Library of my school. It is fascinating, like all things Peter Weir, but it is not always as attentive as I would have liked. I was intrigued by the ideas that were thrown at me (because they are handled very well by director Weir), but at the same time I was not stimulated enough by them. AKA I got a little bored in places. <br /> <br /> The plot surrounds an Australian lawyer obsessed with certain dreams he has that connect him to an Aboriginal group he defends. <br /> <br /> It starts with an intense weather sequence and has some very impressive mood effects (most notably the bizarre, "burping" sound design) and the strong focus. but it just did not entertain me like Weir's later films. I just have to look at it again. <br /> <br /> A good movie about obsession and mystery. Because the mystery that exists between the whites and the aborigines has some serious consequences in the end. God bless Peter Weir. Just for him this movie is worth seeing ... very organic director. Like an Aussie answer Malick! I would give it a 7 because it has enough great ideas to overcome its boring moments.
