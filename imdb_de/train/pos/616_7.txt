If any movie style could be called my "guilty pleasure," it would be this generic fantasy type. Guilt is the wrong word for it, because I am quite happy to be an escapist from time to time. "Stardust" is a good stock-taking fantasy, as one might expect from Neil Gaiman (or Gaiman adjustment, so to speak). It's not the visual dreamscape of Mirrormask, it's not the adult claim of Pan's Labyrinth, and it's not the lusty classic The Princess Bride, but it contains exactly what the fantasy lover knows enough to be completely comfortable throughout the entire viewing , Fantasy lovers should be happy - special effects work is finally good enough and cheap enough that this material is now regularly produced. <br /> <br /> The story of Stardust involves a young man named Tristan who wants to win The love and appreciation of the most beautiful girl in her little town of Wall goes on an adventure to fetch a fallen star. To make it difficult, Tristan's fallen star is actually a woman named Yvaine, and he's not the only one looking for her ... Some witches have greedy eyes on the immortality that the heart of the star can give, and the feud of one Brother over the magical kingdom leads murderous princes in their direction. <br /> <br /> Everything is pretty predictable from there, but it does contain some attractive fantasy elements, some warm-hearted comments about the nature of love and the best, Robert DeNiro as a gay pirate. In this sense, DeNiro's performance is absolutely punctual ... it's not the exaggerated lisp that most actors use to portray gay people, but a surprisingly effective one from someone who was once considered a rough and rugged type character (ie the (running) Joke about his character, which corresponds to DeNiro's own opening in alternative forms of representation.) DeNiro has not been so unique in his own image since Brazil, and that says something. <br /> <br /> Stardust is the kind of movie which may stay on the shelves of children and fantasy lovers for a long time, I can not say that it offers anything new, but it's not really there, those who are most familiar with the tropics will enjoy it the most.
