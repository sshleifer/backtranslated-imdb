This movie literally has every single action film clich√© and everyone works to his advantage. Straight from the deadly weapon, Gary Busey whispers through this film with such ruthless devotion that it can not help but enjoy and entertain. There are tanks, helicopters, machine gun battles, grenades, and ice cream trucks, and if they're not good enough to watch this movie, how about the best ... Danny Trejo. And if you do not know who Danny Trejo is, then you probably will not like this movie.
