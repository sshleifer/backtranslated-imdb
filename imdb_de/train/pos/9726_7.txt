Well, it was a nice surprise. The trailer did not predict a good movie, it was even a bit misleading. Especially the role of Jeff Bridges was a positive surprise, well written, sardonic and funny. Less real, but I do not think a guy who got there shows signs of such disrespect to everything his current company stands for. You do not become a top suit, just to suddenly doubt everything. The end of the film during the screening of Dolce Vita was too hackneyed, clich√© and rather disappointing. And of course, a guy like Pegg's character would not survive his first week in a flashy New York magazine like this one. I hope I'll one day see a decent role for Megan Fox, here she looked like a poor actress playing a fool. Incidentally, I do not see why she is the "sex symbol" of the year, I see on almost every front page hot girls.
