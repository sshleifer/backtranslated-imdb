Pufnstuf is what it is. I saw this at the age of 4 years in the cinema and have very good and vivid memories of it. If you look at it as an adult, you can see the references that are far beyond the minds of the target audience - like the one piece in which Jimmy's gray witch wig is torn off and Ms. Hazel (Cass) scoffs: "I knew she had brown roots! ". It is, of course, heavily influenced by the flower culture of the time and in some ways quite progressive. The track Different, for example, sends a clear message to young viewers that you are yourself, not running with the pack, and appreciating what's different about yourself. This could be a hymn for the gay community, it should be a great track. <br /> <br /> Martha Raye, Cass Elliot and Billie Hayes are all great as witches, and the Living Island performers give everything in the bounds of their character suits (including Billy Barty, Felix Silla and other famous names). There's a lot of over-acting in this movie - it's really nothing subtle, and when little Jack Wild has to voice his concern about the abducted inhabitants of Living Island, it's just more of a scream. This is a drama and a comedy that will be spread out with a trowel. While I think about it, I could never stand the flute. <br /> <br /> I love the soundtrack, especially the difference mentioned above, but also Zap The World, Pufnstuf and even touches of Jack Wild if I could. Also, it is now available on CD from the tasteful people at El Records in London. More information can be found here: www.cherryred.co.uk/el/artists/pufnstuf.htm
