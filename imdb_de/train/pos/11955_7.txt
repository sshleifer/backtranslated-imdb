Let yourself be transported to another kind of narrative art of the old school. Scoop is the classic Woody Allen. <br /> <br /> Allen's newest muse, Scarlett Johansson (who also appeared in Last Year's Match Point, also by Allen), is surprisingly able to calm her sultry sex kitten's appeal and get in a normal-looking student type with the help of Nerd's glasses and outfits, but does not let the audience believe that Hugh Jackman's gorgeous character can be so enthusiastic about her, given the background of the king (do not worry, here no spoilers). For Johansson's character, there are no major transformations here, as she plays the same character throughout, though the script says otherwise. They even forgive the apparent lack of logic of their character and continue an affair with a suspected serial killer, simply because he is his Royal Hotness Jackman, which is refreshing when he sees only the Wolverine boys. <br /> <br /> Consistency, if anything That's what 70-year-old Allen is all about. He continues to tell his stories about celluloid in the same way as always; as if he had never been confronted with modern filmmaking, which probably makes his quiet, simple films attractive. They never seem to go for a particular market. as if Allen is filming to his liking, whether the audience likes it or not.
