I love this program. Well, I'm not a big fan of many sci-fi shows, so if I look like them, I did not notice. I like the storybook quality of the cinematography. I even like the love story, even though I enjoy it, I wonder in the depth of my mind how much this part of the story really can develop, since Ned Chuck can not touch or ... well, you know. I even like Chuck, I do not find it annoying at all, and I generally hate overly cute, nice, perfect characters. I even like the narrator's voice, though it bothers one of my family members and bears some resemblance to some Walgreens commercials. I could make a small selection of all the other things about Ned's predicament and how the writers will deal with it in the future, but I just watch and see what story the authors are weaving.
