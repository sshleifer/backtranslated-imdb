A river flows through It is based on the true story of two fly fishing brothers, Norman and Paul (Brad Pitt and Craig Sheffer), whose Reverend Father (Tom Skerritt) is a stern man whose two passions are his beliefs and fly fishing. and for him and his sons there is a fine line between the two. This story describes the slow progression of the brothers' lives and how their lives separate in two different ways. It's a touching movie told by director Robert Redford. He plays the older Norman and reflects the times when people are already dead. <br /> <br /> Certain themes are recurrent in the film, such as memory, death, eternity and dreams. Most of these themes revolve around the almost tragic hero of Paul. He is a capable, charming and brave man, but has his fatal flaws. <br /> <br /> The final line summarizes the "point" of the movie: "Then in the arctic gloom of the gorge, all existence disappears into a being with my soul and my memories, the sounds of the Big Blackfoot River and a rhythm of four strokes and the hope that a fish will rise.However, all things merge into one, and a river flows through The river was intersected by the great flood of the world and runs over rocks from the cellar of time.On some of these rocks are located Timeless raindrops, under the rocks are the words and some of the words are theirs, I am persecuted by waters.
