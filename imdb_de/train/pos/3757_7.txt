Like a bunch of boys at school, we have to give it up a bit. Even the Grim Ripper made us smile. These two extraterrestrial things made me laugh, Bill and Ted were the stupidest, but the funniest in the whole movie. That's a lot better than the first. And yet I feel that something is missing. Something big. Something important. Made a better house and girlfriends. No, I would say better villains. I use clones instead of robots. I gave 7 out of 10 points because of these two robotic showers. When he fell from the sky, I split up. Splat, I'm not sure about these aliens. What where you? Scientist By no means.
