This is still the yardstick by which all Golden Contemporaries can be measured, and given the limited technical and dubious ethical standards of the authorities (on screen), it holds up against all generations of similar attempts since film and television. Fast and furious with plenty of Warner Bros cloths, and fortunately no time for a love interest, he gallops along and brings the great litter to a violent end. I never understood why Vance Procuratorate had to go everywhere, I always thought they had left the table. Palette as a detective, but especially Girardot as a doctor are delightfully eccentric and un-PC - when he surveys the second murder victim, he sniffs that there were already too many people in the world anyway. Of course it's William Powell as Philo Vance (and Michael Curtiz as director) who makes the film what it is - when did Powell ever make a dud? <br /> <br /> The army of police at the scene did not do it. It is really good to find the second dead body and the unconscious dog! Best of all, Vance tells us the sequence of events around the murders - dodgy sets of models combine with fantastic camera angles to create a very modern feel and amazing with what's gone before. The only problem is, as usual, that the conclusion can not agree with all of the displayed deductive processes, and a somewhat fictitious end is called. Of course, some chans, motos and many others could be closed this way too. But because it happens so quickly and ... is slightly morally dubious, it does not restrict my opinion on the status of KMC as a classic. <br /> <br /> All the prints I've ever seen from KMC are (at worst) like looking into a goldfish bowl, so if you're interested, see it until you're sucked in ,
