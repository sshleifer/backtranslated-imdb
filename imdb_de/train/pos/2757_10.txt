If you want to see a movie of a different kind, if you feel the love in your heart, even if you miss the Lord, this movie makes you think. Although Georges is mentally handicapped, in the end, when love gives you instructions, not the brain, you can see the ultimate intelligence. I am not emotional, but this movie makes you feel human. The movie is as good as Forrest Gump in my beliefs. The foreign films are sometimes more interesting, but there is not enough advertising to make them popular. "Rang-e khoda" (The Color of God) by Majid Majidi is another example of foreign films that have almost the same taste.
