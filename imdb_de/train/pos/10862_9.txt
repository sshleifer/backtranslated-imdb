Choice is a Chinese mob movie or Triads in this case. Every two years, elections are held to decide on a new leader, and there seems to be an initial push between Big D (Tony Leung Ka Fai or, as I know him, "The Other Tony Leung") and Lok (Simon Yam, who was Judge in full contact!). Although Lok has won, Big D refuses to accept the election and does everything he can to establish himself as the new leader. Unlike any other Asian movie that I see with gangsters, this movie is not an action movie. It has its bloody moments when needed, like in Goodfellas, but basically it's just a really effective drama. There are many characters that are really hard to follow, but I think it's a bit crazy. A 100-year-old baton, the symbol of power I mentioned earlier, changes hands several times before things calm down. And although it looks as if the movie ends at 65 or 70 minutes, there are still some big surprises to come. Simon Yam was my favorite character and anchored the picture, so to speak. <br /> <br /> At last year's Hong Kong Film Awards, Election was a laureate, winning the Best Actor (Tony Leung), Best Picture, Best Director (Johnny To, The Heroic Trio !!), and Best Screenplay , There were also nominations for cinematography, editing, film music (which I loved) and three more plays (including yam).
