From the author of "What ever happened to Baby Jane?" and "Hush .. Hush, Sweet Charlotte," this end of the sixties horror cycle has some weird and funky fun. Micheál Macliammóir makes a Victor Buono guy, but the movie too often blots dangerously close to a bad musical ... There's a particularly dreadful kids' evening that's about halfway through. Debbie knocks, tangos, and puts on a Harlow, while Winter's religious fanatic has a lesbian advantage. Agnes Moorehead checks in as an evangelist. Weaver has nothing to do - and even has to pay a gigolo to dance with Debbie.
