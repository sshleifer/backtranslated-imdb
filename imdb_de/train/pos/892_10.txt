sammo must have 10 out of 10 for this movie because he has it all. Great story, great fights, great characters and great cameos. <br /> <br /> In this movie, Dick sees him taking Billy Chow and Chong Fat. sammo takes charge of a casino, sammo loses the fight, but what a fight it is full of speed action and comedy elements is ching ying emerges in a cameo and gets killed - dug up. <br /> <br /> In the final sequence, you have to grab the rewind button as this is one of the best final fights I've ever seen. sammo picks up loads of guys and ends up with billy chow.
