A surprisingly effective thriller. David Duchovny and Michelle 'Ensign Ro' Forbes are a successful, professional couple, he is a writer, she is a photographer. Forbes desperately wants to move to California, and Mulder agrees to compromise, on the condition that they visit historic sites along the way, involving famous serial killers. His idea: he writes the words, she takes the pictures, resulting in a bestselling coffee table book that will bring them to life. To finance the trip, they decide to participate in the car and promote the fact. As bad luck sees, Brad Pitt sees the ad and shortly after he has killed his landlord, he and his girlfriend Juliette Lewis meet the writer couple and begin their cross country walk. Inevitably it comes to nonsense. <br/> <br /> Pitt is great for the really cool, inspiring Early Grayce and is supported by Lewis, who plays her usual white trash character, which is her default. Duchovny and Forbes also make for a convincing double act. When the events get out of control, you as a viewer will get into their plight and feel the tension. Exciting, scary and beautifully shot. This deserves recognition beyond the current status. A top movie.
