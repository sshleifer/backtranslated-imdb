This is one of those movies / pilots. If you knew BattleStar Galactica, it helps but is not necessary. What makes this story even more credible than BSG is that this is not going to happen in the future. This is so deep that it is amazing that it was not published theatrically. The leads could not have been better selected by such experienced and talented actors. Eric Stoltz is outstanding as a father, who will do everything to be reunited with his daughter, whether she is real or not. Paula Malcomson of Deadwood is as famous as his wife. You're not sure about his motives, whether it's love or money or both, but that makes this pilot even more fascinating. I see a star in the making of Zoe, played by the relatively unknown Alessandra Torresani and her performance. Esai Morales is great in his desire to see his loved one again and how wrong it is to even think about what he wants more than his moral objections. I did not think that this would be a good idea, as it was announced, but only by the pilot I am thrilled how we came to BSG stage history. It's great to see Adama as a child, already influenced and influenced by the various robots that are pervading life at this time. I just hope they can continue the stories to find out how they got the humanoid robots. This is an almost perfect pilot and I hope that you can continue the fantastic storytelling. Even the visual effects are better than most of the waste you see on the big screen. If you have not yet entered BSG, at least try it out. I bet you become a fan and want to see how the BSG story came about.
