I loved this movie since it came out. I was about nine years old, and now I'm 27. I remember playing the video game on Sega Genisis. I had so much fun, I would like to show this movie to my son. He also likes Michael Jackson and I know he'll love this movie as much as I did when I was a kid. Although he is much younger than me when I saw it for the first time. I can not wait to get out on DVD! I hope it comes out on DVD! Please leave it on DVD !! I long to see it again !!! Well, that's my comment. I hope I can see this movie again soon. I love all the videos in this movie. My favorite mini video is Badder!
