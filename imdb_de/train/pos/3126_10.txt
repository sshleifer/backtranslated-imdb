I can not just forgive ten stars. A movie really has to impress me, and The Bourne Ultimatum has gone far beyond. In addition, this trilogy has come together so beautifully that I believe that it is one of the biggest film trilogies of our time. Although all three films can no longer differ from the Ludlum novels, they are still an important milestone in film art. The Bourne ultimatum made me cry that the show was over, but I could not stop smiling for hours. Paul Greengrass has done it again. Everything we love from the previous Bourne films is here again: the action, the dialogue and, of course, the shaky camera. For me, the last was never a problem. I think that increases the tension. <br /> <br /> I'll see this movie several times before it's released on DVD simply because it's awesome. It is an absolutely satisfying conclusion and should prove to be a fantastic movie and an unforgettable trilogy as a whole.
