I have to say, Clive Barker's Undying is by far the best horror game ever made. I've played Resident Evil, Silent Hill, and the Evil Dead and Castlevania games, but none of them has captured the sheer joy of this game attacking its horrific elements. Barker is good at what he does, hanging on the horror of our world, and it shows how his hand is clearly unique throughout this game. Heck, his voice is one of the main characters. Full of lush graphics and enough atmosphere to shake a stick, Undying is the game I can beat in my books as the best horror title. I just wish this had come to a console system, but unfortunately bad PC sales stifled it in the bud.
