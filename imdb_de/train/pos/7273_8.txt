Carlos Mencia was excellent, this is an hour special. He worked hard to show everyone he was right. I know people said he stole footage in this special, but that's not true. Carlos does not do comedy the way he wants it, like any other, so he's so good. People say that he is not funny because he says Dee dee dee is too much, and they still have not realized that this is part of his plot, and they do not want it that way, but he does it anyway and creates it, to make people laugh. For all the haters out there, here's a message, Carlos is here to stay, you have no reason to try to bring him down.
