A very good start. I was a little surprised that the machines were not that advanced: they should be coarser, just as we saw them in the original series. The cast is interesting, though the volcano woman looks a little too human. She has to go to school on Spock because she is the role model for this race. Too bad they did not pick Jeri Ryan. I like Ms. Park, the Korean (?) Lady. The doctor has options. I did not sort out the other men, except the black guy. He is very sympathic. Bakula needs to find his niche - In QL, his strong sense of humor and his willingness to try everything. He is of course tall and strong enough for the exploits. The heavies were alright, although I did not like their make-up.
