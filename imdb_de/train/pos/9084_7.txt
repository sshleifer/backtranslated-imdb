Yes, some people have said that this movie is a waste of money, but I'm the kind of die-hard dragon / doomsday / holy crap action movie fan. My point was that this movie had some of the best action scenes, pretty much were good. But it's this kind of movie where everything became harder at the right time or just when the evil was drummed when something fell to save them at the right time. Although there were some funny lines and gangs throughout the movie that surprised me. <br /> <br /> The 3D graphics were damn good. I mean, the 3D effects were great for this kind of movie !!!! The big battle that was shown in the trailers matches the hype of the movie. The fight between good and evil was over, I have to say it could have been longer and a little bit better, but it was still pretty good. Now for the parts that I think could have been better. The beginning was pretty good, showing the parts that led to the big battles. I mean, if you do not really want to see this movie in the cinemas then this is at least a DVD player ... <br /> <br /> Overall, I liked the movie, but the storyline just fit too fast harder just too well fit.
