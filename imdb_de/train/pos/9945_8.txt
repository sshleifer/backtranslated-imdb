The important things first! This is not an action movie, although there is a lot of action in it! I think you can compare it to American sports movies! If a team of very bad players succeed in the unbelievable, you win a game or a tournament that exceeds expectations! In this case, it's not about football or baseball, but Taekwondo! In the beginning, these street bats seem to be good for nothing! But soon we will find out that they do not want to be thugs and actually want to achieve something in life! It's nice to see them fight and train! I was surprised how funny this movie was. From beginning to end you laugh at your pants! The young Korean actors are very convincing! Have a look at this wonderful feel-good film!
