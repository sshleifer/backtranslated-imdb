I saw this movie on cable, it was really funny, from the stereotypical police chief to the stereotypical big bad guys, Jay Leno and Mr. Mayagi of Karate Kid Star in this good comedy about a prototype auto part. I compare this movie to "RUSH HOUR," where a local police officer has to work with an Asian police officer to solve a case. The hunt through the farmers' market in downtown Detroit evokes memories. Pleasant soundtrack, good script, I give 10/10.
