Nick Nolte does an outstanding job in Kurt Vonnegut's dark story. Notle plays Howard W. Campbell, who worked as a double agent in propaganda during the Second World War. After the war, he lives anonymously until competing factions want to dig up his past. As with many of Vonnegut's works, this is a meditation on the absurdity of war and those who use propaganda for their own ends. Nolte is fantastic - confident and confident like the younger Campbell, and then broken and pursued as an older man forced to pay for the sins of his past. (7 out of 10)
