Also, I have had a very painful personal loss (Twice), and this film shows very well the real reality of this experience, life out of balance, nothing makes sense, well meaning relatives, etc.> It was nice to see Ally again. She is one of my favorite actresses of all time. <br /> <br /> I laughed and cried as the story unfolded. Great story and cast. Well done!
