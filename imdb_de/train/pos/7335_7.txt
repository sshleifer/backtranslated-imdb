With Ralph Bakshi, most of his films look like double-edged swords. You get something great out of it, but only if you're satisfied with the stupid and the unnecessarily cheeky trick. The Lord of the Rings was a great adaptation of the story that might not always shine in the animation department. <br /> <br /> From a bakshi point of view, Fire and Ice is a great achievement from an animation point of view. The rotoscopy is much more detailed and the animation is lively. There are still some of the dull still-cells and slightly blurry wallpapers, but overall, the look has definitely gotten better since Bakshi's latest fantasy epic. The animation has almost a realistic-naturalistic style, and unlike LOTR, where this style often does not match the actual content, it enhances the film's unique atmosphere. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the movie can not be created a meaningful story out of its simple environment and most of the motivations of the characters are pretty blurry. Lorn and Tigra are simple cases, but even the main villain Necron was hard to follow, not to mention that guy with the furry face mask (also referred to as "the guy"). Although most of the voice actors were adequate, there are some weird quirks in the audio department, and Tigra sounds particularly horrible when she screams. <br /> <br /> I believe, however, that the film's inherent entertainment value outweighs its unnecessary value stupid execution of the plotline. The sparse coats of characters will never get over you, but it helps you to remember that maybe this movie should not even be taken too seriously. It is still a bit cool and very funny.
