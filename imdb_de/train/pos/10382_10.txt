As with all other reviewers, after 30 years, this movie is a fixture in my mind. I remember going to the library and finding out everything about this story. I even wrote to the PBS station for more information. Despite all this, I could only find out that this was a story that appeared in a newspaper in the early 1900s and there it was, a VHS copy of the film. There was one more bidder, but I was determined to win this movie. The losing bidder wrote to me asking for a copy I gave her. Despite possessing a copy, I eventually searched for and searched for a site where a DVD copy of the movie was sold.
