Before Tuscan Sky I saw Diane Lane's tender performance in this otherwise so-called lark of a movie. Campers are invited to their youth camp and experience it as adults. Anyone who returns seems to be looking for something he has lost that makes him so realistic. Maybe you had to be a camper to really understand it, but in the words of a character who realized that all her clothes were wet, "this is a camp!" From the practical jokes and quarrels about friends, to the fearsome midday lady and the early morning bell ... it's amplifier. Once exciting activities now seem banal. A terrific ensemble cast makes the most of one-dimensional roles and makes them believable. Bill Paxton, Diane, Elizabeth, Mrs. Brad Paisley (probably when he first falls in love with her !!) The beautiful scenery, bright colors, comic music (including variations of Hello Muddah) and a comic acting by the well-known director Sam Raimi make this one Film that can be pulled over and over again, like visiting an old friend.
