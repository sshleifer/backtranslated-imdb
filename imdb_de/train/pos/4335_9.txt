Oscar caliber performance by Peter Falk in an Oscar-written role. I loved the differentiated, balanced exploration of a long-standing marriage - how often do we get that in movies, where the movie usually ends when Boy and Girl get together? This is a movie for adults, a complex look through the eyes of all parties - husband, wife, son - as both have adapted to each other in the past and are growing throughout the story. In addition, I had about ten major belly laughs, and I'm one of those people who usually sit unused when the rest of a crowd laughs. This was one of the few really funny movies I've seen. Great, original jokes.
