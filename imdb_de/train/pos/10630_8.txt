I find it regrettable that the main commentary on this film contains the words "ignorant and horrible nonsense". I think it's a very funny movie and an excellent conversation. One must expose the unbelief that a homosexual man and a lesbian woman fall in love, have a child and live happily together. But it is always wonderful to see how it is played in a movie and the heart is warmed up. Is that so impossible? There are far more implausible events that are described in other films. The drama is good, the script is funny. The only negative comment is that the story might end when the family moves away from their original home instead of continuing to investigate whether the man retains any remaining homosexuality.
