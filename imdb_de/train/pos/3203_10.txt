I think this movie was one of Kurt Russel's good movies. Kurt Russel is my favorite actor, so I think he's a good actor in every role he plays. But this movie had a lot of action and I know it should have more than a 5.6 by 10 meter, but many people did not like this movie. Well, I thought it was good, so I think everyone should watch this movie. If you see and like this movie, I think you should watch Back Draft with Kurt Russel as well. I give out Soldier *** 1/2 *****
