Doghi is a wonderful movie and Renuka Daftardar is excellent. So is Uttara Baokar, who is usually excellent in most of her roles. Together with Kairee, it's an example of Marathi Cinema at its best. There are certain parts in both films that are prone to didactics - it would probably have improved the film so as not to have the few scenes where the social message is hammered. These scenes probably come from the filmmaker's political concerns, but the film is realistic and moves enough not to need it. Apart from such minor issues, it's a movie that deserves to be seen more, and I strongly recommend it. Sumitra Bhave's concern and humanism shine through.
