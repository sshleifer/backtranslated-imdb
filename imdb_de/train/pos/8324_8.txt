This is a romantic comedy in which Albert Einstein, wonderfully played by Walter Matthau, and his friends form a playmate for his niece (Meg Ryan) and a talented auto mechanic (Tim Robbins). The interplay of these leading roles is supported by a grand cast of recognized character actors. This movie is cute and fun ... a "feeling-rascal"! Warm recommendations.
