Probably the best movie of the year for me. This little French movie is all about secretary Carla (Emmanuelle Devos), who spent her days doing the work of other men, not in the credits, and being the source of her contempt and lunch talk, which you only too clear appears, as she is partially deaf reads the lips. A change is set in motion when she hires the recently released cheater Paul (Vincent Cassel) as an assistant. The relationship that develops between them is the center of the film. The interdependence for different reasons connects them. Carla feels attracted to Paul and he feels, for the first time, to be attractive. Paul does not do anything to dispel her feelings because he needs her help. He owes money to a local gangster and formulated a plan to steal him, which will bring Carlas' lip reading skills. I think the main thing that pushes the movie far beyond an average tension / drama is the amazing chemistry between the two stars. Throughout the film, you can feel the amazing connection between Carla and Paul, no matter what other characters on the screen are. I can not remember when I saw such sexual chemistry between two actors. Emmanuell Devos gives a brilliant performance (she won the French Cesar for Best Actress). You never have the feeling to see acting, that's really Carla. The chameleon like Vincent Cassel is also wonderful. He makes a somewhat unappetizing character appealing and attractive. I loved this movie because of these two people, and when I finished the movie, I wanted to go back to the movies and get involved with them again.
