My daughter, her friends, and I have seen this movie literally dozens of times. I bought it twice and some little friends fled with it. Then I rented it so often. It just never gets old !!! Blockbuster does not even have it in their offers anymore and I've been trying to buy, find and rent it for over 5 years. Without a doubt, this was and is my favorite childhood movie of my daughter ... it has everything! We laughed, we cried, we talked about real life and how hard some kids are in the world. Nothing was faked on this film. We referred to every second and every line Bill! Thank you, a million for restoring our belief in human nature. Sincerely, Shelleen and Kailin Vandermey. Craven, Saskatchewan. CANADA, eh !!! :-) <br /> <br /> Update August '07: <br /> <br /> Who should we judge if a rich woman falls in love with a poor man? or a man who has love chooses a child that is not his own. It can not be my or your life. Not only is it credible, it happens every day. Thank God! Keep my faith in human nature alive !!! celebrate!!!!
