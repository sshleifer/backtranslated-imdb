Some movies just should not be recreated. This is one of them. It's not a bad movie in and of itself. But it does not succeed to capture the taste and the terror of the film of the same name from 1963. Liam Neeson was excellent as he always is and most performers except Owen Wilson, who simply did not have the right character for Luke. The main flaw in this version, however, is that it deviated too far from the story of Shirley Jackson in her attempts to be great and lost some of the thrill of the previous film as a compromise for sharper special effects. I would like to say once again that it is not a bad movie in and of itself. But you will enjoy the friction of terror in the older version much more.
