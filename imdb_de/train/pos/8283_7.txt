A solid B-movie. <br /> <br /> I like Jake Weber. Its unobtrusive delivery refreshes in a time when excellence is surpassed. I liked the relationship between father and son. I liked the family dynamics. The wendigo looks stupid, but it is a representation of the children's toy and the dead deer. It's a merger, you understand? This is a psychological story, not a Freddy Slash emblem, an instant gratification strip. Look at it and think about your inner child and what the movie might have to tell you.
