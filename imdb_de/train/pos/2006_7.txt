At this point it seems almost unnecessary that Jon Bon Jovi as Derek Bliss provides a solid, strong and seamless performance. His ability as an actor was previously recognized through his critical acclaim achieved in other films (The Leading Man, No Looking Back). If anyone wonders, Jon Bon Jovi can act. He can behave well and that is expected of him. It's easy to separate Derek from the guy who pulls out hits on VH-1. <br /> <br /> I would not normally watch a horror movie. I now expect them to focus on the sensational mind rather than dialogue and conspiracy. What I liked most about this movie was the fact that a realizable conspiracy was really going on. The gusset is not so much the focus of the film and has no disturbing realistic quality of films with higher technical effects. Gore fans may be disappointed, but story fans will not. <br /> <br /> Unlike an action movie like U-571, in which the dialogue leaves behind the bombast, we have a chance to "experience the good." Some scenes are not explained (like Derek's hallucinations), but you feel that certain aspects are like laying the foundation for a sequel, with Hollywood's lack of interest Unfortunately, this sequel will never happen on this film, and these few instances are forgivable to know that vampires could have been a sequential series. <br /> <br /> This is the best movie I've ever seen in my life "Is it a good way to spend about two hours talking?" Yes, the person who fears horror movies will not be completely disappointed with insomnia and the horror movie lover, if you are somewhere between the horror Genre Lovers and the Horror Genre Lover, this movie is for you - it achieves a happy medium when the effects and the story balance each other out . <br /> <br />
