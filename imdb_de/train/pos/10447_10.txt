There are many people in our lives who we meet only once in our lives, but for some reason we remember those people for the rest of our lives. These unique friendships exist between people of great distances and there are always natural reasons why we do not meet these people anymore. We do not always know their names because we are never introduced, and sometimes we even forget to ask what their names are. It's funny how normal humanity sometimes makes friends, and we like to keep it as such because reunification can destroy many memories, or we do not know if they do. We are too scared to find out. <br /> <br /> The movie 'Before Sunrise' just caught me watching. I never intended to go through it, but as the discussion between the two seemed interesting, I watched the rest of the movie. I did not know what to expect, but not the young couple either. They had time to discuss each other until dawn, and everything could happen before they had to part. I think this movie had good reviews because the situation was experienced by everyone on this planet at least once or twice. It makes us all think about all the people we have only met once in our lives.
