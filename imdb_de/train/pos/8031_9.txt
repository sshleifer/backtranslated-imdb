This is a military drama that I really like! Tom Berenger plays the military assassin Thomas Beckett. This Marine is no nonsense in your face and no questions are asked to do the person who did the work. There is Billy Zane ("The Phantom" and others), who plays Richard Miller, a former D.C. SWAT who works for the government and only takes orders from them. Who needs a bureaucrat? Not me! When these two pairs are connected, sparks should fly. And how. But Beckett teaches the young bureaucrat how it works. If the other sniper hits, it's joke vs. Joke, cat against mouse, shooter against shooter. And if the experienced sniper gets caught, it's up to Miller to put the policy aside and save him. Anyone who needs politics, if you are a professional like Beckett, has only received orders from himself, follows the rules and not the book, and despite the policy, mutual respect is achieved. The movie was a direct success. Look at it. Rating 4 out of 5 stars.
