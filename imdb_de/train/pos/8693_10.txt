I was quite young when it came out in the US, but I picked it up from TV and kept watching it until I memorized it. To this day, I still catch myself quoting. The show itself was funny and had many famous characters, from Frank Sinatra to Sylvester Stallone to Mr. T. The voices were great and sounded just like the characters they portray. The dolls were also well done, if a bit scary. I was amazed when I found out that it was written by Rob Grant and Doug Naylor of Red Dwarf, a show that I really enjoy. As another person wrote in a comment earlier, I, too, was robbed of this great show by a "friend" who lent it and never returned it. I certainly wish there was enough demand for this show to justify a DVD release, but I do not think enough people have heard of it. Well, maybe I'll try e-bay ...
