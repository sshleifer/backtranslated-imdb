I'm afraid it was a movie you have to ACTIVATE to get something out. It's not a pointless movie like ... "LEATHAL WEAPON PART 58" - Do you know where Riggs is really crazy? It's not a movie that's pretty much the same in the end, since it's the beginning. You can talk on the phone, talk on the phone, whatever, and enjoy it in every way. I've found in the past that most people who do not like this kind of movie are the guy who will do almost anything but watch a movie and then pop it because ..... they do not understand it or understand or what happened. <br /> <br /> Do not let your bitch take a shower !!!
