Although this has not been seen in too many films so far, you've certainly seen the basic storylines in too many films. <br /> <br /> None of Grants or Loy's best films, they do a great job together. With so much talent and a very good side occupation, you know that the laughs will be there. <br /> <br /> The film is light, has some dramatic stains, but keeps the action moving and makes you smile. <br /> <br /> A great example of the classic American movie award that has passed the test of time. <br /> <br /> Definitive Saturday afternoon price, heavy on the popcorn.
