"What would you do?" is a question that will be remembered for weeks after seeing the emotional Brokedown Palace. You'll also wonder if Alice (Danes) has told the truth or not - a topic that rightfully remains unresolved. This is a very well-made and beautifully filmed movie. It may be slow at times, but its pace reflects the storyline - but much of the film will get you to the edge of your seat; want to know what happens next. In the end, you will also follow in the footsteps of the main characters brilliantly played by Kate Beckinsale and Claire Danes. The performance of Bill Pullman is also commendable.
