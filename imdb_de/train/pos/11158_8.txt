Shocking, well-made radiator is an underrated story of cruel murder and evil forces. The doctor of a small town is trying to find out who or what is committing a series of violent sexual murders. Incubus is a close mystery, with some terrible murder sequences that evolve into an unconventional and sinister climactic twist. The murder scenes are intense and bloody, so this is not a movie for the squeamish! The direction of John Hough, along with a bizarre musical score, creates a dark atmosphere of fear that runs through the film. It also has a kind of gothic flair. Beautiful filming locations and stylish camera work are also a highlight. <br /> <br /> The cast is not bad either. The great John Cassavetes makes a solid performance as a new doctor in the city. Also good are the performances of Kerrie Keane as a local reporter, Helen Hughes as a city historian, and Duncan McIntosh as a tormented psychic teenager - discovered and reevaluated. <br /> <br /> *** from ****
