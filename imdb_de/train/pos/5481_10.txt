For me, this was more of a wake-up call, and the realization that almost everything we see, hear, read, and think about, depends on everything depends on what the media feeds us. This is a classic example of high-level spin doctors trying to control the masses through controlled information. It is also an excellent example of how people whose condition they freely bought are not influenced by this media control or by attempted misinformation. This shows once again that the needs of the many at the end of the day will actually outweigh the needs of the few. It is also instructive to see that democracy is not really a difficult thing in a country where no religious civil war is taking place.
