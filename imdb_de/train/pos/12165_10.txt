Frownland is like one of those most embarrassing situations where you end up laughing at exactly the wrong time. and the moment you realize that you should not laugh, you have already reached the summit of the voice. and if you look around, the ghostly white faces with their mouths wide open and glazed eyes, you feel a piercing pain that starts in the pit of your stomach and suddenly rushes into your throat and ... well, you have the point. <br /> <br /> But despite all the inconvenience and blows on his face, Frownland is truly a remarkable piece of work that turns you into something after watching the inarticulate confusion of a protagonist and all his miserable problems and mishaps scratch out your own eyes and at the same time you feel sorry for him. It would have been much easier for me to just leave Ronald Bronstein's film, but for some Mad reason, there was the unwavering determination to stay the course and experience all the grainy irritation of the film. If someone sets you on fire, you usually want to delete it: Stop! Fall! And roles! But with this movie you want to watch the flame slowly engulf your entire body. They endure the pain - perhaps out of defiance or an unknown masochistic curiosity that I can not even explain. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, cinema in mainstream cinema will never come to a theater near you. If you have a chance to catch it, get ready: Bring a dog sack.
