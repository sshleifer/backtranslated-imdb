The kids aged 7 to 14 got such a big kick out of this movie that we copied all the other kids on our birthday list this year. Everyone loved it! Children from 2 to 7 years look at this often and often, and we get a kick when we see it with them. <br /> <br /> It's rare that a movie entertains the kids for so long and laughs for the adults. also. Most people enjoy it more than the first one. <br /> <br /> High quality production and excellent cast, led by Christopher Showerman as a superior George - athletic, energetic and totally believable, with a lovable innocence and a special one can take a tree in the face - well supported by the inimitable one Christina Pickles like the evil mother in law, the Thomas Haden Church as the bad jerk and everyone else. That is fun.
