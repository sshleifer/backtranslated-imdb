Simply one of the best ever! Richard Brooks' adaptation of Truman Capote's novel is a true artistic achievement. Stunning black and white cinematography (which should have won an Oscar), a compelling Quincy Jones score, and great performances by Robert Blake and Scott Wilson as uncommonly coordinated killers. This film was 0 for 4 at the Academy Awards and was not even nominated for the Best Picture, while Dr. Imagine that! <br /> <br /> Although you do not get to know the Clutter family as well as in the book, it was a good decision to focus more on Perry and Dick and the painful process of following these guys down. John Forsythe is also impressive as Alvin Dewey. There are simply no shortcomings in this. 10 out of 10. Best Performance = Scott Wilson with R. Blake in second. Highly recommended!
