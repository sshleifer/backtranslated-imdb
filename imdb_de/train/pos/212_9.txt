Much like the comedy duo of his title, "The Sunshine Boys" has become a forgotten classic over the last 30 years. Among other major comedies of the 70s, it is hardly mentioned. Given the unique nature of this film, perhaps the best Neil Simon ever wrote, it makes no sense. Walter Matthau plays Willy Clark, once half of a legendary variety comedy called Lewis and Clark, the now bitter 73-year-old solo act who can not find a job in a potato chip spot. His nephew and agent Ben (Richard Benjamin) is sure he can get work when Willy meets his partner Al Lewis (George Burns) for an ABC TV show-business nostalgia show. <br /> <br /> Nostalgia is what dwarfs "Sunshine Boys", right at the beginning, as a series of 1920s movie clips featuring long-time entertainers, accompanied by Cole Porter's "Be A Clown" flickers. Then there's the movie's setting in Manhattan, where flared pants and wide polyester ties are present. In Willy's fabled confusion of an apartment in Manhattan, times collide with framed photos and cartoons of long-dead celebrities staring out the walls, while the boulevard headlines and empty Zabar shopping bags are empty. If you were like me in the 70s, you might even feel like you're in this apartment. <br /> <br /> Willy has been staying there too long. He sleeps in front of the TV as the kettle cooks in the other room. Willy wakes up and picks up the phone. <br /> <br /> "Hello, who is this?" A break. "It does not matter, it's the tea." Old men who live alone can be sad material in almost every other hand, but Simon's clever wit and incorruptible sense of character make this adaptation of his 1972 stage hit a comedy gold. The amazing thing about "The Sunshine Boys" is how much it rubs their noses in Willy's almost existential state, without even turning them off. "89 years old and just so he dies of nothing," Willy says of an old songwriting friend, before deciding that the man probably died of a song that rhymed "Lady" with "baby." <br /> <br /> Burns won an Oscar for his discreet performance as a gentle but steely Lewis, but it's Matthau who brings this home. His make-up and his proud, but awkward stock really sell you on the idea that he was already 73 years old. Willy is extremely obnoxious and thoroughly deserves Ben's description of "crazy old man", but you have to find him everywhere and enjoy his little victories, even if they are at the expense of others' patience. His lines are also killing you, especially if he's trying to kill Lewis, for whom reuniting the TV is a bad idea. <br /> <br /> "You are out of touch!" Willy eventually tells Lewis. "I'm still in demand, I'm still hot!" <br /> <br /> "If this room was going up in flames, you would not be hot," replies Lewis. <br /> <br /> Director Herbert Ross photographed everything very casually and unobtrusively, with low light and center shots, even in emotional moments, to leave room for the comedy and the entire Zen message of the film through silent acceptance. You never have the feeling of watching a movie, one of "The Sunshine Boys", many charms, and Ross' direction, like the three main characters, does a lot to help achieve that goal. <br /> <br /> Comedy is hard, especially when people watch people passing by, but "The Sunshine Boys" makes it all a pleasure because it's for us to see.
