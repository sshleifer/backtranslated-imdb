Excellent farce! Which, of course, is all it should be. Fortunately, there is neither a social or political message nor the slightest attempt in that direction. Could the action actually have taken place or occurred at a certain time or place? Unlikely, because this is just a movie, and movies spring from fantasy, not reality. The only goal of this film is to entertain, certainly not to educate and entertain, with the reality of delightfully and light-heartedly thrown into the wind. I think most would agree that we expect documentation to be educative and authentic. But for entertainment, I want what is today referred to as a "children's game", which is The Mating Game in every way. For a few giggles and a regular laugh every now and then, this is a fine sample.
