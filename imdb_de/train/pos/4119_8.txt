Another demonstration of Kurosawa's genius, his first color film, is a grim surreal look at the tragic life of the Tokyo slum dwellers, essentially a series of interlaced vignettes depicting several groups of people having a dangerous existence in a tough and dangerous world careless slums after the war exploit. Moving from comedy to tragedy and back, this film shows how people, in their own way, deal with the worst kinds of life, tend to retreat into themselves and live in the fantasy worlds of their own minds, emotionally, by their fellow human beings retreat or drown yourself in alcohol. Kurosawa mixes the realism of the kitchens with kabuki-like theaters and plays with the emotions of his audience, tears and laughter with equal skill. A wonderful experience
