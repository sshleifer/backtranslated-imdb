The memory of "The Last Hunt" has remained with me since I saw her in 1956 at the age of thirteen. It was a film that was far ahead of others at the time, such as the treatment of the natives, the environment, and the ubiquitous contrast between the short and long term effects of greed. It is just as relevant today as it was in 1956, a cross-film discussion of the greatest depth and relevance. The environment is beautiful and the cinematography excellent. The memory of this movie will stay with me until the end of my days.
