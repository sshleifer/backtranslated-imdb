I must say, from the beginning, when I saw the Stargate movie, I was not blown away or like an average sci-fi movie with a lot of POTENTIAL, though the movie was not that, um, amazing as other science fiction movies like Star Wars or Aliens, who, if you're a science fiction fanatic, will admit one of those titles is amazing, even though I'm not as much of a hardcore science fiction fan as some folks I remember one Line from these two films. I'm not a big fan of Star Wars T-shirts. If you saw me, I would look like you to an average person. That's that you do not have to be a big hardcore science fiction fan to like this great show, which unfortunately ended after 10 amazing seasons without any loss of quality End came closer. <br /> <br /> Although I did not like the movie very much, I was really looking forward to the first season of 1997, and let me tell you that the special effects were just one of the highlights. The brilliant things in the series, the chemistry between the characters just blew me away, the special effects were just as good, if not better, than most sci-fi shows today. I have to admit that I would never have gone to sci-fi if Stargate had not been, and my dad, who really got me into sci-fi when I was 6, and I'm glad he did it I have not seen the brilliant shows like SG1, which in my opinion sets the standard for almost all sci-fi series and films. Basically, if a new sci-fi series is not better or better than SG1, it's not worth watching. Basically, this is the best sci-fi show ever, and if you do not see it, you have no idea what you're missing!
