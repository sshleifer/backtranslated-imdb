An unusual role that Eddie Murphy plays at the height of his career. Although there is a lot of "Eddie Murphy", he plays a really decent person. The rest of the cast is good, especially the beautiful Charlotte Lewis. The beauty and serenity of her character prevented the film from becoming too much Murphy.
