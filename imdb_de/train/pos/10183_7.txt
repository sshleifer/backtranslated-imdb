This is probably Karisma at her best, apart from Zubeidaa. Nana Patekar does his best without trying. The story is at times very good, but it seems to end up, especially when Shahrukh comes into the picture. What I really liked was the performances of the leads, the dialogue delivery and the story for what it was. It could have been better addressed and edited. The supportive case was even great, including Karima's mother-in-law, even though she only had one glittering moment, it was great to see her. <br /> <br /> The sets were pretty good too. I do not really like their portrayal of a Canadian family, but once they're in India, it's as real as it gets. <br /> <br /> All in all, I would make an effort!
