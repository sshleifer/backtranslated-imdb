This is one of my favorite movies of all time, PERIOD. I can not imagine another movie that combines so many beautiful movie qualities like this one. This streak has everything: action, adventure, science fiction, good against evil and even some romance (without even an innocent "peck" on the cheek between Pazu and Sheeta). The best part is that you do not have to be in the cafeteria to "get some of it" and enjoy the movie as you do with some of Miyazaki's other films (I do not know about you, but I'll take a look Watch movies to take a break.) Thinking). This is just a thoroughly enjoyable movie everyone will like, so do yourself a favor and buy it. The only acidic note is the American dubbing. I just found Vander-Geek annoying. But not all is lost, the Japanese original version is on the two-disc set and it rocks! Who cares if you do not understand spoken Japanese? If you can read at secondary level, watch the Japanese original recording with English subtitles. You will not regret it.
