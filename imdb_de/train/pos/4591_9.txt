It is depressing to see where Jackie Chan has landed. It was an unstoppable hurricane of blows, kicks and incredible stunts. To be fair, he is now in his fifties and one would expect a slowdown. But with "Rush Hour 3", where he takes Chris Tucker (of all people!) Behind, and then "Kung Fu Panda", where he plays not only a purely vocal role, but that his character has little dialogue. .. to say that Jackie Chan has seen better days is a colossal understatement. <br /> <br /> It's times like these when the only solution is to pull out a dusty old VHS tape and watch Jackie kick some asses in his younger home, Fitter, Chris Tucker-free days. <br /> <br /> Enter 'Police Story'. Jackie Chan plays Kar-kui, a police officer whose job it is to protect a witness from a major trial. He faces the opposition of both the uncooperative witness and the numerous inmates sent by the mob to silence both. <br /> <br /> But on the other hand, who cares? We do not see Jackie Chan films for the story. We watch Jackie Chan perform stunning stunts and usually beat and kick a bunch of people who are less great than himself. <br /> <br /> And at this level, 'Police Story' is not disappoint at all. In the end, there's a fantastic showdown in a mall that causes Jackie to slip down a giant high-voltage chandelier. Seriously, when such a thing happened more often, no man would ever be forced to buy clothes. <br /> <br /> There is also a comedy in which Kar-kui unintentionally disturbs May (Maggie Cheung). , his eternally suffering and seemingly forgiving girlfriend. The humor is pretty unremarkable on the whole, but it does not work, I'm not complaining. <br /> <br /> The drama is not too subtle either. In fact, I'm not sure if 'Police Story' has anything subtle at all. Director Jackie Chan (yes, he does) has a deep understanding of why we watch his films and knows that while we wait for the next fight, we're the last thing we want to do, looking for nuance and depth and inner meaning. <br /> <br /> So 'Police Story' is a hit. As with most of his films, the fact that Jackie actually does the stuff on the screen puts head and shoulders above the competition. I mean, when Jackie Chan really hangs on a raging bus on an umbrella, a whole new "wow!" Factor is added to the action.
