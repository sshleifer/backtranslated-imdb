Rented and watched this short (<90 minutes) work. It's by far the best treatment Modesty has received in the movie - and its creator Peter O'Donnell agrees and participates as a "Creative Consultant". The character and we who love are treated with respect. The direction of Spiegel is the best he has done so far and the casting has been done very well. Alexandra Staden fits almost perfectly with the original Jim Holdaway illustrations by Modesty. A terrific find of everyone who has occupied them! Raymond Cruz was also honored as a young Rafael Garcia. I hope that Tarantino & Co. I will be particularly interested in whom they would choose as incomparable Willie Garvin!
