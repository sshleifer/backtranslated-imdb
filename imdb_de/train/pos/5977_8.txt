Teenager Eddie spends his life being bullied and humiliated because he is obsessed with heavy metal music. One day he learns that his hero Sammi Curr has died, allegedly burned by the establishment that wanted to put an end to his music. But Eddie has his last record, which was never released, and when he plays them, he receives messages telling him how to deal with his tormentors. Shortly afterwards, Sammi revealed that he intends to live again at the local Halloween party to seek revenge on the city that once ridiculed him. Sammi himself is an original horror movie villain dealing with the obsessions of the "Rock Music Evils" of the 80s. It is worth seeing.
