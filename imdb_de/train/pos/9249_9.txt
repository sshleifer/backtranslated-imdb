This movie is funny, visible and touching. And now you often see how Jean Harlow (or another actress of that time) gives another woman a quick punch in the jaw? (Twice!) <br /> <br /> After Harlow's Ruby was sent to a Reformation after mixing with Gables Edward Hall (he of that cheesy, but loveable, crooked smile), her situation becomes even more difficult when she discovers that she is pregnant, and she is convinced that rake left her, but in fact she has reformed her love and he comes to her, although he is arrested and married with the help of a minister. <br /> <br /> The wonderful relationship Harlow associates with her inmates is second to her electrical chemistry with Gable, her most common male. Her cynical character goes perfectly with Gables smooth crooks. What is not to like? <br /> <br /> "You know, you would not be a bad-looking lady - if it was not your face!" Ruby comments sharply to Gypsy, her rival. "If you come so close to me, I have to open the other window!" <br /> <br /> Priceless !!!
