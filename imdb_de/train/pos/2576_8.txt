I belong to the "Christopher Reeve Generation". You can say he was the best actor Superman has played so far, but that does not stop me from enjoying other actors in that role, and George Reeves gives a good impetus to knocking Chris off the top, even though he's just just goes down. That does not stop me from enjoying this movie, it has a lot to offer. It has everything a movie needs, a plot with beginning, middle and end, and all these parts are written intelligently. The film is somewhat unconventional in both acting and acting, but with tights. The story is both exciting and meaningful. This is a movie with a message that is not preachable. I am still amazed that this was shot over 12 days, oh the glory days of Hollywood, when we did not have to wait 5 years just to see if the movie went to hell ... The movie is polished and expertly done. Directed by Lee "Roll'em" Sholem, known for fast and efficient governance. It never stops the limitations of technology, in fact some creative measures are taken to create the effect of flying. These include attaching a camera to a truck boom, shooting up, and driving fast to make it look like we're seeing it. Superman also sees some close-ups of George in progress and a long shot of an animated Superman. <br /> <br /> This is now available on DVD as an additional feature in the first season of the George Reeves Television series. A DVD that's worthy of being independent, involving the film as an original whole, is a cherry on the cake. <br /> <br /> Give Blood Today God Bless!
