No hidden agenda. Pure scifi. All fun. <br /> <br /> I saw the original on TV and was pretty scared. I was a kid :) <br /> <br /> The original can be valued more than the new one that I have seen and forgotten. The original with great movie star Steve McQueen (BULLET) is by far the better and the only version everyone should see. <br /> <br /> The movie production is outdated, but the movie that made the blob is the test of the times. I was convinced that this thing moved on its own. 10/10 <br /> <br /> zafoid
