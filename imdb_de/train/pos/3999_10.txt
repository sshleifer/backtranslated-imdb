I'm embarrassed to say that I missed "The Mother" when it was in the cinemas. I saw it on DVD tonight. I gave 10 votes, one of the few I have given here. This English Independent is filmed with such great care and quality. It attracted me relentlessly. The story, unobtrusive and purely human, is brutally honest and exciting thanks to the acting of Anne Reid, Daniel Craig and Cathryn Bradshaw. The cinematography is stunning. The score is firmly attached to the plot. The storyline is epic and brilliantly portrayed by writer Hanif Kureishi in secular life. This story deals with major problems with the subtlety of an Impressionist painting. And some of these big issues are highly controversial, which probably explains the lack of awards despite many nominations. It's just one of my favorite movies of all time.
