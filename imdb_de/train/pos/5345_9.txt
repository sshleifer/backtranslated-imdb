Yesterday, my Spanish / Catalan wife and I have seen this emotional lesson in history. Spain is back in political confrontation. For this reason, this masterpiece should be shown in all Spanish high schools. It is a tremendous lesson in the hidden crime of fascism. The American pilot involved in the Spanish Civil War elects the democratically elected republican government. The criminal role of religion shows up surprisingly well in one of the most original scenes that Uribe has ever made. The colors are great. The cruelty of war (can anyone explain the difference between any war and a civil war?) Used as a scenario of hope when two young children express their feelings and protect each other. The cowards who use their abuse of power even against innocent children are now active again. A film like 'El viaje de Carol' / 'Carol's Journey' tells one of the many sad stories of the 20th century. It's a better lesson in history than any book could contain. Again great work from the peninsula Iberica!
