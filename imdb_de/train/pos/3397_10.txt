Soylent Green IS ... really a really good movie. I never thought so. I do not really like Heston in his sci-fi efforts. He's one of those actors who like Superman most of the time find everything mocking and invincible. I prefer more vulnerable heroes. And in fact, he's mocking Soylent Green too, but since he's supposed to play a cocky bat, it does not really bother me. <br /> <br /> I can understand why some people turn their noses in this movie. Soylent Green makes no effort to create futuristic visuals (what do you know - it looks like 1973), and there is a lack of action. But I admired the film's vision of a complex, corrupt, and stratified society, and I was so pleased to see that Edward G. Robinson had such a moving, funny final role. Cute little character moments - like sharing something precious with Heston - really make the movie. <br /> <br /> Soylent Green's message is pretty relevant nowadays, when nobody seems to know what the government or hell is hell of a business is up to. Is not it funny to see Heston in a prototype of Michael Moore?
