I love this movie! 10 out of 10 hands! It is so damn good! I'm not a big fan of movies, but I have to tell you that it opened my eyes. Amazing color and fast energy. I was lucky enough to see this at a show during the Zoinks! Boston Film Festival, and history really shaped me from the beginning. It had many themes and characters for adults and when it came to an end, I wanted more. I hope they make a sequel. That would be fun. My only problem is the performance of Melissa Connor as Anya. POOH! She SUCKS! I saw a block of wood perform better. I do not know what the director thought when he occupied her. But if you ignore them, you can not help but give this movie a big ten !!!
