Somerset Maugham's characters come to life in RKO's "Of Human Bondage"; But the film is a too skeletonized version of the novel, with Bette Davis' star-making performance absorbing all the energy. Otherwise it's the story of Leslie Howard (as Philip Carey); He dreams of becoming a painter, but he has no talent for the arts. In the course of the film, Mr. Howards will instead fight doctors. His efforts seem to show some bad advice in the arts; Although he was successful in medicine, his painting seemed easier. Also note the symbolism of his disability, a "clubfoot" (explained in the movie). <br /> <br /> On the way (in this version immediately) Howard is beguiled by waitress Davis (as Mildred Rogers). Davis' characterization of "Mildred" is extraordinary, culminating in a spectacular speech as she tells Howard, among other things, that she had to "MY MOUTH". after he kissed him. Howard also plays well, but the story fails to explain his long-lasting fascination and love for Davis. Your services are thus wasted. <br /> <br /> Still a movie for acting, including good support players. Bette Davis' characterization was famous for inspiring a write-in campaign for the 1934 "Best Actress" Academy Award. For the protocol, she placed in third place. The results were: <br /> <br /> 1. Claudette Colbert - "It happened one night" <br /> <br /> 2. Norma Shearer - "Barretts of Wimpole Street" <br /> <br /> 3. Bette Davis - "Of Human Bondage" <br /> <br /> 4. Grace Moore - "A Night of Love" <br /> <br /> ******* of Human Bondage (28.06. 34) John Cromwell ~ Leslie Howard, Bette Davis, Reginald Denny
