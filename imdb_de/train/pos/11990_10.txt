In 1990, the world of Disney TV cartoons was certainly at its best. Shows like Chip n Dale Rescue Rangers, DuckTales and Gummy Bears were already popular, and now Disney made another great cartoon and this cartoon brought the birth of the Disney Afternoon. This cartoon is called TaleSpin. It's about the old jungle book character Baloo the Bear when he gets a job in the aircraft business. In the series he meets Kit Cloudkicker, the former Air Pirate and good cloud surfers, the business lady Rebecca Cunningham and her hyperactive daughter Molly. This series is very funny and has a lot of great puns that you might not understand as a kid, but understand later in life. This is a cleverly written series that fits perfectly into your DVD collection. Parents, buy this for your kids instead of letting them watch all those horrible Nickelodeon cartoons. If you liked TaleSpin, check out "Darkwing Duck" and "Goof Troop". Turn it!
