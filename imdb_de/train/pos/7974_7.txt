I found that this movie is the usual French hit in America's face. Too often, the camera focuses on fat people, sloppy homes and impassable rural areas. While the narrative seems to sympathize with and admire the people of the town presented to the audience, they are exploited and humiliated by cinematography. No doubt Glencoe saw thin people and neatly organized houses, but Malle decided to show us the worst of what was there. <br /> <br /> I can only hope that some American filmmakers go to France to show their worst elements to the American public. As a frequent visitor to France, I can assure you that not everything is good. Foreign immigrants are not easily assimilated, leading to significant social inequalities. But Americans do not want to unmask the French because of their prejudices against their own compatriots and their envy of the United States. Therefore, we will probably not see any films on this topic.
