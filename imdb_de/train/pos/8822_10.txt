A great movie that shows an unusual genre mix in just eight minutes: Mystery, Thriller, Musical. In short, we can tell about the story: A girl comes to a European cafeteria and then ... Soft transition from nonsense mystery to narrative logic. In no time Vigalondo succeeded by fantasy and despite (thanks) tight budget to find a pleasure in B / W. <br /> <br /> Through the unity of time and space, the film reaches the intensity of a short poem (almost a haiku). Spain, land of fast poetry in SW (¿remembers the early Buñuel?). <br /> <br /> A must to reassure our belief in a young cinema outside the States.
