Nick Cage is Randall Raines, a retired car thief forced out of retirement when he has to save the life of his brother Kip (Giovanni Ribisi) as he does a job by fulfilling his brother's task of stealing 50 cars Night. He has to put together his old crew, whom he can trust to help him make it and get his brother from the Netherlands. But the cops are on him, so can he do it? This was one of the big candidates for a new movie because the original was far from a classic. And if you do not dare to expect much, and turn off the thinking part of your brain so that you can ignore the storyline, just take the movie for what it is. You will enjoy the ride in the end. Watch a double bill for a night full of high-speed hijinks with "The Fast and the Furious". Just do not take the car after. <br /> <br /> My degree: B - <br /> <br /> DVD extras: 7-minute Jerry Bruckheimer interview; Bruckheimer Bio / Filmography; Action Overload: Highlight reel; The great pursuit; "0 to 60" feature; "Wild Rides" feature; Stars in motion; The Cult "Painted on the Heart" Music Video; Trailer and Trailer for "Shanghai Noon", "Mission to Mars" and "Coyote Ugly"
