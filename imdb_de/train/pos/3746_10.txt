I love this movie / short thing. Jason Steele is incredible! My favorite parts are The French Song and in the opening title, when the Spatelsoldat "SPOONS!" I go up every time. I would recommend this movie to Knox Klaymation fans and people who like the other films by Jason Steele. His animation style is very original. It takes some views to see the detailed backgrounds. His humor is also funny and is definitely not something you would have heard before. Like Max the deformed spatula, who has in mind a sound and light system that emits colorful lights and happy music as he talks about his miserable life. This is a wonderful animation that you can watch anytime, anywhere.
