I have been a fan of Xu Ke (Hark Tsui) for many years. This movie is the best fantasy movie in years. I do not think "Action" is the right genre, even though there are many action and KongFu scenes. Wait, did I mention that this is an ORIENTAL Fantasy Moive? Please keep in mind that you DO NOT use a Hollywood formula to rate this movie. And for the guy who's "fooled around", I'm not blaming you because you're still young and need to know more about "culture."
