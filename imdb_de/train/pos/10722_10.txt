Spacecamp is one of those movies that kids just love, and mom and dad can also enjoy watching it. I grew up in the 80s. I enjoyed this movie, its plot and all the actors. I recently bought this movie on DVD. So if I have kids of my own, they will have so much fun watching like me. The action is fun. A group of children embarking on a journey they would never have expected when shot into outer space by a hyperreactive robot. At first they were in awe, but when they realized that they did not have enough oxygen to panic. Once they gained enough oxygen from the space station, they returned to Earth as even better friends and found respect for life.
