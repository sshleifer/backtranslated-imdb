A state-of-the-art home in a wealthy neighborhood seems to be the cause of each of its inhabitants's bizarre (and deadly) behavior. At least this is argued by Lara Flynn Boyle's character, Col Kennedy. After a series of deadly events in a huge house next door, Col knows there's something to give. Mark-Paul Gosselaar is also the mysterious architect. <br /> <br /> My Opinion: The house next door works for Lara Flynn Boyle and the places (nice house) and stylish sets. Boyle is a talented and dynamic actress, not to mention the stunner. It gives credibility to her character and makes the movie fascinating. Without them, it would have failed. "It's so alive," explains a potential buyer regarding the house. Yes, it lives. But the story itself is not so much. <br /> <br /> Apart from Boyle's presence, not much happens here, as a huge amount of the movie is spent watching or waiting to see how the house affects its current owners. The results are predictable. But I liked it anyway. The cinematography gives the film a polished look. 8/10 because of Boyle, the premise of a nasty state-of-the-art home, film locations and cinematography, as well as decorations and wardrobe.
