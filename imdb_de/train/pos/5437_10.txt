Pandro S. Berman was "responsible for the production", but that made him a so-called line producer. But who produced this epic was not filmed in Arizona, but in the Californian Mohave Desert, where scavengers with all the remains of the "gold temple", the Thuggee huts, the British outpost in Muri, the village of Tantrapur, etc. were smaller technical Errors can and must be forgiven. Unforgivable is the lack of an Oscar for Best Music, though perhaps the Academy at the time did not offer one. A single theme was played in different tempi, including waltz, march and sweet, atmospheric setting. Brilliant! One of the curious aspects of the production were the demands of widow Kipling. An actor playing Kipling appears just before and after the fight scenes. In the first release, his scenes were cut according to Mrs. Kipling's demands. Later they were recorded and gave Ben Hecht's screenplay a "connection" to Kipling's immortal poem. Interestingly, this very typical and pro-British story was about a great screenwriter who hated even the British.
