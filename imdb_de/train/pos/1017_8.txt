I watched the show from season one and was pretty skeptical at the beginning. The original movie was a bit childish and I was just looking for a sci-fi show while I waited for the new season of the BSG. <br /> <br /> But after a few episodes I became a fan. I loved the characters - who are not as stupid as you think he is Jack O'Neill, who is not just chic Samantha Carter, the glorious Teal 'c, the darling of women and children, and brilliant Dr. Daniel Jackson. <br /> <br /> Of course stories are sometimes not serious, sometimes even ridiculous, but most of the time it's not about technology or space fights - it's about helping your friend and even risking your life for him. It's about "we do not leave anyone behind". To fight to the end when all hope is lost. About the free will and all the good qualities that make a person human. <br /> <br /> And now he's breaking a record, entering the 10th season and still doing good.
