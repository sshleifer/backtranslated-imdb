This movie is banned in almost every foreign land I can think of. The Japanese (?), Who play a major role in this, really need to search desperately for a job, or we're just friends. Here's the shovel: Three thugs torture hell out of a helpless woman, they use all sorts of things to kill them eventually, they burn them, kick them, turn around here in a chair (over 200 times!), Use them Sound torture (by forcing them to hear a static sound for over 20 hours! That does not sound so bad, but it can drive you crazy). They throw at her (probably from an animal) while she's knocked out, and she freaks out when she wakes up. And who can forget the grand finale of the BIGGEST EYEBALL TORTURE I've ever seen? <br /> <br /> If you have not heard of these movies yet, and have a look without knowing it's a simulated snuff movie, you'll think so! (Just ask Charlie Sheen) This is guaranteed to make people freak and sick! As I said, subway pure. See if you're a fan of underground horror or foreign blood. If not, I strongly recommend that you watch the show before you watch it! From the aspect of blood, shock and creativity, it gets a 10, but from the plot and all the stuff it's a 1. An underground classic ... <br /> <br /> My final rating is 8 / 10 <br /> <br />
