My father was the jailer of the prison (he is now retired), which is shown in this documentary, and I grew up with the prison life. Maybe my views are completely different from all the others watching this movie. I say that, the filmmakers who brought us this 93-minute wonder are fantastic artists and even better people. They were brave enough to come to A) and tell this story. Responsible for her art and especially for the inmates and staff of the Luther Luckett Correctional Complex. You should be recommended for this work without end. 170 hours, even HOURS, taking material and being able to reduce it to 93 minutes is nothing short of extraordinary and they have my respect. <br /> <br /> I may have seen this movie very few could see it. I was at the inmate demonstration. I was in the same room with these men when they saw their hearts pouring into the screen. I saw men weeping on television weeping in front of me on the chair, and I tell you, it was a very profound experience. These men have done horrible crimes in some cases, but they have found ways to save themselves, even if they find themselves insoluble. How many of us have the courage? How many people could do what they did in such a harsh environment? Seeing how they reacted to the film was an experience that I am immensely grateful for. I will never forget that. I thank the men who have allowed me this insight into their lives, thank my dad for making ALL possible, and thank Philomath Films for taking their time, their blood, their sweat, their soul and pour her tears into this project /> <br /> This film will change everything that you know you know about prison life and the inmates who are in it. 'Oz' is not real, TV is not real. "Shakespeare behind bars" is.
