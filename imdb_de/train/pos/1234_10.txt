I grew up with this film, and I still love it today as well as a child. Do not listen to the reviews of the critics. They are not accurate in this movie. Eddie Murphy really shines in his role. You can sit down with your whole family and everyone will enjoy it. I recommend this movie to anyone to see it. It's a comedy with a touch of fantasy. With demons, dragons and a small, bald-headed child with god-like powers. This film will take you from LA to Tibet, in the amazing view of the wonderful temples of the mountains in Tibet a beautiful view! So do yourself a favor and grab this! You will not regret it!
