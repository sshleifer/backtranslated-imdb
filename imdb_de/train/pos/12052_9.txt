I've seen this on TV so long ago that I can not remember when it was, but it's still one of the scariest, most annoying movies I've ever seen. There is a subtle yet intense fear that is evoked by the woman in black, who lurks at the edge of the frame and is not clearly visible, so that you (like the hero's attorney) feel insecure, if only one Imagination is or not. It's also one of the few films that really scared me. "Production values" are hanged, good films are about a director's ability to create atmosphere through film, actors, locations / sets, music, attention to detail and ... imagination. A true gem.
