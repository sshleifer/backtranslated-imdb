I do not understand Because I'm not a critic, I do not rate the quality of acting, which I believe to be credible, a good thing. My confusion lies with the content. Is no one else sensitive to the fact that these two unfaithful women justify their unfaithfulness to men who have fought and bled to ensure the continued freedom of their families and their country? Should not there have been a prologue telling us if the men made it home, and if so, how did the fraudulent infidelity of the wives affect them? Did they think that while these women begged their predilection from cautious loneliness, did they believe that their husbands enjoy being shot at while being daily exposed to death or dismemberment? They did not think of their husbands at all! Just forgive me, unless you want to see your husband dead.
