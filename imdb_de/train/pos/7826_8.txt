The story of Steve Biko - as you've played it excellently by Denzel Washington - is actually more the story of Donald Woods, played by Kevin Kline. This was undoubtedly the emergence of Kline as a serious actor, and he was surprisingly good at the role. Attenborough gave him the direction one would expect, and the often spectacular scenes of the masses were the way they were in. Only he can come over. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast was competent enough and did a good job, ending up as a sad story about a South Africa not yet close to the distant past.
