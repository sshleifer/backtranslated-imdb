I have only seen this show a few times but will live in my memory. <br /> <br /> It's very frustrating that finding it everywhere is so difficult, and there are seemingly endless repetitions of things like friends! Especially hard to get to be in England, I suppose ..? <br /> <br /> You say it was bad reviews, or was it a Bakersfield police complaint itself? Maybe it was just too smart for some people? Anyway, about a comedy I'd like to see again, but almost impossible to find. I hear that it is or was repeated in another network? But unfortunately not here !! <br /> <br /> Summary: Awesome.
