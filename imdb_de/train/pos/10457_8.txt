Forget the camping "religious" movies that have monopolized the TV / film market ... this film has a real feel. While it may be considered a movie that has cheap emotional traits, it also has the message of forgiveness and overall good morale. However, I did not like the lighting in this film ... It was too bright for a film that deals with such topics. I felt that the film's overall appeal was gone, which is almost an unforgivable sin, but the recognizable cast and their performances counteract this oversight.
