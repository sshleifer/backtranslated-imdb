Alain Chabat claims that this film is his original idea, but the theme of reluctant lovers who finally bring it together is so old, if not older, when Shakespeare does not want a member of the opposite sex to disturb his life. He has a problem, 5 sisters and a matriarchal mother - the G7 - who decides that he should be married. Enter the delightful, charming Charlotte Gainsbourg and a simple plan. Charlotte has to portray herself as Chabat's girlfriend and just will not show up on the wedding day. No marriage anymore from the G7. Of course, the best plans have a habit of getting out of hand. There are very strong supporting roles of Lafont as mother and Osterman as the brother with the tight fist of Gainsbourg There are some fantastic scenes, as Charlotte must first enchant and then rebel the family. French farce with English.
