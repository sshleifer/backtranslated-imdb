I laughed so much during this movie that my face hurt. Ben Affleck was funny and reminded me of a handsome boy Jack Black in this role. Gandolfini gives his typical A performance. The whole cast is funny, the story pretty good and the comic moments fantastic. I did not expect much in this movie and maybe that's why I was so surprised when I came out of the movie, completely satisfied and exhausted. I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys the comedy, who can identify with loneliness during the holidays and / or resign themselves to relatives. The best thing about this film (at least for me) was the subtle jokes that caught me off guard and made me laugh long after the rest of the audience. Namely the scene in which the Christmas tree is illuminated. Look at it and laugh well!
