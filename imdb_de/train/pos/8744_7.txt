This is a low budget movie with a cast of unknowns and a minimum of filming on location. The Filipino deputy for Thailand, and actually nobody goes to Hong Kong. The stock shot of a Cathay Pacific jumbo jet landing at the old airport makes the transition perfect. This movie proves that you do not need megabudgets or a headliner star to produce a great movie. It contains neither the gaffes nor the excesses that young filmmakers often stumble upon. Solid processing of people who know all aspects of filmmaking and know the trade-offs between art and box office. An excellent job!
