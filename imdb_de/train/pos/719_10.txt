Although this film is cheese at its best, it is taken off perfectly. This movie is undoubtedly a modern classic. Basically, there are two kinds of movies that I like - movies with depth (chick flicks, if you have to - I blame my wife for it) - and thoughtless comedies, where I can sit back and relax. This movie is a perfect example of the latter. <br /> <br /> A friend of mine was interested in this movie shortly after its release. When I thought I was a bit shallow, he told me, "You have to watch this movie, it's just your kind of movie." I renounced the insult and began to look. I know they mentioned the Ramones a million times, but when you actually see them, I said, "Hey, these are the Ramones." My friend replied, "I do not know that they were a real band." I had my moment of glory. <br /> <br /> This movie is a bit dated but a must-have for Ramones fans - or anyone else.
