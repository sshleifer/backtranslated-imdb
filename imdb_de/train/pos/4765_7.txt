A priest who has given up his ministry meets a young man who has just been ordained. <br /> <br /> This film is about the cruel dilemma between a life dedicated to God and faith and a life of more earthly pleasures. Post-war France is also about the mortal aspect of Faith herself. <br /> <br /> While this is not the film of a lifetime, it is a sin that it has been forgotten. In addition, Pierre Fresnay is sublime.
