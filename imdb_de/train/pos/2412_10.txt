I think Monarch Cove was one of the best-written and played "drama" series that has been on any network for a long time. This show had great potential and I could not wait to see it every week. This could become a great primetime soap. People are looking forward to this kind of acting because we are over the top with "Reality TV". I long for the kind of writing and acting that shows like Dallas, Knots Landing, Dynasty, MelRose Place and so on. Monarch Cove did a pretty good job of overhauling this concept and I expected it to only get better. There is so much to do with these characters and they have all been very interesting and fascinating. It would be a loss not to explore this and to develop these characters after getting involved in their world. I absolutely loved this show because it was mysterious, interesting and sensual without going overboard or offending. I loved it.
