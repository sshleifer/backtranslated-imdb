I think Dark Angel is great! The first season was excellent and had a good story. With Max (Jessica Alba) as escaped X-5, Manticore creation who wanted to adapt to a normal life but wanted to "save the world". And hunted by manticore all season, adding some spice to the series. <br /> <br /> The second season, however, was suddenly a bit strange compared to the first one. The plot had somehow disappeared, and the series lost some of its charm, mainly because of all the strange "creatures" that appeared. Do not get me wrong, the second season is good, but with a bit too much "Manticore". However, they managed to return to a new promising plot in the final episodes of season 2, in which I had high hopes of seeing more episodes of it. And with James Cameron behind it, things can not go wrong. In conclusion, I would say it's a great show, but I still hope for a third season!
