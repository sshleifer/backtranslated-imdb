Well, I think I'm emotionally involved with this movie since I first went to the movies more than ten times. He helped me get through my master's thesis or rather keep me from working on it! <br /> <br /> But when I some years later (and many films) look back, what a well-made little gem! I've never seen Gwyneth Paltrow so convincing and Jeremy Northam is the perfect Mr. Knightley - where to meet such a man ??? <<< sigh >>> Sophie Thompson's turn as wife Bates is a virtuoso acting (oh, napkins, excuse me!) and the rest of the cast is no disappointment - Toni Colette brings a lot of Muriel to her Harriet and Ewan McGregor is convincingly charming - and Alan Cumming and Juliet Stevenson are the perfect "impossible" pair! <br /> <br /> Of course, the sets and costumes as well as the beautiful soundtrack contribute a lot to the feel-good balance, almost like Hobbiton's atmosphere of the film - although cinematography and art jewelery are a visual overload. Very, very pretty, but a bit more austerity might have given a better feel for the time. But the good thing is that the movie itself does not take itself too seriously and there is a lot of fun - and a lot of cool interface - that keep him from sinking into the sugary Merry Old England mode. <br /> <br /> My Particularly popular is the ballroom scene - there are some nice plays and directing, and the final dance summarizes the relationship between Emma and Mr. Knightley just beautiful together. Too bad the final proposal scene takes too long just a little - cut two shots (I can imagine exactly what!) And would have met the rest of the film much more. <br /> <br Gosh, I just noticed (by reading the imdb listings) that I've seen Jeremy Northam in at least three films, without knowing that it was him - apparently he as an actor has a lot more with to do it as just a gentleman-like English heartbreaker! Hmm, I think I have to pay a visit to my video store ... <br /> <br /> Nice movie. My favorite Jane Austen adaptation so far - although perhaps Ang Lee's sense and sensibility is the better movie, this one is closest to my heart - and I've certainly seen it much more! Watch it if you can - and do not be too harsh with its small imperfections. <br /> <br />
