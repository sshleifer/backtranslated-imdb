I'm a big Jane Austen fan and apart from being a full-length movie (a real fan wants to see as little as possible left out and that can only be achieved in a miniseries), he was really great. Gwyneth Paltrow captures the slightly unsuspecting but well-meaning rich girl and Jeremy Northam IS Mr. Knightly with his attitude and nobility. I did not like Ewan McGregor, although I really like him as an actor but did not feel like he spoiled the movie. As I said, as Jane Austen fan, there were things I would have liked to see, but not, but they would have done much longer than would have been allowed for a full-length movie, and I felt that they were Capturing history is good. I have seen every adaptation of this book and thought that was the best!
