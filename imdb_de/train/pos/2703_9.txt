I'm not a big fan of Camp Kitsch and the "so bad is good" way of watching. But I really like this movie because of its fun factor and - believe it or not - it's an innovation. <br /> <br /> The whole thing has a ring from John Waters and is endlessly thrilled, but with some great actors and deliberate direction to make the most of the slapstick and the stabilized movements. Billy Zane moves with an incredible expression (see the scene in the bus for a textbook lesson on how to use movement) and is framed by unexpected stars. <br /> <br /> You may not enjoy this movie, but if you get the chance to look at it, save the time, because chances are you're watching the movie with a confused smile on your face and a new perspective on the humor of some big stars. Highly recommended.
