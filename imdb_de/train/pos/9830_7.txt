No one understands the logic behind numbering Italian zombie flicks, but ?? Honestly ?? Why should we bother? Each and every movie in the Zombi "series" delivers very entertaining, unpleasant and unfortunate shocks, and "Zombi 3" is no exception, despite the production difficulties encountered in filming. This film started out as an interesting Lucio Fulci project that needed to continue to grow on Zombi 2, but it became a typical product of Bruno Mattei with more mistakes and stolen ideas from earlier films. The script is hopelessly incapable and ignores all forms of continuity. Every ingenious idea from George A. Romero's "Night of the Living Dead" and "The Crazies" is shamelessly repeated here and the plays are really miserable and painful to watch. But all that did not annoy me for a moment, because the sublime palate compensates everything! At a secret army base in the Philippines, the scientists completed the bacterial warfare virus "Death One" and prepared it for transport. After a failed attempt to steal the virus, the infected corpse of a terrorist is cremated and the zombie ashes contaminate the entire population of a nearby holiday village. The last group of survivors must fight hyperactive and inhumanly strong zombies as well as soldiers in white overalls who have been instructed to kill anything that moves in the contaminated area. This movie is comparable to Umberto Lenzi's "Nightmare City". Really bad ... but incredibly entertaining with fast action sequences and several very creative zombie insanity situations. For example, the undead birds were original and the whole zombie birth sequence in the abandoned hospital was pretty cool too. The notorious flying head scene is nowhere near as horrible as it was created, and is a perfect match for this cheesy and thoroughly comfortable Italian zombie stripe. Recommended to the fans; do not worry about the negative reviews.
