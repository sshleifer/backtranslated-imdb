This is the first movie I have seen in the last year! It's damn funny, unbelievably original, unbelievably great looking (they opted for this super cool technicolor widescreen look that's awesome to look at), and it does have a deep character and a sense of society. It's a really smart satire, bringing everything from homeland security to racial issues while laughing and realizing how much the world lives in fear. Carrie Anne Moss presents a comedic performance that I never imagined she would come from! She is cute, funny and sexy! Billy Connolly is great as Fido, who can only grunt and moan! And Dylan Baker as a father is priceless. In fact, the whole cast is perfect. Henry Czerny as a villain, Tim Blake Nelson as a neighbor with the hot, sexy zombie girlfriend (now has the idea?) Funny but provocative and just stunning! Watch this movie! It's like nothing you've ever seen before.
