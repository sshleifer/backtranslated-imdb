*** I could not think that there is a spoiler, but I would rather be careful than careless *** I never saw this movie when I was little. I fell in love the first time I saw it with my three-year-old daughter. I can see it over and over again. <br /> <br /> For the little actress Ilene Woods did in her life, she was a wonderful voice for Cinderella. very attractive; very credible The music really fits the movie perfectly. The acting was great. loved the mice !! They really "hated" Lady Tremain and the step-sisters; They were just terrible. The cartoonists have shown the spoiled behavior very well. <br /> <br /> This is a wonderful movie, especially if you like love stories. My daughter has watched the movie about 25 times and in the end is still excited.
