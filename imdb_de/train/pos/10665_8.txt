As a disclaimer, I've watched the movie five to six times in the last 15 years, and I just saw the musical just this week. This allowed me to judge the film without messing with what was or was in the musical (though I was spoiled when I saw the musical :)) <br /> <br /> I think so Really, Michael Douglas has worked well in this role along with Kasey. I think that "Let me dance for you scene" is one of the best parts of the movie, a worthwhile addition to the musical. The dancers and the vocals in the film are far superior to the musical, as well as the cast, which is at least ten times bigger (in the film this is of course easier). The decors, lighting, dancing and singing are also much superior in the film, which should be expected and actually delivered. <br /> <br /> The songs that were common to the musical are getting better in the movie, the new ones are pretty good, and in my opinion the whole movie delivers more than the musical, especially compared to a musical few decors. The only drawback to the film is the obvious cuts between the actors who talk and the singers were baptized during the vocal parts for some of the characters, but their dance is impeccable and the final product was more enjoyable than the musical
