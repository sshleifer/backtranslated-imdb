About two hundred members of a film company from Cleveland, Ohio (USA), called Cinematheque, gathered on August 19, 2000 to watch a pristine cinemascope print of Michelangelo Antonioni's Zabriskie Point film (1970). Cinematheque director John Ewing, who has received the best prints for his series, told the audience in advance that this print was flown in from Italy just for the show. <br /> <br /> The audience was spellbound as the film unfolded its artistic expression on the huge panoramic screen. At the sight of this excellent print, which showed the intention intended by Antonioni, it became clear that this is indeed a modern work of art. All the more fitting was that the series is housed in the Cleveland Institute of Art in University Circle. <br /> <br /> Antonioni's compositions were created for the Cinemascope landscape. His beautiful balance of images, the impressive use of color and the sweeping choreographic movements are the work of a true artist who uses the canvas as a canvas. <br /> <br /> Finally the audience could understand "Zabriskie Point". As his narrative unfolded, it became clear that this work was not about history itself but about the impressionist reproduction of an artist's fleeting images of his subject. The setting of some of the more turbulent activities of the sixties is only a dramatic motor for the artist's comprehensive collage. <br /> <br /> Antonioni is not tied to traditional narrative standards and can stop anytime to creatively embroider an event with grandiose decorations. The audience readily went with the flow of his remarkable imagination as his huge images on the massive screen arouse an enthusiastic attention. While the audience may have been tangentially involved in character relationships, they recognize that this is a human relationship, the recurring theme of the director. <br /> <br /> It has also been recognized that no smaller or lesser pressure than the original print in Cinemascope can accommodate this particular rendition. All the more, the audience appreciated seeing "Zabriskie Point" in its original, breathtaking format, and in the end it broke out in thunderous applause.
