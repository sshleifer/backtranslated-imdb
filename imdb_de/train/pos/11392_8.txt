Paris is the place where you can enjoy beautiful art and music and - like in this film - fall in love immortal. Boy meets girls, they fall in love, but something stands in the way of their eternal happiness, the classic story. <br /> <br /> The wonderful music of George Gerschwin complements the great dance of Gene Kelly and Leslie Caron. "An American in Paris" is a humorous, carefree, loving movie worthy of being viewed. <br /> <br /> 8/10 <br /> <br />
