I agree with those who claim that this film has earned everything that lies beneath unsatisfactory grace. This is an amazing documentary about a shocking day. <br /> <br /> IMDB asks us to rate this movie. I ask you to consider the fact that the documentary was made. The courage to shoot this movie is remarkable. We find that the two brothers are separated at this moment. They continue to document the bravest of the brave without knowing their own safety and the safety of their fellow human beings. Judging whether it is nobler to make a video of this tragedy or save the life, as these amazing, amazing firefighters have done is not my answer. All I know is that a class with children in 30 years can not get to know one another without the other. <br /> <br /> I'm giving an unrestricted 10 class. That's why the film art was created! Capture the natural emotions of real life. You can keep your kung fu trash. Romance is sweet. Action will never reach that level. This film, September 11th, will be timeless because it has not glorified itself. It had no taste. It did not have all the glaring vanities that wipe out a lion's share of the many films on the many screens. It had class, serenity, substance, and a record of the day that changed the modern face of America and even the world. It spoke of things that are essential to the eye of the camera. Please keep in mind that this movie, as he says himself, is a rousing tribute to those who fell for the free, beautiful name of America. <br /> <br /> How can you give a movie that is shown no less praises the natural valor of real people who act in unreal times. I love "The Godfather", but "9/11" is forever a different kind of movie because this is a different kind of world now. It is art without question or questions. <br /> <br /> jf
