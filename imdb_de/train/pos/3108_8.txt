This installment makes the CIA look very much like a very stupid organization. In fact they may be. The plot looks like a man would have the power to kill everyone, including his own, to kill Jason Bourne. Matt Damon does a very credible job B. Bourne trying to stay one step ahead of the entire movie. He is still trying to remember who he was and how he got where he is. He gets help from a few people and it seems like every minute of the movie someone is trying to kill him. <br /> <br /> There is not much time for rest in this movie and the action sequences are very real. There are many chases that were recorded with the shaky cam that complement the realism in a way and cause less Hollywood appear than many pictures. These sequences give the film a realistic feel. <br /> <br /> The tension in some sequences is brilliant when you wonder if someone will die or if Bourne can fend them off. This is the kind of action-tension that you see when you want to be entertained. I'm sure this movie will lead to the next movie in the series.
