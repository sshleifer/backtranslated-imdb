There are four great films depicting the Vietnam War. They are (in no particular order: Apocalypse Now, born July 4, Platoon, and finally Tigerland.) All but Tigerland are focused on the actual war and the men in it.) Tigerland focuses on men who have advanced in the Vietnam War Training are located. The character of Boz is one of the most important depictions of a man who questions the war and its absurdity. This was done in many war films, but rarely in boot camp. This is also a very complex character whose method of dealing with his feelings and emotions is the driving force of this film. The character of Boz makes this movie so good. It's a shame he did not get a major release. He is next to the above mentioned movie titles to every Kinofan.
