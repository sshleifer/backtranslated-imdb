The biggest surprise in this movie was the performance of Daryl Hannah. Instead of playing the stereotypical, blond-haired roles she normally does, she plays a taut, intelligent, world-weary character. She does not matter much, but she does a great job of portraying Lois Harlan as a woman she's tired of, though she's used to covering up her boss's indiscretions.
