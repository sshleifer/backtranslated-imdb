The fluttering of butterfly wings in the Atlantic may trigger a hurricane in the Pacific. According to this theory (somehow related to chaos theory, I do not know exactly how), any action, no matter how small or insignificant, will trigger a chain reaction that can lead to big events. This little gem of a movie shows us a number of seemingly independent characters, most of them in Paris, whose actions will affect the lives of others. (The theory of the six degrees of separation can also be used.) Every story is a facet of the jewel of this film. The drama is finely tuned and nuanced (Audrey Tautou is bright), the stories are plausible, the humor is right and the viewer allows the theater to agree.
