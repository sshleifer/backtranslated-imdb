I just got the DVD release of this film in Norway on vacation, where it was released with English subtitles. <br /> <br /> The film is beautifully photographed and powerful. The youngster, starring "Frits," has a surprisingly open face that painfully reflects the tragic events that unfold around him. <br /> <br /> Early on in the movie we see that the father Frits loves so much has mental health problems and this is thrown up when the brutal headmaster denies attacking the boy and suggests that it was his own father. <br /> <br /> The climate scene where Frits disrespects the Headmaster; Just standing on the floor and repeating "Liar" while brutally attacking his classmates is a scene you probably will not forget. <br /> <br /> The only weak point of the films is the rather stereotypical "Flower Power". Teacher using every "friendly teacher" trick in the book. Apart from that, I am sure that this is a movie that you will really enjoy.
