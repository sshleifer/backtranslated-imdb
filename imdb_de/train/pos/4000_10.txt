Impressive. I saw it last night and I'm still excited about how good it was. Every character felt so real (though most of them are petty, selfish holes) and the bizarre story - the middle-aged widow starts fucking her daughter's insane friend - was absolutely convinced. All-round top performances, but ahead of Anne Reid and Our Friends in the north Daniel Craig (the latter as the next David Thewlis). <br /> <br /> And director Roger Michell? This is as far from Notting Hill as possible. Thank God. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie !!!
