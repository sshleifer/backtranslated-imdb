I have seen rivers and tides again today. It's the second time in two days and yes, I watch movies that I like as often as needed. Yesterday I was impressed by the brilliance of the images and Goldsworthy's work. When I threw the coins this morning, I received # 29 The Abysmal (Water). Goldsworthy has an affinity for water, hence the title. I received the fifth line, which switched to # 7 The Army. For Blake Art was a war. Anyway, I knew that I needed to see the movie again. <br /> <br /> I read one of the few online reviews of the SF Examiner. The critic loved the movie, but said Goldsworthy's comments disturbed his enjoyment of the film. He would rather have just the pictures and the wonderful soundtrack. I was aware of that when I saw the second time. Yesterday I thought I would vote for Andy Goldsworthy as King of the World. Well, today I could go a little bit beyond the pictures and hear what he had to say. Could I enjoy the movie without his comments? What he does, what he says, goes far beyond "art." His understanding of water, time, stone, change, and so forth made me believe that the man is the reincarnation of Lao Tsu or an avatar. Some of his works / words are like Zen. His knowledge ... <br /> <br /> However, the movie is (seemingly) shown here only in the Bay Area. Be a trendsetter. Go to your local cinema and tell them you do not have to book a movie you've heard about from the backcountry. It's called rivers and tides. <br /> <br />
