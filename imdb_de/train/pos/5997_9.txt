Let me first say that I have never read a movie on IMDb. But I am in video business myself. And come from this perception; I can say without a doubt that this movie is what a short film should be. It has a very good story and another thing that I love - (an even better twist). The opening was very well done, I loved that a video was selected for it and how it was edited. <br /> <br /> I'm not a fan of B & W, but the way this movie uses the effect works. And with every movie that's all that matters. The flow of the film works perfectly and the editing was very good. From a technical side (which I usually work on) everything is very well done. There is no big technology. Things to be pointed out. The only thing I have is that the credits are a bit bouncy. This is probably due to a rendering problem. Let me also say that I would have preferred to see more of the love scene, but I'm a guy (you can prove that with a guy factor). <br/>. It's worth the clock if you're a fan of indies and / or short films. <br /> <br /> ps. Sorry for bad grammar or spelling.
