This movie was one of the best movies I've seen this year. I have not seen any cameos in the movie, but it's still pretty good. It is similar to Anchorman in the Department of Humor, but I think that this is a better composed film. It actually has a point. If you see a whole bunch of T & A, you'll be disappointed. Just a well composed film !!!! If you have nothing to do for the day or need a lot of humor then you will find that this is a really good movie. I definitely think that Ebert and Roeper's review of this movie is right. I mean, I do not really like Ebert in most movies, but that's the movie I'll agree with. The movie contains a good story that believes these people are out there. It's definitely something to say about virginity in this movie. Yes, sure, you will be laughed at if you hear about it, but it still suggests that you have to wait. Steve has wonderfully portrayed the person he made in this film, and yet it is still funny.
