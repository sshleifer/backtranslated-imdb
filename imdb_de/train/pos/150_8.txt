The latest film by Spanish director Agusti Villaronga is a study of how children who experience violence and isolation in their remote community develop into disturbed young adults who need certain psychic aids to cope with their hidden mental frailty to become. Whether these tools are fanatical, caring for others, or just a macho image while engaging as men's prostitutes, Villaronga is successfully investigating how these vices affect three teenagers under Franco live in Spain. The three are witnesses of the disturbing double death or their friends before they are teenagers, and then bury the feelings that they feel with their physical fellow human beings until they meet again in a hospital to be ill with tuberculosis. <br /> <br /> The cinematic style of the text is usually visually opulent, as one would expect from the Spanish author, and is strongly reminiscent of the work of Spaniard Pedro Almodovar, who deals with issues related to sexual Desire to engage both heterosexual and gay. One element that differs between the two directors is that Villaronga prefers a supernatural undertone that is associated with claustrophobic, pithy realism as opposed to Almodovar's surrealism, although both styles are similar. <br /> <br /> The piece gives an insight into problems of young psyche and contains disturbing violence and scenes of a sexual nature. I strongly recommend this movie because it contains elements that will stay with the audience for a long time after viewing.
