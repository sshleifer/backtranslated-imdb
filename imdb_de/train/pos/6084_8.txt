I was satisfied with the cast of renowned players. History is a matter of getting up for a cause, even if you are exposed to personal risk. At a time when violence and pain are often the focus of the film, this film focuses on the old-fashioned good cop. Although similar representations have been made over and over again, these guys are doing well. Sit back and enjoy it. Dennehy is a master of film taking.
