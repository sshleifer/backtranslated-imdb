This great movie did not manage to score higher than 5! Why not! It is a great representation of the life of Christ without the merciless sensationalism of the Passion of Christ. Johnny Cash has done great things for God, amazingly shunned and neglected in areas where they should be most important, as in our churches. The film itself took less than a month to film when Johnny felt God was leading through him. Great recognition to all who are involved in this overwhelmingly candid film, which is always appreciated by the fans. At the very least, Billy Graham's crusade was valued high enough to be used as the primary source of new Christian education. Thanks, Fox, for producing him. As Walk the Line, he proved that it was a freaky, that this man alone survived and produced such an undervalued masterpiece. Films are not canonized by referendum, as this production proves! In summary, I believe that this film is one of the great documentary films in the world because it is sincere, honest and a great testimony to the Christian faith!
