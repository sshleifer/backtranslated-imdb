It does not make sense to look through history as enough reviewers have done that. Here are a few different scripts from one of these "religious nuts," as a big-headed reviewer puts it so tolerantly. <br /> <br /> 1) "Baby Face" (1933) may offer the classic example that has ever been shown in a movie about how women can manipulate men with sex. What Barbara Stanwyck proves in this film has a lot to offer: look cute, hit your eyelashes, offer your body for free ..... and men will fall over to help you with what you want , > <br /> In this case, it was a promotion of promotion with the ultimate goal of money .... much of it. At least four men in this film do just that, even if it ruins their lives. <br /> <br /> 2) The end - which many reviewers seemed to hate here - is another great message: The money and material goods of the world will not make a person feel fulfilled. A sad comment that so many "critics" here rather immoral messages and prefer the substance. No wonder, I guess. Anyway, the movie is entertaining from start to finish and Stanwyck has some great lines, especially in the beginning when she betrayed her evil father and his father's reluctant bar customers. With just over 70 minutes, this movie moves at a fast pace and is over before you know it.
