This Oscar nominee from 2004 is a very short b / w film in Spanish. A young woman goes to a caf√©, gets a coffee, and notices a couple of musicians silently standing with their instruments. All patrons are motionless like mannequins. However, a guy is quite funny and breaks into a song about what's going on at 7:35 in the morning. There is a surprising moment after another until the end, which is quite surprising. The people, the place, everything looks quite normal. And like the music piece "Bolero", the thing continues to climax. With its structure, theme, movement and humor, it is an eight-minute masterpiece.
