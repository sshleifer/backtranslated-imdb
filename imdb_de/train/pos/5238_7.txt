I liked Top Gun. It has sparked my interest. Predictable storyline, decent character development and plot. It's very similar to the High Noon in that the city dwellers seem weak and scared to hold their own against a villain. This movie has some good actors who really did not have the chance to share all their talents. Even some of the actors were not recognized for their roles. Denver Pyle was a handsome man at a young age. John Dehner and Rod Taylor are outstanding in their roles. Sterling Hayden did the best he could with bad material. It is hard to imagine that he is a gunslinger. Laura, played by Karen Booth, was a disgusting character. She seemed flattered that two men could have fought over her. Pooh. How can people travel without luggage? Especially women.
