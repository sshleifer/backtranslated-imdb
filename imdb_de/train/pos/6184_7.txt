Since this is the Black History Month, and I discuss the successes of many African Americans in chronological order in the film, I received this film through VHS from the library because Duke Ellington and his orchestra were there. Her jazz version of Franz Liszt's "Rhapsody" was the culmination of this mostly overlong murder mystery musical comedy mix. Many other numbers I liked were Kitty Carlisle's special Sweet Marijuana, Carl Brisson's Cocktails for Two, and his duet with Carlisle and Gertrude Michael's. Jack Oakie and Victor McLaglen are probably going a bit too long with their love spirit as a producer and detective, but they grow with you. And Toby Wing is a sexy fool like Nancy, who's always trying to tell Oakie, but gets "not now" from him every time. While many of the characters have a motive for the murders that take place, I was not surprised at the discovery of who did it. And imagine how naked the women are here (though their breasts are naturally covered with their hands or a thin top). This was obviously a pre-code. It is worth it for every movie lover who is interested in such a thing. P.S. As a longtime resident of Louisiana, I would like to know when someone was born here, because Carlisle came from New Orleans.
