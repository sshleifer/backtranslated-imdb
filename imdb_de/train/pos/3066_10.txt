Everyone loves or hate this movie. I go with love. It's so well hit and played so well. Beautiful. This movie is for people who appreciate well-made movie art. If you're not a fan of well-made films, of course, you would hate that. But if you like the pinnacle of acting, photography, history and development then look no further.
