This series brought me to Deighton's writing and genre when I was younger and I love this presentation of the story. However, I would not agree with the above comment. From what I have read in the past, it is not the achievement of Holm that leads Deighton to refuse to publish the series, but the slaughter that all three books have received in translation on screen. A good example of this is the redesign of the border crossing that ended Samson's career. The scene is not in the book, the character who dies in the minefield was never in one of the books and the crossing in Sinker was from East Germany to West Germany, not the Polish border. This whole story is stuff. The changes in Set similarly affect the integrity of the story. My point about Holm's achievement was that he excellently portrayed Samson's disorientation during his wife's raid, and I believe he felt good about portraying the aging field agent desperately trying to bridge the class split. Samson pays both for the idealism of his father and suffers under his influence on his life. As Clevemore comments, he would probably have trained himself if he had trained himself. I think the true power loss is more than anything else due to the physical appearance. Compared to the Samson of the book, Holm is tiny - a physically impressive man who is able to force presence with his size.
