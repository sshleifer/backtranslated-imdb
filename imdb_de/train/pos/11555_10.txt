A simple comment ... <br /> <br /> What can I say ... this is a wonderful movie that I can watch again and again. It's definitely one of the top ten comedies. With a great cast, Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau formulate a perfect script by Neil Simon based on his piece. If you have a digital cable, the menu will appear at the bottom of the screen. Normally, this movie gives *** stars, but in reality it earns **** stars. If you really see this movie, you can say that in a hundred years it will be so funny and fresh.
