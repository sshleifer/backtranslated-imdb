I have to admit, I thought this movie would not be good, but I soon changed my mind. The film let you guess in which direction it is. Pierce Broson is amazing in his role as a batsman who suddenly burns out and asks for help from a man he met in a Mexican bar. Greg Kinnear is an awesome hetero. His role as a gentle Denver man who begins an innocent conversation with Pierce in a Mexican bar. The movie will make you laugh as Pierce delivers hilarious one-liners (mostly about sex). <br /> <br /> The imaginary in this film is very well done, especially in the bullfighting scene and when Pierce sees himself trying to finish his last jobs.
