Mardi Gras: Made in China provides a wonderful, intricate link between popular culture, nudity, and globalization by making and throwing beads. I saw this film at the Boston International Film Festival and expected a dry introduction to globalization. What I got was a fascinating visual display of shocking shots from China and the United States. The insightful film is humorous, profound, serious, not patronizing and leaves you more than the credits role. It's worth comparing with Murderball - it's just so well done. The young women workers in China have different perspectives and the owner is amazingly open about the discipline. The revelers during the carnival are the highlight, but only because this excellent film offers a profound context within the factory in China without narration. Bravo to the filmmaker for getting started and finishing the movie! I never thought about the connection between Pearl, China and New Orleans. Now I think about the human connection between almost every object, but also about the role of globalization, inequality and fun. More importantly, I can make those connections without feeling bad after watching this movie, unlike other globalization films I've seen.
