This movie is one of my favorites of all time. Cary Grant, Victor McLaglen and Douglas Fairbanks Jr ... what a cast. Not to mention Sam Jaffe as Gunga Din. Drama, action, adventure and comedy in one. The last fight scene to this day gives me shivers and the end always leaves me in tears. If you have not seen it, I would strongly recommend it.
