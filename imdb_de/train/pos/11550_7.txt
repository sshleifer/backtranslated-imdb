If you delete the first 20 minutes of this movie, a fantastic comedy remains. Still, I still found it a pretty good movie, which is not an easy task given the coma I put into the opening scenes. To say the least, this movie has a bleak beginning that was not even funny or even funny. As things get dumber, there's a comedy left, which after more than three decades is still going strong. Definitely worth a visit, especially if you're a younger fan of Lemmon and Matthau and would like to see their previous work.
