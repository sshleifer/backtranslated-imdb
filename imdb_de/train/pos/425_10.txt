I would like to comment on the movie April Love. It's one of my absolute favorites because my dad Nelson Malone plays the horse trainer. I remember exactly when Hollywood came to Lexington, KY, where we lived at the time to do April Love. My father had participated in numerous plays and was a talented man. I persuaded him to try some of the parts offered, and lo and behold, he came home with the script. How exciting is that! In addition, some of my classmates were in the audience scenes - especially those shown in the amusement park. It's very nostalgic every April when I see the movie again, and the song April Love by Pat Boone is still played on the radio. Timeless and reminiscent of a bygone era when you see the films that make them today with all sex, bad language and violence. It would be refreshing if more films like April Love were brought into focus again ...
