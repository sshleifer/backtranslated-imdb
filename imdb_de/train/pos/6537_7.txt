The children I took with me to this film were thrilled (four children aged 9 to 12, they would have given it 10 stars). Emma Roberts was charming in the title role. (Expect more from this next-generation Roberts in the future.) After being overly exposed to Britney Spears, Lindsay Lohan and Paris Hilton, it was refreshing to see a girl who did not look like she was working in the office streets , It also liked to see a side cast that included Tate Donovan, Rachel Leigh Cook, Barry Bostwick, and Monica Parker (with a Bruce Willis cameo). Last Take Away: Sweet movie. <br /> <br /> (Note: I have not read the book series, so my comments are based solely on the merits of the film.)
