Even longtime Shirley fans can be surprised by "Now and Forever". The movie was filmed with Paramount Studios? not with Shirley's parent company Twentieth Century Fox? 1934, before Fox producer Darryl Zanuck had perfected the successful Shirley formula (sweet songs, cold hearts to melt, young couples to the cupid, happy ending). So "Now and Forever" falls into the category of a Shirley vehicle without the standard Shirley story. It's an uncomfortable position for any movie, but this impressive, talented cast makes it possible. Gary Cooper and Carole Lombard are the fun, irresponsible comrades Jerry and Toni Day. The only thing that seems to hate this dedicated but dysfunctional duo more than being together is to be disconnected. When they suddenly ended up worrying about Jerry's young daughter Penny (Shirley Temple), is it Toni? and not Penny, how many believe? who persuades Jerry to give up his criminal career. But Jerry flutters at his desk job and desperately wants to prove that he can take care of his new family, he soon returns to theft and dishonesty. In a standard Shirley device, Penny tries to melt the heart of crunchy curmudgeon Felix Evans, a victim of Jerry's annoyance, but their attempt fails because Evans has exposed himself as a fraud and blackmails Jerry to help him steal jewels. The drama, the shooting, the death and the grief that follow make this film very unusual for Little Miss Sunshine. There is no happy ending, no dancing and only one song sequence (the cute number "The world owes me a life"). <br /> <br /> But that does not mean that Shirley fans should avoid "Now and Forever". "It's a departure from the usual Shirley story, which makes it more interesting and memorable than many of her other films, but beware: you should avoid a colored version of this movie and see in black and white if you can." The color is bright, garish and unrealistic, and in many scenes Shirley's famous curls are actually red instead of blonde.
