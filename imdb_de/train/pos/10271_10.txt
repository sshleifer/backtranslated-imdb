This movie should not be compared to "The Sting" or other movies. What makes it a great movie experience is what it has to say about relationships, deceit and trust. It is also a fairly critical criticism of psychiatry, as the female protagonist is a shrink who is so easily betrayed and then acts in the finale in such a primitive way. Has Mr. Mamet had an unfortunate experience in therapy? We recommend!
