On October 24, 1955, hard-working Hadley Oil Company geologist Mitch Wayne (Rock Hudson) meets senior secretary Lucy Moore (Lauren Bacall) in her boss Bill Ryan's office in New York and invites them to a conference with alcoholic playboy and the son of a tycoon Kyle Hadley (Robert Stack). On the way to the meeting, he confesses that they traveled from Houston to New York to satisfy the reckless Kyle, who has been his best friend since childhood, to eat a sandwich from Club 21, and the meeting was just an excuse for Kyle's father Jasper Hadley (Robert Keith). Mitch and Kyle immediately fall in love with Lucy and Kyle uses his money unsuccessfully to impress Lucy; then he opens his heart and suggests Lucy. They marry and travel to Acapulco, and the insecure Kyle stops drinking. In the meantime, Kyle's sister Marylee (Dorothy Malone) is a light woman and has an uncorrupted infatuation with Mitch, who sees her as a sister. A year later, Kyle discovers that he has a problem, may be sterile, and starts drinking again. The jealous Marylee poisoned Kyle that his wife and Mitch have a love affair. When Lucy realizes that she is pregnant, Kyle believes that the baby belongs to Mitch and leads his distrust to a tragedy. <br /> <br /> "Written on the Wind" is an overrated melodramatic soap opera with artificial characters and situations. There are at least two great films featuring characters with alcohol problems: "The Lost Weekend" (1945) with breathtaking performance by Ray Milland and "Days of Wine and Roses" (1962) with a fantastic performance by Jack Lemmon. Robert Stack has a reasonable performance and the motives of his character for drinking are shallow and clich√©s. In the end, the unforgettable "Written on the Wind" is just entertaining and never a feature that can be nominated for the Oscar. My voice is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Palavras ua Vento" ("Words in the Wind")
