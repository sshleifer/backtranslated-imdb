Pickup on South Street (1953), directed by Samuel Fuller, contains an impressive opening that is a double complication. Underground driver Candy (Susan Peters) collides with pickpocket Skip McCoy (Richard Widmark dived into Nuatas Sinatra tones). She does not know that she wears valuable microfilm. McCoy is not aware of that. Both do not know that they are being watched by two federal officials. So the Grift starts a certain amount of knowledge. Candy is seen twice (Skip and the police) and therefore doubly naive; Skip, the cocky little thief, is attentive to the uncertainty of the federal government officials; The federal authorities, who all know, are ultimately helpless. They can not stop the "passing" of government secrets or the spread of communism.
