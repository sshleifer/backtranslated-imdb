In contrast to other comments, I found this film intriguing despite all its mistakes and the zombie playing of some actors. <br /> <br /> As a technologist I found the experiments interesting and the hardware realistic. Although reading people's heads through computers sounds fantastic, experiments are now being conducted to do just that. I note that these experiments are at a very early stage and the results are not favorable so far. <br /> <br /> The characters in the movie are well staffed. The girl looks a bit exaggerated, but looks stupid. The truck driver is a bell for real truck drivers. The minister conveys first doubts: (The chief investigator informs the minister that he (the minister) is not sure if he believes that God created man or that man created God His belief: Only the doctoral student plays the zombie The secrets they hold are appropriate for their characters, and in the face of death they react like real people. <br /> <br /> The film is a warning of the dangers of full government surveillance: like a thriller The film does not have enough thrills, it is fascinating as a scientific exercise with philosophical foundations.
