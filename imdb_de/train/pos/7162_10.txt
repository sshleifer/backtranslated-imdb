This is one of my favorite movies of all time. I read the book and I liked it, but this film extends everything that made the book famous. The drama is fantastic, especially by Jon Voight, who plays Mr. Sir, a very angry character. This film has a certain kind of storytelling that keeps you addicted to the end, where everything is pulled together for a great ending. I also love how this is managed by commuting between modern times and the stories of Stanley's ancestors. The story was written by Louis Sachar, yes, but it seems this story is made for the film and Andrew Davis does a great job of directing it. I definitely recommend it to anyone who likes good movies.
