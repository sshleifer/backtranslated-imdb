Cheesy! I love it! Corny - as the TV show was about 40 years ago! Adam and Burt ignite the same chemistry on the screen that never seems to be left! They rekindle old memories, and the actors they play from the 1960s show some things behind the scenes that are interesting to know. 1960's television was a crappy escapism for so many of us, and this DVD is no exception if you're familiar with the original TV series. The fight scene with the written Boofs and Bams or whatever is fantastic !! The movie scene shows excerpts of the bad guys who have died. In the end, Frank Gorshin appears. He did not die too long after this DVD was made, I think, and it's thanks to him that he once again played a villain before Adam and Burt, just as Batman and Robin did many years ago. He did not lose his touch! Thanks to Julie Newmar, who has also relived a rogue role. In conclusion, I think this DVD is great memories, and I want to thank both Adam and Burt for coming back and restoring those memories for those of us who remember the original - !!! Thanks, people!!!
