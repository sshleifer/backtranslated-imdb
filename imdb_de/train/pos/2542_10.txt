With a special telescope, Dr. Ing. Janos Rukh (Boris Karloff) successfully proved that a few years ago a meteorite landed in Africa containing an unknown but extremely powerful element. Dr. Benet (Bela Lugosi) is an expedition led by Rukh to locate the element. Unexpectedly, Rukh discovers "Radium X", even more powerful than radium and very radioactive. Karloff gets contaminated and can kill anyone if he's just touched. The sparks really fly between Lugosi and Karloff in this classic sci-fi movie in the aftermath of World War II. Director Hillyer used a few standing sets from the "FLASH GORDON" series, which was shot at the same time, and also took a few shots with Frankenstein electric machines. Universal has not informed the public about the special effects in this great classic movie. Karloff and Lugosi were at their best and both enjoyed working together and will be thrilled by future generations.
