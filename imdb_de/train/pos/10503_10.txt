When I got my first N64 at the age of five or six, I fell in love with it and my first game was Super Mario 64. And I loved it! The graphics were great for the time, a good plot, great courses and more All in all, the best music I've heard in a Nintendo game. <br /> <br /> I can not fully remember the story, but I think Princess Peach was kidnapped by Bowser and Mario has to rescue her. The game is said to receive 120 stars from the curses in the castle. Everyone had about five or six challenges to get the stars. There are secret parts of the castle where you can get more stars. But of course you defeated Bowser. * I think there are three levels where Bowser can be defeated. * Let's start with the characters. Mario is the main character and is advised by Toad helpful. He is basically one of your only alliances. I heard that Luigi and Yoshi are in the game towards the end. The main villain is Bowser, and there are a number of other characters like Boo and Goomba. The characters are really great. <br /> <br /> Next, how about it? People say gameplay is more important than graphics, and I totally agree. But with its great storyline, there are great graphics. Especially for the time. I do not have a whole host of other Nintendo games like 007 and their graphics Compare it to Super Mario.Bright colors, great effects, and awesome sound effects. I liked the graphics in the watercourses very well. In addition to the Bowser world, she has the best graphics in the game. <br /> <br /> Well, the music. This is my favorite part of the game. When I was playing this at a young age, I would like to keep the game going all night so the music would make me fall asleep. Especially the music of Jolly Roger Bay, which was peaceful and wonderful. There are others who are great, especially in the worlds of Bowser, who stay with me the most and are my favorites. <br /> <br /> This game was my favorite time as a developing player and I love it. This game gets 10/10 or ***** (5) / ***** (5) GO GAME THE GAME!
