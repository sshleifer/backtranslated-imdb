This is one of those films that I've seen so many times that I can quote most of it. Some of the lines in this movie are simply unbeatable. I especially enjoy it when I see him stumble and fall while he is drunk. I go out into the chic restaurant and moose time part. From the moment that Arthur comes to Susan's dad to the moose, you're laughing pretty much all the time. I remember watching the out-takes with the moose. It went down as I had imagined. They all laughed so hard that it was difficult to film them. <br /> <br /> The late Sir John Gielgud was a wonderful addition to it. His behavior, his one-liners, and his dealings with Arthur were all equally funny. It's always a funny moment when he slaps his hat over his head or tells him he's a spoiled little ____. I laugh every time I hear the "I'm going to take a bath" and the following lines.
