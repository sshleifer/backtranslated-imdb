This is without doubt one of the best movies I have ever seen. The first time I saw it, I was about 9 or 10 years old. I was looking at the rape scene sometime. When I saw it, I was really shocked to think, "What a sick movie is that?". Today I saw it from the beginning and really understood how great this movie really is. It's exciting, frightening, shocking and disturbing in its own way. But best of all, it's the end of showing the audience that this experience will keep the characters alive for the rest of their lives. It will torment their conscience and they worry about the bodies found in this river for the rest of their lives. And there's nothing they can do about it that they have to live with. This ending is one of the most unlucky ends in film history and very clever, brilliant and terrible. <br /> <br /> And acting is great as well, especially Jon Voight and Burt Reynolds. Great spectacle in this movie. All in all, John Boorman has created one of the best films in all of film history, based on Dick Chaney's novel. A must for all movie lovers
