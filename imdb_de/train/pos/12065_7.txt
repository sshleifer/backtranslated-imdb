"Insignificance" is anything but a great movie, from a stage play, directed by Nic Roeg. In the scheme of Roeg's films, this is above the level of most of his work after "Do not Look Now," in which Theresa Russell is used as the leading actress. She is really good here and far from the problem in other Roeg films like "Bad Timing" and "Cold Heaven". As an "actress", who is Marilyn Monroe, Russell is very effective and portrays her as a thoroughly depressive but likable siren. She plays well with Michael Emil as Einstein, who is, to say the least, outstanding. He looks admirable, and although Theresa Russell does not look exactly like Monroe, she's certainly attractive enough to make the part come true. Other players are sufficient, though not as arresting as Emil and Russell. A fairly workable, intelligent script is well managed by Roeg, but certainly not brilliant, like "Walkabout" or "Performance." As in other later Roeg films, he tends to rely too much on vague, unimportant flashbacks that add little to the film. In many ways, the movie would have worked better as a shorter (eg 60 minutes) and more modest piece. Nevertheless, a perfectly acceptable, passable film. Very good, but overall a bit poor. Rating: - *** 1/2 / *****
