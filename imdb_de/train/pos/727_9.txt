One of the best, if not the best rock'n'roll movies ever. And it's not just a pointless fun. There were really a lot of clever jokes here. Of course I love the Ramones. But with all the themes "Anarchy" and "I hate high school," the movie does not take itself too seriously, which is great in the spring of 1980, and I've seen it again recently. Since I went to high school in the late 70s, I got kind of nostalgic. <br /> <br /> As I said, this movie is not so serious and is not as presumptuous as so many other seventies, eighties and nineties teens. And to say it, it's not really dirty or disgusting either. Only PG rated. This is rare for a movie in this category. A great cult classic and a really incredible time capsule.
