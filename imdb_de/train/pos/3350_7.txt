I do not remember that I ever saw this title before tonight. The title probably sounded so ordinary that he kept passing me. But it's a well-made B-western with an interesting scary storyline that is complemented by good to crazy actors. Robert Mitchum plunges into an open city and seeks his wife and the news of her daughter and remains for a time as a city tamer. As always, the good business people have mixed feelings - they want to get rid of the bad guys, but they like the business they bring. Laws are still in place for relaxing drinks and gambling and promoting industry, but they claim to be lamenting the harmful effects they can have on ordinary people. The fascinating thing about this film is the cynically intense portrayal of Mitchum cleaning the city of villains and the assumption that the city dwellers were convinced that his violent methods were the only ones. Favorite piece: the sudden death of two villains in the Red Dog Salon. The firing of the main salon bordered on evil, but was an effective means to combat the spread of poison. <br /> <br /> All in all a very good movie whose only flaw is a bit hokeyness - not so good for do-gooders who would probably prefer a lifelong negotiation with the evil instead of ending it.
