Well, you take O.J. Simpson as an American soldier transformed all American bus drivers who decide to save his passengers alone, only when no one else goes, and Arte Johnson in an absolutely direct role as a tour guide who does not know what to do, but not I do not want admit that they are in trouble, and combine them with Lorenzo Lamas, as one of three vicious boys who have to kidnap an heir and leave a busload of people to die at dessert and lots of drama. Everyone was fine, but seeing llamas as the worst of the bad guys really impressed me. He was far too credible as the arrogant villain who not only wanted to kidnap the heir, but also wanted to rape the women and humiliate the guy who had tried to stop him. This obviously took a long time before he developed his good image. And believe me a 20 year old Lorenzo in tight jeans, which you really do not want to miss!
