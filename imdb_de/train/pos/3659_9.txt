This movie was my first encounter with Mr. Sica, so I did not know what to expect. But what I've seen has broken all my expectations - in a good way. <br /> <br /> The plot is not complex and shows us a life of found young children and especially its connection to the community of poor people who gather together built a dome of simple metal panel houses. This little town in another city lives its own life and things are going well. But one day there is a water resource and a rich nobleman is interested in buying the place. But as the title of the film suggests, a miracle is taking place. Our character receives a miracle dove from his dead mother. What will he do to protect his friends and all built cities? <br /> <br /> It was just a masterpiece of natural comedy. It shows how poor people behave and how money and property can talk and play with people. There are also many funny moments and scenes included - at the beginning with the place where the sun is shining and much more. <br /> <br /> So if you are not a comedy, you should watch this movie because of me I liked it very much <br /> <br /> me
