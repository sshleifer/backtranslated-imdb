If the Lion King was a Disney version of Hamlet, then the Lion King 3: Hakuna Matata is a Disney version of Guildenstern and Rosencrantz are dead. Just like Tom Stoppard's seductive film, we can see the action from the point of view of two look at the smaller characters of the original: Timon, the meerkat with a tendency to dive into a song in no time, and Pumbaa, the warthog with flatulence. By following their story, not Simbas, we can see why all the animals bowed when Simba was presented from Pride Rock. We learn why Timon and Pumbaa decided to follow Simba back to Pride Rock to drive out Scar. And we learn how they dealt with the hyenas once and for all. Nathan Lane as Timon gets the best jokes, but is supported by Ernie Sabella as Pumbaa. It is also good to hear Matthew Broderick and Whoopi Goldberg reinterpreting their roles. Julie Kavner and Jerry Stiller give their unmistakable voices to two new characters: Timon's mother and uncle. The only downside is the constant stop-start-rewind fast-forward device, which does not always help drive the story forward. At the beginning of the film, however, a brilliant zoom can be seen. Hakuna Matata is more laughing than any other third Disney series movie, and it's well worth seeing - if only for the hot tub scene, which is still fun, though it's a bit predictable.
