No, this weird horror horror flick of the 70s is not about a mortally obsessed dessert cake. Yet, this extraordinarily terrible, yet undeniably amusing, and therefore pleasing, cathode-ray drop reaches a breathtaking peak of absolute, tireless stupidity and cruelty that is quite delicious in such a hideous, unbelievable way. Richard Crenna, who looked ugly and possibly drunk, and Yvette Mimieux, who looks as if she could not bear the brutal rape she endured in the Jackson County Jail, portrays a disgustingly nice and respectable suburban couple whose quaint, boring Sleepy Town Existence is torn apart when the sweet German Shepherd they pick up as a family pet proves to be an ancient deadly evil spirit. Soon Mimieux and her two dismissive children Kim Richards and Ike Eisenmann (the psychic alien moppets from the Disney "Witch Mountain" pictures) worship a rough crayon drawing of the evil, ugly canine in the cave. Boy, does not that sound really scary and disturbing? Well, scary and disturbing, this ridiculously ridiculous claptrap is certainly not, but thanks to Curtis ("Night Tide") Harrington's hopelessly weak direction, cartoonish (not so) special effects, he is funny, an almost painful and painless trick plot and a game, bravely battling the absurd story (alongside the leads, both Martine Beswicke and RG Armstrong appear briefly as members of a satanic cult and Victor Jory has a nice cameo as a helpful Native American shaman). Favorite scene: The malevolent Mephestophelion Mutt puts Crenna on top of him and practically forces him to put his hand into a raging lawnmower blade. While stuck Snobby Fear movie fans can keep their noses from the perfectly putrid stench of this admittedly smelly bat, religious TV waste lovers should consider these adorable hideous innards to be the alpine doll.
