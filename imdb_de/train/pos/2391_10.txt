My husband and I enjoy The DoodleBops as well as our 8 month old baby. We bought him DVDs and CDs so we could watch and listen to them ourselves. They are fun, energetic and very entertaining. They encourage children to be active, to share and to care. They always have a positive message along with fun conversation. Every time our son hears the theme song, he quickly turns his head to the TV and jumps excitedly up and down. Dee Dee is a wonderful singer, she has a great voice. Moe is a great dancer. I would recommend The DoodleBops to anyone with children. Our favorite song is The Bird Song. You can just smile and want to dance when you hear it.
