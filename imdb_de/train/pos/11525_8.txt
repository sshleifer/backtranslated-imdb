This movie is great for three reasons. It is aesthetically beautiful. I absolutely loved that. Throughout the film, there is a bold color theme with extraordinary costumes and scenic sets. A photograph that looks very expensive (and probably was not) completes the look. I always enjoy these stories about groups of outsiders / loners who come together and become a family. Sometimes they get into stereotypes, but this is not. This group of actors portrays really flawed but extremely likable characters. Alan Larkin is the best (between him, the van and the road movie theme, I could not help remembering my favorite movie of Little Miss Sunshine last year) I discovered Fabrizio Bentivoglio, a very interesting actor, and was shot by Til Schweiger is sometimes a little annoyed, the opening scene, all the scenes in which they screw up their tricks are very funny, there is a mix of humor and emotions throughout the film, I like the end very much and of course everything revolves around the subject Magician: A good magician lets the audience look where they want it to create an illusion, which is exactly what a movie director does, and that's why they call it film magic.
