"Sweetness is never so sweet without the acid." This quote, in my opinion, was essentially the theme for the movie. Tom Cruise plays a young man who has been given everything in his life. He takes things for granted and it comes in this great movie with a great twist to the point. This movie will involve you in the plot and can not stop it for a bathroom break. <br /> <br /> It's a movie where you really step back and look at your life and lifestyle. You can not really appreciate the better things in life (sweetness), like love, until you have experienced the bad ones (the acid). The theme will really make you "open your eyes". <br /> <br /> The only complaint is that the film is very distorted in certain places and difficult to understand. I think the end is perfect. I recommend you to look at it and see for yourself.
