I saw this movie in a very strange way - I put it on my Netflix list and could not remember why (except that I knew that Philip Seymour Hoffman was there). Since the film has no opening credits, I could not remember who had directed it. <br /> <br /> When my wife and I saw him, I turned to her for about 45 minutes and said, "You know, I still want to decide that I hate this movie, but something just does not let me Stop looking at him. "Then there is a play of about half a dozen scenes in the middle of the film that are really electrifying in the actors' performances. <br /> <br /> It was not until the credits rolled that I realized it was a Sidney Lumet movie. And I thought - wow. I am surprised that Lumet has recorded a really dirty, petty story about really mean, broken people. But it's a testament to his talent that I was so excited when I did not know it was him. Philip Seymour Hoffman is really good in this movie. How awfully good. Sit down against Capote and I would argue that the Oscar should have been instead for this film. <br /> <br /> I also recommend the narrative peculiarity in which Lumet, Hawke and Hoffman talk about the film - it's entertaining and instructive, with Hawke playing the student who loves to learn at his feet. Lumet definitely teaches you the first rule of working with actors - always kissing her asses !! <br /> <br /> There are a lot of violent, melodramatic films that are gradually becoming empty ciphers. And in this film there is an element - the actors fill the air with sulphurous emotions, and when the smoke clears, nothing remains. Nothing resonates on a deeper level. <br /> <br /> But Lumet has given us Network and Twelve Angry Men - films raised in their own way to the highest levels of cinema. <br /> <br /> This movie is not at this level. But there is something that keeps up. And maybe that's enough. <br /> <br /> My last comment refers to the comments - if you look at the number of comments on this little movie here on IMDb - and the depth and intelligence of the comments, Pro and con - it's a pretty good one A hint that something special is happening with this movie.
