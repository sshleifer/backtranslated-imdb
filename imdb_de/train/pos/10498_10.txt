It's a bit easy. That's all. <br /> <br /> The graphics are clean and realistic, except that some of the fences are 2d, but that's forgivable. The rest of the graphics are cleaner than GoldenEye and many other N64 games. The sounds are great. Everything from talking to SFX is pleasant and realistic. <br /> <br /> The camera angle is sometimes a bit frustrating, but the same for every platform game like Banjo-Kazooie and Donkey Kong 64 /> <br /> I received this game in 1997 as a Christmas present, and since then I have over 10 times dutifully received 120 stars.
