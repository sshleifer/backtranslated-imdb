This documentary has been nominated for an Oscar and it's easy to see why. 45 years later, it is an impressive work. Why it is not printed is a puzzle that only Disney can explain. Good use of live footage and animations in tandem. That used to be part of "Vault Disney" or something, but I have not seen it for some time. * sigh * Most recommended.
