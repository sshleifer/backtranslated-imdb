Nicolas Mallet is a failure. A cashier in a bank, everyone passes over him. Then his friend, a writer who does not like books, has a plan to change his life. Our hero tells his boss that he stops. He wants to spend the rest of his life making a lot of money and sleeping with many women. And he can do it. <br /> <br /> If it were not for the number of deaths (murder / suicide / natural causes) in the movie, it would be a farce. There are numerous jabs in marriage, politics, journalism and ... life. Jean-Louis Trintignant is a sympathetic amoral villain. Romy Schneider is at her most attractive. Definitely worth a look.
