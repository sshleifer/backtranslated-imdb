This is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. Anyone who considers this movie to be completely insignificant is not smart enough to capture all the subtle humor this movie has to offer. It shows us that real life and "fictitious" actions can lead to a winning combination. As a romantic comedy, it also has one of the smartest ways two people can find each other. Call me another movie where you can see all this, and Donald Sutherland sings a song like "You'll find your anus on a mountain on Mars."
