Can such an ambient production have missed its primary goal, namely to adapt the novel by Allende correctly? Yes, of course. Bille August was able to make a superficial, flat film in which basic elements of South American mentality are simply presented as side events, leading to total incoherence. I can not believe that there was an entire production team that could not understand the book! There's technical quality in this movie, of course, and I think the actors did their best to get what they had in their hands, but there's something missing. And that something was the most important part.
