Acting is a bit cheesy, but for the people in this area who are automotive engineers in the 80s and now in Detroit, this is a great movie. I even work with a Japanese provider, so this movie is even funnier. Jay Leno showed his age in the Tonight Show yesterday! He looks pretty young here ... 17 years ago. The opening scene with the drag race on the seemingly Woodward Ave was great. <br /> <br /> Leno also owns some bad cars now, it would be great to see a remake of it with his modern collection. I'm sure the blown Vette in the opening scene was his own car. <br /> <br /> Typical 80s movie. Look at it and enjoy it. No computer-generated crap!
