I have not seen this movie until after years of excitement. Needless to say, the actual experience was a bit anti-climactic. Nevertheless, Alec Guiness leads a wonderful cast in a happy, though formula-rich, industrial England after the Second World War. <br /> <br /> This is the familiar story of the suffering of inventing the perfect everyday product. Do you remember the car that goes by water? Do you remember the promise of nuclear energy? In this case, it is a fabric that does not wears, wrinkles or even gets dirty! Of course, fabric makers and their employees are appalled by the prospect of being bogged down, and so the conspiracy grows fatter. Guinness makes the whole company rewarding and watching him Factory research lab is always a real hit! (These Britons ... always stiff upper lip when shot at.) The film may be jerky just like Guiness' doofy invention, but it's still a good ride.
