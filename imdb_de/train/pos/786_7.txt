Andie MacDowell's facial expressions are great again in this movie. If you are 40 years old and have been alone for a while (or your entire life), you may feel like you are wasting. The movie is a sweet reminder that love can be found everywhere if your antennas are acutely active. I liked the quick sexual encounter, which must be inappropriate for a normally reserved teacher (MacDowell). Her former student is sweet enough and in love with his teacher forever. <br /> <br /> There are some parts that I find unrealistic or impractical. At one scene where the jealousy of the other women was overridden and Andie MacDowell was asked to throw the young man, would a mature police officer (the other friend of MacDowell) allow her friend to do such a sinister act? Is it so easy for someone not to stop in front of a car? Of course, accidents happen again and again, but I hoped to see the heroine happily married to the first man she was involved with (that was the hardest part to believe !!) for such a beautiful woman for so long was alone?) ... <br /> <br /> Maybe the movie producers know that a lot of romance between an older woman and a younger man does not last long. They also know that a happy ending would not appeal to the public, especially women over 40 years old and waiting for miracles. The sad end with a glimmer of hope for the sad woman who has lost her true love is sweet, but if the man lived on, would that last? For how long? Nobody knows. Nonetheless, it's a movie in which you want to see it again sometime later ... maybe a year later.
