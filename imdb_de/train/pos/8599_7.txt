It's been 19 years since Gordon Gekko used "Wall Street" to let us know that greed is good. Now Michael Douglas takes the GG persona and turns her into a secret service agent, Pete Garrison. Guess what? It works out! This is a solid political thriller that makes me think. Fascinating was also the detailed work, in which the security arrangements of the SS on behalf of the President and the First Lady were presented. All hints were pretty good, but I could not accept Eva Longoria as a Secret Service Agent. While Jodie Foster has just got you to believe and really believe she's FBI Agent Starling in "Silence of the Lambs," you do not feel the same way with Longoria. Still, this is a fun movie, escapist entertainment with the Beltway as a backdrop.
