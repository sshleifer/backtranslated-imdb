That makes me proud to be a Brit. This is by far the funniest on TV. The league consists of Jeremy Dyson, Steve Pemberton, Mark Gatiss and the beautiful Reece Shearsmith. Totally underrated is this horror comedy perfection. The characters are iconic and the expressions bizarre "Hello Dave". It's a comedy that everyone just has to watch. <br /> <br /> The best thing about the men's league is that it is always fresh and always pushing the limits. It is not necessary to rely on keywords (unlike the UK) for it to be funny. The fact that the League is ready to kill its most famous and famous characters shows us that they have steel balls.
