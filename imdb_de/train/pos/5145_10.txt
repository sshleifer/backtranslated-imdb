<br /> <br /> An old man works as a janitor in a mental hospital to be close to his wife, who is a patient there, and to try to get her out. <br /> <br /> This is certainly one of the most forgotten masterpieces of the silent time and a curiosity in the history of Japanese cinema. After much thought, a print was found in the 70s and a music soundtrack was added, which fits perfectly with the pictures. It may have been influenced by the Cabinet of Doctor Caligary (director Kinugasa claimed he had never seen German film). However, it surpasses it stylistically and in its more convincing (and cooler) portrayal of the mental state of inmates inside the institution. To achieve this, the film utilizes every film technique currently available: multiple exposure and subjective out-of-focus focus, tilted camera angles, fast and slow motion, expressionistic lighting, and overlays. It's also a very complicated movie that follows because he has no subtitles. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a montage of rain sprays hitting the windows of the hospital, wind-shattering trees and thunder. The unsettling weather shows the mental state of the patients and introduces one of them: a former dancer. The combination of sounds produced by rain, wind and thunder serves as music that animates the dancer into a hectic, almost hypnotic dance. In another sequence in which the same patient is involved in another raging dance, it is observed by other inmates. Multiple exposures of the dancer represent the view of the patient and their confused "view" of the world. <br /> <br /> These are just two examples from this amazing movie that try to portray the subconscious of patients and the view of patients "healthy" world. <br /> <br /> A MUST SEE in three words.
