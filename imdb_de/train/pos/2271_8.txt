I've just listened to the director commentary for this movie, and I think the one thing I agree with that I agree with is that this movie, like Mann's The Insider, is totally subjective. It's from Howard's POV. Any review or attempt to consider a series of comments, as Ebert did, does indeed refer to Nolte's character. If you feel that the movie is "not working," then say, I think Howard is not working. To be honest, you may be right. Howard's reasoning and personality really did not stand up to professional mental treatment and analysis. <br /> <br /> But, hey, that's the nature of the people. <br /> <br /> Andrew.
