A Give this movie a 10/10 because it earns 10/10. Two of the best actors of their time - Walter Matthau & George Burns - work together with Neil Simon and all the other actors in this film + director Herbert Ross, and all of this makes this stage adaptation come true. The Sunshine Boys are one of the best films of the 70s. I love the kind of humor in this movie. I laugh so much. <br /> <br /> I got this movie on VHS 3 days ago (yes, VHS, because it was cheaper - only $ 3). I went straight home, but I had to look at it again because I missed a few parts the first time. The second time, I felt much better and laughed a lot more. I'll definitely get that back on DVD because I have to see the specials. <br /> <br /> It's very funny how that happens. Two people work together as entertainers / actors / performers. They get along well on stage, but argue off stage, they can not survive another minute, and after about 15 years you want to reunite them for a TV special. You will find that in this movie. Matthau & Burns were great in this movie. It's a goddamn shame they died. George Burns has earned this Oscar. He gave a strong comic performance. He was also 78 when this movie was shot. So far, he is the oldest actor who received an academy at the age. Jessica Tandy breaks the record as the oldest actress. Richard Benjamin was also fantastic. He won a Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actor. He deserves this Golden Globe. Although many people can not agree with what I want to say, everyone in this film has done a great job. This comedy is an instant classic. I highly recommend it. One more thing: anyone who hates this movie is a "cleaning"
