I did not know the real events as I sat down to look at it, just the fact that it was based on a true story. After the death of the child's father, Rhonda tries to cope with the loss of her daughter Desiree (... I did not know that someone actually called her offspring that way). This is really done for kids, as is often the case with "family" stripes (with that said, get ready and get everyone together for a viewing, though I'd keep teens off, unless you are sure that they are.) I'll buy the concept), but it does not downplay the sting that the death of a parent is the case and it does not appeal to anyone. The plot is sufficiently interesting and moves well enough. Acting varies, with the excellent Burstyn sticking out most of their fellow players, Mathis followed suit pretty well and Ferland and her colleagues (with a few exceptions) were the least convincing (and frankly, they're irritating, then again I'm not really in the intended Audience for this thing). The cut and the cinematography are standard and certainly not less. While the humor is limited to a handful of amusing lines, the sound is not unpleasant. There are one or two intense scenes in this one. I recommend it to fans of this kind of movies. 10.7
