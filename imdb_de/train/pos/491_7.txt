Take 4 couples whose relationships have already been on the rocks, and place them in an island paradise where they will be tempted by 26 singles. This was the premise of the show, simple but outrageous and funny. Leave it to Fox to throw the moral out of the window and let the debauchery flow. It was like a real version of Melrose Place. The good thing about the show is that it was not about people cheating and manipulating each other for a cash prize. It was about lust and temptation, pure and simple and the ultimate test for a relationship. <br /> <br /> People either loved the show or hated it. It was like slowing down to see a terrible traffic accident. You know that you should not be careful, but you can not help but look. Apart from drama, there was a lot of eye candy.
