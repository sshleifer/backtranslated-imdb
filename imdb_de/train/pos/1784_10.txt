The evening is a fun movie with a certain depth. All actors and actresses show spectacular performances. However, with the enormous cast one expects an outstanding acting, but in this film the expectations are exceeded. One can relate to personalities and situations in one's own family. While watching the interaction of the family members, it immediately reminds one of their own family memories. This is one of the few films that inspire one to read the book. Usually it's the other way round; You read the book and want to see the movie. I will definitely get a copy of the Susan Minot book and read it. The scenery of Rhode Island is as spectacular as the soundtrack. Every car fan will enjoy the seemingly expertly restored historic automobiles. Needless to say, but I highly recommend Evening. See it, you will enjoy it.
