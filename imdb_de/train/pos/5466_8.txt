Excellent pre-code amoral story with Barbara Stanwyck as the (Inspired by Nietzsche's writings!) Inspired to expel their sensations and take advantage of themselves, using men to their advantage. For the German philosopher not really fair, but interesting that Hitler came to power this year. Stanwyck, also in this young version, does not do much for me, but she does a really good job here, always pushing herself and the movie forward. There is not as much meat here as you might expect, but there are many daring situations and amazing jokes and allusions. Great fun, if not a particularly attractive presentation of men and I think, quite frankly, not a very attractive look at the gold digger. Nevertheless, life is!
