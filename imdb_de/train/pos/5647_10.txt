I do not want to bore everyone by repeating what has already been said, but this is one of the best series ever! It was a great shame when it was canceled, and I hope someone will have the common sense to pick it up and start the series again. The good news is that it is AUS DVD !!!! I rushed into the store and picked up a copy. I'm glad it's as good as I remembered. Gary Cole is a wonderfully dark and scary character, and all the actors were very good. It's a shame that the network did not continue. Shaun Cassidy, this is a masterpiece. Who enjoys the genre and has not seen it, must do it. You will not be disappointed. My daughter, who was too young to look at when she was on TV (she is 20), is very interested and will soon be a fan. She finds it "very twisted" and has enjoyed the episodes she has seen. I can not wait to watch the episodes that were not broadcast. <br /> <br /> This show rocks !!!!
