I saw El Mar yesterday and thought it was a great movie. It begins with a childhood episode in the life of the 3 main characters: Ramallo, Manuel Tur and Francisca. Then we jump about 10 years in a hospital, where the three friends meet again. Religion, illness, love, violence and sexuality are raging throughout the film, creating an intense and suspenseful film. <Br /> <br /> I see people complaining that the movie is too bloody, and I think they missed the point of the story. It's a violent, intense and sad story. People should have to suffer. Cry. Get injured. Blossoms. And I think that what the film shows is not made out of pure shock or displayed in an unpleasant way. I know that some people like their films "clean", even those with violence. But sometimes a movie has to make you feel uncomfortable at work. This is one of those movies. And it's a great movie. <br /> <br /> The only mistake I found was that there were 3 or 4 moments in which some details of the plot were not 100% clear, and only at the end of the movie movie did it all make sense , But it did not matter to the entire story, so I still give this movie a 9.
