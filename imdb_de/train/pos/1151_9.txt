"Soapdish" is one of the best but least remembered comedies of the 1990s. The film revolves around the various off-camera dramas that take place behind the scenes of a cheaply produced Daytime Soap Opera. The first impressive strength of the film is the fantastic A-List cast. "Soapdish" shows some of the best actors and actresses of his time. <br /> <br /> The film is superbly directed by Sally Field, as the neurotic aging actress Celeste Talbert (she's known to have a temper tantrum when she's put into a costume that looks like "Gloria F * CKING Swanson! "). Your cast reads like a Who Who Who of the '90s movie greats! Whoopi Goldberg, Robert Downey Jr., Teri Hatcher, Kevin Kline and Kathy Najimy make the film stand out. Goldberg is predictably outstanding, while the performances of Downey Jr. and Hatcher point to the comic excellence they would later achieve. <br /> <br /> The film is outstanding in terms of writing. The script has a really modern approach that gets into the wonderful bizarre several times. There are also some visual gags that are way ahead of their time. In a way, the film is reminiscent of Mel Brooks at its best and often reminds these reviewers of High Anxiety (1977). Much of the movie's humor depends on the fact that it's often scathing but pretty accurate depictions of daytime television and neurotic and overbearing actors. For example, the Extras casting session, in which Carrie Fisher's exploitative leader is played, is both hilarious and honest. For my money, one of them is best comedies that Hollywood produced in the 1990s. It's an awesome script and A-Class cast make it a must. It's hard not to love this movie after laughing for 90 minutes.
