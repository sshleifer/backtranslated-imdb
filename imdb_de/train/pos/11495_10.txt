We saw this at one of Montrose's local art cinemas in Houston, TX. That was a surprise compared to the report in the Theatrical Newsletter, but both were enthusiastic about the artistry. It was beautifully made and (apparently) photographed in a castle (somewhere near Munich). It is a very explicit study of the sexual relations of a group of twenty men and women isolated from daily constraints. It's fantastic on more levels than I can remember. We came home after the movie and talked and talked until about 4am the next morning. <br /> <br /> The version we saw was in English (mostly), so there must be at least two versions since the first reviewer saw the movie in (probably its original) German version. I searched and searched for a videotape version, but had never found anything. Would absolutely like to have a VHS or DVD version of it. It explores relationships on a fundamental level and is also a great tutorial to connect with your partner. If anyone knows the author / director, please persuade him to re-release it, preferably on DVD. I can not imagine seeing it weary to see the honest performers of the actors, who are now probably all over forty. Please bring it back please.
