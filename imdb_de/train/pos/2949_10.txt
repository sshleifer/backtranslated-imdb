This is the funniest booth I've ever seen and I think it's the funniest thing I've ever seen. If you do not choke on laughter, this is not your thing. But I do not know anybody who saw that and did not like it. It is now 17 years later and my friends and I still quote everything from Goonie Goo to Furzspiel, Aunt Bunnie, Eismann, Ralph and Ed to GET OUT !! There are so many individual and collective hit hits here that if you really have not seen this movie, you'll miss one of the best stand-ups. Take with you Robin Williams, Damon Wayans, The Dice, George Carlin or even greats like Richard Pryor or Red Foxx, and that will surpass them. I do not know how or where Murphy got some of his material, but it works. That's what matters. It is damn funny. Could you imagine how this show must have shocked people accustomed to Eddie Buckwheat and Mr. Rogers doing something for SNL? If you listen to the audience, when it hits its first joke, or when it says the F-word for the first time, they are completely shocked. <br /> <br /> His first time he says the F-word is when he does the sketch about Mr. T being a homosexual. <br /> <br /> "Hey boy, hey boy, you look so cute in jeans, now come over here and fuck me in the ass!" <br /> <br /> The crowd breaks into loud laughter out. No one expected the dirty mouth he unleashed. But the results were just great. I've never been tied up with ruthless comedies like this Stand Up. In fact, the next time my stomach ached so much from laughing, it was not until 1999, when I saw SOUTHERN PARK: GREATER LONG AND UNCUT. This comedy was harsh and unsightly, and so was Jugular, as was DELIRIOUS. I do not think it's possible to see this piece of comic book history and not to laugh. It's almost twenty years later and it's still the funniest damn thing on video. <br /> <br /> "I had your kids fishing last week, and I put the worm on the hook and the kids put the fishing rod back in the boat and poked their heads into the water for two minutes Then they started to move their heads so that the M **** F ********** comes with fish, then they looked at each other and said Goonie Goo Goo! I said, can you believe that shit ?! "<br /> <br /> Watch it again and be ready to laugh your fucking ass! <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10
