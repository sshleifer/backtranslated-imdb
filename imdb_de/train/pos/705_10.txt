I came across An Insomniac's Nightmare as I searched for unusual independent films. That crazy half-hour ride has taken me all the way, and the end was excellent - one of those NOOOOO moments that really stay with you. I have shown it to a number of people and everyone seems to agree with me. The little Ghostie girl was very talented and I think her performance stole the show. She snuck the crap out of me, that's what I can say. Nanavati did a great job to put this short thing together. All the pieces have simply set in scene and you can see from the script that she is a great writer. So well written. Undoubtedly the strongest part of the film. The direction was great and the acting was fun, but the most important factor is the strength of the script. Good job for this girl, I can not wait to see more!
