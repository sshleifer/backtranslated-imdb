Think of Pierce Brosnan, and you think you love the elegant, intelligent James Bond. In this movie, Brosnan plays against the guy - and a lot of fun (as well as the audience). This is a movie about a hired assassin who befriends a harried businessman ... and he works! <br /> <br /> This is a funny movie with very good scenes (a riveting, marginal brosnan and a good, yielding "off" - the edge kinnear has some good lines). My only downside is that Hope Davis, the oh-so-tolerant woman playing ("Can I see your gun?"), Does not show up more often: She could have been a wonderful slide to those men. <br /> <br /> This movie is like a matador: he plays with the audience as he goes "to kill". The end is awesome, because a storyline (with a positive moral!) Emerges: This is a frenetic, hectic and entertaining movie that deserves a wide audience.
