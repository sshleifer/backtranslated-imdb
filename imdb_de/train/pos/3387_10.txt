A truly amazing movie, the concept as a possible prophetic vision of the future is frightening. A world that is heavily overpopulated and unbearable due to the damaged ozone layer and all of our depleted natural resources. In this nightmarish degenerate society, we have the great Charlton Heston as a sympathetic, noir-style film detective trying to uncover the truth behind a murder, opposite the legendary film noir legend Edward G. Robinson, who presents himself in a recent performance One of the images I will always be in this film is the crowds that populate the stairwells and the way Thorne (Heston) has to go through them each time he uses them. <br /> <br /> The use of music by the film is also remarkable, though it does not contain a score in the usual sense. The opening theme is good, and the subsequent pieces of music we have here in Simonson's apartment, and especially the Beethoven pieces in the euthanasia clinic, are superbly atmospheric.
