Well executed old and very dark horror. Good lineup that includes the character of Poe himself, alluding to the story in a London pub. Although it's pretty much the only one out here that dares to visit the house on a particular night, either from room to room, looking for people or avoiding people, it's still very enjoyable. We also have the adorable and enigmatic Barbara Steele. There are a few dialogues of wood and some inexplicable details, but it's the super creepy atmosphere that is consistently maintained, and the awesome musical score that makes this piece move well. DVD comes from the USA and has some extras
