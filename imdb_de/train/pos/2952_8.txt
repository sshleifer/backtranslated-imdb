Judy Davis shows us here why she is one of Australia's most respected and popular actresses - her portrayal of a lonely, directionless nomad is top notch. A teenage Claudia Karvan also gives us an insight into what would make her one of the most popular actresses in the country in the years to come, with future roles in THE BIG STEAL, THE HEARTBREAK KID, DATING THE FINE, RISK and the acclaimed TV Series THE SECRET THE LIFE OF US. (Incidentally, as a child, Karvan was a young girl whose toy Panda was stolen from a drugstore in 1983 in the drama GOING DOWN with Tracey Mann.) If this movie comes in your direction, you should definitely see it !! Rating: 79/100. See also: HOTEL SORRENTO, RADIANCE, VACANCY, LANTANA.
