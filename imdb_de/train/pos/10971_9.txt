Gray Gardens is shocking, amusing, sad and fascinating. I watched in amazement as Ediths Jr. and Sr. bounced and kicked as I remembered their past. Their existence in a rundown mansion (which they had not left for more than fifteen years) is both a comedy and a tragedy. This is a movie you will not forget so soon.
