Hunky Geordie Robson Green is Owen Springer, a young doctor who moves to Manchester to be near his father. On the way he falls in love with Anna, a 20 year older woman who happens to be the wife of his new boss Richard Crane. Despite the warnings of his new colleagues, Owen gets Anna for herself and sabotages Anna and Richard's fraudulent marriage. This is a romantic drama with many humorous undertones and a quick joke. The actors are great: Green from "The Student Prince" and "Touching Evil" smolder on the screen as a crafty, but warm-hearted Owen; Annis from "Dune" is very lively and goes well with Green. Kitchen, from "To Play The King," is the real threat, like Richard, whose weird missteps and snobbery underscore his masterful, uplifting hatred of Owen. This is a perfect love triangle, and despite the weaknesses and fallacies of our three characters, it is better to know and observe them.
