I remember seeing this movie when it was first released in 1982. About 4 years later I had the privilege to see Luciano Pavarotti singing in the Metropolitan Opera in New York (in Tosca). Remembering the end of this movie really reminds me of this great night. What is not to like about this movie? The music is brilliant and Pavarotti (Fini) was at his best and still looked great. The story is actually very funny in part and the 'food fight' scene is still one of the funniest I've ever seen. The hot air balloon flight over the Napa Valley was beautiful and so he also sang "When we were in love" (one of the few times Pavarotti sang in English). And to hear the duet of Santa Lucia beautiful. Get real people, this was a movie about an opera singer named Georgio Fini who happened to be played by Pavarotti. Kathryn Harrold & Eddie Albert were outstanding in their supporting roles. <br /> <br /> I am very glad that I still have this almost worn-out VHS band of this movie, but I would love to be released on DVD especially now. Pavarotti is not with us anymore because I think so That this is the best performance of Nessun Dorma sung by him today.
