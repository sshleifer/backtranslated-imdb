Thriller with Brad Pitt and Juliette Lewis traveling with David Duchovny and Michelle Forbes on a road tour to the west. The latter couple are researching infamous murder sites for an upcoming book; Pitt is a serial killer on the Lam (unaware of Dave) and Juliette is his poor, not ubiquitous companion. This is a good cast, and the story continues, but Pitt is not scary as a serial killer, though it's one of his better past roles. Best of all here is Michelle Forbes, who always manages to shine, whether in her roles on "Homicide: Life on the Street" or in the short series "Wonderland." <br /> <br /> Vote: 6
