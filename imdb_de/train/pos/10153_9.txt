I caught this movie during a test demonstration. Was very surprised to find a really sweet and funny story. Well played. Natasha Henstridge is the next Julia Roberts. The male lead role was great. Very funny movie. Held in the best locations in New York. I wanted to go there. I just saw "You have mail" I thought, "It had to be you" was a much better story. Fresher. <br /> <br /> It was clean and great for the whole family. I think it will be fine The audience with whom I saw it was thrilled.
