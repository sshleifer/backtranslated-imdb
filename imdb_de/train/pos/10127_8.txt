This was the beginning of everything! Granted, these are not friends at their best, but this was the show's pilot. Let's not forget it and not bad either. We are introduced to Gang and Central Perk, where our story begins. Even from this first episode, we get a sign of the Ross-Rachel relationship that will come in the next decade, when Ross says, "I just want to get married again," and Rachel charges with a wedding dress ... probably not intentionally as it did back then, when the authors sought a Monica-Joey relationship, but it fits in well with the review. Something else ... In this episode, Rachel Chandler is introduced as if the two had never met before, but in later episodes, the so-called "flashbacks", this is contradicted because they have met three times already. However, the point is a great start to a great show. This episode may not be your usual girlfriend since we are used to it. The cast is still a bit inexperienced, but in the next few episodes, we'll see why the show got what it was! Look out, the first season is a blast !!
