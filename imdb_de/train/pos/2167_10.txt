I saw this movie in 1984, we first saw "This Is Spinal Tap" and after 5 minutes we were ready to fall asleep. So we watched this movie instead. If you have a conspiracy theory in mind, you should watch it. <br /> <br /> The question you have to ask yourself when watching this movie is: do you think the government would be able to? (In my opinion there is no doubt that they could) <br /> <br /> But I do not want to give away too much information as this would be a spoiler and I think you should watch the movie yourself. <br /> <br /> But just to let you know, we still talk about this movie 20 years later, and if you try to explain it to people, this is not the easiest thing in the world.
