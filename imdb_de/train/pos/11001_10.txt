The Canadian director Vincenzo Natali conquered the Kunsthaus tour with the fascinating and astonishingly intelligent Cube, my personal favorite SF film of the 90s. It framed the basic idea of ​​a group of strangers trapped in a labyrinth shaped like a giant cube shot completely on a set. This idea took her in fascinating directions. <br /> <br /> I waited anxiously for Natali's follow-up, and although it took me five years to realize another project, I am pleased that it was worth the wait. Cypher is a fascinating exploration of the place of a man in the world and how he enters a situation he can not control through a completely logical chain of events. <br /> <br /> I do not want to over-betray the conspiracy, because one of the joys of Cypher are the different ways we descend. It's so refreshing to see an SF movie that has more than one idea in mind today. Cypher is such a movie. <br /> <br /> Morgan Sullivan (Jeremy Northam), one of the most daring people ever to walk on Earth, is hired by DigiCorp. They send him to different parts of America to hold various seminars. To his confusion, they are incredibly boring. As sophisticated as shaving cream and cheese. <br /> <br /> While waiting for a seminar, Morgan encounters Rita Foster (a perfectly laced Lucy Liu), the definition of an Ice Maiden. She gives him the brush, but there is something he finds irresistible. That's not surprising, considering that the marriage is dry. <br /> <br /> When Rita comes to another seminar from Morgan, she tells him that his life is not what it seems. And I say nothing more about the conspiracy. This would cheapen the impact the rest of the movie has on us and the tortuous path that is so much fun. <br /> <br /> As with Cube, Natali has a knack for seemingly ordinary people who take them out of the familiar and basically see what happens when they run into the unknown. And Cypher follows similar patterns. But it is not a copy of Cube. It has its own inspiration. <br /> <br /> Cypher is a movie that has more in common with conspiracy thrillers and paranoia stories. One of the great things about Cypher is how these topics creep into history without your knowledge. When Morgan realizes that his false identity is part of a much larger puzzle, it is just as shocking to us as it is to him. <br /> <br /> One thing that differentiates Cypher from Cube is how much better it is. While Cube was limited to a minimalist environment and a tight budget with unknown personalities, Cypher also has a low budget, but Natali saves as much as possible, allowing him to broaden his horizons and take Morgan on an amazing journey through the maze his own identity. <br/> <br /> Natali's direction is extraordinary, with a skilled hand on the reins. There are some amazing camera angles from above, such as the enormity of the DigiCorp building as a huge, sturdy office block combined with the insignificant stain that Morgan holds out. The entire color seems to have been bled out of the picture, perfectly complementing the sound of the film as a modern film noir. <br /> <br /> The spectacle is consistently outstanding. Jeremy Northam is a sympathetic figure from his loveless marriage to the questioning of his own identity. His performance is excellent because it's so modulated. He literally seems to be changing right before our eyes. From a spiderless eyelash to a self-assured man who does everything to preserve his new identity. David Hewlett shows a welcome performance that left such an impression in Cube. He lives in a secret silo that looks like it was borrowed from Men in Black. His scene is one of the best because it is an exercise in carefully calculated tension and paranoia. He is a purported double agent identification expert, and it's a fantastic piece brilliantly played by Hewlett. All he has to do is look at Morgan, and we're drawn into his complex puzzle game. <br /> <br /> But it's Lucy Liu who steals the scene here. Too often she is cast in films where her potential is not fully exploited. But in Cypher she finally gets a figure that fits her like a glove. Rita is a distant, guarded femme fatale, who lives Liu with relish. Every time she showed up, I became alert, because she is always in control and can silence the room with her icy eyes alone. <br /> <br /> Things have a very enjoyable ending that does not end with an ambiguous note like Cube. But Morgan has earned his happy ending. After he went through the ringtone, I cheered him in the final scene. It is a perfect closing moment as it appears as sunbeam after 90 minutes. Cypher succeeds in all respects. Dedicated, shocking, always entertaining - it's all that Total Recall wanted to be but was not. And it's a refreshing antidote to the overwhelming and inexplicable matrix. <br /> <br /> A good follow-up from Natali. And now I am a dedicated fan of the man. Great stuff!
