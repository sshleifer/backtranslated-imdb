This is a docudrama story on the Lindy Chamberlain case and a look at its impact on Australian society. In particular, it addresses the problem of allusion, gossip and expectation in dealing with real dramas. <br /> <br /> One topic that history deals with is the way in which it is expected that all people will give the same emotional response to similar situations. Not everyone goes wild, melodramatic hysterics in any major crisis. Just because the characters act in a certain way in the movies and on television is no reason to expect real people. This is particularly useful for journalists and news editors who seem to be looking for the big gorge scene that attracts the ratings. It is a topic that needs to be addressed constantly. <br /> <br /> The leads play the characters with depth, personality and sensitivity. They are adeptly supported by a large cast who play all fact-based individuals. Some viewers may be surprised to learn that many of the supporting actors in this story are better known in Australia than comic actors. My idea that comic actors are making some of the best props in dramas is reinforced by this. Because with comedy they know how they can generate quick impressions of individuals. <br /> <br /> (Spoiler warning!) <br /> <br /> I have to say something very personal here. I am actually a former Adventist who was a practicing member in Australia at the time of this incident. So I have a slightly different impression of the story than most. I think it is handled with amazing creativity and personality and emotional heart. I think the best scene is the one where the pair is being chased by the new helicopters. The themes of the story have been brilliantly captured. <br /> <br /> I once heard Fred Schepsi say in an interview that he told the actors to "play the best case for their character they could". While this is particularly appropriate for this story, I think that it is also a general principle that should apply to all actors.
