Just to mention something about gentleman Jim. I agree with all the assessments that make this one of the greatest achievements of Errol Flynn in a career of great success. I think this role-playing boxer Jim Corbett is more like his true personality than the Swashbucklers he typed. Flynn seemed to be a party animal from his memoirs and was a guy whose real life was more exciting than his screen life. The special thing that I wanted to point out is the great montages, transitions and inlays that underline the film. Although director Raoul Walsh, a frequent contributor to Flynn, was with cinematographer Sid Hickox, the montages were designed by an aspiring editor called Don Siegel. I never knew Siegel had gone that far, but he's listed right in the credits. He would make a great career as an action director himself.
