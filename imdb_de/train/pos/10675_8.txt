I wanted to see this movie for a long time because I was a fan of Peter Cushing and David McCallum. I agree that the romantic subplot was a waste of time, but McCallum's talent seems to radiate through this youthful role. Many thanks for the Turner Classic, which aired the show last week. I can imagine that there were many problems with children after the war, especially with the things that happened in the fifties. Some of the guys are a bit scary. I would not want to meet her on a well lit street, let alone in a dark street. There were also good insights into the feelings of a fire bug or, as they call it, a firefly.
