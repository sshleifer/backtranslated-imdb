This is not my favorite WIP ("Women in Prison"), but it's one of the most famous movies in the subgenre. It was produced by Roger Corman, who had already produced several WIPs at that time. It is obvious that the film is trying to play with the established formula. The film is set in a USA prison, not a "banana republic" like most WIP films. I'm not sure if this was a smart move, but it's an acceptable change. Writer-director Demme is really working in his workplace, constantly searching for new ways to introduce a familiar scenario. In fact, he is a bit too ambitious for his own good. The filmmaker creates some surreal dream sequences bordering on the border trains, but it's fun to see how he tries to put this film above the average of the usual Chicks-in-Chains. But do not worry, Demme is still working within the parameters of the sub-genre. There is a lot of nudity and violence, which will satisfy hardcore fans. The movie is a bit slow but very entertaining. The cast is good. Roberta Collins is a WIP veteran, so she does not need an introduction, and Barbara Steel is a whore as a crazy jailie in a wheelchair. Pam Grier, however, is painfully missed.
