After hearing the CD soundtrack several times, I knew that I wanted this movie, got it for Christmas and was amazed. Marc Bolan had such a charisma, I can not describe it. I had heard of him that way, but I did not know what people were talking about until I was in the company of those recordings. He was incredible. Clips from the Wembley concert are interspersed with surrealistic sketches, such as nuns who soak up at a garden party, while Marc Bolan performs acoustic versions of Get It On, etc. (I'm still learning the song titles). George Claydon, the little photographer from Magical Mystery Tour, plays a chauffeur who jumps out of a car and eats one of the side mirrors. Nothing that I can say to describe it would spoil it, even if I put the spoiler disclaimer in this review, so you just have to see it for yourself. It escapes the description. <br /> <br /> Yes, I love the Beatles and I was curious that Ringo was leading a rock documentary 35 years ago. Now I've found out that she's been on DVD for 2 years, but she's finally at my home. It's an amazing viewing experience - even fascinating. <br /> <br /> Now comes the DVD with hidden extras and the following is a copy and paste by another user: <br /> <br /> There are two hidden extras on Born's double DVD release To boogie. <br /> <br /> 1.Select the bonus material from the menu on CD 1 and go to the additional scenes. 2.
