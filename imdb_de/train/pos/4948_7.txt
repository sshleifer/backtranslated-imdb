This is a well-made, simplistic film that explores a subject and gives each viewer something other than what he takes from it. The premise is simple: a nameless celebrity actor (Morgan Freeman) decides to research for an upcoming role by visiting a store and watching people. He is particularly interested in the cashier on the "10 Items or Less" trail (Paz Vega), who finds a loveable, strong and curious presence. Both actors play each other brilliantly and bring them with Fixed Dimension for characters in a drawing study. No conventional character study; They each represent whole worlds. The cashier's life is in a hard and frustrating "real world", while the actor is so entangled in his fantasy that he can not perform simple tasks like remembering phone numbers. He likes to admit that he puts a face on when he talks to people, and the purpose of exploring real people shows that he is not one of them. <br /> <br /> But not only the actor is inspired by real people for his work; We also see the reverse process. Several characters recognize "him" and refer to how he inspired them with his film roles. <br /> <br /> The favorite song of cashier "Al Pasar la Barca" about how a girl refuses to hide behind beauty prefers to pay for the boat trip (ie to do honest work) would not have can be chosen better. It resembles the Vega character, the only shop assistant with brain or ambition who is ready to work hard for success. (For someone who looks like Paz Vega, that's quite a claim.) It's a strange little movie that was probably filmed on a shoelace. If you do not mind taking slow steps and following a "chatty" approach, this movie will be entertained. The characters are perfectly contrasted and effective action makes them adorable. A nice clock.
