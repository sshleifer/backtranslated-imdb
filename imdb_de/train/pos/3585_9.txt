Excellent story about teenagers, leaders and "high school football" stars. How far will you go to protect your friends? Lying, killing? How much can you lose if you are breeding from an innocent girl? Can love beat the love? Can you defeat narrow-minded small town people? If your girlfriend scores and "loses," will you do everything in your power to pay for it, or will you be a man above and respect her right to vote? Do you want to rape her and show her as your victory over a "problem" girl? Can you stand for the only sin that has only sin to have your own opinion, to make your own decisions, to decide for yourself? I had to think twice before judging who was right and who was wrong, but one thing is for sure - very disturbing film and theme in general. Thumbs up!
