I get tired of my 4 and 5 year old daughters who are constantly watching Nickelodeon, Disney and the like. It all seems to be the same old, tired cartoons that are being washed over and over again. When my daughters could not go to Mass this afternoon because one of them was sick, I wanted them to just rest and rest awhile. I turned on the TV and looked for something else. I turned the channels over. My finger stopped surfing when I heard Harvey's voice. I adore every single thing this man did, and when I saw that he was doing voice-over work for a little duck ... well, I could not change the channel! My daughters were immediately fascinated by the cartoon and the more we looked at the TOGGLE SHOW, the more I was thrilled with the show. It is not necessarily an advocate of the "gay rights" but anyone who has ever been outlawed as a child for EVERYTHING. I had friends who were chosen for one thing or another ... too fat, too thin, too feminine, a bully, not smart enough, just one parent ... you name it! Children can be very cruel to each other, so I enjoyed a fun cartoon that actually gave the audience a LIFE MESSAGE. My girls already accept others as they are and do not choose others because they are different. My older daughter actually gets involved with her friends when they are approached (one happens to have a single mom, and this little girl is often dressed - it warms my heart when Kassie works for her!). <Br /> <br /> Those of you who condemn this show because you feel they are campaigning for "gay rights" or are forced to "accept certain views" have the point of this poignant one little comic sign completely missed. <br /> <br /> And if you need to explain it, you need more help than any television program could ever offer.
