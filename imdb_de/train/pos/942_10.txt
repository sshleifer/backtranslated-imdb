This is the best movie version of Dicken's classic story. I have seen it again and again on VHS and recently purchased the DVD version that is formatted for TV (not widescreen). What I find interesting about this TV play is the cast of English actors who have appeared in other movies / shows in North America since 1984. My biggest surprise is Edward Woodward, the "equalizer", as the Ghost of Christmas Present.
