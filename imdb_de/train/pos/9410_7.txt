I enjoyed this movie. But I was surprised to see people calling it a comedy. It was sometimes amusing, but it was not funny at all. If I had expected it to be a comedy, I might have been disappointed with the movie, but without any expectations, I found it pleasing and captivating. Maybe it was because I identified myself as an engineer with the protagonist. I was less interested in the satire of capital or work than in the basic story of a man fighting for his invention. A man who is less interested in money than his invention, rather than realizing himself and going into production. He is absolutely heroic when he refuses to take the big money and the hot wife for suppressing his invention. That's why I find it interesting that people compared it to Jurassic Park. I compare it to The Fountainhead.
