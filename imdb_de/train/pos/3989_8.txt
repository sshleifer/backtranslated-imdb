"The Mother" tells of a recently widowed mid-60s mother of two grown-up children (Reid) who, after her husband's death, wakes up from a sleepwalking life as she has an affair with a young carpenter who does her daughter's daughter is married. The film looks at the quietly passive mother, her tenacious relationship with her adult son and daughter, the silent need she tries to calm down with her young lover in bed, and the resulting windings. "The Mother" is a somewhat antiseptic drama with rushing psychodramatic undercurrents. It is an excellent job to treat uncomfortable topics realistically while avoiding unnecessary sensationalism. Will work best with a more mature audience, possibly with women who can better empathize with their central character, needs and problems. (B +)
