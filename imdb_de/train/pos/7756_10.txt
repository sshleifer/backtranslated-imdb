I'm not sure if it's some kind of masterpiece or just fluff that stands out through the performances and visuals. I am sure that I loved it. From the wonderfully twisted, radiant, interlocking stories, to the incredibly sinister appearances of Robert Stack and Dorothy Malone, to the vivid, gaudy colors that capture everything, this is a prime trash and it's great fun. Not to mention the amusingly devious and thinly veiled sexual subtexts that permeate the entire film and always threaten to flee the picture into the dialogue, but never. I would be lying if I said that the sheer entertainment value of the movie did not add to my love for it, but behind the unintentional (or was it?) Comedy was a kind of bizarre artistry, and I really dug that out. I could really get into this melodrama stuff.
