This movie made me cry in the end! I watch at least 3-4 movies a week. I've seen a lot of great movies, even more crap. But when the end of the scene - basically catharsis - ended, I cried! And if not, you have serious problems! The story is archetypal - nothing new or original. But it's real - because it's really happened and people really exist. Glam is not my kind of music, but I really admire everything they went through in the early '70s ... At some point that led me to Velvet Goldmine! Docudramas never work really well. But this movie has really made us believe everything ... Because they are not trying to make a pathway full of glorious concerts, musicians who are superheroes, groupie girls who are stupid and emotionally deaf, do not present drugs and alcohol Promote the rehabilitation and salvation that comes even 20 years later ... Once again a great movie. Since "Leaving Las Vegas" I've never been so moved by a movie.
