What interested me most about this movie was the way the characters and their stories are developed on-the-fly. I suppose the authors wanted us to be interested in the characters by not forcibly feeding their characters. The premise of using the arts and crafts of furniture design and construction was a unique theme and / or analogy to what families / siblings go through in their lives. The complexity of having a twin serves as a substitute father and even as a husband, which emotionally arouses the movie. Although the story was not a story that could directly affect the masses (ie, Jewish / Gemini / Family businesses), the themes are quite universal, as every family has a black sheep. That made it very appealing.
