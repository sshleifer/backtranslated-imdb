Everything was better in the past few days. Even kids TV. And Fraggle Rock proves my point pretty easily. I'm 14 years old when I wrote this comment, but even in my teenage years, I can not resist the charm of Fraggle Rock. For those of you who have actually lived under a rock (haha!), Fraggle Rock is a pack of playful and dumb creatures called Fraggles who, amazingly, live in a rock. But they are not the only creatures. The rock is inhabited by many other species such as the industrious Doozern and countless living plants. On the other side of the rock, inventor-scientist Doc and his dog Sprocket (who later becomes friends with Gobo Fraggle) live on the other side, on the other side a family of Gorgs-supposed rulers of the universe. The five most important Fraggles Gobo (fearless leader), Mokey (arty and peaceful), Wembley (undecided and a friend of Gobo), Boober (a pessimistic house god) and Red (love everything that has to do with sports and general Feistyness) caught In some strange situations, each episode can sing and dance simultaneously. <br /> <br /> Fraggle Rock is definitely a family show - the actions can contain intricate details that babies can not follow well, but the song and dance routines keep their attention. The characters are strong and sympathetic, their conflicts credible and their adventures exciting. The Gorgs are terrifying, Doc and Sprocket enlightening, Uncle Traveling Matt hilarious (the postcard segments are very '80s!) And the last episode, address change, really touching. Let's go to Fraggle Rock again!
