This was a great movie with a good cast that hit everyone on all cylinders. And if Dianne Keaton is at his best, it just will not get better. Tom Everett Scott, always undervalued, was even better. He should be a star. <br /> <br /> My only complaint concerns one aspect of the script. None of the characters ever acknowledged that the dead daughter was not always a good person. And her mother was not played by Keaton. At some point she breaks a promise she made to a character so as not to reveal that he had slept around. <br /> <br /> One of the other commentators said the film has a "political agenda". That's a startling thing. There was no politics at all in this film.
