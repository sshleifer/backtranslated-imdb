Spoilers for those lucky enough to ever see this movie (not really spoilers). Saw this movie when it was released, and still remember parts. It's all in a small town in the west or what's left of this city. It is more like a ghost town with few inhabitants. Among them a couple, where the wife is especially angry. She lets her husband die at the end of the film and leaves the city, but has to cross the desert. We never know what will happen to her next, but just before she leaves her dying husband, she shoots her and deliberately does not hit her and instead supplies the water. She does not know that she will soon be thirsty. Mark Damon kills some bad guys in a weird mansion - but that's another story I do not remember well. The remnant impression of the film was that it was one of the first times I saw a really angry woman in the movie pretending to be anything but evil - not unlike the witch in 'Snowwhite' that is in comparison easy to find out. Very narrow west with few main characters and still exciting.
