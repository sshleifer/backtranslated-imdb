I saw this movie a few days ago in a small independent cinema in Paris. It was my last night in the French capital and the best farewell I could choose. These twenty episodes made me relive the impressions I had gathered in Paris in a heart-warming way, without falling into kitsch or sentimental schmaltz. Each episode is full of surprises, strong emotions, and suggestive images, and each short film follows the rules of a good short story. For me, this kind of movie requires a lot more talent and qualities of a director and a storyboard author than any epic two-hour drama, and they all did a great job! The stories were carefully selected with regard to the associated arrondissement and express the respective flair perfectly. Each episode was shot from another ankle, had a different theme, a different style, and yet the twenty stories make for a harmonious film orchestra. The most outstanding advantage of the concept of an episodic film, in my opinion, is that you can switch between a wide variety of feelings and moods without the risk of overloading, just the opposite, the melange of sadness, melancholy joy, despair, anger, fear, curiosity or Passion gives this film a unique freshness and harmony. And not to forget the omnipresent topic of love! Love between the characters, love between the characters and Paris and also the love of the directors and actors / actresses for this project. I do not want to go into the details of the episodes because there are so many, but I have to highlight the selection of world-famous actors and actresses from all over the world and their approach to this project. Some played with their image, others broke it completely and others interpreted the stereotypes associated with their homeland or the roles they had previously played, and so intertextuality was given throughout the film. All in all, I can fully recommend this great collage and I'm looking forward to the release on DVD.
