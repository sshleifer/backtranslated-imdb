An interesting television movie based on true facts betrays the description of one of the protagonists, a prisoner. Giovanni Ribisi plays his younger brother, who has the difficult task of deciding whether to call his brother's death penalty. When he visits him and enters Elias Koteas, the problem begins. It has nothing to do with Koteas' acting. He just looks like the version of a prisoner of proletarian roots after "G.Q." A magazine whose language is too high for someone who has spent most of his life behind bars. This realization came to me after meeting an old friend whom I had not seen for almost 15 years and whom he spent in several Panamanian prisons. The young man I knew he left is not only older because of that, but also because he has been in prison for a long time. There are prisons and there are prisons, you have to say, but this one prisoner in "Shot In the Heart" is definitely out of this world.
