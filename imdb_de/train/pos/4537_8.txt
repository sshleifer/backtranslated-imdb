I saw the movie for the first time on BBC on July 27, 2005. For me it was a good interpretation of the person Conan Doyle, and I really wonder what the Sherlock fans think about it. I also think it's a movie for these fans, whether they agree or not, what's mentioned. You may wonder that AC Doyle was a strong person, or did he question himself. He was, however, the creator of the famous Holmes, but how much of it was a kind of half-biography? Nonetheless, I've made that adaptation emphatic, it's a movie you need to see - even if you're not interested in the Sherlock Holmes movies or books.
