Jeremy Northam's characterization of the stuttering, docile book reading Morgan Sullivan and the observation of how he unleashed loose parts of his true identity under the influence of single malt scotch, and under the spell of Lucy Liu's presence, is brilliantly crafted and a joy to watch. His offer to offer her a cigarette at the bar is an old habit that was asked without thinking or even asking questions, and he loses himself in the face, neck and lips. Whatever brainwashing, love has a way to persevere. Also, love can not be brainwashed with one of the two wrong women. Gradually, he renounces his glasses, runs and speaks differently and even his face looks different in the course of the film. The music is fantastic, hypnotic, sexy and sometimes driving. The use of black-and-white and gray tones makes this film almost a science-fiction film "Noir" in the tradition of many classic thrillers. I would have liked to have seen more vulnerability in Lucy Liu's portrayal whenever she sees him in his various insane states, the man she loves, and for whom she carries out a mission based on blind faith, some restrained vulnerabilities and flashes of genuine Sympathy and care would have made it a less one-dimensional achievement on their part. She just is not confronted with the talents of Northam, but on the whole I really liked this movie and I would appreciate knowing about other scripts from the same author.
