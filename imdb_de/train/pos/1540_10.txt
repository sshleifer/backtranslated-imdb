This is an incredible movie. I can not remember the last time I saw a Swedish movie. It's funny, it's tragic, it's captivating and, above all, it's part of Swedish small town life. It crushes the clichés and lives deeper. This will make you feel connected, not just with the main characters, but with all the characters. <br /> <br /> The big-city girl goes back to her roots, her little hometown, to celebrate her dad's 70th birthday and cross paths with people she has not met in several years. Although the story is not unique in itself, it offers a fresh approach. At the heart of the story is the relationship between three sisters (on different stages of life) who are not very close. Or at least you do not know how close they are. <br /> <br /> One of the main reasons why it is so easy to connect with the people in this film is the impeccable cast. Firstly, I am more than pleased that there is absolutely no "A-list" of Swedish actors in this film. Usually there are a handful of actors who can make it into almost every major production in Sweden. This time, the production company succeeded in preserving reality by filling actors who seem to love their profession. Sofia Helin is probably the first Swedish actress since Eva Röse who proves that you do not need words to convey an emotion. <br /> <br /> The writing is also very appealing. The dialogue is more than credible, and compared to other Swedish films of the past one or two years, it is far away. Maria Blom controls everything from the beginning, and if you did not know it, you would never guess that this was the first time they were shooting and directing a feature film. I can not wait to wait her. <br /> <br /> If you are seeing it for the first time, you really want to see through it.
