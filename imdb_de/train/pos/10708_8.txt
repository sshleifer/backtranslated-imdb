John (Ben Chaplin) is a lonely bank employee living in a small town near London. He contacts a Russian bridal agency via the internet. He chooses Sophia (Nicole Kidman - the guy could be lonely and shy, but certainly has a good taste, right?) And when they first met, he realizes that she does not speak English. Communicating with each other is essentially restricted by sex (again, imagine what a terrible situation for the guy, just have a naughty sex with Nicole Kidman!). On her birthday, two Russian friends visit her. Then many surprises will happen. I liked this movie: First, it's almost impossible to be tagged. Is it a black comedy, an action, a thriller movie? I believe that all decisions are right. Nicole Kidman is as always great and I'm very curious about her Russian: Does she speak Russian with a proper accent or just fake it? Anyway, I found it a pleasing movie. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "A Isca Perfeita" ("The Perfect Bait")
