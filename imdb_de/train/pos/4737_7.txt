Hak hap (Black Mask) I would like to call a ballet with fists and explosions. Sure, the conspiracy was tried and heard before. (A biological soldier who is part of an elite army of supermen and decides he does not consider killing and brute force a means of solving everything and becoming a pacifist. Librarian: When he learns, however, that the rest of his group are trying To find an antidote that keeps her alive by picking up the police - his best friend is a police officer - he becomes a black mask.) The style the film stands for, very visual, works, and at least to me entertaining. I love martial arts movies that are spectacular. People who fly around easier than air and recover a split second after the impact keep the pace and the action unceasing. But that's what this movie is all about, a showcase where Jet Li does what he does best, and that's a spectacular display of his abilities, which, to say the least, are first-rate. Like most fast action martial arts films. Jackie Chan and Sammo Hung, who are here for the first time here in the United States, these films are on the action and have amazing physical abilities. But I have to say, even with the big holes in the lot (how do we see him safely in his apartment when he only had one scene before he had 20 men no more than 15 yards away from him and a escape sign? ) Who knows the scene just cuts him in the apartment ... oh oh well, I think the movie is interesting. Only in the last 20 minutes does the movie seem a bit shorter. But still a great action movie.
