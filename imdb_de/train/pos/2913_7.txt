"This Man's Navy" is, as suggested in other comments, a rare and well-filmed look at Navy activities that are lighter than air (LTA). The LTA crews were justifiably proud that the convoys they shadowed did not lose a ship in a submarine attack. And filming at the various NAS locations gives a valuable insight into a kind of aviation that is long gone. In the first half of the film, however, it's all about Beery, his relationship with his service friends, and he meets the Tom Drake character and his mother and has Drake's leg repaired. Only then does the second film begin. The second movie is mostly in action in LTAs, picking up a submarine, killing guys and causing a lot of damage. The look is pretty bleak and realistic, I think. Then we switch to Southeast Asia. Did the navy have LTAs there? Anyway, this part is really wild, with an airship being used to pull run-down air forces out of the jungle. And the Japanese shoot like crazy. Shadow of Vietnam, besides the flight is oh so comfortable. We're talking about a blimp here. In the end, a benevolent WWII drama about a very unusual part of the war.
