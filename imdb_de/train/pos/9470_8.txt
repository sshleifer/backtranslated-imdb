I'm not a fan of Steve Carell, but I like this movie about Dan, a counseling columnist who goes to his parents with his kids and falls in love with his brother's girlfriend. It's a story that was told before, but not like that. There are just too many small parts that make the movie better than it should be. The cast is wonderful, and while Carell is not my cup of tea, he is quite good as a widower who wants to know everything, but knows that knowledge is something other than feeling and that life sometimes surprises you. Sometimes funny and clever in the way an annoying Hallmark card can be, the film still manages to grow on it and be something more than a run of mill film. Worth seeing
