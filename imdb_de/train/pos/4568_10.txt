Can you imagine such a talent distribution in a big-budget movie: Daniel Day-Lewis, Ray McAnally, Brenda Fricker, Hugh O'Conor, and Fiona Shaw? There is no question that Fricker and Day-Lewis have earned their accolades. But it would have been perfectly justified to see O'Conor (as Young Christie) and McAnally: The clich√© is right here: they do not play the roles, they inhabit them. Day-Lewis' performance is a tour de force - a transformation that's impressive, but it really was a sign of the Academy's intelligence that in addition to this performance, they also honor Brenda Fricker's beautifully restrained, quiet and heartbreaking work as Christie's mother. By the way, if you have not seen this great actress in "Swann," this is another movie worth watching for her contribution (and the sublime Miranda Richardson).
