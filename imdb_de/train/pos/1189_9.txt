The Last Hunt is one of the few Westerners ever to be involved in the hunt for Buffalo, both as a sport and as a business and as a way to win the Indian War prairies. Before the White entered the other side of the Mississippi, there were American bison herds in the plains that were as big as some of our largest cities. By the time the last hunt was in place, the buffalo was almost extinct. Due to the efforts of conservationists, the twentieth century saw a revival of the species population, which was hardly as it was in the past. Robert Taylor and Stewart Granger are starring in a second movie together, and this is far superior to all brothers. Here's Stewart Granger the Good, a world-weary buffalo hunter who for financial reasons has to return to a job he hates. <br /> <br /> The partner he has selected is Robert Taylor. If I forget Taylor for a moment, I doubt there's ever been a meaner, more vicious soul than Charlie Gilsen, who represents Taylor. In Devil's Doorway, he fought as an Indian against the prejudices of a racist who was played by Louis Calhern. He's the racist here in The Last Hunt. He kills buffaloes and Indians for sheer pleasure. He kills an Indian family when they steal his mules and take the widow of a prisoner. Like a barbarian conqueror, he awaits the pleasure of Debra Paget's sexual pleasures. Actually, he is crazy if Paget does not see it that way. <br /> <br /> No matter how many times you refer to Russ Tamblyn as a kind of half-breed, I never really believed he was an Indian. It's the only flaw I found in The Last Hunt. <br /> <br /> However, Lloyd Nolan, the old buffalo skinner Taylor and Granger bring along, is just great. Nolan steals every scene in the cast. <br /> <br /> For those who really like their westerns, who want to see a side of Robert Taylor never seen on screen, and who do not like cheap exploits, The Last Hunt is the ideal hunt.
