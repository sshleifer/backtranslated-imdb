It is said that Deanna Durbin invented the teens. This first movie was one of the best. The humorous story featured a delightful 14-year-old Deanna, a small beauty with a beautiful voice, as "Miss Fixit" in a divorced family. A summary of the actions can be found in other IMDb entries. However, Deanna and her two older sisters plan to travel to America from Switzerland to prevent her father from remarrying. With an excellent cast, especially Barbara Read and Nan Gray as sisters, good directing and editing, the film succeeds in capturing a film on later visits. Of the three songs by Deanna, only "Il Bacio" comes from the classical repertoire, but when she sings it in this police station scene, the place of the film is secured in the story. At least it was for this spectator, who at the age of 15 years was thrilled with both Deanna and classical music. One of the many nice touches that come with THREE SMART GIRLS is the drunk's short gaze as he stretches his neck for a last look at Deanna as the cops rush by! An unfortunate result of this film's success was that subsequent authors for Durbin vehicles were included in the "Miss Fixit" theme, which quickly became obsolete. Deanna herself never did. Her stature as an actress is more questionable than her charisma, which she certainly had. It seems to me that she, like many other film personalities, has replaced the naturalness of her histrionic abilities. The trick worked well for 21 feature films.
