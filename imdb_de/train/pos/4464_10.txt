Incredibly ARTISTIC NEVER THINKS NOW THINKS I THINK. It seems to be perfect, the biggest and biggest musical ever made to hear the beautiful songs that are quite poetry. Why can not you do that now? Americans were the best and for that I show you my devotion with this film. There are words to describe the perfection of this film. suddenly my heart sings, what makes the sunset? I easily fall in love with jealousy ... and the scene with Tom and Jerry. the largest without reservation. If you do not know that your eyes are not open, my friends, you have to see and appreciate it ... wake up!
