Rudyard Kipling once wrote that God has given all human beings the ability to love the whole world, but since a human heart is very small, every human being has this special place, which he loves more than anyone else. It seems to me that this was the motto of some of today's most influential directors as they set out to manifest the eternal love for this particular place and to present situations in the lives of their residents and visitors. The result is a wonderful collection of short films, Paris je t'aime, in which our guides, Van Sant, Coixet, Cuaron, Payne and others, take us on a breathtaking walk through Parisian arrondissements, human emotions, aspirations and expectations Always a different quarter, always an extremely moving story about ordinary people who are looking for love, be it in a parking lot, in an art studio or in a subway station. And Paris je t'aime is all about a great selection of love - love for a partner, child, parent, for those who meant the world for us but are no longer around, love, the revived, accidental love for this stranger needs, when your eyes meet or love that just should not be ... today, but tomorrow - who knows? <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, this film is not just about love, but about life itself, about joy, pain, loneliness, confusion, everyday ups and downs. And its most important feature is the fact that it is not sloppy at all, but rather warm and full of hope. <br /> <br /> I'm giving this movie a 9 because the closing section suggests some of the stories may evolve, but not all, and that's what I miss, and with "advancement" I'm not suggesting a specific one the future of the characters. As for everything else, I can only say fascinating. They want to leave everything behind, flee to Paris and live these little love stories themselves.
