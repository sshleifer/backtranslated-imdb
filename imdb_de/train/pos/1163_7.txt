This movie was released by Roger Corman, so you know that the filmmakers did not have much money to work with. <br /> <br /> Although some viewers might miss the subtleties in this movie because they are very typically "obsessed" with Killer's "art marketing approach, there are unique differences in this movie. <br /> <br /> AMANDA, as played by the obviously talented Justine Priestley, is a complex character, some people like these movies because the violence can be random, but here the impact of past misuse (realistic, but tasteful) shapes the psychosis of AMANDA. Surprisingly, Amanda ends up with a love act in which most of these films become the most typical, all fight to the death and the evil character dies just as badly as at the beginning. <br /> <br /> A few corners and Edges in this picture, but I have to give him 7 out of 10 stars, based on his thoughtfulness and yes, originality compared to the usual - especially on a budget.
