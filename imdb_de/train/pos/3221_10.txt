Several references to blade runners are mentioned in the film, but one of the most obvious is the fact that the Cain 607 and its unit are all genetic constructs that turn out to be consumable warriors. However, my favorite quote from the film is: "You should have made them both smart and fast." Kurt Russell has done an incredible job, his facial expressions or his lack of films more related to the story than the rest of the cast. Even if he falls in love with Sandra, but does not know how to deal with these emotions, and his tears after he is expelled from the group, or his shudder when he is hugged, and his attachment to the dumb boy, the in many ways are reminiscent of Todd himself and what he could have been if he had not been selected as a soldier.
