For real movie lovers, this film is a must, as it acts as a perfect little allegory for the films themselves. The science of Janos Rukh / Boris Karloff has to do with capturing and projecting light from cosmic phenomena. This light can do damage or can be used to do good. On the one hand it dazzles its mother, on the other hand it is used for the treatment of blindness ("I can see!", Gets a young girl, on whose eyes this light is projected). When Rukh / Karloff himself is poisoned by the eerie power of this light, we see that he is actually radiating a ghostly glow on his hands and face like a badly developed negative, pointing out the fact that the man we are observing , a projection is entity that is viewed in the movie (only visible, as in a movie theater when the lights go out). There is a wonderful passage in the beginning where Karloff / Rukh explains that his research is influenced by the fact that everything that happens is held in light that rolls through space for millions of years, as the light of Andromeda from this Galaxy was broadcast at a time when the earth was still molten rock. <br /> <br /> There are passages in the film when this new science is juxtaposed with older culture vehicles: that of the writer in the person of Beulah Bondi / Arabella Stevens; and religion, symbolized in the sculptural figures of the local cathedral, which Karloff shoots with his projector / Strahlwerfer. <br /> <br /> Here you have to wonder if this film should take a look at the time in Germany at that time, especially if Riefenstall used the film the year before to promote a regime that certainly goes on a lot Do damage: Triumph of the will. <br /> <br /> Luckily, Mother (Violet Kemble Cooper) intervenes and reminds Janos Rukh of the first science rule. <br /> <br /> If you just want to make more movies, you want to get up in the theater and shout, "I can see!"
