Absolute masterpiece of a movie! Goodnight Mr.Tom has quickly become one of my favorite movies of all time. Nobody should miss this movie, it's just too good! Mr.Tom is perfectly portrayed by John Thaw as a tough old man who becomes a soft father figure when William Beech (Nick Robinson) is sent to him for evacuation, almost like "The Town Mouse and the Land Mouse". A really heartbreaking movie. The director knew exactly how to turn book into film, and he did it extremely well. The film was filmed so brilliantly that the emotions of the characters and the happenings have led the audience to experience a range of emotions from love to fear, and these emotions could turn six pence. In a time of turmoil during the Second World War, this film also shows the difference between the cities and the landscape, they are almost like different countries. An absolute must, those who do not miss a truly amazing and brilliant movie.
