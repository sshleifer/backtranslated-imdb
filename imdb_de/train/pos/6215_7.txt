Although I'm not a big fan of musicals, I loved the films of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers because they're so much fun. Sure, they can be a bit formulaic, but although you know what's going to happen, they're still very enjoyable to look at. Nevertheless, I was a bit disappointed with this trip. Part of it was that this movie does not have the wonderful cast you saw in TOP HAT or SHALL WE DANCE. Without Edward Everett Horton or Eric Blore, the movie seems a bit lacking - especially in the "fun" section. The stupid antics of these supporting actors have given the other films the charm that you do not get with FOLLOW THE FLEET. Contrary to the usual character of Astaire this is more of a jerk - as his fat head Rogers always brings in trouble. That's why it's much harder to like him or see her come together at the end of the movie. Although the music comes from Irving Berlin, the songs just do not seem so memorable. In fact, none of the songs was so special and I can not remember any of the songs, even though I've just watched the movie. Although still a sweet and rewarding film, it simply lacks the sheen and magic of some of their other films. Good but far away from grand.
