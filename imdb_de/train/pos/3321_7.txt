I accidentally saw "Fever Pitch"; it played on the plane to Europe. It was not that bad. Ben (Jimmy Fallon) is the world's biggest Red Sox fan, but his relationship with Lindsay Meeks (Drew Barrymore) may weigh on that. The film is a pretty interesting look at how world events can affect people's relationships. It is particularly noticeable that the Red Sox have ended their 80-year defeat. I suppose such things happen all the time and we tend not to notice them. Not bad. <br /> <br /> Another movie that has an unusual relationship with baseball is the "Frequency" of 2000. Check both out.
