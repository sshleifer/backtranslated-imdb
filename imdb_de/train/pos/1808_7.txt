All Dogs Go To Heaven is an animated children's movie like no other. Gambling, drinking, death, guns and hell are prominent in the storyline, and though children will get very little from it, adults are scratching about why this movie looks like a gangster movie. The actual movie is in no way explicit, it's just a weird combination to make a kids movie. Charlie Barkin (Burt Reynolds) is a player dog who owns half a casino with his partner Carface (Vic Tayback). After getting drunk (a dog ... getting drunk ... in a children's movie that just sounds weird), Charlie gets tricked and killed by Carfax. When he is in heaven, he finds a way to return to earth, but he will no longer be allowed in heaven. He still goes back to Earth and meets his old friend Itchy (Dom Deluise). He plans to repay himself for Carfax. Meanwhile, Carfax has a small orphan, who is kept captive by Anne Marie because of her amazing ability to talk to all species, which makes it easier to predict races. Charlie and Itchy rescue her and try to help her find a family while learning a lot about herself. <br /> <br /> This movie is one of the few non-Disney children that appeals to both children and adults. Kids will enjoy the funny characters and animations while adults enjoy the beautiful, sweet action and more than normally developed characters. One thing that keeps that down is that it's a musical. Usually that's a good thing, but the music here is honestly terrible. They tend to bounce around and sound almost unimpressed, with almost no instrumental support. In fact, these are probably the worst songs I've ever heard in an animated movie, but luckily the rest of the movie is strong enough not to break through bad grades. <br /> <br /> The end of this movie works, but I honestly hate it. It's sad but happy, but more sad than happy, and the movie feels like it needs a sequel. Considering how bad the sequel was, I wished that the end would not have justified a sequel, and it would have come to a nice, super happy ending. This is one of the few movies I feel that way, but I do. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is a nice family movie with strange themes, but still great entertainment. <br /> <br /> My rating: *** from ****. 85 min. G.
