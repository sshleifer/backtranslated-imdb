There were times when this movie seemed to get a lot more complicated than it needed to be, but I think that's part of its charm. The observation of Detective Philo Vance seems to be greater than all the oriental sleuths of the epoch together when it comes to the final assessment of the way the murders were committed. The dropping of the dagger into the Chinese vase was the kicker for me; I mean, would not someone have dropped it? <br /> <br /> Vance (William Powell) had a line early in the film about Archer Coe's "psychological impossibility" to kill himself - I had to think about it for a while. I was wondering if there really is a scientific basis for this concept to be true and that I did not study psychology myself. That seems logical, but there is always one case that does not conform to the rules. <br /> <br /> You know, the excited coroner (Etienne Girardot) who calls me Star Trek's dr. McCoy said a few times, "I'm a doctor, not a wizard," and "I'm a doctor, not a detective." I can imagine DeForrest Kelley watching the movie and saying to herself: "I'll have to use that someday". <br /> <br /> Once the killer's identity reveals, it does not seem like a big surprise. But until then you can really guess. But apart from Archer and Brisbane Coe, the film did not answer the central question of the title and the murder I was really interested in - who killed Sir Thomas MacDonald's dog Ghillie?
