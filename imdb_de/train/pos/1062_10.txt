I think this show is definitely the best show. Jessica Alba does such a great job. Michael Weatherly is also doing a great job, as well as the rest of the cast. The show is very intriguing and they have wonderful stories and their stunts are incredible. It's like a 1-hour movie. It is definitely worth seeing.
