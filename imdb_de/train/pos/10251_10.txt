I am surprised that many viewers pay more respect to the continuation of this brilliant film ... I have seen all guinea pigs and this is by far the best. <br /> <br /> Even though I have seen the "Making of" "I still have doubts when I look at these 35 minutes of pure torture: It's so powerful. <br /> <br /> A 10 out of 10, because this film has achieved exactly what it set out to do: the best fake snuff film ever made.
