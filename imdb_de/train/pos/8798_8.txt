First of all, I will not praise IÃ±arrith's short film, even I'm Mexican and proud of his success in mainstream Hollywood. <br /> <br /> In another hand, I see most of the reviews focus on her favorite (and not so) short films; but we forget that there is a subtle bottom line surrounding the whole compilation, and perhaps it will not be so pleasing to the Americans. (Even though that was not the main purpose of the producers.) <br /> <br /> What I'm talking about is that most short films do not show the suffering that WASP people have suffered because of the terrorist attack in September 11th, but the suffering of others. <br /> <br /> Do you need proof of what I am saying? Look, in the short film of Bosnia, the message is: "They weep because of the people who died in the towers, but we (the others = Eastern Europeans) weep for the crimes against our women long ago, and nobody cares. We are like the whole world has done to you ". <br /> <br /> Although the story of Burkina Fasso is more in the comedy, it shares the same idea: "You are angry because Osama bin Laden has beaten you in an evil way, but we (the others = Africans ) should be more angry because our people are dying of hunger, poverty and AIDS a long time ago and no one is paying much attention to what the whole world has done to you. "<br /> Now look at the Sean Penn short film : The Fall of the Twin Towers rejoices over a lonely (and alienated) man. So the message is that the power and greed (symbolized by the towers) must fall so that people can see the sun and see the flowers blossom. It is noteworthy that this terrible record was proposed by an American. There is so much irony in this short film that it is almost subversive. <br /> <br /> Well, the Ken Loach (well known because of his anti-capitalism ideology) is much clearer and shameless to go straight to the point: "You are angry because your country has been attacked by evil forces but we (the others = Latin Americans) have suffered worse on a similar date, and no one remembers our grief the way the whole world has done to you. " It is as if the creator of this project wanted to say to the Americans: "Do you see now, America? You are not the only ones who have become victims of violence in the world, you are not alone in your pain. By the way, we (the others = the non-Americans) for a long time much more than you suffered, so we are in solidarity with you in your pain ... and by the way we are sorry because you had a taste of your own medicine. "Only the Mexican and French short films showed compassion and compassion for the Americans. the others are like a slap in the face for the American state, which is not equal to the American people.
