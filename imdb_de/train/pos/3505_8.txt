I have no idea how IMDb sorts reviews, but I know that, as is often the case with Amazon.com, there are a striking amount of very negative reviews for this film that almost repeat the same, somewhat obscure conversation points almost word for word. A campaign? Only IMDb knows. <br /> <br /> As for this movie, that's fine. It's a funny, sweet and very simple movie. <br /> <br /> It's been more than a decade since I've worked in Brooklyn, lived in Queens and visited relatives in the South Bronx. But I did not find anything inauthentic or exploitative about these children. Is the grandmother a bizarre character? Yup. Confirm the dialogue and the plot that? Yes, luckily they do. Are other films possible in LES with Dominican / Puerto Rican children? You can bet on it. Does that make this movie a crime? how would some (astroturf for my eyes) suggest comments? Barely. Let a thousand plastic flowers bloom. <br /> <br /> This is better than any episode of Degrassi JR. High or Degrassi high. Scarify the comparison, but we have never had, and I am touched to the core of the humility of the film and the delicate spirit. <br /> <br /> That means I'd like to hear the backstory behind all the backbiting! :-D
