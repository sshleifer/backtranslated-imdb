TCM keeps me awake all the time ... there are always movies that I've never heard of ... Senso ... now Ossessione ... a very early film by Visconti !! ... wow ... the Italian version of the postman always rings twice ... brilliant !! Beautifully played and directed ... I have never heard of Clara Calamai as Giovanna and especially Massimo Girotti as Gino ... what a sensual man !! more muscular and attractive than anyone else on the screen in 1943 !!! His eyes were ahead of his time ... many male stars from the 1950s were probably inspired by him ... he should have been a global star !! The movie is much better than the version of Jack Nicholson / Jessica Lange and less shiny than the MGM version (which I really like), in which John Garfield and Lana Turner remember this white outfit. Who can forget that? This Italian version is different .. more realistic and with a very different ending ... see it ... I will buy it !!
