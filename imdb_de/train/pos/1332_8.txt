In 1594, the Tupinambas Indians in Brazil are friends of the Frenches and their enemies are the Tupiniquins, friends of the Portuguese. A Frenchman (Arduíno Colassanti) is captured by the Tupinambás, and although he was tried to convince them that he is a Frenchman, they believe he is a Portuguese. The Frenchman becomes her slave and marries Seboipepe (Ana Maria Magalhães). Later, he uses powder in the cannons the Portuguese left behind to defeat the Tupiniquins in battle. To celebrate the victory, the Indians decide to eat it. <br /> <br /> "Como Era Gostoso o Meu Francês" is another great low-budget movie by the great Brazilian director Nélson Pereira dos Santos. The script is very original and the story is spoken in Tupi. The film is mostly shot with natural light and is very realistic. The actors and actresses play naked and Ana Maria Magalhães is great, shows a wonderful body and gives an impressive performance. The sound is produced by Brazilian musician Zé Rodrix. This film shows the beginning of the exploitation of my land by the Europeans, who at that time concentrated on Portuguese and French, traded with the Indians and exchanged combs and mirrors with our natural resources. This film has been awarded at national festivals, such as Brazil's Brazil Brazilian Cinema Festival (1971) with Best Screenplay (Nelson Pereira dos Santos), Best Dialogue (Nelson Pereira dos Santos and Humberto Mauro) and Best Cenographer (Régis Monteiro); São Paulo Art Critics Association (Associação Paulista dos Críticos de Arte), with the best revelation of the year (Ana Maria Magalhães) and some other prizes. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Como Era Gostoso o Meu Francês" ("How tasty was my Frenchman")
