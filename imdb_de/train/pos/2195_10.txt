I loved it! Fred MacMurray is wonderful as Skid Johnson, a somewhat conceited, proud and at the same time very vulnerable saxophonist who loves Maggie (Carole Lombard), who is always there for him. They meet in Panama after Maggie leaves a ship and land in a bar with Anthony Quinn. After being insulted, Tony is punched in the face of Maggie, who considers her a laid-back woman - just because she has taken off her hat in public. Big brawl and Maggie gets stuck in Panama. Romance. Carole and Arthur are great together. Maggie is always there for him when he needs her. She asks him to go to New York (look at the movie and find out). They have these wonderful scenes together, in which she sings in his arms while playing saxophone. I definitely recommend it.
