I saw that in Detroit, which must have been his original run. I literally rolled into the corridor of the theater. It was so funny. I have not seen it since, but I would like to do it. Where do you get a copy from? Anyone who says anything about being outdated or exaggerated is just a bunch of Poseurs for my money. Each sketch is either evil, erotic or perverse funny. Everyone! It is not a weak one. The opening sequence, which parodies 2001, shows gorilla go-go dancers with hanging breasts, for example. Felinni would have filmed it if he had been the bad joke ... If you come to this movie with an open mind and a sneering mischievous heart, put it in your best list.
