Incredibly intriguing and fascinating, I found it impossible to turn away as soon as I started to watch. I'm usually one of the toughest critics, but for me this movie was just brilliant, weird, because it sounds like I could almost smell the air and feel the textures of the places. <br /> <br /> From a movie, I thought that light and texture are great. From the orange glow of the summer light to the plastic-wrapped couch, I had a pronounced claim to reality. <br /> <br /> From a point of view, I thought Victor Vargas' idea was almost the glue that connects The story was pretty inspired. Each of the other family members had a broader background and simply caused a greater intrigue in the main character himself. In addition, he had known and had been someone like the grandmother. In such a situation, I can say that the situation was particularly realistic. The awkwardness, the accent, the cooking and even the comments were so authentic to me. <br /> <br /> I think this movie worked for me because I looked at it blankly and totally immersed, bringing back memories of teenage emotions that are worth a watch.
