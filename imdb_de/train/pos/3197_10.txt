If you're a Crispin Glover fan, you need to see this. If you're a fan of Sean Penn, you need to see this. If you are generally a movie fan you need to see this. If you have no idea who Crispin Glover is and you have no idea who Sean Penn is, this movie will probably still be of great value, but the more work you've seen from Crispin or Sean before, the better. <Br /> <br /> This movie is so funny, but it's also a genius. I do not know anything that resembles this movie. It's a separate genre. I doubt that such a thing will ever be done again. I can not say exactly why, without spoiling it in part, and some of the other reviews here have already done a good job. <br /> <br /> In response to the reviewers here who have given a poor rating, I ask you to watch the movie again. In reality, there is no point where this film could be described as "boring". This is possibly the funniest, most entertaining and least boring movie ever made. And with age and repeated considerations it gets better. A timeless classic that unfortunately few can claim. <br /> <br /> Beaver Trilogy is the brilliant work of director Trent Harris, who also stars for the amazing Rubin and Ed, the Crispin Glover, who draws in. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, there are copies of this film rare and hard to find. However, after some careful searching, I managed to find a VHS version, and there are several ways to find it that I know. But I really wish someone would put that on a DVD.
