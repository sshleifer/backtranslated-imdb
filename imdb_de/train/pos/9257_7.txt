Is this your typical woman in chains navy transport love story? Maybe, damn, you know how the formula works, pretty woman gets introduced into a picture, someone has to fall in love with her. <br /> <br /> I think this movie follows some typical storylines. but that says nothing about the content. There are great scenes with Crisps Glover, Dennis Hopper and Gary Busey, albeit briefly. Some things made no sense, such as the need to immerse in random struggles, but it's entertaining to observe that the fights were actually well done feels very good. The humor is well balanced, you will not hurt your stomach, but you will have a smile on your face. <br /> <br /> There is a bit of steam and action, so not for the kids.
