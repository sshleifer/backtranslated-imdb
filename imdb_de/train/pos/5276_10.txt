I joined the IMDb, so people know what a great movie that is! It's not often that you come across a movie that is moving and visually cinematic yet humble. You have read the plot, so I just want to say that you do not want to watch over it because you want to see a clash of cultural-religious identity blabbering, because this is the typical misunderstanding to which people read and travel on a son's journey get to know each other through their struggles. Buy it and pass it on before film4 reaches it. This was one of the few films nominated for an independent and foreign BAFTA. The beauty of it is that it appeals to anyone, even if you never watch subtitles or are just used to the Hollywood formula - just a great story that will delight you. The only thing I want is that it takes longer and sees what happens
