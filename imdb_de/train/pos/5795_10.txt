This movie is my absolute favorite !!! You really have to see Michael Jackson in this wonderful movie !! I'm always overjoyed and watch it !! This is a movie you really need to see, even if you are not an MJ fan since this movie is like Captain EO, E.T. and ghosts, a bit of film and music history !! This wonderful movie, from Michael's pen, is a must !! And: Smooth Criminal is truly the most wonderful, exciting and amazing song I've ever heard in my life !! Thanks Michael for this movie and I love you !!! MJ is the best musician to meet this planet, he is a good man and always brings sparkling eyes in your eyes when you listen to his music !! If you do not know this movie, look at it and do not miss it because it would be bad for you if you missed it !! - Highly Recommanded Film, for every movie lover-
