... or did Honest Iago actually smile when he died? <br /> <br /> Loved as the Bard's Iambic pentameter, with its superb clarity and emotion, just rolled off Fishburn's tongue. <br />> And how Branagh Honest made Iago celebrate his own wickedness ... <br /> <br /> This is a wonderful movie. <br /> <br /> I've often thought that Shakespeare is not film-friendly by nature: he uses words to create images in our heads, resulting in a constant battle with the camera that only knows what we are have to think and feel. Any effort to film Shakespeare should really be celebrated. It is not an easy thing.
