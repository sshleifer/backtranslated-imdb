An entertaining kung fu movie with drama, action and fight scenes that are above average chop socks. All performers are friendly characters and experienced martial artists. Alexander Fu-Sheng's Proto-Jackie Chan comedy antics are fun, and his strict companion shows particularly impressive abilities. For me, the only big mistake of the movie is the size of the cast - sometimes things get a bit confused when the movie switches between scenes, and some of the characters are not as full as you like. <br /> <br /> But a kung fu movie should be judged primarily on the quality of the action, and the Shaolin Temple definitely provides that number. The film reaches its climax with a fight in which every character can display his abilities against a worthy opponent. The Shaolin Temple is an entertaining low budget kung fu movie overall. Not the quality of a good Jet-Li movie, but worth a look for fans of the genre. My rating: 8/10. <br /> <br /> Other Comments: The 1987 Warner Home video release I've seen was (predictably) badly dubbed and it lacked the cast and crew.
