I'm a pretty old guy, old enough to remember the taste of Oreos and Coke, as they were 50 to 55 years ago, when every taste was fresh for a kid. I wish I had set aside some, then there is a magically hung locker so I could try these things today. This magical locker might even have adapted the theme of the food to take into account how I physically and elsewhere developed a kind of dynamic anticipation chemistry. Over half a century they would have had to adapt quite a bit because I would have known that I set them aside. A meal would now be a celebration of itself and the past and a story and a feeling that would make the intervening years almost an expected reward. <br /> <br /> I did not have enough sense to do that with Original Coke. And I could not have invented any of these magical lockers? not then. But I did almost as well. In the seventies, I really voted on Roman Polanski. He was a strange and exotic pleasure. You know, movies smuggled out of the Soviet bloc. Films so prone to beauty that you'll cry for weeks afterwards. Films that make you want to live with Polish women and then decide that they are the last ones to get it. <br /> <br /> Here's what I did. I took what I thought was my favorite movie from Polanski and set it aside. I did not see it. I postponed until I thought I was big enough to earn it. Over the years, I have tested myself, my ability to surround and isolate beauty without occupying it. There are probably only a few Poles who have worked to earn Chopin. Working to make a wife when I see it. I tried to get the inners from the edges. <br /> <br /> I recently gained something of the certainty that it was time to pull this out. I already knew that I had already passed the time when it would work optimally because I had already seen and understood "9th Gate". <br /> <br /> If you do not know this, it is a man who is innocent rents a room in which the previous tenant (after whom the story was named) jumped out of the window to later die after visiting this man (played by Polanski). What happens is that time works and he becomes that woman. We are deluded to believe that he is just crazy. But he is not the way we follow him. He just has lightning fast, that the world is normal and that the surrounding people are not part of a convention, which forgoes his reality. <br /> <br /> The story does not matter. What matters is how Polanksi shapes this thing, both in the way it inhabits the eye, which only makes edges, and in the body, which consists only of confused flesh. The two never meet. There is a dissonance that can haunt me for the next 30 years. Is it the idea about inside and outside without edges at all? Except for a redheaded wig. <br /> <br /> I do not know anybody who could do this sketch that remains a sketch, this horror that stays natural of course you need to know one of the best movies ever made. "Rear window." The genius of this film is the post-noir idea that the camera shapes the world. that the viewer creates the story. What Roman does is take this movie and turn it upside down. In Rear Window, the idea was that the viewer on the screen (Jimmy Stewart) was the anchor and everything else was a fiction that we observed. Here is the resident of the filmmakers living on the screen. We know that. We know that everything we see is true because he is the narrator. We know that it is true that bodies shift identity, that times shift, that causality is plastic. We know that the narrator will kill us. We know that the narrator leaves us in eternal horror, at the edge he implies, but never shows us and introduces us. <br /> <br /> Teds Rating - 4 out of 3: Every movie should know this.
