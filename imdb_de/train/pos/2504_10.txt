When I saw this movie for the first time, I first thought it was more of an anime than a movie. The reason is that vampires do incredible stunts. The stunts are very similar to how the matrix moves like moving too fast for projectiles and jumping very far. Another reason why I like the movie well is the adorable anime faces they make during the movie. Just as Gackt makes his pouting faces or just the way they behave, VERY ANIME. I think it's a really good movie to watch. ^ _ ^ The action in this movie is a 10 (not to mention Gackt and Hyde are also a 10). ^ _ ~ If you're fans of Gackt and Hyde, you need to see it.
