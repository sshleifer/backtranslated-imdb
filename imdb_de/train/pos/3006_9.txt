While a 9 might look like an unusually high value for such a lightweight movie, compared to the hundreds and hundreds of serial detective films from the 1930s and 40s, this is one of the best and compares very favorably with Powell's later "Thin" It does NOT mean that the movie is similar to the Thin Man movies, because THE KENNEL MURDER CASE is not a comedy, but rather a traditional mystery detective movie.You might think Nora Charles or Asta or a more traditional one Comic buddy (something that can be found in virtually all serial detective films) for fun would be a drawback, but I did not miss them at all because this was so exceptional well-written film - with a really interesting case as well The film starts at the dog show and is called The KENNEL Murder Case, though this film by Philo Vance t dogs are not much on the dog show and dogs are not a very important part of the movie. Instead, a completely hated man is killed and left behind in a completely sealed room - an idea that is repeated in many other detective films (like the weirdest case of CRIME DOCTOR). How that is explained, however, seems quite believable and fits very well together - my interest remains consistently. I wish that other detective movies of the day would have such smartly written and extraordinary plays as this one. This one is definitely a keeper.
