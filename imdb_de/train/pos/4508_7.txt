I was impressed with the beautiful photography in this film shot on location in Alaska. Although it is actually a melodrama, we see many activities involving Eskimos, such as hunting, dancing, building igloos, etc. And their customs, such as: The hunting sequences sometimes come from footage, as some rear projection scenes of animals were easily recognizable, but even these were intriguing. Spearfishing for salmon, hunting for walrus, caribou and even polar bear and whale sometimes seemed like a documentary. There was no cast to reinforce the documentary. The filmmakers tried to make the whole thing look very authentic. The natives spoke only in an Eskimo language, which was either translated by someone on the canvas or by subtitles. In the introduction, it was stated that there were no actors in the film other than the white traders and the Royal Mounted Canadian Police. This was not necessarily true. The two leading actors played by Mala and Lotus Long were Eskimos by birth, but were professional actors with credits for previous films, and sometimes they were seen to have made-up. But they were excellent in their roles and then had a career in Hollywood. All in all, the movie is definitely worth a look.
