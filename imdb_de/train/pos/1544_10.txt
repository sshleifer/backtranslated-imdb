This is an excellent, but hard-to-find Trippy thriller from the First World War in the inimitable Italian style of the 60s. From the psychedelic graphics of the introductory credits and the great score by Ennio Morricone to the lesbian love scene with Capucine and the lavishly produced no-man's land combat scenes with poison gas and German cavalry in gas-tight "Storm Trooper" gear, a movie not to be missed. It is a film that captures the horrors and cruelties of war and the recklessness of players on and off the battlefield. Apart from the combat scenes, some of the production and special effects are crude, obviously because most of the budget for this film was saved for the fight scenes. For lovers of cinema in the 60s, this should not be a problem. I saw this movie on television for the first time many years ago and had the foresight to record it on VHS. I still have the tape and look at it from time to time.
