It's easy to forget that the series of alien conspiracy theory was later developed once again, and that The X-Files wrote episodes like GenderBender and Fearful Symmetry, in which the aliens were not all little gray men or mind control but you might really surprise you. <br /> <br /> "Fearful Symmetry" starts with an "invisible elephant" - actually an elephant somehow offset in space and time, less than a mile from "The Walk" - ending with the abduction of a pregnant woman Gorillas And it's very much a sequence of wonderful moments The subplot is annoyingly worthy - yes, we get it, zoos are bad, except when they are not - but the ideas contained in it are fascinating, visually powerful, and very memorable, and they cover an aspect of abduction that is largely overlooked - why * would * people * be the only things aliens are interested in? <br /> <br /> In the end, it was not an instant classic, but it was a pleasing sight, as long as it lasted, again very memorable and, above all, it is something that you can not imagine many other shows.
