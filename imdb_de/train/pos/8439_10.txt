For all homicide junkies this movie was great! Every single character ever on the show appeared in the movie. It helped to solve some (but not all) problems in the series. Unfortunately, if you did not really look at the show, most of the enjoyment would be lost as the movie played heavily on the existence of the series every season. This would probably have been appropriate as a series finale, rather than being a separate movie, but we have to take what we can get. I hope they make more films and continue to perform homicide characters on Law and Order.
