Having seen most of Ringo Lam's films, I can say that this is his best and most unusual film so far. It's an old piece of porcelain, packed with martial arts, where the location of an underground hiding place full of traps and dungeons plays just as big a role as the characters. The action is fantastic, the story is tense and entertaining and the scenery is truly memorable. Unfortunately, Burning Paradise was not made available on DVD, and vhs is nearly impossible, even if you're near the second largest porcelain city in North America (like me). If you can find it, do not miss it.
