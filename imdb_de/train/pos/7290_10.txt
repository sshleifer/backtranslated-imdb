After some very good reviews to the point SUPERB I was very satisfied with the movie. The movie was dark, moving, the anger, the pain, the guilt and a very convincing demon. At first I expected to see a lot of special effects, and like a caress of a lover, he blew me away with the subtlety and accuracy of it. Brian, I'm excited about your art again, telling the story and your concern for the special effects. You will go a long way, my friend. I will definitely be the president of your fan club. Eric Etebari, the best actor prize, was the first choice. They made Jr. Lopez look like a kid compared to Kasadya. :) <br /> <br /> All in all, the drama, the story, the high-quality filming and the fantastic effects were fantastic. I just wish it was longer. I'm looking forward to The Dreamless with extremely high expectations.
