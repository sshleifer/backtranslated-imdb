Here's a movie that's really funny in every moment it covers. How can it not be said that this film plays the makers of South Park and is led by David Zucker? When I saw this movie for the first time, I did not immediately realize that Coop and Doug were really Matt and Trey, but their talent in acting and writing was very impressive. I was pleasantly surprised to learn that they were really Matt and Trey later on. The humor is sometimes crude, sometimes bad, sometimes brilliant, sometimes subtle, sometimes loud and sometimes stupid, but overall this is a hell of a movie that is undoubtedly undervalued. Well, actually it is crazy. Completely crazy.
