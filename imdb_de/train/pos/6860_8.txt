The psychotic-transsexual Bobbi murders the patient (Angie Dickinson) of a prominent physician (Michael Caine) and then pursues the high-priced prostitute (Nancy Allen), who caught a glimpse of Bobbi in the elevator. Liz (Allen) is under suspicion of the crime and works with the patient's son (Keith Gordon) to catch the killer. <br /> <br /> It can be summed up in a few words: It's very sexy (Dickinson) and Allen looks great), it's very bloody - with the kind of gore that's usually reserved for splatter movies, and boy, is it done well. Screenwriter / director De Palma is fine, but he really sets a back seat in the man's ability to film. It is very successful on the visceral level and I am really interested in these characters. I can notice the usual De Palma homages on Hitchcock - at least from one of Master's paintings. <br /> <br /> And to top it off, it has a professional and credible cast. <br /> <br /> This was De Palma's third film with ex-wife Nancy Allen (after "Carrie" and "Home Movies"). By the way, the dancer, the actress Rachel Ticotin, was one of the production assistants. There are a few little things for you. <br /> <br /> I would not believe that a thriller could be both stylish and bloody at the same time, but this image pulls it off. <br /> <br /> One of the best things about it is a typically striking music by Pino Donaggio. <br /> <br /> 8/10
