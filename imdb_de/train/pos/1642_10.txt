I have not seen the movie since the first release, but it was memorable. The performances of Rip Torn and Conchata Farrell were outstanding, the photography outstanding, the moving story and everything else at the highest level. It seems to be quite forgotten though. <br/> <br /> Maybe because UK is a strange market for it, but I have not seen the movie on TV or video, which is sad. Has it had more success in the US, where it could rightly be considered a fairly accurate historical drama? <br /> <br /> You always think that 50% of a good movie is the music and although I am not sure if I believe it. The cover story was a simple but moving clarinet solo of "What kind of a friend do we have in Jesus ". The film then refuted that! Am I right or not?
