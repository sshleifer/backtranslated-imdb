I'll give it to you directly ... this movie is incredible. Foreign gay movies surpass American gay movies in terms of production quality and story so fast. While so many American gay indie films are grainy, bad sound, amateur film, trivial storylines, and a surprising lack of any nudity or eroticism, top-notch foreign gay movies like this one from France show up. The cinematography is beautiful, thoughtful and meaningful. The story is grown-up and complex (but difficult for anyone to understand), the drama is intense and professional. Both leads are fantastic, as well as the entire cast. The boys are more than just good looking and there is plenty of frontal nudity. You follow the whole year of these boys, from their meeting to the end. All the little nuances of a relationship, the details of the onset and failure of love are beautifully executed there. it made me want more. Listen!
