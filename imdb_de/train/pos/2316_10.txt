I saw this movie by accident and I'm curious about the trailer on TV. I like it when I discover such films, small, tender stories about ordinary people. Although the end is tragic, "The Man in the Moon" has some fun moments, especially in the first characterization of Dani, with her innocent and pure love affair with Court. It's really a beautiful, moving love story with 3 highlights: the performance of Reese Witherspoon, who kept her promises in the world of cinema, the beautiful camera of "Old Lion" Freddie Francis and the fantastic score of James Newton Howard really is the soul of the movie. His themes (which deserve an Oscar nomination) are so intimate and lyrical that they have turned the script into music.
