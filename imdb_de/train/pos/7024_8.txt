I just saw this movie in Santa Barbara. My friend knew someone who worked on it, so I thought I would take a look. I thought it was a really nice movie and I can not wait to watch it again. The actors were really good and I loved all the music! There was not a lot of talk in the movie, which felt a bit odd at first - but once I got into it, I thought that the story and the acting were really emotional and meaningful, and I thought that was a lot of fantasy , I would like to see the movie again because there was so much going on that I forgot many little things, but I know that I left the theater to think about the movie. It was beautifully shot and the whole thing was really unique.
