Clint Eastwood reiterates his role as Dirty Harry, this time as the case of a vigilante (Sondra Locke) killing the people who raped her and her sister at a carnival many years ago. Eastwood makes the role his and the movie is mainly more action than talking, not that I'm complaining. Sudden Impact is indeed a fun conversation.
