I may have seen one or two episodes when the show was originally aired, but when I saw 1 episode on Netflix, I was also addicted. I saw the whole series in about two days. :) I really liked the character of Gary Cole. At first he is completely reprehensible, then one starts to like the character ("These things have a thousand applications")! His folksy Andy Griffith and Charles Manson and Satan are great. Charming, charismatic, smarmy and uh somehow dangerous and with "somehow" I mean "really". I want to be like Him when I grow up. Lucas Black is great, too. The accents are great too. Anyway, I thought that this was one of the best TV shows ever and you owe it to yourself to see it.
