** POSSIBLE SPOILER ** <br /> <br /> Most of the film that does not work is the Wendigo. If your title character fails, your movie is usually not far behind. The interpretation of the Wendigo shape by the filmmakers is interesting and can be quite threatening if filmed properly - for example, when the fleeing killer sees Wendigo in his rearview mirror at lightning speed - and the tree shape was really good. As a monster, however, it is never really brought to life. There is no great explanation for his behavior, and what we see here does not match the story narrated in the film itself, or any Wendigo tradition I've ever read. <br /> <br I think one of the main reasons for the monster's failure is that there is not enough in the movie. If you boil this movie to the bone, you have a suspense thriller with a bit of a supernatural element instead of a movie about a monster. <br /> <br /> The cinematography is good, if a bit cheesy; The filmmakers use scenery, lighting and time of day to convey atmosphere and mood quite well. The character of Otis is really dangerous and unpredictable and makes him the real monster in the movie. It might have been more effective to explain his behavior in such a way that he is obsessed with the hungry spirit of the Wendigo, which would also be a more accurate account of the real legend. I've heard unconfirmed reports (from a newsgroup) that the Wendigo does not do much about, the fact that the monster suit was not that heavy and uncomfortable when building the monster (to mimic the clique's split-hoof attitude, the performer needed running) to his toes) that it was almost impossible to walk, run or otherwise portray. So the creature's many flashes stopped and the obvious accelerated shots of it ran away. I emphasize that these reports are not confirmed.
