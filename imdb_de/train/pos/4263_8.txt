Where do we go during a Kurt Weill celebration in Brooklyn? was finally exposed for a screening. It's amazing that a movie from all eras in which Weill-Gershwin collaborates may possibly be missing on the screens. The score is high, and a CD of the material, along with Gershwin and Weill, only highlights its merits, which are considerable. Yes, the film has its problems, but the score is not one of them. Ratoff is not in his element as a director of this musical fantasy, and Fred MacMurray can not quite grasp the material. Then the "modern" segment is weakly written. BUT the fantasy elements bring the film to a good note, as does the work of the two adorable leading actors - Joan Leslie and June Haver. Both have the charm that this kind of work needs to work urgently. As a greeting of World War II to the history of our country - albeit in an unprecedented context - the film has its place in Hollywood's music history and should be accessible to all and see its notable merits.
