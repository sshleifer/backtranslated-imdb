One of the things about the movie that warms my heart is that fly fishing was a big part of the scene. I have occasionally spent my time in dry fly fishing, tethering my own flies and, with my brother and father, we spend a day on one or the other river trying to get the ever-elusive brown trout to rise and take the fly that has been offered to them. <br /> <br /> When we had such opportunities, all the differences between us disappeared and the pressures of the world disappeared, to be replaced by the glory, to be recruited into the activity and life environment of the place where we live we were. <br /> <br /> This was one of the amazing things I was shown in the movie when the Minister and his two sons Norman and Pauly performed the ritual. Because fly fishing has something ritualistic, because so many pastimes have something ritualistic. You can not just start fishing and hope for the best. You need to be able to adjust to the location you are in. You need to scan the surface of the water, looking at the fluidity and the best point for the departure of your fly. Depending on your abilities you can even reach your water surface fly there long enough for a fish to notice and hit it. The "art of fly fishing" has been so well directed and presented that you can classify yourself as an artist. <br /> <br /> The title for the film could not be chosen more appropriately, since the river actually ran through the life of father and two sons. However, this movie spreads wider than the family and community in Montana on the Blackfoot River where the movie is being played. She has the ability to draw you to her, to captivate you, to captivate you as the story unfolds of family, community and epoch. The narrated story is not just a family story, but a story of life. What can be classified as the "flow of life"
