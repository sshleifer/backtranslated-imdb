I think people underestimate this incredible movie. People think of it as a typical horror movie that scares us and prevents us from sleeping. Which, if it had, would be a 1/10 rightly so, but I looked at this movie with some friends and we found it very entertaining and although it was a good movie, even though it has Stephanie Beaton. That's why I think it deserves 10/10 for the pure entertainment of the movie. <br /> <br /> The general view of this movie is that it has bad acting, could produce a simple script that is 10 years old and that it can not be taken seriously, and people therefore rate it low. But I see it as a thoroughly entertaining masterpiece ... it has a fun and humorous script that's made even more entertaining by the actors, and although it's not very serious, it's very entertaining.
