This is an excellent example of what is possible with a movie on a budget. The drama is excellent, considering the script. The entire atmosphere of the movie is very unaware. The Gore is well made and used sparingly (pay attention to the excellent barbed wire death) and the action is punchy when used. It's true that shady lines are sometimes present in the script, but compared to other movies with the same (or bigger!) Budget, that's not noticeable at all. Overall, this is recommended. Trust me, it's better than it seems! 8.10
