I could never remember the name of this show. I look at it when I was 8 years old. I remember getting up a long time when I did not think just to watch this show. It was the best show for me. As far as I remember, it is still great. This showed that Lucas Black was the first boy I ever had a crush on. I'm from the country, so guys with an accent did not appeal to me, but for me, I would definitely make an exception. After seeing Crazy in Alabama, Friday Night Lights and Tokyo Drift, you should see why. He is a great actor and has been active since childhood. I miss this show and wish she would come out again. If anyone ever sees where he sells the season, please email me. kywildflower16@hotmail.com
