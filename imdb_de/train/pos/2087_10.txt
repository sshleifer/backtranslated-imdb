This movie was released in the year I was born and will be 70 years old in 2007 like mine. I saw him again last night and have not seen him since high school. It was full of 30s feeling and the acting was a bit stereotypical, but it was great. The story of Pearl S. Buck came to life through the magic of chemistry by Luise Rainer and Paul Muni. The novel, which earned Ms. Buck the Nobel Prize for Literature, comes alive under the direction of Sydney Franklin, who along with an excellent script tells the story of farmer farmer Wang Lung, whose father procures for him a bride, a slavegirl from the kitchen local landlord. In Buck's story, Wang's success is due to his willingness to listen to his wife most of the time and his love of the land. In the end, he realizes that his wife, like the land, is the source of his wealth, his happiness and his immortality. Bock's stories always had strong women at a critical juncture to influence the outcome of events in the pre-feminist world. Born in Germany, Luise Rainer brings to life in her Olan depiction a tentative but determined Chinese Chinese woman. Muni also captures the naive but respectable Wang, who is finally trapped between the two worlds of the rich and the peasant. Other classic characters include Charlie Grapewin, Kansan Uncle Henry by Dorothy Gale of the Wizard of Oz, Walter Connelly as a meowing, calling uncle and Keye Luke as Number One Son - but not Charlie Chans this time. <br /> <br /> A classic can be defined as a movie that you can watch over and over again and never tire of. If so, this movie is undoubtedly a classic.
