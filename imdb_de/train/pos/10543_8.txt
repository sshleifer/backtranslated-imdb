A carefree comedy, Nothing shows us a world that we sometimes want to escape: a world of nothingness. Anything you do not like, whether it's a stack of bills, a bad memory or even hunger, can disappear at your request. They approached this movie very well, and with a fun starring duo there were few things I did not like about Nothing, and they were not even part of the main movie. <br /> the post-credits scene (and yes, there's one): good for a giggle, but what did you want to do with it? I was confused and did not want to see anything after a movie. Instead, we hear a random selection of sounds and they scream. It's trying to build a sequel in my opinion and was not really necessary, nor was it funny after the turtle crawled out of the picture. <br /> <br /> Second, the trailer: I saw the trailer on the DVD And as others have said, it promotes a horror movie that never came. Well, bad marketing I appreciate. <br /> <br /> If you see that in your film rental, have a look, because Nothing is a great movie. However, if you have a big screen, you may want to wear sunglasses.
