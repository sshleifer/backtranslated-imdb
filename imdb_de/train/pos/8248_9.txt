If you see the cover of the DVD, you're convinced that this is a cheap class B minion, a movie made for someone in the backyard for $ 1,000. <br /> <br /> Wrong! <br /> <br /> This is high quality material and really good. It's a comedy and a wise one. It is also very touching in spots, with a nice spot of friendliness. The production values ​​are very good (that looks great), the actors are well known, the direction and the film of the movie are great. It is wonderful. Who would have thought that Carrie-Ann Moss, who plays against the guy, is great, like "Helen Robinson," the June-splitter-like woman; Billy Connolly is great, as the good-natured zombie "Fido;" Tim Blake Nelson ("Mr. Theopolis") is a neighbor with the sexy zombie girlfriend "Tammy" and Henry Czerny and Dylan Baker as fathers (check) are excellent, also K'Sun Ray as a young "Timmy Robinson" "should too In fact, it probably has more lines than any other. <br /> <br /> When I explain the story, it will sound so stupid that only a few of you would see it - you just have to say the word of the people who liked it and found it a very, very pleasant surprise, but they need a dark sense of humor, an appreciation of the absurd.
