I'm not a John Cleese Completeist (although I thought "Fawlty Towers was brilliant"), but I'm a fan, and when I saw it neglected sitting on a local shelf at my local blockbuster, I decided to give it a try. What I got was a wonderful surprise and one of the funniest 50 minutes I've ever seen. The writing is a typical English "goon show" send. In fact, as an audio sketch, this would not be wrong on a "Firesign Theater" album. But the execution and the timing are just right, and "Strange Case" becomes a kind of stunning performance that can produce lifelong British comedy fanatics. <br /> <br /> The Brits is a gift for combining broad satirical lampoons with closely watched "tics" of character and timing, and the creators both make good use of it here.

I've never heard of Lowe before (his background seems to be vaudeville and music theater), but he justifies his entire career with this performance as far as I'm concerned. Some people do not like the "Strange Case ...", especially when British humor is not their "cuppa tea". But I am very glad that I saw this before it disappeared.
