A surprise thriller with more twists and double crosses than a doodle pad. A great cast that has mixed her up with a mesmerizing plot accompanied by a Twin Peaks influence on director Dahl. Nicholas Cage is a very underrated actor and shows a great depiction of a man in search of the right person. J.T. Walsh (RIP for a great actor) is always a wonderful villain, as is Dennis Hopper. It is a shame that he has never made in the business to a higher profile. I'm sure he has his followers. All in all, this is a great movie that shows you that you do not need a big pony or commercial soundtrack to be a fun movie.
