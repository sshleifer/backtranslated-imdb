And even a movie made for television was good. The drama and plot were just great. This is one of the few films I have seen, and I felt twisted because I was afraid Reaper would kill me through my computer screen. There were only a few little things that were not right with this movie, but it was very easy to miss. <br/> <br /> Antonio Sabbato Jr played a great role in this movie together with Janine Turner and Robert Wagner. This film just has so much excitement and I feel like more, because I never thought that a low budget television movie could be so powerful. After reading this, I read the novel on which this film is based (four times), and it was great as well. If you ever see this movie on TV, I would see it. The effects in this movie were pretty well done, I honestly do not know what a live person would look like, but with the way the FX team made this movie, I was impressed and it turns out that All that was bad for TV movies out there on a low budget should not be so bad. <br /> <br /> look at it. It's really good, no, really!
