My 2 year old likes the Doodlebops Show, she seems to be keeping his attention for a while. The characters are interesting, alive with primary colors and everything. There are not many learning content that could benefit the intended audience, but they seem to have a theme in every show and try to teach children sharing and respect and other fundamentals, so I like it. It is well produced with high production values. But it's really just an average show, like most TV shows these days. We do not buy in the goods angle and let our son carry everything with Dooblebop. I do not think we would spend money on a live show if they ever came to town. Going to the zoo or the science center is a much better experience for everyone involved, and I think the money is better spent.
