This movie really deserves more recognition than it gets. It truly is a stunning and rich display of bloodlines, favors and loyalties within the world of crime. The film is beautifully shot and deals with all your classic crime topics such as betrayal and power. This film is a cinema visitor's film that requires attention and understanding and is fully rewarded in the end. It is the godfather of Hong Kong and is more of a welcome change than another wire mesh fight, a martial art epic that seems to be the biggest contributor to the Hong Kong and China cinema world. It has an arrangement of great characters, actors and development, though I had to say rightly that I had to see it twice, just to see what happened to some of the characters because they had so many interactions in the movie. All in all 8/10 Great action characters, but there are characters that do not stand out enough, and the music did not really get me started, and sometimes I felt it was not well synchronized with the action (there is action from the way) it loses some points for it.
