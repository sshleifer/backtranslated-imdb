This documentary has been broadcast on RTE and BBC in recent months. Now that I have seen it twice, I would recommend it to anyone interested in media and documentary film. <br /> <br /> First, this documentary should detail the political life of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez. The Irish crew started with these intentions. What happens when they come to Venezuela is astonishing as they witness first-hand the attempted overthrow of the rebel factions (especially the oil companies in Venezuela) of Chavez and his government. What we observe as a viewer is how the media manipulate the situation and actually support the fall of Chavez by distorting events that become apparent as the coup wears on. <br /> <br /> It's really a great documentary and a remarkable piece of work by some new filmmakers. <br /> <br />
