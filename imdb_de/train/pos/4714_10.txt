Famous words of the foreign nightclub owner Roman Maroni, this "lousy cork suckers", who not only spends the entire film as a competitor to Johnny Dangerously, but also slaughters the English language. <br /> <br /> Another Underrated Classic One Can Only Johnny Dangerously is a terrific satirist about a kind-hearted boy who secretly leads a criminal life to finance his mother's medical care and his brother through law school bring. <br /> <br /> Yes, there is a story, but who cares? A cast that includes Joe Piscopo, Dom DeLuise, Marilu Henner and Alan Hale Jr will wait and see what happens next. <br /> <br /> There are too many laughs to settle here. Like Airplane you have to be careful or you will miss something. Highly recommended for those who need one or two good laughs !!!
