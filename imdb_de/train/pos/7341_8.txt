I like Ralph Bakshi movies ("Wizards", "Cool World" and the undervalued animated "Lord of the Rings") and I'm a Frank Frazetta collector and fan. I'm also a sword and sorcery fanatic who loves the worlds of Edgar Rice Burroughs and Robert E. Howard loves. <br /> <br /> I missed the theatrical release of "Fire and Ice" in 1983 and was looking forward to seeing it video or a revival ever since. Therefore, the 2005 release was a dream for me. However, I did buy it with some concern, hoping that it would not only be worthwhile to see it once, and then put on the shelves as "collectable" collection dust until my death. Luckily my fears were baseless and I was pleasantly impressed with this movie. <br /> <br /> Like the art of Frazetta, this is a pithy film that has a corporeality and sexuality that is hard to find in most fantasy / sword and sorcery movies without cheesy or to be dirty. The art is good and you see Frazetta at its best. Even my boys really enjoyed seeing it with me and seeing it again and again. However, my wife has some objections because of the scantily dressed princess (very Frazetta esquire). I do not mind because it is believable and there is no sex scene. <br /> <br /> Roto-Scoping is used, but I personally like roto-scoping. It gives the characters more fluid and realistic movements that are hard to find in the animation. <br /> <br /> Despite some continuity issues, I recommend this movie to all Bakshi, Frazetta, Conan and Sword and Sorcery fans. Enjoy!
