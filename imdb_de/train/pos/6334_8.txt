This movie has some amazing things. First, it should be based on a true story. It's amazing that several tornadoes would meet the same city in Nebraska that fall night. I wonder if the actual name of the town was near Blainsworth (as the city name is in the movie). There is an Ainsworth, Nebraska, but there is also a city that starts with Blains-something. <br /> <br /> It shows the slowest moving tornadoes seen in the where the boys are in the house. On the other hand, the scene where the TV is blurred is actually built. Before the Doppler radar and weather radio, we were taught that if you tuned your TV to a specific channel (not on cable) and adjusted the brightness, you can tell if a tornado is coming. The problem was that you might hear it until then. <br /> <br /> As I know about tornadoes in the Midwest, this movie was fun. I enjoy it more than Twister. I mean, give me a break - there's no way to get it through and F5 by chaining yourself to a pipe in a well house.
