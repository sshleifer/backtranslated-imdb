Terry Gilliam gives a stunning movie that I really enjoyed. Bruce Willis, Madeline Stowe, Brad Pitt and even Christover Plummer's little performance make the movie absolutely brilliant! This is the only Terry Gilliam movie I've seen, and Twelve Monkeys is definitely in my top 10th and Brad Pitt is the best. Brad Pitt delivers a perfect performance. Maybe one of the ten best actors I've ever seen. He played his role (Geoffrey) very convincingly. The role of Bruce Willis (James Cole) was also quite convincing. Both Bruce Willis and Brad Pitt have done extremely well. With the ingenious story to support the great achievements; and to support that, Terry Gilliam is an excellent director.
