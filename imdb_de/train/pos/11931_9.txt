This was a first-class movie with a first-class cast. Danny Glover, Tony Danza, Joseph Gordon-Levitt and, above all, Christopher Lloyed are well-placed in this enchanting movie about the real angels of the Angels baseball team. You never know, it could happen. I loved Lloyd's role in it. He was funny. The story is about changing your life, because the child's belief in Angels helped to get angry, hardened, and embittered. Manager Glover sees the best in people. The movie was well done and it was about seeing the best in people and achieving your dreams. It was funny, charming, touching and sad, all very nicely done. You will like it (or love it). I guarantee. <br /> <br /> *** from ****
