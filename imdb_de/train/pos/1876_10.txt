An adaptation of the book "Finding Fish". This story is about a disturbed young sailor Antwone Fisher (Derek Luke), who tells a psychiatrist Jerome Davenport (Denzel Washington) the painful story of his past. A brilliant debut performance by Derek Luke and a consistently impressive performance by Denzel Washington. <br /> <br /> This film was incredible on so many levels and I was disappointed that it did not win an Oscar it was released at a bad time, so it was overlooked. I highly recommend this movie to anyone. You will be touched by his story, and that makes the audience really sensitive with this young man, Antwone Fisher. <br /> <br /> If you like inspiring true stories, check Antwone Fisher. <br /> <br /> Thank you
