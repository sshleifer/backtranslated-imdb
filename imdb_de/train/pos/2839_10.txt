I saw this movie at a preview screening and thought it was great. <br /> <br /> New York I Love You is a real confrontation with a romance that explores smart, funny and sometimes shocking situations around the strongest sense of humanity. <br /> <br /> The cast is huge, a true oceans 11 with Andy Garcia, Ethan Hawke, Shia Labouf, Natalie Portman, Bradley Cooper and others. They all deliver outstanding achievements in one way or another. <br /> <br /> Not to mention that there is a who's who of directors who interweave stories in a clever and interesting way. Brett Rattner, Shaka Kapur, Natalie Portman, I mean WOW! This movie is not a straightforward romance or romantic comedy, though it's both romantic and fun. It also has serious stories and comments. But that's good in my opinion. Convince yourself and respond to my review. I want to hear what others have to say.
