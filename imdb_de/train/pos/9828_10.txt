I will be honest with you ... I liked this movie. It's a great zombie movie filled with action, original ideas and good acting, but also with bad zombie effects. Part IV entitled "After Death" is also good. I would recommend this movie to horror fans everywhere. <br /> <br /> 10 of 10 <br /> <br /> Fans of horror movies like this one should watch Puppet Master, Skinned Alive, Slumber Party Massacre, Sleep Away Camp and other Full Moon Pictures movies.
