Red Rock West (1993) <br /> <br /> Nicolas Cage becomes involved in a deadly crime without first knowing it, and the dominos are leading to increasing danger, adventure and adversity in the devastated American West of the 1990s. Red Rock West is often brutal and sometimes weird, and Cage pulls off the mix with his usual sardonic wit and cautious ease. <br /> <br /> Is the plot over the top? Yes. Is Dennis Hopper perfect as a crazy, almost sympathetic killer? Yes. Does Cage have a chance? Well, you have to watch and see. It never stops, and it surprised me when I saw it for the first time. The second time yesterday, I was surprised at how well it performed, how well it was built and how macabre and funny it was at the same time. <br /> <br /> Director Ron Dahl (who also helped with the writing) is more known for his TV work, but with Rounders and this movie he shows a skilled hand with sensational acts. By the way, it is saved by his humor and by the caricatures. The bar is sloppy, the bulls questionable. Do not miss a truly inspired Cameo by Dwight Yoakam as a truck driver.
