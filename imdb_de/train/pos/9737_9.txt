Amazing performance by Simon Pegg, who gets better and better with every role. As usual, he plays the role of a very crispy character who sometimes wants to hide embarrassed behind your pillow, but that's what Pegg is about. <br /> <br /> Each of them aimed at Penn. The film has been very cleverly composed, with each character playing a very subtle and serious role, with Penn being the only involved humor that wows director Robert Weide a great deal without a quick round of applause from Gilliam Anderson, who shined throughout. Highly recommended for everyone.
