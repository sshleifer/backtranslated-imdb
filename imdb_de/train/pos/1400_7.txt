Bogmeister and others nailed it pretty much. Shore Leave is really TOS's first attempt to make lightweight sci-fi devices (which would later be perfect with the classic Trouble with Tribbles). It gave both the crew of the Enterprise and their television viewers a necessary respite from the universe of imminent consequences, such as The Corbomite Manouever. <br /> <br /> Looking for a place where the Enterprise can recover for a while happens on a seemingly idyllic M-Class planet, sending an exploration team down to a closer look. Soon enough, all sorts of absurdities occur - some seem to be dangerous - but everything seems to be a morass of human emotional extremities, in a strange mix of fantastic secrets (McCoy has been looked through the mirror) and psychological thriller (Kirk is persecuted ) of a tireless tyrant from his past) and a romantic comedy (no comment). <br /> <br /> TOS was the least serialized of all series in the Trek series, so it's easy to forget how many episodes are included in the program. The first season focused on lumbering, potentially catastrophic dramas. Unlike later serial franchise authors, the TOS production team was not afraid to go where there was no TV series. And Shore Leave is an example, despite its occasional problems. My only criticism of this episode is that the cast (especially Shatner - irony in the face of his legendary sense of humor) did not know how to handle this new fold about ST's themes. The final scene may be one of the worst scenes I can remember throughout the TOS run, both in composition and acting. My recommendation - see it while you see the entire first season as it should be seen - it's the order.
