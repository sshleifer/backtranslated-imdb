Critics need to check what they classify as a quality film. I think the critics have seen too many action films and have succumbed to the matrix style of films. Europe is a breath of fresh air, a film with so many layers that one look is not enough to understand or appreciate this outstanding film. Lars von Trier shows that old film styles can create wonderful cinema and build up drama and suspense. The back projection effect he uses throughout the movie awakens and enhances the characters and focus of the conversation they lead. Other effects that he uses, such as For example, the color and black and white in a scene, like Hitchcock and the girl in the red coat, attract attention and reinforce the drama and meaning of the scene. The commentary is superb and has a hypnotic effect, which in turn keeps the focus on the central characters in the scene and their actions. <br /> <br /> I could talk more about the effects, but I think you all agree that they are doing this movie into their own category, and really raising the drama of the movie. A movie you can buy if you do not already own it, and one you can not see. <br /> <br /> 10/10 Do not miss this artistic Noir movie by one of the great directors.
