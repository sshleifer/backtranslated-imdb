This movie has become one of my favorite pseudo noir experiences in the last decade. The three storylines that Kazan has given us each have their own and individual pleasures. The domestic chatter between Bel Geddes and Widmark, the movement between the rooms, the little gestures like the phone book that Barbara places in the chair under her son so he can reach the table and of course. Most of all, I love their porch, the second living room, where it's clear they're spending most of their summertime. The second thread is the professional relationship between many in the film, but especially between Widmark and Douglas' characters. It may not be quite original and gets a bit restless, but overall it looks real, respectful and efficient. The third thread, the grubby tale of Blackie and his tattered little gang, brings us closer to a dark and fearsome world. This self-proclaimed businessman, this self-styled man clearly has a complexity we only briefly address. For me, this film is still a completely satisfying experience.
