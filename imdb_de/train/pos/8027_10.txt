When I saw it for the first time, I was really impressed. The director made such a mysterious atmosphere, especially at the end. Throughout the story, viewers can expect Richard to kill Thomas, or he'll do it first. But the main point was not the conflict, but ... FRIENDSHIP! Life.It is amazing. Every time I see it, I enjoy it! Of course it's pretty violent like any action movie, but I think it's acceptable. Thank you Louis Liosa and Tom Berenger! Amazing movie! I recommend everyone to see it. I'm sure people will not regret it and really have a good time.
