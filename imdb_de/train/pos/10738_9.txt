SPOILERS 9/11 is a very good and VERY realistic documentary about the attacks on the WTC.2 French filmmakers who are in New York to film the actions of a NYFD who are confronted with this event and make the most of it. 9/11 It does not really happen much, which gives the movie an even more terrifying scenario. The day of the attacks seems to be another boring working day, but it will soon change. As the filmmaker travels with the firefighters, he films the first crashed plane, this is the only material of the first impact. He rides with the firefighters to the WTC and enters the building. When the second plane crashes, people understand that this is no coincidence. In the near future, we see firefighters planning to save as many people as possible. Meanwhile, we hear popping sounds. These are the sounds of people who jumped off the tower and fell to the ground. This is the scariest moment in the documentary. Then the tower collapses and our French friend has to run for his life, You hear him breathe like a madman while he runs out of the building. Then a huge sandstorm jumps over him and the screen goes black, he was lucky enough to survive and now he can film the empty streets of downtown New York. Since this documentary has so much historical footage and because the movie should be something completely different, this documentary will likely remain in your memory. I saw the attacks live at home because I had the afternoon. That makes them even more realistic. 10/10
