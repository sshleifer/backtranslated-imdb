I bought this game on eBay after hearing that it's a similar game to Elite. The gameplay is indeed very similar and addictive. After playing it a couple of times, I immediately went back to eBay and bought copies for all my kids so they could join in the fun as well. I've played this game through and the plot feels that way If you're actually in a movie, it's brilliant. If you find it difficult to explore freely due to the limited action of the single player, you can easily set up a freelancer server on your own PC (easy to use and software included) and play to your heart's content. There are still a large number of freelancer servers on the internet, so multiplayer is not a problem and not too threatening because you did not often think of other players unless you want it. So get a copy of this game, learn about it through the single player campaign, set up an online presence and enjoy it. The depth of this game is mind-boggling, with huge systems to explore and find wrecks and all sorts of other things to discover - hidden planets, wormholes, secret bases, the list is almost endless. Fantastic game and especially since you can get it for a few pounds on eBay. Get one with the full written instructions, if you can (blue box, not red xplosiv box), it loads better!
