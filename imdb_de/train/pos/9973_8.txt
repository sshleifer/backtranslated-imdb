This version of 'Vanishing Point' was really nice to me compared to the 1971 version. I found the 1971 version rather boring. If I can get up in the middle of a movie a couple of times (like the 1971 version) than for me, that's not great. Of course, this could be due to the fact that I was only nine years old at the time of publication of the 1971 version. However, I've seen a lot of remakes that made me like the original and the older one better. I found that the plot of the 1997 version was more comprehensible and had essentially adhered to the original, without compromising the meaning of the 1971 version. In my opinion, the 1997 version had more excitement and was not so "bubble". (Boring)
