An absolute classic !! The direction is impeccable, the spectacle is just great. There are no words for this great work. The most definitive movie about the police in Mumbai. This movie has stood the test of time. <br /> <br /> Om Puri offers an outstanding performance, Smita Patil no less. All the actors did their best and the movie races inspired you every moment. This film shakes your whole being badly, forcing you to rethink many issues facing our society. This is the story of a policeman (Om Puri) who begins his career as an honest man, ultimately degenerating into a murderer. The first attempt in Bollywood to go behind the scenes and uncover the oppressive truth about Mumbai bulls. Kudos to Nihalani !! <br /> <br /> Following this film, a series of Bollywood films were released exposing criminals between politicians and police officers. Thus, this film was really a trendsetter. This trend dominated the Hindi film scene for more than a decade. <br /> <br /> This movie was a moderate blockbuster. <br /> <br /> A must for demanding movie fans.
