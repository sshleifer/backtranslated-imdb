That's my kind of movie. I'm fascinated by strange psychotic nightmares and this movie is just that. It's also a dark comedy. While I see it mostly as a horror / thriller, there will be others who could view it as a black dramatic comedy. The end surprised me, but what an end! It leaves the viewer much to think about. <br /> <br /> Powerful performances, a complex and detailed storyline, a great script full of fear and humor and an eerie atmosphere make this movie worth seeing. I personally think that I have to watch this several times to see all the subtleties that are in it find, understand and understand. But it is such a movie that it will be a pleasure and not a chore.
