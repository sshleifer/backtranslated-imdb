Although this beautiful piece of art uses part of the cinematic vocabulary of surrealism, it is actually nothing like that. It is a political and cultural allegory of Mexico's postcolumbian odyssey, as even a passing glance at Mexico's history will prove. <br /> <br /> Unlike "Like Water for Chocolate", "Erendira" expects the viewer to hit at least halfway, so understanding it takes a little work. (A good starting point is to see the figure of the grandmother as Spain: proud, reserved, sad and, above all, complaining about the story.) The heroine's ultimate actions are obscure because the "result" of the story (ie, the present) is always unclear, because we are too close to an honest assessment. The refusal to tie loose ends is the only real choice for the director, given the film's ambitions. <br/> <br/> "Erendira" is beautiful. A big-screen experience would be ideal if you can see it in an art house on site or at a university. If not, VHS is better than not seeing it at all.
