I remember seeing this for the first time when I was nine years old. I wanted to be one of the "barbarian brothers". This movie is still great. An original aspect was that the combat scenes were very short. That the "barbarian brothers" were so good that they quickly killed their enemies! You also have chases, a cage fight, a kite, and even a brawl. <br /> <br /> Yeah, the drama is bad, so it's not ten, also the story got a lot of criticism. I find it very original. Not too many movies in their genre have the same original storyline or colored dialogues. <br /> <br /> I can definitely recommend this movie.
