In a sense, like a very primitive episode of "General Hospital" in a birthing station (and one for difficult cases), this fast-paced programmer has a satisfying emotional impact - mainly because Eric Linden as a distraught young husband in The main plot is so obviously a wreck and for good reason. His pregnant wife, Loretta Young, is arrested at the beginning of a 20-year prison sentence for dismissing a Lecher who had probably come to him; Ms. Young, as always, does nothing to discourage the sympathy of the public, and she is a bit too good to be true, though of course she is sympathetic and kind. Her difficult pregnancy and relationships with the station's other girls form the heart of the film, and the result - not entirely happy - feels right. Aline MacMahon, "one of cinema's few perfect actresses," radiates warmth and authority as an overseer in the apt words of film historian David Thomson, and Glenda Farrell as a not-so-willing new mom to twins Croon "Frankie and Johnny" as a drunken lullaby. Frank McHugh shows in another subplot, and he can show more reach than Warners usually allowed. It's modestly scaled and varied, and Linden's expectant father remains in ovens for days - this part was often laughed at, but he's a scared young boy in trouble and very convincing.
