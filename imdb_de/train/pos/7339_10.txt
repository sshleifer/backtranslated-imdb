Since listening to the Ralph Bakshi version of The Lord of the Rings, I was wondering, "What the hell is Rotoscope animation? !!! Well, I finally found out ... I saw this movie about three years ago, without any idea who Ralph Bakshi is ... and I liked it ... very ... very good story ... it even has a little character development that's great for a cartoon ... See if you get bored with contemporary animation ... Do not get me wrong ... I'm not saying it's just a nice cartoon. .. It's also a pretty good movie ...
