Woah! Can I say to this movie. Personally, I'm one of those who love cats, so that would have been a big drawback to the movie, but I loved the fact that cats could eventually take revenge on everyone. <br /> <br /> I liked The Movie, but I have to admit that Brian Krause, who played Charles Brady, was very compelling. I think the desire has improved when watching the movie. <br /> <br /> I had one thing was disappointed about. I've already seen Charmed and Brian Krause is married to Holly Marie Combs, his kissing scene was O.K. in Sleepwalkers, but really bad compared to his kissing scenes with Holly Marie Combs, I do not know if Krause and Combs have great chemistry or maybe more, it was the only disappointment in the movie, but I think with Brian Krause in the tight It was fine again for the jeans he wore in the movie. <br /> <br /> If you want to meet Brian Krause as Holly Marie Combs' heavenly husband and father of her son For a big surprise with this movie, he was not an angle boy. Although I think about it now, it would be great to see how Krause's character on Charmed was taken over by evil, making him something like his in Sleepwalkers. <br /> <br /> I also have to say that the music in this regard was great movie too!
