The film was recently featured on cable television and opens with a disclaimer that distances itself from any real-life collaboration. That is an eye-catcher in itself. But the script and acting of the main characters is excellent and I was thoroughly absorbed. Not least because of the clear, thoughtful and interesting dialogue. The film is about a meeting in a day between two real musical "legends" formerly composed together, then separated. The film captures the essence of their lives and philosophies, in a story that provides an explanation for their initial "split." What's so impressive is that the actors are as realistic as the characters, mistakes, and everything they play, so at least that viewer believed that I witnessed a true event in almost every detail. The great art of this piece is that a film that talks mainly about "two of us" can make a great impression with sharp writing and good acting. At least 8 out of 10 points.
