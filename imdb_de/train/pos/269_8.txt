I'm a fan of TV movies in general and this was one of the good ones. The cast performances were pretty solid throughout and there were twists that I did not see before every commercial. For me it was a kind of medium meets CSI. <br /> <br /> Has anyone else thought that the daughter looked like a young Nicole Kidman in certain lighting conditions? Are they somehow related? I would definitely watch it or rent it, if it ever comes to a video. <br /> <br /> Dedee was great. She has not seen much in many things and she has done her job very convincingly. <br /> <br /> If you're into TV mystery movies, check them out if you have a chance.
