I saw this movie many years ago and have been looking for it ever since. In my opinion it is very instructive what the future can mean for me. I enjoyed the movie very much and for this day it is very unfortunate for anyone who disagrees But a movie should always be judged for everyone there, and in my opinion, it's great that it matches all of today's cloning and test tubes that occur today, who should judge this movie, make a try. This could be a dramatic event but there you go. All the horrors of today are so far-fetched, even when I laugh, but that makes me think and it scares me as a mother. What if I was desperate? After watching this movie, I would think twice, but I love the movie Do not look at the movie - just know the story and wonder how far you would go for a kid?
