"Fraidy Cat," the fourth of these cartoons, is a good one. At least I like it, so I'm surprised that this gets mixed reviews. <br /> <br /> This is more of a macabre story than a funny one, though it has its moments of comedy. The atmosphere is dark and scary. Tension is another strong element here. As for humor, it's mostly dark humor. <br /> <br /> In this short version, Tom hears a creepy radio show at night and is absolutely scared because it's about ghosts, something he believes. While Tom is scared to death, Jerry watches everything and can laugh all the time. In fact, Jerry quickly finds a way to torture him more and more. With the help of a white shirt and a vacuum cleaner, he creates a great "spirit". <br /> <br /> Tom lives the scariest experiences of his life. Although Jerry Tom is scared for a good reason, the way the story is made becomes funny. Besides, there is no violence here, as this is one of Tom & Jerry's oldest cartoons. I do not get the joke of Tom's nine lives that were almost sucked into the vacuum cleaner. <br /> <br /> When Tom finally finds out that Jerry is all about Jerry's plan and that Jerry made a fool of him, Jerry is "caught in the cookie jar" (he deserves it, to be discovered). Still, Tom shows incredible patience before he reacts. He looks at Jerry angrily for about a minute. The funny thing is that Jerry Tom makes you laugh and it takes about half a minute to realize that Tom is looking at him with a very serious face. Jerry tries to be funny, but Tom does not laugh. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is another strange and remarkable Tom & Jerry experience.
