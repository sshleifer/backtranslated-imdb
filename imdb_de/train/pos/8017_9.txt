This time, Kermit, Fozzie, Miss Piggy, Scooter, Rowlf, The Electric Mayhem, Gonzo, and Camilla, the chickens, are out of college playing in a musical they're trying to reach on Broadway. After failing to produce them, they parted and went their separate ways. I love the characters and cameos. The songs in the movie are "Together Again," "Look at me, here I am," "Goodbye," and "I'll always love you," "Rat Jazz," and "He'll make me happy." "Frank Oz performs the film excellently and all the actors do a great job, when they look as if the Muppets are real .. See it! 91 minutes." Reviewed G. My Rating: A.
