I bought "The Feast of All Saints" and it's not really a horrible movie, but a lot could have been better. It had a great historical value played by very talented actors / actors, and it is not a common occurrence that actors play such a role and can be somewhat credible. There were some parts that were a bit mediocre and confusing, but I would not say that the whole movie was awful. Once you think about capturing 19th century New Orleans and making something of it, it's quite difficult, and it's much harder to find actors who can label those parts strongly. But the only big problem I had with the movie was that most of the actors who played the free people of color were mostly fair-skinned Africans, who were not very universal in filling others who were not fair-skinned. one of the old Creole clich√©s that still exist. Whatever the casting could have given a wider choice, though many Creoles were color conscious. Rather, actors should be selected who in a sense were almost white. The actors had done a good job, the script could have written better, and overall the performances were very credible.
