The adaptation of Will Eisner's SPIRIT to the TV screen followed many other offerings that evolved from comic books or comic books. (Remember, the two are not exactly the same medium.) It is indeed ironic that this is the only adaptation (at the time of writing) of Eisner's clever Alec, clever cracking, and witty superhero. <br /> <br /> The story goes that Republic Pictures was interested in a movie version and had negotiated with the owner of the copyright in the mid-1940s, but the deal was never closed. The remaining screen game became the series THE MASKED MARVEL, one of the best in the Republic. Maybe it was a good thing, because this studio had a predilection for crafting material from the comics, pulp mags, radio and comic books. <br /> <br /> It's pretty obvious that it was a failed pilot for a scheduled television series. While an old, longtime comic book reader like myself may be a little strict in criticizing an adaptation, a viewer unfamiliar with the character may make some new observations without getting in the way of the performance, like this screen version should look like, how. <br /> <br /> Well, sitting and watching the story while the characters interact in the midst of a crime wave, the Little Lady (my wife, Mrs. Ryan) pinned it down with a statement. "That can not decide whether it's serious or not!" This describes both THE SPIRIT and its creator, Mr. Will Eisner, the true creative genius in the comics. The film is a sincere attempt to bring Eisner's world to the screen. The cast of Denny Colt / The Spirit, Commissioner Dolan and Ellen was really good. Although it was in a contemporary environment in the tradition of the "good old days", as regards the costuming, you know when men and women still wore hats! This brings out this one last (and meandering) point, and that is that the director and staging deliberately tried to give the characters a Will Eisner look in terms of facial expressions and body language. We tell them kudos for their efforts. <br /> <br /> It's just too bad that no series followed! Well, in today's movie world, weird adjustments seem to be a hot topic. Maybe some big-timer producer and director could make a really first-class SPIRIT production for the big screen. We can only hope. <br /> <br /> UPDATING: Dateline, Chicago, Illinois. 06/04/2008. Meanwhile, anyone who goes to the movies in Multiplexes Mall has seen the poster promoting the new movie by THE SPIRIT (with subtitles, MY CITY SCREAMS). Which Christmas 2008 should be published. Well, then we'll see what we talked about. Keep your fingers crossed! CONTINUED ............. <br /> <br /> UPDATE II: A few days ago we saw the new movie writer-director Frank Miller's rendition of THE SPIRIT. Well, we got our wish; But is that a good thing or another case of "Be careful what you ask for, because you might get it?" Please read our articles elsewhere on IMDb.com. THANK YOU!
