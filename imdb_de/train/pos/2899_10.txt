Very Smart Humor Excellent Performance I can not believe how people might think it deserves a 1/10! I hope this movie will be shown everywhere so that everyone can enjoy it. If you ever have the opportunity, see it ... Do not miss it. There is a part when the main characters "Happy Birthday" and "el payaso" drive and sing plinplin "(an Argentine song for children (I think ... it could also be South American, I am not sure)). These two Songs have the same melody ... but people do not usually realize that ... it's just a thank you! I tried to write this in Spanish and English because it's an Argentine movie ... but the site would do not allow me :( Hope you like it!
