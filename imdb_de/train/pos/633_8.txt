Stardust Another Guarded Review (originally written June 15, 2007) <br /> <br /> The marketing engine has just begun (no website yet?), So I doubt most of you have heard of it. In truth, I did not (somehow). When I got the post, I thought it was a different codename and was actually afraid to be Transformers, one of the movies I want to see when I'm not working, so I enjoy it 100% as a mortal moviegoer. It turned out to be no Transformers, and I already noticed it as "this Neil Gaiman movie." Why is? In short, it's a Gaiman fairy tale about a boy and a fallen star. More than that, and I would disclose plot information that (a) constitutes a breach of contract and (b) spoils your enjoyment. If you really want to know what it's about, buy the book. Rumor has it that Gaiman is something of a writer. <br /> <br /> Not knowing what to expect in a movie can be so enjoyable when it's worth the surprise. And for this it certainly was. This show was "special" in that it included not only film critics, but also exhibitors (who rarely show a mixed performance) and local sci-fi / fantasy people. So you know the expected audience, right? I mean, with that lot and the title of Stardust, I knew what to expect. Oh, how cute I was wrong. Yes, it's a fairy tale written by an author famous in the comic bookdom. But it was not Lord of the Rings. It was not even another Lord of the Rings (er, Eragon). It was much more intimate than anything else. <br /> <br /> But like Lord of the Rings, it was the humanism of the film that sold the fantastic qualities. It's certainly a romantic story, but with generous splashes of humor. And that humor is of the kind that is not slapstick shrekism. It's more drama than comedy. Before I continue, let's do this film review. <br /> <br /> Acting is at least good. It's always hard to say more for fantasy films, but I think there were significant, well played roles. Unfortunately, Michelle Pfieffer is not one of them. She plays a villain and does the job. Nothing special. Rupert Everett, however, was a real idiot. This is a big bad guy. Peter O'Toole is, well, Peter frickin 'O'Toole - which is wonderful. Ricky Gervais is perfectly staffed and shows why. For the most part, Robert De Niro seemed to have too much fun. When he wanted to deliver the goods, he did it. And Charlie Cox (who?) The lead actor was a nice surprise from a man I've never heard of. Claire Danes. Claire Danes Claire Danes I have always had mixed opinions with her. She can be great, and then she seems to miss the target. In it she is the former. And she is literally the star of this movie. Sure, her accent stumbles here and there. And yes, she is not as good as she can be when Cox is not in the scene. But ... well, see for yourself. <br /> <br /> Special effects are dumb, but only where they should be. The best airship so far - sorry Potter. The direction is carefree and flows well. Cinematography could have been better, but not everyone films in New Zealand. Everything else is the upper bracket. <br /> <br /> And now that's done ... <br /> <br /> ... the writing. Oh, the writing! Neil, you devil. In today's climate, it is difficult to do something original, and one begins to wonder. A kingdom, a dying king, a boy who wants to prove his value, witches, ghosts, a search (or three) - what's new? But Gaiman's story attracts you with its familiar interface, just to turn it into a sweetly original story about a boy and his heart. And although you suspect how everything will develop, you start to wonder in the third act, and if you are me you are drawn into the exciting climactic confrontation and hope for the best. In the end you will find this story, this movie, as all fairy tales should be, but all too often not. Fantastic and real. <br /> <br /> (I wish I could talk about Septimus vs Tristan, but I will not ruin it for you.> <br /> Those I talked to later had the same impression as me. A great movie for all ages and the new {WITHHELD} for this generation - the space will not be filled until the movie is in the re-release because you might expect it - you'll still know it when you go out, I sincerely hope Stardust is not lost under the tent poles, even if it does, it would be a pleasure for me to push everyone I know into the hands. <br /> <br /> --- <br /> < br /> Forgot to add the {WITHHELD} look, I'm a couple of years late, but ... "A great movie for all ages and the new THE PRINCESS BRIDE for this generation." <br /> <br / > Maybe a somewhat sublime assessment, but I'm still confident that the di e years now the same "Oh, I love this movie" are the answer, as now for "The Princess Bride".
