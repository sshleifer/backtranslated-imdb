Watching the devil is one of my best experiences in the cinema. I was intrigued by the mixed reaction to the film - and for me, the differences suggest that the film has touched something that was embraced or rejected by the general public. It's one of those movies that stayed with me, and I keep thinking about it. <br /> <br /> The DVD would certainly highlight some of the themes and elements of filmmaking? These include: Sidney Lumet's comeback movie, the staggering technique used in storytelling, the great combination of Lumet and Masterson, and why it works so well. To become an open checkbook for their women, the under-represented, yet resonating performance by Marisa Tomei, and of course the great Hoffman with this central monologue about the sum of its parts - for me the heart of the film. <br /> <br /> Phew! Certainly a masterful movie. So imagine my disappointment to watch the eagerly anticipated DVD - just to avoid comment, no peek behind the scenes, no interviews, no extras. <br /> <br /> Hey - Distributors - arrange it!
