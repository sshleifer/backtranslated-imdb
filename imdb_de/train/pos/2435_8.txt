I never thought that an old cartoon would bring tears to my eyes! When I bought Casper & Friends: Spooking About Africa for the first time, I absolutely wanted to have the very first Casper cartoon titled The Friendly Ghost (1945) break me down! I could not believe how sad and tragic it was to see Casper's fox killed! I've never seen anything like that in the other Casper cartoons! This is the saddest of all! It was so depressing that I just could not watch it anymore. It's like watching Lassie die at the end of a movie. I know that it is a classic. But it's too much for us old comic fans, as if they were like me! If I wanted to see something old and classic, I would rather look for something happy and funny! But when I think of this Casper cartoon, I think of my cats!
