No film with Dennis Hopper, Gary Busey, Erika Eleniak, Tom Berenger, Dean Stockwell, Marilu Henner deserves a rating below 5. This is a bad version of movies like 16 blocks or the timeless Midnight Run, except that the prisoner, the being transported here, which is very eye-friendly woman. Tom Berenger plays another blatant, maverick military guy well and William Mcnamara plays his beginner who has discharged well. The conspiracy at first sight is absurd because I've lost the times Eleniak should have had and could have escaped, but this is an entertaining feel-good film and there are good cameos from all the above actors keeping the movie rolling. This is not really a family movie, as there are some elusive and rare nude scenes with eleniak, but this is much better than some of the others that have appeared this time around.
