This is one of my favorite sports movies. Dennis Quaid moves and convinces in the role of a man who gave up his dream of being a baseball player when his arm gave way. As a high school coach, he encourages his players to win the division championship by telling them he would try to play a baseball team when they do. They win (partly because of all the brawling they do with a coach who can beat more than 90 miles an hour) and he keeps his side of the business - and is signed! <br /> <br /> If you've ever decided to try something new and scary as an adult, Jim Morris's story will resonate with you. It's moving and inspiring, and the man's relationships are true. <br /> <br /> But inspiration is not the only reason why I lend this one. Dennis Quaid is downright purdy in this game and a baseball movie with a handsome man changing a diaper is my idea of ​​heaven. Ladies, if you feel like me, look at this.
