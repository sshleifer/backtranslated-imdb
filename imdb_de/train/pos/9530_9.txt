Conrad Hall went out with a bang. The great movie photographer completed his brilliant career with this film before being passed on. He was proud that this is one of the best-looking crime thrillers you'll ever see. <br /> <br /> Of course, acting is not bad if you let Tom Hanks and Paul Newman on a leash! The amount of action is just right here too: not too much; not to less. <br /> <br /> None of the characters here are, frankly, "good guys" as Hanks is a professional hitman for city boss Newman. Hanks' only redeeming quality is not that his little son gives up a murderer like him, even though he teaches him how to escape robberies as an escape man! Huh? <br /> <br /> As good as the acting is and as interesting as the story is, the real star of this film is the cameraman Hall, who paints scene for beautiful scene with his lens. His work is just great.
