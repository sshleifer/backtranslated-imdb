I love the movie, it was a very interesting fantasy movie that describes the true meaning of the family in this movie, the history of our country and the funny action in the movie. I look at the top about 4 times a week and I just love it! I wish it had been a sequel to see more of Susan's father in the past and see how Susan settled down with her new little sister and had no phones, computers, gameboys, or anything of the 21st century. I hope everyone else enjoyed the movie as much as I did. I think you could say I'm a top fanatic and I do not mind. The little boy in the movie Robert Lincoln Walker was just adorable. I wonder who he is and how old he is today. Does anyone know if he's been watching movies or watching TV?
