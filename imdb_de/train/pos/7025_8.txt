I found this a charming adaptation, very lively and full of fun. Apart from some big mistakes, the cast is wonderful. I have to repeat some of the earlier comments - Chynna Phillips is a terrible misstep as a teenager. At 27, she's just too old (and yes, that shows her), and the singing "chops" for Broadway music are missing. Vanessa Williams is a decent singer and suitable for non-dancer. However, she is NOT Latina and her character is definite. It is also STRIDENT throughout, which gets boring. <br /> <br /> The birds of Bird Bird's Sweet Birds fan club really sparkle - with special praise to Brigitta Dau and Chiara Zanni. I also enjoyed the performance of Tyne Daly, although I'm generally not a fan of her work. After all, the dancing Shriners are uprising, especially the dorky three in the bar. <br /> <br /> The film is suitable for the whole family, and I highly recommend it.
