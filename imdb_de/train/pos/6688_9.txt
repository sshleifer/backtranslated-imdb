In the history of movies based on comics, "Mystery Men" is one of the most underrated. This is not a normal cartoon superhero movie! It follows the successes of a colorful crew of well-meaning wannabees, including Mr. Furious (played by Ben Stiller), the bowler (Janeane Garofalo), the Shoveller (William H. Macy), the Blue Rajah (Hank Azariah) and the Spleen (Paul Reubens). "Mystery Men" fakes various aspects of superhero films such as "Superman" or "Batman" such as the pithy proverbs and the questions of secret identities. Most superheroes are not billionaires like Bruce Wayne, but work types with light jobs and a neurotic home. So it looks like director Kinka Usher is making heroes something the average viewer can identify with. I found "Mystery Men" visually stimulating and very funny. Although it does not make a franchise, it's still a pleasure to see it!
