I just read good things about this movie and finally got a chance to watch it late last night, and it was all I expected, and more. So a real horror movie should be scary because it was so realistic. The creepy-sounding score was perfect for a bleak mood. I liked the dramatic opening scene and loved how the rest of the movie went. Very good. I would like to see more horror movies like this. This is easily one of my favorites. A realistic thunder and thunder storm would have created a nice atmosphere for this movie. In addition, all the elements had a good horror movie needs.I can recommend this movie to anyone who appreciates a good scary movie that does not hit. I will add it to my collection. The DVD has some interesting features.
