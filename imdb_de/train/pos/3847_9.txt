During this time, a controversy was written in this film (as in most projects by Verhoeven). <br /> <br /> Very graphic representations of death scenes. A parachute that does not open claps on the floor. A guy being eaten by a lion eater * chomp * teeth in the neck. And a guy run over by a speedboat * zoom *, a bloody corpse that goes down. <br /> <br /> But besides Gore, this film also contains some brilliant (and stunningly beautiful) scenes filmed in the gray fishing town of Vlissingen; <br /> <br /> Thousands of rosebuds fly across the screen, in a somewhat irrelevant part of the film, a beautiful (holy) woman putting flowers in a milk jug surrounded by blood-dripping meat plates A hot love scene between two male characters a cemetery. <br /> <br /> The story ends in a desperate but fulfilling 10 minutes that will not disappoint and leave you with a relieved sigh. <br /> <br /> Of course, the pros are the disadvantages. Some special effects are too exaggerated and are made obvious to see how far Verhoeven could push the gore factor (eg, the multiple eyeballs hanging out of their sockets). While the two main characters (Jeroen Krabbé and Renée Soutendijk) are doing their characters a great job, the character of Herman (portrayed by the rather unfriendly Thom Hoffman) just feels enormously underdeveloped, which makes him tough. I also look after his tragic death. <br /> <br /> I've tried my best to give you an idea of ​​what you can expect from this amazing movie, and as you can see, this is not easily summarized in words. So do yourself a favor, if you find this movie anywhere, look at it! And enjoy the unique style and substance of this masterpiece.
