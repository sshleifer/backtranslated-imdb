As a city researcher / photographer with over 40 years and a longtime fan of the original Kolchak: Night Stalker series since my early childhood, one aspect that was not really mentioned is the amount of exploration Carl has made during the series. He has always managed to get into a big job, into the sewer or tunnel after tunnel. Only armed with his trusty pin light (okay, he had some torches in the primary ape episode tunnel) and his camera, he never wore any other gear to either protect himself or facilitate the exploration. <br /> <br /> I have recently bought the DVD box of the two pilot films and the following TV episodes and have slowly revisited all the shows. And although I remember seeing them in the early 70s when they were first aired, it's been over 30 years ... so many of them seem to be brand new. Campy, old fashioned and cheesy - but charming and very entertaining. They just do not do anything these days. Now all are raindrops with predictable characters and actions. Luckily, my 16-year-old daughter sat down to watch the episodes with me, and has developed an appreciation for her (she enjoys.) the genre). It gives me hope and confidence that the series will be passed on to new generations of fans for many years to come.
