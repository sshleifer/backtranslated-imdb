"Match Point" and now "Scoop" have both convinced me that Woody Allen makes good movies not only in England (and Scarlett Johansson is the right cast member), but also confirms what I've known for years: he should not concentrate not on neurotic-rich New Yorkers. In this case, Johansson plays the journalist Sondra Pransky, who is the magician Sid Waterman (Allen) in his vanishing box, where she meets the spirit of the murdered reporter Joe Strombel (Ian McShane), who tells her that the serial murders have plagued London By millionaire Peter Lyman (Hugh Jackman) committed. So she gets to know him and ... well, I do not know how much I can tell you without revealing it. But I can say that this is probably the funniest movie Allen has ever had in years. There is his ubiquitous, unique sense of humor (especially the line about his religion). <br /> <br /> So you'll like this movie for sure. If nothing else, you will fall in love with London. But most of the time it's just so damn funny. Even if you do not like Woody Allen, you must love him.
