I saw this movie for the first time about 4 years ago and expected something funny, similar to CB4. I was blown away. I lay on the floor and laughed my butt out of this movie is so great. Much better than CB4, the characters, the songs, the plot, everything. First-class independent film awarded by Siskel and Egbert "Two Thumbs UP" (and if two old white men understand the humor in this movie, you know it's good).
