Vivah is by no means a classic. In the days of hardcore action, groundbreaking special effects and complex plots (none of which Bollywood has mastered), it's refreshing to see a simple movie like Vivah. The story is, as we all know, a journey from the first meeting of a couple to the eventual wedding after a few restrained moments and trial periods. Not more, not less. The music is not quite in the same league as MPK or HAHK, but shakes not synonymous. Two songs stood up for me - Mujhe Haq Hai & Do Anjaane. While Milan Abhi Aadha and Hamaari Shaadi were cumulative. Shahid is sincere and shows a lot of potential. It's good to see him playing something different from the "cool guy" he normally does. Amrita is very cute and plays the role of a docile little girl perfectly. Alok Nath, Anupam Kher and Seema Biswas are great supporters, and the rest of the cast is doing a good job. Suraj's direction is simple but effective. The film's main flaw is the slow pace that could test the patience of many young viewers. But all in all a good, clean and decent family movie.
