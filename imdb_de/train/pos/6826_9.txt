John Cassavete's "Opening Night" is fantastic and fascinating. fantastic, because it plays with the deepest fears that we have in our imagination, fascinating, because it always surprises us to surprise. With a very long duration of two hours and twenty minutes, anyone who appreciates characters will not be able to take their eyes off the screen. <br /> <br /> The story of an unstable actress, Myrtle Gordon (Gena Rowlands)) trying to put together a game to fight against their demons; "Opening Night" is not just about a woman who is about to collapse, but also about the complexity of the life of theater actors and the theater world. All figures of Cassavetes are experienced people who are familiar with the world of the theater. So half of the movie is on a stage, either where the performers do their jobs or behind the scenes where producers, writers and directors do their jobs. Cassavetes is so harsh with his characters that this unfriendliness turns to the audience, but the audience in the cinema. Because in the theater of film, there is another audience that does not know what's really happening, and laughs because it's performance. And that's essentially what it is. It's just that the audience in the theater does not see 'Backstage' as we do. You will not experience the exuberance of Gena Rowlands before she enters this phase, but above all; They do not know why she behaves the way she does. <br /> <br /> I always thought it would be difficult to be friends with an actor. Myrtle (Rowland) says she is an actress, and that's the only thing she knows how to do. and I imagine if I had a friend who is a professional performer, it would be really hard to tell when he is telling the truth because I would know he is an actor and he can fake everything at any time. A lot of the things that Myrtle does during the terrible experiences that the movie performs? We suspect that she is real; The rest of the characters also suspect. <br /> <br /> There is the writer Sarah (Joan Blondell), who can not understand why Myrtle does not understand the character she wrote for her. There's the director, Manny (Ben Gazzara), who can not accept the fact that his best actress might lose it; Producer David (Paul Stewart), who does not know where to stand, and Myrtle's co-star Maurice (Cassavetes himself), who can not handle the love they have for each other. <br /> <br /> When they witness the death of a teenager, a fan; All this comes together and affects Myrtle, but no one knows if their delusions are real. They say nothing because they do not want to upset them, but the film enters a state of subconscious that only Myrtle accepts. Sometimes we can say that everyone has it. During those moments, Cassavete's brilliant script shows an eerie brutal honesty in the words the characters say in a behind-the-scenes talk. and not just what every Myrtle tells, but also what she says to them. <br /> <br /> Here are people who are not afraid to voice their opinions and constantly change what they think, just like Cassavetes way of making movies. And in this aspect, the performances are more important here than in "Shadows" because the characters have a bigger picture; a bigger story that comes out of the trivial. <br /> <br /> But in another aspect, the actual way of doing cinema, this movie is no different from "Shadows". It's a nice thing in the way Al Ruban's camera shoots the characters. When someone speaks, the camera does not focus on him, he shoots at the person who listens; So we can see how he or she reacts to the things the other says. Sometimes they do not care, sometimes they are happy, sometimes devastated. <br /> <br /> Improvisation may still be there, but between all those wonderful performances. Towards the end, there is an unexpected scene in which Cassavetes and Rowlands talk uninterruptedly. Whether this was improvised or not, we do not have to ask ourselves. We just have to watch. and see how they share both life experiences and see words come to life in a conversation that means much more than what it shows? It does not become more natural.
