When I was little, my parents got this movie to watch. I really liked it and I have watched it over and over again. Even when I was in the 3rd grade, I have seen it from time to time. I recently watched it again, just for the sake of nostalgia, and although the show was not intended for my age group (I'm in my late teenage years), I still found it entertaining and instructive. This show teaches good lessons about imagination and good togetherness. I found some parts pretty entertaining. Also, this show has no bad content, so you can leave children alone with this show and not have to worry about whether they pick up a bad language or anything else. I would recommend this.
