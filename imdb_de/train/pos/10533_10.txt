I totally agree that "Nothing" is a fantastic movie! I did not laugh long when I saw a movie! and David Hewlett and Andrew Miller are awesome! They work really well together! This movie may not appeal to some people (I can not really say why, without ruining it!), But everyone for themselves! I loved it and would highly recommend it! <br /> <br /> The direction is great and some shots are very smart. It looks like they had a lot of fun filming! <br /> <br /> Although there are really only two main characters in the movie and not a lot of props that the actors make, all this makes the movie enjoyable to watch.
