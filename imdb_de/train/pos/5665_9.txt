They had me from the first show. <br /> <br /> Welcome to Trinity County. A sleepy, small, mayberry-like place with a little difference. The sheriff is really Satan. There's the spoiler Not like you would not find out in 10 minutes anyway. <br /> <br /> Oh, but that's not all. It turns out that Satan has a son named Caleb. Some people try to keep it good, but it's a tough fight. Sheriff Buck (Satan) knows who Caleb is and enjoys spending time with him to explain the ways of darkness. Subtly sneaky. He is not always angry. Mostly he is a hero. Everyone owes him a great favor because he often triggers and saves from misfortune. Every time you think someone is going to knock him down, one of his friends comes out of nowhere to sabotage him. <br /> <br /> In one of my favorite episodes, Lucas and Caleb were in a cabin in the woods and some people with guns decided to rob them. Lucas used it as an excuse to teach Caleb a lesson about evil. The robber (Ted) was reluctant to shoot her. Lucas told Caleb that Ted had half a conscience. If he had no conscience, he would have shot her by now. If he had a real conscience, he would never have become criminal. So he called Half-Ted. It was pretty funny. He mocked the criminals. And of course he was always half-ted by 10 steps ahead. And of course he had full control at all times. They actually had the privilege of favoring Satan. <br /> <br /> Very, very good show. It was one of my favorite horror shows of all time. Twilight Zone Night Stalker Fear Circle American Gothic Supernatural <br /> <br /> This is a good company.
