Although DiG! was hailed as closest to that closest to the music industry. The director has led the public to believe that the 'Brian Jonestown' massacre of '98 disappeared from Earth. And the rivalry between the dandy Warhols and Jonestown was milked. The truth of the matter is not really shown in this movie. <br /> <br /> So, this movie is endlessly quotable and an interesting clock when we look at two groups of very talented musicians creating their art. One of the best features of this film is the unique perspective between the indie music scene and the larger corporate scene. <br /> <br /> Mostly recommended for the music and the two fantastic bands.
