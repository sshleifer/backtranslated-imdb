Rohmer deviates from his usual portraits of the French middle class to tell this costume drama about the difficulties of an aristocratic lady during the French Revolution. What is even more attractive about "La Anglaise ..." (apart from the story itself) is the fantastic aesthetic that Rohmer has achieved. The images were also digitally decorated, so they look like baroque images. At some moments you can not really say whether you are watching a movie or a series of pictures in the Louvre Musseum. Every shot is like a work of art. <br /> <br /> * My rating: 7.5 / 10 <br /> <br /> ---------------- <br /> <br /> --- ----------- - <br /> <br /> ------------ <br /> <br /> - --------- ---------
