The feeling of this movie was incredible. The performance of Adam Sandler was very inspiring. Since he played a very rattling and fragile character, he brought his skills to the point and practiced the role. His character was really interesting. I can see how I read the script for this movie and was not half as interested in the role Sandler made me. For someone who plays mostly comedy roles, he took on a serious role with seemingly own quirks and inputs. I especially loved the scene in which the characters of Adam and Don drove a scooter through the city. I became familiar with the moment, because it seemed that Don was witnessing a thing that Adam did to break away from everything. With his video games, music and many other things he does everything to prevent him from thinking of the past. Riding the scooter with the headset seemed like an escape from his thoughts. This movie is definitely worth it.
