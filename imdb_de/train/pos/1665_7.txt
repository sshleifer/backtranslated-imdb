The film looked like a passage for Immoral Study. Most likely, I've never been so concerned with the burning need of the artist to immortalize male nudes and all the fuss about "Well, who draws this penis ?!" sounded a bit unfounded. The dialogues in this movie are pretty awful, though this movie visually had its moments. I almost made it when Tassi painted a mental picture, but then the movie turned to penis again. Highly recommended for those who have not seen it for a long time.
