So many educational films are nothing more than an insane drudgery, saved only by the fact that "MST3K" she mocked ( "Why do they study industrial arts?"). "Hemo the Magnificent" is actually quite well done. It's about blood, the heart and the circulatory system. I admit that I can not remember everything, but it does a good job explaining everything to keep it serious, but entertaining. I think you can always count on June Foray (best known for the voice of Rocky the Squirrel, she plays a deer here) The best place to see it is in "Gremlins": a class watches it while herself a Gremlin formed.
