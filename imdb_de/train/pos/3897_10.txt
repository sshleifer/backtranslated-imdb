This video was my first encounter with Eddie Izzard. We had several friends during one night and for some reason we had to go to HBO during the evening. Someone named "Eddie Izzard" was on. I tried not to laugh too loud at the first jokes. I did not want to be held responsible for the rest of the group enjoying something that obviously killed me. After I had kept my laugh more than healthy, I let go - as did the others of us (we were not stoned, by the way, nor do we talk about insurance and pensions ...). We were suffocated afterwards. The storylines, the plot, the bizarre but ingenious connections in the sketches are downright brilliant. I've been addicted to every Eddie Izzard comedy I can get my hands on. His work is just awesome. His comedy appears effortless. He seems more like a hysterically funny friend hanging around your house, hanging over this or that. He gives you the impression that the joke lies between you and yourself, the only true humor lover. If you are disappointed in this video, you have no sense of the penultimate humor or humor, as they are said in the UK.
