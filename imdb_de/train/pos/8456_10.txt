I've seen almost all the Gundam / Mech anime shown in the US, and this is by far the best story. The way his action turns and turns has increased. Gundam Wing is a series that focuses mainly on politics and war. The series follows a group of five 15-year-old boys who were trained to control state-of-the-art mobile suits known as Gundams. The Gundam pilots were trained to fight a powerful uprising known as Oz. As things heat up between OZ and the Gundam pilots, new political groups will form and old ones will disperse. Old conflicts will end and new ones will emerge. To achieve peace, Gundam pilots must deal with the events in their world and put an end to all struggles. But how far are people ready to reach their goal? I recommend this anime to anyone looking for a show that has a deep plot.
