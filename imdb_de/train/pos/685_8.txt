Ghost Story is a terrible horror story. This is from the Circle of Fear and Ghost Story series of the early seventies. The beginning and end of each story are told by Sebastian Cabot. Do you remember him from the early family series Family Affair in the 1960s? This particular story has Barbara Parkins and David Birney as leading actors and as main characters in the story. I've seen this recently, and I was so scared. If you are alone, I would not recommend you to look at them. This story is terrific, not a bloody or cursing word, but very scary. Barbara Parkins played the young bride. David Birney played her husband. Both actors were very good in their roles. If you like weird, funny, terrifying ghost stories, then you'll like this little gem. I rated this highly. I highly recommend this story.
