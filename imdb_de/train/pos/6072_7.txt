Branagh and Fishburne deliver outstanding performances in this version of the Shakespearean classic. Branagh plays Iago better than I saw the character in the movie or on stage. Some may say that this movie is too Iago oriented, but I disagree. Fishburne, ironically the first black Othello in film history, delivers a powerful performance. Fishburne has always been a good actor, but this performance as the Moor of Venice may be one of his best. <br /> <br /> The only problem I have with this film is the simple subtraction of some important scenes. Desdemona's character gets far less depth than she has in the play. In this movie, it could not be added. One of Branagh's worst cuts in this film was the subtraction of a conversation between Iago and Desdemona at the beginning of the second act. This part of the piece shows that Desdemona is not the innocent child she portrays as in this film. There were a number of subtractions that affected the integrity of this film. <br /> <br /> If you have not read the piece yet or have seen a movie version of Othello, I recommend this movie. The story, whether cut or not, is still incredibly exciting. The drama is, as I said, very good. If some important scenes had been added and Desdemona's character had been a little further prioritized, this would be a great movie. As it stands, it is still an admirable version of the original. I only recommend it marginally.
