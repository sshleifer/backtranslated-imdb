Probably the best fantasy movie ever made. Gorgeous colors, spectacular sets, incredible Miklos Rosza sheet music that will suit any scene and mood. Acting is also outstanding in something that could have been stiff and overbearing in a few hands, but here the poetic dialogue is sent and sensitively spoken (the humor is also subtle and delightful) were thrilled with it. Along with "The Four Feathers" (1939), one of the two best films released by Alexander Korda and London Films - and one of the best ever made. <br /> <br /> A true, addictive movie classic!
