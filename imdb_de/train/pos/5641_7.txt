Yes, the plot is predictable. Yes, there are some action holes. Yes, it has a TV quality. and yes, Britney Spears "wrote" the book with obvious self-promotion. <br /> <br /> But forget all this ... this movie is fun. <br /> <br /> Fun in an After School A special way, but still funny. <br /> <br /> Virginia Madsen as a mother is doing a great job ... so well that I'll start looking for her films. For all the good reasons she reminded me of Diane Lane. <br /> <br /> Also the rest of the cast is doing a good job. If I were a casting agent, I would explore some of these young actors. <br /> <br /> The production values ​​are above the usual TV standards and the music was really great ... better than some big budget movies I've seen. <br /> <br /> If you're in the mood for German Noir, this movie is not for you. If you want a safe, entertaining and undervalued movie, this is a good movie. It's one thing you could show your 10-year-old daughter, but you can enjoy it yourself.
