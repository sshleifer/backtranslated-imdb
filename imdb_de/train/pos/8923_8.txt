The Blob is a classic science fiction film of the 1950s. You probably know the story: Two teens (Steve McQueen & Aneta Corsaut) see a meteorite hit the ground, and when they search for it, they meet an old man with a strange ... blob on his arm. You take him to the doctor's office and go to find out what happened. From there, the blob spreads and eats everyone on its way. The special effects are fun, as is the story. There are many great touches, such as the policeman playing chess over the radio with a police officer in another district. It's not a masterpiece, but it has a special place in its genre. Steve McQueen is very good. 8.10.
