Excellent movie. The whole picture was shot in Budapest, so I am proud of it. My little problem was that the trains were in the film of the Hungarian State Railways (M√ÅV), and it is obvious that they were used in big trains, not in the local railway - according to the story in which Chikatilo picked up his victims local stations , Apart from that, the movie is outstanding.
