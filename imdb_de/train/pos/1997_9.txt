As a life-long fan of Dickens, I have always been disappointed with the adaptations of his novels. <br /> <br /> Although his works represented a highly accurate reissue of human life at all levels of the Victorian British Kingdom, this was the case across the board. A pervasive thread of humor that could be as playful as it was sarcastic the narrative dictates. In a way, he was a literary cartoonist and cartoonist. He could be serious and funny in the same sentence. He was proud of him, tried arrogance, celebrated modesty, and reconciled himself with loneliness and poverty. It may be a clich√©, but he was a folk writer. <br /> <br /> And it's the comedy that's so often lacking in its interpretations. At the time of writing, Oliver Twist is shown on BBC television in serial form. All the misery and cruelty are her, but not the humor, irony and wild delicacies. The result is just a dark, gloomy experience: The story was written by a journalist and not by a writer. It's not really Dickens. <br /> <br /> 'Oliver!' By contrast, the brand is much closer. The mockery of authority is perfectly interpreted, from the roaring pearl to the drunken magistrate. The classic confrontation between Pearl and Mr. Brownlow, who calls the law "donkey, idiot," could not have been better. Harry Secombe is an ideal choice. <br /> <br /> But the blind cruelty is there too, the callous indifference of the state, the cold, the hunger, the poverty and the loneliness are as sure as the Master desires. <br /> <br /> And then there are crimes. Ron Moody is a treasure, like the grubby Jewish fence, while Oliver Reid perfects Bill Sykes. <br/> <br /> Perhaps it's not surprising that Lionel Bart - himself a Jew from East London - is free to reinterpret him with Fagin by Fagin as a much kinder guy than Dicken's. In the novel he was completely reckless and sent some of his own boys to the gallows to protect himself (though he was also caught and hanged). While portrayed in the film rather as a stubborn father figure, rather than a charitable thief as a spoiler of children, the latter is a long-standing anti-Semitic feeling. Otherwise, very few freedoms are recorded with Dickens original. All the most memorable elements are included. There is just enough threat and violence to ensure storytelling while taking into account the children's sensitivity. Nancy is still beaten to death, Bullseye escapes drowning, and Bill Sykes gets a true-to-original graphics. <br /> <br /> Every song is excellent, although it tends towards Schmaltz. Mark Lester mimics wonderfully. His and my favorite scene is the one in which the world lives, "who will buy". It's nice, but it's Dickens through and through. <br /> <br /> I could go on. I could recommend the wonderful set pieces, the contrast between rich and poor. There are first-class spectacles from more British regulars than you could shake off a stick. <br /> <br /> I should give 10 points, but today I feel more like Scrooge. Enjoy it with your Christmas dinner. No original was better realized.
