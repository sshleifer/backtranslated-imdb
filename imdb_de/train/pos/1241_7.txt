This movie is very entertaining and any criticism is based on personal preference - not on movie quality. Apart from the exaggerated profanities that are common in many scenes of Murphy, the film is an excellent instrument for his humor. It has some pretty good special effects and exciting action scenes. As a finder of lost children, Murphy's character begins to search for a missing girl, leading him on the path that others believe is "chosen" - to protect the golden child. The boy is born an enlightened one destined to save the world from evil forces whose life is in danger if not Murphy's help and his beautiful, mysterious and mystical helper / guide / protector /> <br /> Es There are also moments of philosophical lessons to challenge viewers who are interested in thinking about deep thoughts. One such scene is where the golden child around whom Murphy's figure is supposed to protect herself is being tested by the monks of the Mountain Temple. An elderly monk presents a necklace with jewelry necklaces that the child can choose from, and the child is tested for his or her choice. <br /> <br /> This is a fantasy / comedy based on the idea that both are good and evil powers in our world most people do not know about. If we accept this premise of conspiracy, we must let go of our touch with a perceived everyday reality and prepare for the earth and walls to collapse, revealing a realm of evil just waiting to destroy us. This is an excellent film, with a good plot, subtle drama and mostly pretty decent dialogue that combines a serious theme with a healthy balance between martial arts and Eddie Murphy's humor.
