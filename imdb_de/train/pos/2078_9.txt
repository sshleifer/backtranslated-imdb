This adaptation of the film by Pearl S. Buck is certainly a classic. A real Hollywood epic. It has all the things a great Hollywood movie has: birth, death, happiness, sadness, amusement, desperation and so on. There is only one thing that bothers me. I know that this was a sign of the times, but neither of the main characters is played by Asian actors. Paul Muni was a great actor, and he does admirable work as Wang Lung, the owner of a farm in China. Luise Rainier plays Olan. She does not even look Chinese! I think she was trying to get the role, but they should have put Anna May Wong in the role. I know why they did not do that, and Ms. Rainier is very good at the movie, but they barely tried to make her look "authentic." It's still a great movie, especially if you've read the book (I did it in high school decades ago). It's a must, just look behind the casting. I think you can.
