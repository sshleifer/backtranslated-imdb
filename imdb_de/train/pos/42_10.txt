Busy Phillips performed a weird and dramatic performance. Erika Christensen was good, but Busy stole the show. It was a nice touch to The Smokers, a movie with Busy that was not great. If Busy does not get a nomination for this movie, that would be a disaster. Forget Mona Lisa Smile, see Home Room.
