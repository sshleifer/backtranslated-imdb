It's a pretty good movie, but too Americanized in its predictability. Switch the kung fu in football and the turkish family into a pakistani family member, and you'll see Bend It Like Beckham (2002) almost scene by scene. One nice feature that serves as the film's backbone is the progression of fights with the mysterious Ninja under the highway, starting with miserable losses and slow progression, until the final fight is a victory against itself, like the kung fu master on several occasions emphasized. On another level, Danish life reveals itself very differently from the image of outsiders: the non-native immigrants who make up a large part (actually the majority) of the Danish citizens, the graffiti in the suburbs of Copenhagen, the mockery of the immigrant girl begging the movie. All show a different picture than one imagines when one hears the word Denmark.
