The magnificent and underrated Marion Davies shows her things in this late (1928) silent comedy, which also features the wonderful William Haines. Davies plays a hick from Georgia, who crashes Hollywood with the help of Haines. They appear in cheap comedies until Marion is "discovered" and becomes a great dramatic star. A great lampoon about Hollywood and its ideas. Davies & Haines are a wonderful team (too bad they never did a talk together) and the guest recordings by Charlie Chaplin, Douglas Fairbanks, William S. Hart, John Gilbert, Elinor Glynn and Marion Davies (you see, it's) a scream. A must for any serious movie lover or for anyone interested in the still evil Marion Davies!
