His Hollywood imitation of daytiem soap operas at its best! It's the fun we never see. Great characters and great lines. Whoopi is funny ..... Sally Field is so exaggerated .... Gary Marshall's lines are a riot .... that's what I love about good comedy. I was never afraid to make fun of myself !!!!!! The sets were great ... the wardrobe was in a nutshell and the "Montana Morehead" was a devilish pleasure. Terri Hatcher as "Dr. Monica Demonico" did not have enough lines, but still great and funny when shown on screen. I would like to know how the idea for this film came about. I've never seen a cast of people having so much fun making comedy work! Soapdish is a must and I am waiting for the DVD !!!
