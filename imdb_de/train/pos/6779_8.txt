George Cukor leads a brooding and cynical classic. The unmistakable Ronald Coleman is best in this piece of Noir by an actor who loses himself in his roles. Acclaimed Anthony John (Colman) has driven away his wife Brita (Signe Hasso) with his strong temperament and erratic behavior. The two, however, manage to continue working together to please the audience. Things start to change when John gets bored with his career; reluctantly he agrees to play Othello. He feels like a jealous and murderous man deep in character. He begins to walk a thin line between illusion and reality, confuses his role with his own life, and finally kills his lover (Shelley Winters), but has no recollection of the deceitful act in that role. Winters is very impressive when the young woman was determined to escape her miserable life. With in the cast: Edmond O'Brien, Ray Collins, Joe Sawyer and Whit Bissell.
