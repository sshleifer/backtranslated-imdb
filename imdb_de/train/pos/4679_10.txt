Great movie with a slow start - give him the chance to cook. Story builds on interest and complexity. Characters and action undermine expectation and stereotype in the right moments. Outstanding locations in New York City - bleak, real - are a fantastic antidote to the commercial demands of "Sex in the City" - the entire film is an antidote to the HBO / Hollywood notion of New York, sex and relationships. It's a rare movie that treats its characters so honestly and compassionately. I loved it! Great cast with notable performances by Steve Buscemi, Rosario Dawson and their love interest (forgot his name!).
