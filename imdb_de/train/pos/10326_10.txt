We talk so much about cinema landmarks - Kane, The Godfather, A Bout de Souffle. However, a movie is too often overlooked by "serious" film critics. Of course I'm talking about the classic Doc Savage (M.o.B.) <br /> <br /> This film is not only exciting, but also seriously addresses the issue of the exploitation of developing countries by US imperialism. Not to mention Kung Fu. <br /> <br /> It also had the biggest soundtrack in film history (up to Queen's breathtaking work on Flash Gordon). Although it is a rarity, it pays off to search for this movie - it will pay back the effort of your search tenfold.
