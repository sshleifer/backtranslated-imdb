Terry Gilliam's stunning feature film adaptation of Chris Marker's LA JETEE short film is full of groundbreaking surprises, yet touches your heart thanks to the superb cast. Gilliam's sense of the phantasmagoric works with the script of David and Janet Peoples playing the same way as poor James Cole (Willis in his Steve McQueen-like form - even better than McQueen!). Travelers from the future, who literally do not know whether he comes or goes as a team of scientists, keep sending him back to the wrong epoch, while trying to prevent a deadly, but animal-borne, disease in 1995. Willis, who is rightfully Oscar-nominated Brad Pitt, and Madeline Stowe as a well-meaning psychiatrist show some of the best performances of her career. Even Paul Buckmaster's tango-style score is insistent. This is not a miss!
