You probably could have skipped something at the beginning - I'm not sure why this starts in the Asian part of Turkey. If it was a launch in the Mediterranean, they could have come a bit closer from what is Lebanon today. <br /> <br /> When the cameras and crews arrive at the Bakhtyari Tribe, an incredible 48-day journey begins. 50,000 people with about 250,000 goats, camels, cattle and horses make this amazing hike over the seemingly fast flowing Karun. They use rafts that are held by inflating goat skins over water - you can see where the head and legs have been removed. The other "bank" of the river was very steep - I estimate an increase of 60 degrees. <br /> <br /> It was just unbelievable to see that, but there would be much more to come. To get to the pastures, they also had to cross a large mountain that had about 4 feet of snow, if not more. To climb the mountain was amazing, but they (and all animals) climbed this mountain barefoot! Yes, barefoot. <br /> <br /> The only drawback to this documentary was some of the titles with bad jokes. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a silent movie documentary or the incredible challenges that this tribe not only faces, but wins. This is just an incredible document from a little-known group of people facing all kinds of challenges.
