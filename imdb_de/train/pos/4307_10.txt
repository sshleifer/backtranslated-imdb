Well, maybe not immediately before the Rodney King riots, but even a few months earlier, they were on time. My parents said they saw it, and next the police were acquitted and LA was burned down. It only shows the status of race relations in America. In the plot, the white Mack (Kevin Kline) and the African American Simon (Danny Glover) befriended after Simon Mack's life in the black ghetto has saved. Meanwhile, film producer Davis (Steve Martin in a serious role) says violence is really cool ... until he's shot. There is also some existentialism in the movie: Mack and his family realize they are not living the way they really want. <br /> <br /> It seems that "Crash" has aroused people's interest in race relations, but it came out much earlier. Maybe we will never have stable race relations in this country. In any case, "Grand Canyon" is a great movie. It confirms Kevin Kline as my favorite actor. With Mary McDonnell, Mary-Louise Parker and Alfre Woodard.
