Shortly after the end of World War II, Powell & Pressburger were asked to come up with something to heal the gap between Britain and the United States. At that time there were many comments that were "overpaid, oversexed and here". Somehow they came up with this masterpiece. <br /> <br /> My favorite movie of all time. It has everything. Romance, poetry, emotions, religion, drama and very quirky. <br /> <br /> I can never quite explain why, but it hits all the right buttons and although I've seen it hundreds of times (yes, really) I'm still guaranteed tears in many places. <br /> <br /> Was it the great show, the wonderful sets, the inspired script? Who knows. But look at it and you'll see what I mean.
