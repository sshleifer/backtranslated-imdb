This movie is cold, naked truth. Often we think "oh no, that will not happen to me." But it can. Drug smuggling is a big money, and often people are unknowingly (or tricked) to do anything for smugglers. The story of these two girls is the story of many young people who just wanted an exotic vacation - which became a nightmare. People need to know that this type of event is not unlikely or exaggerated - this is a big problem in today's movie society. It is very emotional and raw. It is worth seeing and will surely be remembered.
