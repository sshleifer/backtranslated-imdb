While Oliver Hardy is dominated by horns, bells, telephones and trombones, his doctor advises Finlayson to rest and to goat milk diet. Partner Stan Laurel has a great solution because he lives on a docked boat, so the salty ocean air can help Ollie get the rest he needs. It's a great premise for all the crazy cap-hijinks as the boat is being dumped by the hungry goat and an escaped convict (Richard Cramer) for the ride stands out from all the gags in the movie, starting with this shield at the Hupetest factory - "Silence, while men work ". The early story in the boys' flat reveals a series of mixed plumbing and appliance spills, with Stan making a banana inside a banana slice. Laurel has some great lines in the picture, like "We've got to be separated," but the one that got me started was his answer to the criminal on board - "self-preservation is the last law of averages" - in fact! <br /> <br /> I'm not as good a student of Laurel and Hardy's movies as many on this board. All I know is that I enjoyed her as a kid and today I find her as entertaining as they were back in my youth. In this regard, "Saps At Sea" offers a decent hour of hornophobic fun, well on the way to hornomania.
