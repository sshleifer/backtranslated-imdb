What I found so good about the film adaptation of The Stone Angel is that it has remained so faithful to the novel! Excellent movie! As an avid reader, I find the worst thing about movie adaptations is that the book somehow gets lost in translation. It can be said that the Stone Angel team was careful not to let this happen with this movie. Ellen Burstyn was an excellent casting choice for Hagar's role and she's definitely a movie superstar. However, I think the Canadian actress (Christine Horne), who chose Hagar in her younger years, has also done an incredible job that deserves a lot of praise. I have not seen anything from Horn's previous work, but I'll definitely find it out after seeing their Stone Angel performance. <br /> <br /> I heard the Canadian theatrical release of The Stone Angel in the spring or summer I can not wait to see it back on the big screen!
