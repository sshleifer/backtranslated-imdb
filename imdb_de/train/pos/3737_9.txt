First of all, this movie was a wild ride. The history of the training of the soldiers, the struggle with their superiors and finally the grouping. <br /> <br /> From start to finish. This is a war drama that should be noticed if you are constantly (sometimes overground) out on the huts of the Boot Camp. <br /> <br /> The dynamics of the actors' interaction was sometimes amazing and sometimes humorous. How Bozz (Colin Farrel) deals with Paxton (Matthew Davis) throughout the storyline, from the camp to the Tigerland, and in the end even helping to help him taste the movie. Constant movement, constant action and only constant confusion. Sometimes it was a help. Others not so much. <br /> <br /> It has become more and more realistic throughout the movie. Some points in the movie (especially the sex scenes) seemed a bit too realistic, even though they gave the film an effect that would not have been there without them. It was a very pithy movie, through and through. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this is one of Colin Farrel's better films (if not his peak performance). The spectacle for each character was outstanding. 9/10 -sysnuk3r
