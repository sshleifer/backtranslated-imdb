Well, I was not sure what the movie would look like, as I had only seen a small clip, but I thought it would be fine, and I was right, I saw it twice the day I saw it got, and now it is my favorite movie. <br /> <br /> I think Alison Lohan has played the role of Beth really well. She is such a grateful actress, and the author must have gone into research to learn about bulimia, although the end, when Beth is in hospital, there are two Horus observations after meals, because iv was told that 1 House is ok, and that also hospitals do not help, as iv was said, which is probably the reason why i'm still at home, although my sister and mother would gladly do this to take me to the hospital because i Have bulimia, but this is a movie that I can recommend. I recommend it to anyone with or without an eating disorder or to people who know someone with eating disorders, as he can introduce them into the life of a bulimia person and see the world as they go a little bit over the whole movie, and I recommend it to everyone and everyone every type of person
