This Columbo episode is probably referred to more for director Steven Spielberg than one of his early films. It should be considered as Jack Cassidy's role as a murderer who kills his partner in writing to sustain his lifestyle. Jack Cassidy would appear in a later Columbo. After all, Columbo meets Jack Cassidy's character. He is a mystery writer who does the perfect murder. After his first murder, the next victim would be the annoying shopkeeper / widow, who would blackmail him for money. Instead of losing more money, he kills her. It is very entertaining to see Cassidy and Falk as always. Falk's familiarity as Columbo makes him visible after seeing this episode repeatedly over the years. What TV today forgets about the success of the years is that people like to watch the shows again and again when they like the characters. It's not about who, how and why, but about Columbo's familiarity and his sympathy, which is so important to audiences like me.
