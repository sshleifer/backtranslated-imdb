If you are not in the mood for more than an hour of film, this movie could provide a change. What I love are the constant surprises. Not just once, you want one or more of the short films in 'New York, I Love You' to continue. Yes, some of the short films not make you curious, some very short, some longer, some have a particular end, others. <br /> <br /> Most stories are presented on the sad side of the capital. It shows many different nationalities. In many cases, it feels as if I would have gone again for a year in a capital in other countries, where many people from different countries attended. In this film, many kinds of things are examined, you may already know, but for all the characters, it is something new. Perhaps some of you have traveled abroad alone to stay a year or two to feel something new, meet new people; feel dreamy you sad, but kind of sad, you seek, because it is simply boring, that you were in your own home. You may want to relive it by watching this.
