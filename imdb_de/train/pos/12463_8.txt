Nora is a single mother of two children who still wants to live the life of a young artist in the 1970s, as well as her friends, a group of writers, singers and actors. The "Free Love" philosophy is not entirely out of the system. and Nora did not expect to fall in love, especially a junkie. Hazlehurst won her first of two AFI Awards in four years for her amazing performance of Nora, who makes sure she does the right thing for her kids, but at the same time falls in love with junkie Javo (Friels). Garner ?? Who would later in movies like LOVE AND OTHER DISASTERS and STRANGE PLANET Costar ?? is well staffed as Nora's Pre-pubescent daughter, and Caton (perhaps ready for his role as host of the HOT PROPERTY lifestyle program in 2000 ???) appears as a bearded painter. Early efforts by director Cameron are a winner; He made the award-winning miniseries MY BROTHER JACK a later project. But it is the breathtaking delivery of Hazlehurst that brings to life the intelligent, searching script based on Helen Garner's award-winning novel.
