Fans of the HBO series "Tales From the Crypt" will love this MOH episode. Those who know the basic archetypal stories on which most classic EC comics are based will immediately recognize them. <br /> <br /> Underrated indie favorite Martin Donovan (also an excellent author - co-writer of The Scenarios for APARTMENT ZERO and DEATH is becoming a guy everyone can look good on or he can play the same role with a creepy undertone of caustic sloppiness - in the case of RIGHT TO DIE, he adopts the latter approach and it definitely works - Donovan is a doctor who recently had an affair with his nasty Office workers (Robin Sydney) have been displeased with his heartbroken, unforgiving spouse Abbey (Julia Anderson), who gets involved in an awful car accident from an unsuccessful make-up weekend and is terribly burned in a fire Pulling on her, not without an enthusiastic kick of his still slippery nature lawyer and best buddy (Corbin Bernsen, which looks increasingly bad these days). <br /> <br /> But Abbey has never given up without a fight, and this is where the EC theme of the episode comes into play. Cuckolded husbands - and wives - have always been the favorite subject of the genre for some weird (and OOKY) supernatural phenomena, and this case is definitely no exception. If anything, Bill Gaines in his mausoleum must rush somewhere for the high quotient of sex and screaming. <br /> <br /> And that's not to mention that John Esposito's original writing makes the adultery angle only slightly twist. You do not know, as you can see, that you only know half of the story until just before the end ... (Think WHAT LIES, with more guts and gazongas, and you are there.) <br /> <br Not bad, but not the best. At least Rob Schmidt shows some flair here and there with the direction, especially in a scene that makes mobile picture messaging a truly gruesome experience! As with most MOH episodes, this episode follows a prevalent theme in this season of skinning and fragmentation, so they must be extremely squeamish.
