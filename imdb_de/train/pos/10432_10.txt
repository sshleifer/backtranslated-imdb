I have to admit that at first I was a little reserved because I saw this movie. I thought it was this stupid little romantic movie about a French woman who meets an American on the train and decides to visit Vienna with him. I was not really excited about this kind of script because I'm convinced it's just a movie. Nevertheless, I have seen it! And I was amazed ... "Before Sunrise" is one of the few films that dare to speak in a more philosophical way, and wonders that we are sentenced to death at the moment of our birth, or that it is The idea is that a couple should rest together for eternity, or that sometimes we humans can afford to live in fairy tales. <br /> <br /> The end was wonderfully chosen (we do not know whether they will meet again in six months at the Vienna train station in six months) - in our optimism we sincerely hope so. The actors acted very well, so I started to believe that I could live a love story myself.
