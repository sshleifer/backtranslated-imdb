The Gangster genre is now a worn topic that is too often parodied. In retrospect, the series is a culmination of earlier stereotypes used in their genre. Fortunately, the authors created this mistake with a realism applied to it. The sopranos are an epic criminal story that illustrates their content with psychological depth, characterized by subtle nuances, humor and unvarnished violence. The main protagonist Tony Soprano is feared by his crew as a dangerous general deprived of fear and moral values. However, Tony is the one of two persons who is beastly while the other conflicts with guilt and disgust. Without any inhibitions or contradictions, I still firmly believe that The Sopranos has the best cast of recent years. All in all, I could give the series a detailed explanation, but I will not. If there is even a visual dictionary in global consumer research, look for those definitions, vital, ambiguous, unyielding, epic, uncompromising, and the fragmented face of the sopranos will smile back at you.
