For all Has-Beens or Never Was's or Curious, this movie is for you ... Have you ever played a sport or wondered what it feels like after the lights go out and the spectators leave? This movie explores that and more. <br /> <br /> Robin Williams (Jack Dundee) is a small-town banker in Taft, CA, whose life was plagued by a miscue in a BIG rival high school football game 13 years ago. He dropped the pass, the Bakersfield , his arch rival, who hammered the Taft Rockets season after season. Kurt Russell (Reno Hightower) was the quarterback in this famous game and is the local legend who is now a van repair specialist whose life in lethargy fades like the city Taft itself. <br /> <br /> Williams gets an idea to redo the story by repeating the GAME! He encounters skeptical resistance, so he makes a one-man terrorist spree and literally paints the city, orange, yellow and black, to arouse the wrath of the denizens to create the game. After this success, the players from this 1972 team reunite and try to get in shape, which is hysterical. The game is running, Bakesfield is equipped with all the high-tech equipment, game strategies and sophisticated training routines. Taft draws games in the mud, with sticks, stones and bottle caps, what a rebellion! If Taft overcomes the odds, does Robin Willians clean the demons out of his guts, does Kurt Russell rise from the lethargy? See "The Best of Times" for one of the best visual experiences of all time! <br /> <br /> One of Robin Williams best UNDERSTATED achievements, the chemistry between Robin and Russell is magical. And who is Kid Lester? <br /> <br /> Holly Palance and Pamela Reed give memorable performances as wives of Williams and Russell. Success on many levels. A 10!
