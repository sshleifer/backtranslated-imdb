This is the ultimate one man show where Eddie Murphy is at his best. Just forget about the crazy professor and the distinguished gentlemen, this is the real Eddie Murphy. His imitations of Mr. T. (pretending to be gay), Michael Jackson and other artists are murderers. I think it's also risky to make fun of artists who were very popular back then. My favorite act is the one in which he plays with the family every year at BBQ and plays his drunken father and his aunt Bunny who falls off the stairs. If you see the sequel "Raw", you will not be disappointed. It's also pretty good, but it does not fit 'Delirious'.
