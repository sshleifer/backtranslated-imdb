"Elvira, Mistress of the Dark" is a kind of "Harper Valley P.T.A." with touches of the supernatural. Elvira (Cassandra Peterson) is leaving her job as a TV horror movie presenter after the owner of the new station has freshened up with her. She now relies on a Las Vegas show to pull her off, but learns she has to spend more money to start the show. Things look hopeless to raise this money until she learns of the death of her aunt, who then brings Elvira to Massachusetts to read the will. A house to repair, a dog, and a cookbook are all things left to her by her aunt, and again it seems Elvira is struggling to get the money for the Las Vegas show. The adults of the small and narrow-minded city aggravate the situation for Elvira. Only the local guy (Daniel Greene) and a group of teenagers will make friends with her. Elvira's uncle "Vinnie" (W. Morgan Sheppard) is pushing to make a deal with Elvira for the cookbook, but Elvira is soon learning about her powerful legacy that includes magic and some very effective casseroles. Elvira no longer wants to sell the cookbook to her uncle, but he is determined to get it in the knowledge of his power. Elvira then sees herself burned at the stake when the city's old witchcraft and showdown took place between her and her uncle. The plot is pretty simple, but the humor and the well-developed characters make for a good pace. "Elvira, Mistress Of The Dark" is full of cute, coarse, bawdy and smart humor that is carried by the many visual gags, puns, props, songs and parodies. The occult touches of the film make this one of the best horror parodies ever made. It's a well-made movie with a great spectacle of all actors; including Edie McClurg and Jeff Conaway (from "Grease"). There are also beautiful special effects. Many people (including myself) wondered if the Elvira character could wear a movie, and the answer is adorable: YES!
