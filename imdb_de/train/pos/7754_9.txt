However the wind blows, Tom Barmans (also known as the frontman of the rock band 'dEUS') is his debut film. The film was shot entirely in Antwerp, Belgium, and starts on a sunny Friday morning. Between the events that fill the day of a dozen main characters, the films are superficially skipped. When the movie is over, you have a lot to talk about, as most storylines stay open. <br /> <br /> The film features a (purely instrumental) soundtrack that will delight you socks. In most scenes, the music really enhances the overall atmosphere and feel, making the movie really hallucinatory at certain times. The main scene of the film, the party, is filmed very well. <br /> <br /> The director did not hesitate to use video clip techniques as his main characters danced on one of the best soundtracks I've ever heard. <br /> <br /> The script is great stuff. Camera angle and colors are very well chosen. The "costumes" are very hot and also very "seventies". And I loved most of the acting time. <br /> <br /> What I liked most about the film are the subtle accents of absurd, surreal, very dry or even cynical humor that nests. <br /> <Without calling itself a comedy (this movie is certainly not a comedy, but an alternative work of art), he still manages to giggle his audience and sometimes even to laughter. <br /> <br /> This is another directorial debut that should not be over. I hope to see more Tom Barman movies in the future because I had a good time. Cheers.
