In this movie, you may think that this movie is for kids only. Well, it's mostly focused on them, but it's also good enough with the jokes that are also directed at the adults in the audience. This time, the Muppet gang is trying to reach Broadway. The bad corridors prevent them from producing them and lead them to separation. But Kermit does not stop, and his determination keeps things moving until he gets hit by a car and gets put into amnesia! <br /> <br /> It is partly a broadcast of the old star cars from the 40s, whose musical is actually the subject of a musical. Only here is the usual amount of zaniness and wonderful moments lumped together by hysterically funny moments (Lou Seabird's boomerang fish, Gonzo's water stub display, the whispering action, etc.), but also with a lot of heart. The Muppet writers do not shy away from the conventions, on the contrary, they hug them to the point where it's almost refreshing to see such a "let's do a show" story in which they get theirs through the thick and thoughtful characters To find a dream. <br /> <br /> Although not quite as original as the Muppet movie, it has many catchy and memorable songs, excellent locations throughout Manhattan, and even some intonation of inter-species dating (and marriage)! The cameos include Liza Minneli ("a frog?"), Elliot Gould (as a cop), Brooke Shields (proposed by a rat), Edward I. Koch, Gregory Hines, and Joan Rivers. So get ready to sing along or just have fun and romantic (yes, romantic) times with one of the best Muppet movies.
