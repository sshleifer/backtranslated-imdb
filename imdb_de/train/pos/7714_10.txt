There were many sci-fi movies of the 50s. They were big draws for the drive-in theater. Many were crappy even then. This film and "The Day the Earth Stood Still" are outstanding, and both have aged well in their own way. Forbidden Planet takes you from the beginning with its sinister Theremin music (which still sounds funny as Theremins are barely used) to the place where no one has ever been before. Speaking of Star Trek: There is so much material in this movie that came in Star Trek TOS like a pilot for the series. from the interactive captain / first officer / doctor, the crazy scientist, extraterrestrial beings, baby in short skirt, computer intelligence; It is all de rigueur now but that was the first of its kind. In addition, it has good acting and well-made works of art that evoke a certain reverence for the images even today. Consider how the huge Krell machine is successfully displayed with some depth. I saw this as a kid (when driving in: 0) when it was a new movie and it scared me. Of course, any movie that was vaguely scary was made at that time, but I remember that I was really worried about the invisible monster. Forbidden Planet is a movie that a science fiction fan can watch several times and find something new with each ad.
