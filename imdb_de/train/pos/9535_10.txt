Road to Perdition, a movie that was overlooked undeservedly this year. Oscars is the second work by Sam Mendes (and in my opinion, his best work), a director who won the Oscar for his much acclaimed but controversial American Beauty three years ago. This is a terrific movie and at the same time ultimately poignant and sad. <br /> <br /> It is a relatively wealthy and happy family that expressed itself in difficult times of depression when, Michael Sullivan, a father of two, played by the great Tom Hanks (I am not his admirer, but should say), is a hitman for the local mafia boss, played by Paul Newman. His eldest son, a thirteen-year-old boy, Michael Sullivan Jr., who is perfectly played by young Tyler Hoechlin, learns after years of blissful ignorance what his father is and what money the family lives on. Through his curiosity and his desire to learn the truth, he accidentally witnesses a murder committed by John Rooney, his father's son. This discovery hits an innocent soul and caused numerous events that changed his life forever. The atmosphere of this time, all the backgrounds and decorations are perfectly created, cut and film are almost flawless, while the story is well written. But the main line of the film, the key moments and points of the film and the key factor in film success are difficult father-son relationships in bad times. They are so deep, strong and believable. Tom Hanks is excellent and has one of the best achievements of his career in an unusual role for him and acting at all levels is outstanding. Finally, a very nice result by Paul Newman, and as a result, we get a great job from everyone involved in this beautiful (but sad) masterpiece. I believe that Road to Perdition is one of the greatest accomplishments of this decade's filmmaking and is undoubtedly one of the best films of the year. <br /> <br /> My grade 10 out of 10
