In a nutshell, this is one of the most amazing and intense films I've seen in a long time. The first movie in years that absolutely put me off. I could hardly feel out of the theater, I was so overwhelmed. <br /> <br /> I've been staring at the screen for about fifteen minutes trying to describe the power of this film simply failing to highlight some aspects of it - the documentary-style video diary format, the relentless portrayal of events, the power of the characters - seems to trivialize everything. Some find it ridiculous that every murderer could be called normal. But then not all the killers who froth lunatics at the mouth swarm. Many are quite regular, modest people. They are simply wired differently. <br /> <br /> And that's perhaps the coolest thought of all.
