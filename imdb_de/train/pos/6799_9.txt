This episode is a bit confusing. Some people say that you have to start from the beginning, but I have to say that I was a bit confused from the start. Clark gets hit on the head and wakes up on the grounds of Fairview Mental Institution and makes fun of being a superhero. Clark is told that the life he knew was all in his head. Delusional He also finds some unusual things: Martha is married to Lionel; Lex is confined to a wheelchair after an accident on the bridge. His limbs are cut off. and Lana is dedicated to Clark. But he finds a familiarity; someone else dedicated to Clark: Chloe. He also thinks that a mental patient comes from the familiar world of Smallville. And the doctor is a refugee from the phantom zone. <br /> <br /> This episode reminds me of a Buffy episode called "Normal Again" in which Buffy has vivid daydreams about a madhouse. The doctor tried to convince her that everything she knew was a fantasy of her imagination and that she was actually crazy. Her parents were still married, they still lived in LA, her friends did not exist, Angel was never her boyfriend and she had no sister named Dawn. Demons and vampires did not exist either. Both episodes are a bit sad because the doctors not only tell the characters that this is all a fantasy of their imagination, but it tells us what it really is: fiction and brings us back to reality. It's nice to have a sense of reality from time to time, but we see these shows escape reality. It's nice again because the characters have to master new challenges.
