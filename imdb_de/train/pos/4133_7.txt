An incredible little English movie for so many reasons. First, it's a rare look that Laurence Olivier sees in a light comedy. Although his performance did not meet the standards he would set as one of the greatest actors of the 20th century, he is absolutely the credible lawyer. Historically, this movie is of great interest because of the location and shooting. As an Englishman, he did not have the big budget of Hollywood films of the same era and often shows it, but more interesting is the fact that this film was shot just before the war and shows an England that would soon be gone. When we see it today, we think in terms of modern morality and watch that this film and its closest American counterpart, "It Happened One Night," were as risky in their day as "Fatal Instinct" in our time. But having seen and enjoyed this movie for the first time, I can not help being sad when I look at it today. Since half of the filming was done before 1950, saving the remainder of the film makes difficult decisions, and unfortunately films like this one are often handed over to save films that are important to us all. The color shift, the lack of contrast and the generally poor quality of the print are heartbreaking. This movie together with "It Happened One Night" is perfect for sneaking up and watching a cool night with a sweet love under a blanket, or better still, why not a double movie.
