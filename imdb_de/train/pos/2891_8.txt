We saw this last night on ABC in "The Wonderful World of Disney," and I came to the conclusion that things must be closer than usual on "The Mouse." <br /> <br /> Since this movie only lasted 74 minutes and they had to be set to 2 hours of air time, they had, and I do not mind, commercial breaks that lasted 6 to 7 minutes. And during these commercial breaks, there was another ad in the form of a "TV show" hosted by the oh so annoying Kelly Rippa, who vociferously proclaimed the magical wonders of "Cinderella 2: Dreams Come True." <br /> <Again and again, pause for break, Disney took the time to tell us, the faithful spectators, that we needed a copy of the sequel. Thank you, Disney, for making us a successor to your beloved movie jewel. <br /> <br /> Despite all this commercialization and the call to the box office, making the movie "Cinderella" as a movie made it a difficult task, because when the commercials were over, I forgot where the story had ended. <br /> <br /> But the original "Cinderella" still keeps its magic of course The story is still good, although we've seen it all countless times. It's a shame they had to cheapen it with all the marketing to be a lame follower.
