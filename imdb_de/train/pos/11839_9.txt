This movie was very entertaining. The soundtrack (Bian Adams) is just beautiful and inspiring. Even more impressive is that Brian Adams also does all the songs in French. The result is also uplifting and dramatic. <br /> <br /> The film is a mixture of traditional animations and computer-generated images. The result is really stunning. I watch this movie at least once a week with my kids and we do not tire. The story is captivating and well told. <br /> <br /> I do not understand anyone who rated this movie as less than 7.
