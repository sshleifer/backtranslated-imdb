This movie is breathtakingly beautiful. Goldsworthy's art really benefits from the medium of film, because you can see art at its best, move, change and blossom. I highly recommend this movie to anyone. I can not imagine anything else. It's just the kind of movie you MUST see because it's so visually appealing and refreshing when I left the theater.
