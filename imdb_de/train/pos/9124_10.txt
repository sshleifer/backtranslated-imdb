Bar some of the questionable acting (there musicians at the end of the day), this is in the words of Quentin Tarrinno "The best rock movie of all time ... period" <br /> <br /> Think 8 Mile, but without the knock - a young musician trying to prove himself to the local community while struggling with a broken home and a rival band. The sex interest and the really extraordinary achievements are the 8 kilometers. Prince offers a solid performance, as does Morris Day and Jerome Benton. Decent script, good direction, great plot and spectacular performances. Not to mention the best rock / pop / funk music you'll ever hear.
