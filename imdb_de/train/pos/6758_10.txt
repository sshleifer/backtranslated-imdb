Where the sidewalk ends (1950) <br /> <br /> Where one ends, another begins <br /> <br /> This is a prototypical film noir, and as such pretty flawless in terms of style and content prospect. The settings for photography and night are top notch (cinematographer Joseph LaShelle pervades the drama scene by scene) and the close-ups of faces of pure expressionism. I can watch this kind of movie for the visuals alone, even if the actors have difficulties and the action stinks. <br /> <br /> But acting is top notch here, and the plot contains what I believe to be the core of most noir films, the alienated male lead role (which represents the many men who went to war after the war) changed United States return) feeling lost). In fact, Dana Andrews is not only convincing as a concerned solitary detective, he has a small but important counterpart in the film, the (first) husband of the lead actress, a garnished ex-GI who has fallen into trouble and drinks alcohol , The fact that one man kills the other could be of monumental value, overall - the normal man who struggles to succeed through his inner problems, while the Order-carrying soldier sinks in his head with an accidental death with a silver plate in his head. The woman changes from one to the other - we assume that they marry and have children, as suggested in the film. Even if this postpones an interpretation, we can still see the path of a man with psychological baggage who leads through a crisis to the highest kind of moral order - and turns to a small crime at that point in fact he has gotten away with it. <br /> <br /> This movie belongs to Andrews. He plays a more restrained and moving type than Kirk Douglas in a similar role in William Wyler's Detective Story, made just a year later, and Andrews is certainly less theatrical. You can easily see both movies side by side for a comparison between textbooks and contrast. The fact that Andrews, as Detective Dixon, morally struggles through all aspects, and Douglas as Detective McLeod, could explain why one man gets his girl and the other does not. Gene Tierney pulls out a very likable, condescending and ultimately conventional and "pretty" woman - not just a box that's desirable, but someone Dixon actually wants to marry. <br /> <br /> The criminal plot is secondary to the main drama, but it's effective enough in playing with types and clich√©s. The chisel parts are snappy, the little details (like the wearable Craps table) are nice, far from the character actors or the glamor of gambling in Casablanca. But Curtiz 's great film is also iconic in the details - it does not strive to be subtle and real and pervasive, but is rousing and memorable and inspiring. They arrive at opposite ends of the war and present conflicting possibilities for their leading men. Bogart begins his active task, Dixon, and the man Dixon has killed is through. Through, thoroughly, but not flushed. <br /> <br /> It is no coincidence that many, perhaps most, movie noirs have what you would call "happy" endings. The man overcomes his adversaries and transforms his inner self, and the moviegoer understands then and now how beautiful that must feel.
