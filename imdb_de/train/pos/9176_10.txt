This review comes almost 30 years too late. However, it must be mentioned that I saw a copy of this film in early 2008 and reviewed it for four months. I just had to write about it! I fell in love and forgot that something else existed when I saw this movie. How ironic it is to see the ugliest male protagonist of Literature portrayed by the most beautiful man! What a welcome irony! It was perfect for me because Timothy Dalton lived up to his role. He has shown an amazing and triumphant achievement! I've never seen anything like it! All other actors are also very good. The whole movie was beautifully put together. I do not care what anyone says about this movie. I love it and love it! It made me happy and satisfied. It crushes me a little when I say that, but I prefer Jane Eyre in 1983 to A & E's P & J, which I believe is the ultimate mini-series. <br /> <br /> The excerpts from Jane Eyre scared me a bit at school. I never got around to reading the book seriously and knowing the story so well. When I saw this particular production, the story came to life for me and drove me insane. The scenes and Mr. Dalton's voice chased me endlessly, eventually leading me to read the book seriously, which of course is a masterpiece. Bravo to the whole team and especially to Mr. Dalton !! This movie is now a part of me. <br /> <br /> I give him 10/10.
