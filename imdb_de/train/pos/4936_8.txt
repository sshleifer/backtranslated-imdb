When a stiff man with a lung plague (a variant of bubonic plague) shows up, the representative of the United States Health Service, dr. Clinton Reed (Richard Widmark), immediately anyone he knows to be near the body. Unfortunately, the stiffness of murder has come this way and there is a good chance that the killer will spread the plague and cause an epidemic. Enter the police captain Tom Warren (Paul Douglas), who is urged to locate the killer as quickly as possible and avert a potential national disaster. <br /> <br /> Panic in the Streets is a quality film, but it suffers a bit unfocused and a bit too spacious (my reason to reduce the score to eight). It ranges from noirish gangsters to medical disasters, police procedures, thrillers and romance. <br /> <br /> This is not the best work by director Elia Kazan, but the claim is a bit insincere. Kazan is the hero who is masterpieces such as A Streetcar Named Desire (1951), On The Waterfront (1954) and East of Eden (1955). This movie is older than this, but Kazan said he was "untied" by the studio. Taking this freedom too far can partly explain its spread. The film takes place in New Orleans, a city where Kazan wandered "day and night so I knew it well". He wanted to use the environment. "It's so great and colorful, I wanted boats, steam engines, warehouses, jazz joints - all in New Orleans." <br /> <br /> Kazan can handle any genre of Panic in the Streets well, but they could be better connected. The movie would have benefited if it had stuck to one or two of its moods. The expansion in terms of attitude would have worked. Part of the dilemma could have been caused by the fact that panic in the streets was an attempt to bring together two stories by the writers Edna and Edward Anhalt, "Quarantine" and "Some Like 'Em Cold". <br /> <br /> The gangster material that ends up in the thriller area at the end of the movie with a lengthy chase scene is probably the highlight. Not surprisingly, Kazan said he believes that the bad guys are "more colorful - I've never had much affection for the good guys anyway, I do not like Puritans". A brief second is the only material that approaches the title's "panic" - the discovery of the plague and the attempts to track down, to vaccinate and to control the disease. While there's a lot of tension between these two "moods", a lot of the movie is also a pretty straightforward drama, with the tempo more typical of this genre. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is consistently excellent. The stylistic difference to many modern films could hardly be more pronounced. It's smart, it's delivered quickly and displayed well by every character. Conflict is not caused by "stupid" decisions, but clever moves; Events and characters Actions are more like a game of chess. When unusual positions are taken, as Reed holds back the plague in the papers, he makes relatively long justifications for his decisions that other characters are arguing about. <br /> <br /> In the light of this, it is interesting that Kazan believed "decency, religion, ethics and the middle class are murdering us all". This idea infiltrates the film by removing from it the protagonist's changes to the standard or allowances. For example, Headgangster Blackie (Jack Palance in his first film role) is offered a "Get Out of Jail Free" card when he will cooperate in the fight against the plague. <br /> <br /> The technical aspects of the film are fine, if not extraordinary, but the real reasons are the performances, the fascinating scenario and the well-written dialogue.
