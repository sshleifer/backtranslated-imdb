The tweed professor types said they had found out everything. Today's peoples, who inhabit Polynesia, are descended from migratory Asians and tirelessly migrated from the Far East, island to island, east to Tahiti, and all the other exotic tropical islands of the South Pacific over thousands of years. However, the established thinking was not good with the young Norwegian ethnographer Thor Heyerdahl. If this explanation were true, then why did some of the people born and raised on these islands have traditions, works of art, and physical characteristics not resembling Asia but South America? What can the vegetation of Ecuador, Peru and Chile look like you would find on the island thousands of miles away? Is it just a coincidence that the islanders point to South America at sea and say that their ancestors came here, led by Tiki, their counterpart to Adam? In the meantime, how do the Norwegians speak of Scandanavian progenitors expelled from the South American continent that they had colonized, and head west across the Western Sea along with some friendly Native Americans? It's all too much to be a coincidence for Heyerdahl. An expedition begins with an amazing amount of moxies, a handful of crewmembers, and local know-how for traditional raft building. It is a journey into human imagination as well as a pseudoscientific demonstration that such a journey is possible only with the basics of tools and sailor art. The Oscar-winning documentary may be dated in its tone and its Anglo-ethnocentric approach, but proves to be more adventurous and even surpasses the space program launched a decade later, as men are willing to risk everything to gain a theory Testing that they think is true. Wonderful Do yourself a favor and read the book first. It's an amazing page break and the perfect setup for the movie in the newspaper style.
