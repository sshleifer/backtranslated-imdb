Reese Witherspooon's first film. I loved it. The plot and the acting were first class. They are emotionally engaged with the characters. In my opinion a must. <br /> <br /> After watching this movie, you'll see why Reese Witherspoon's acting career has been so successful. <br /> <br /> The other performers also do a great job. <br /> <br /> The movie is extremely good. There is no boring moment in the whole picture. The man in the length of the moon is just right. <br /> <br /> As I said before, I think this movie was excellent. I have seen it many times and have enjoyed each of the tours.
