This was by far the best war documentation ever made. From the beginning of the first episode, Sir Laurence Olivier described the terrible events in Oradour-Sur-Glane: "The day the soldiers came". In the last days of the war, when the mushroom clouds appeared over Japan, I never missed a second of this classic series, and I remember them well, though it was shown back in 1974. Every aspect of this tragedy has been treated in detail. This series should be mandatory for as many of the world's children as possible so that the tragedy of World War II is not repeated, and bigotry, hatred, greed, and intolerance are not confused with patriotism or religious zeal.
