China O'Brien (1990) was an attempt to make Cynthia Rothrock a star in the United States. This Golden Harvet production was directed by veteran director Robert Clouse. Unfortunately, he was either lucky with Enter the Dragon or lost contact because he is not such a good director. The only reason to watch this movie is the martial arts of Mrs. Rothrock and Richard Norton. If shot under the direction of Corey Yuen or Hoi Meng, this film might have been an action classic rather than a cheesy action movie with direct video. China O'Brien returns home to help her father. He has problems with the local mob and he needs their help. So she returns home and restores order (with the help of two unlikely people). But will they be enough to overthrow Mr. Big and his evil friends? <br /> <br /> If you're a big Cynthia Rothrock fan, then this movie is for you. I only enjoyed the fighting scenes, everything else is garbage. Why did not Raymond Chow take off some shekels and hire a top-notch action director? <br /> <br /> Recommended.
