It took me a while to look at this version, because unfortunately I can not rent it in the video library, just the other version, but I fell in love with it. I was always at the border with the other Emma. Gwenneth and Toni Collette, since they are not British, naturally have to set their tone, and that does not seem natural to me. It seems to get dressed. I'm sorry, but do not think that Toni and Gwenneth did a great job there. I could not get used to any of the characters, but this version is more heartwarming and more the kind of person I imagined Emma. It's definitely the version that I'll come back to from now on. I was disappointed that Mr. Knightley did not look better, but he convinced. I also like Jane Fairfax better (played by Olivia Williams). I never warmed to her in the movie version, but she's better portrayed in this version. Think about it (except Mr. Knightley) that all characters are better played and much less exaggerated. Unfortunately, both came out at about the same time and the Paltrow version became more popular. Too bad ...... I also love the new scene at the end. Well done to Kate Beckingsale! So if you're a fan of Jane Austen, do not forget to see this one.
