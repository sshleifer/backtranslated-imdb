I'm not a fan of recent movies, but it was a real pleasure to see them. Adults and children could watch it together - how unusual! My aunt liked it too. It had laughter, tears, love, adventure, special effects, good actors - and a talking parrot. It reminded me of a favorite, the Wizard of Oz. Hero Paulie, an intelligent parrot, is separated from his home and his family and goes through many adventures, temptations and disappointments, always clinging to his decision to find his girlfriend Marie , Highly recommended.
