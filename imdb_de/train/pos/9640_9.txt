Most Hollywood movies do not capture the full range of teenage experiences. This movie shows exactly how it's done right. It combines elements of humor, suffering, rebellion etc. in a way that is complex and sympathetic. The ending could be a bit clearer, but the fact that the director does not phrase everything for you before he comes to a conclusion means that this film will take on a smarter viewer.
