The New Batman Adventures (also known as Gotham Knights) takes place 5 years after the latest episodes of Batman: the Animated Series (B: TAS) and aired for only 24 episodes. This is not a terrible show, but it just is not as good as the original Batman Animated Series. I start with all the things that I did not feel very good. <br /> <br /> First, the animation itself: long and sweet, Gotham is no longer dark, the sky is always bright red and orange, B: TAS did too, but it was drawn on a dark palate. If the color of the sky is ominous, in this show the color of the sky is too bright. It looks like any other children's show and does not seem to be unique like Batman: TAS with its dark, cool art on Gotham. The art style is fine, but does not remind me anymore of Batman. Each character consists of straight lines, squares, and triangles, making the characters less human. In the original series (B: TAS), the characters are more like drawn versions of real people. The animation may be more consistent here than in B: TAS, but it's definitely not that good. <br /> <br /> Next: Some of the episodes seem to be too stupid and childish, but some of the issues are even more pronounced than in B: TAS (two-face attempt to kill Tim Drake / Robin 2, and Some villains are treated rather harshly, which leads me to my next point. <br /> <br /> As this will happen in the future, as in the recent episodes of the Batman Animated Universe, many villains will find their end or for Venom ivy apparently drowns when a cruise ship explodes, Two-Face nearly kills Penguin, Killer Croc, and himself, so he's moved to Arkham forever, Joker falls into the exhaust tower of an industrial plant (though later in the Justice Catwoman moves to France and leaves Batman, etc ... Just because the series ends does not mean they have to get rid of some great characters! The bad guys' motives are also pretty bad are not! In B: TAS we learn that these villains are mentally tormented and their lives are ruined. That's why they act the way they do. In this show, the bad guys only commit crimes to advance the story. It's as if Batman does not even care to save the sanity that's left in the people he fights against, he just beats them senselessly. This Batman is a colder and meaner version of the character, but since he has been doing this job for years, I can see why he is so tough. <br /> <br /> Next, the redesigned character models: they are terrible. Gordon slim at 100 pounds ... is he sick? Many villains look like STUPID (Joker, Riddler, Catwoman, Mr. Freeze, Mad Hatter and Killer Croc are among the worst). However, I think some characters look better (Bane, Scarecrow, Batgirl). Harley is about the same and Ivy (who is even hotter now) has bright green skin. <br /> <br /> With the series that has many flaws, some episodes are great, Girls Night Out, Old Wounds, Dark Knight Legends and Never Fear are my favorites in my opinion. All crossovers with Batman in the Superman Animated Series were great as well. <br /> <br /> The absolute SPIRITUAL part of this show is, as the makers say, that they love the animation of this series more than the original. The DVD features of the original Batman animated series talk about how proud they were of the art style and how hard some characters were to animate, but in the end they managed to do so (the difficult animation needed to animate Clayface). , On the DVD features of the New Batman Adventures, the creators basically say, "To hell with B: TAS, this is a fresh, new Rebamp, looks better and we love how we almost ruined the series!" (Okay, that's an exaggeration). If the creators take off the amazing art style of B: TAS, that really annoyed me! <br /> <br /> It's not a bad show, but I still do not like it so much as the original cartoon. At least the show does not appeal to the audience, so I still recommend it. Although some of the episodes of this new series are fantastic and worth watching. <br /> <br /> Superman: the Animated Series and Justice League: The Animated Series are great follow-up shows to Batman: The Animated Series and The New Batman Adventures. So take a look at a watch.
