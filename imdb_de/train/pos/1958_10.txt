I've heard that Madonna was briefly considered for Catherine Tremell's role. Madonna is too crude and farmerish compared to Sharon Stone. She is not even close. <br /> <br /> EVIL INCARNATE: Sharon Stone has gotten a bit older, despite the improvement in modern chemistry and surgery. But she artfully treats us to a frightening personification of evil beyond salvation. In the obligatory sex scene she projects pure, crystalline lust. Especially her hooded eyes and a face flat with pleasure. Thanks to the brilliant use of light and other stage techniques, the hard age lines only occasionally manifest themselves. It seems to have a light golden glow (YES, YEARS). <br /> <br /> The locations gave us a glimpse of London, a welcome departure from the usual London landscapes. The Catherine character is so powerful and threatening that I thank my happy stars that our paths have never crossed. I would not have had a chance. <br /> <br /> THE ORIGINAL BASIC INSTINCT; ATTEMPTS AT CENSORSHIP: I have to comment briefly on the original film from 1992 playing in San Francisco, a beautiful city that deserves this movie. It's great, from the music to the locations to the sets and so on. Paul Verhoven drew impressive performances from the cast and the crew. <br /> <br /> That the main bathroom was a woman did not escape the Bay Area gay lesbian activist investigation. Censorship attempts were vehemently rejected. SWELLING. These philosophical pygmies demanded editorial scrutiny over the script and insisted on re-writing to promote their political and psychiatric agendas. Example: On charges of sexuality and misogyny they demanded to change the main role of BAD GIRL to BAD GUY. <br /> <br /> In places in San Francisco, the gentle, tolerant activists have done their best to sabotage the filming of the scenes with noise, flashing lights and other tactics. The executive producers, Mario Kassar and Andrew Vajna, promised to fight all efforts to curtail the artistic freedom guaranteed in our democracy, and obtained injunction against the disruptive tactics. <br /> <br /> BLOWBACK: Thanks to the brilliant activists, the film received a lot of attention in the press - millions of dollars worth of free advertising. Calls for viewers to boycott the film led to a backlash that led to customers waiting to see where the film was being shot. It was also widely welcomed critically. In the words of the reptilian Hackett in NETWORK it says: "A GREAT HIT!" Sorry, dear reader. I just could not resist that. Yes, it's fun. <br /> <br /> In conclusion I believe that both BASIC INSTINCT 1 and 2 with their brilliant music notes, aesthetics and acting are works of art <br /> <br /> worthy of protection under our constitution.
