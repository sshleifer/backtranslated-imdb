I found the FBI story entertaining and appropriately optimistic for my New Year's holiday sightseeing. The drama and the action-packed episodes were exciting. The Hardesty character was well drawn and admirable. Overall, the photography, the script and the director was absolutely recommended. Instead of viewing the film as a disgusting propaganda image, as some might do, I enjoyed it as a well-rehearsed depiction of the need for brilliant minds and courageous bodies in the fight against crime. Even the portrayal of a family that holds together even under the burden of the husband for his (presumably) important work, I found not as a second, but an ideal and exemplary representation.
