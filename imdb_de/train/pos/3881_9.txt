This film seized me with the incredible opening sequence that led me to a complete reversal of perspective. I was fascinated when the title came. The theme of this film is that all are acting and trying to reinvent themselves, but not in a difficult way like identity or the usual suspects, but in the way we all try the banal life in which we live Find us to make something more interesting. The scenes in the chicken farms are spectacular. At some point Jorgen (who owns the chicken farm) attends a laughter seminar where he is the worst student. His discomfort makes you realize the depth of his yearning to change himself. The film astonished me with the hidden secrets behind the surface of the most commonplace people I see every day. There is not much conspiracy here. To guess the old man's secret is pretty simple, but the fascination is to guess what all the other characters will do when they find out. This movie appealed to me as much as sideways, though the characters could not be more different.
