Okay, that was a pretty sensitive little number, but I can not help thinking that I've seen her before. Reminds me of another VCA movie I saw in Poitier called "THE OTHER DAYS OF RUBY RAE". He also had some points from "Welcome to the Dollhouse" and "Ratcatcher" and Lynne Ramsay in his running. This does not mean that they are not tasteful references, but that they feel very modern and very fashionable. I feel as if this is closer to advertising (as an approach to style and history) than to the work of An Original and Authentic Author of the Future. <br /> <br /> The cinematography is just too perfect for my taste. To coral filter (or coal) for my taste ... to arched 12mm. That's why the whole impression has withdrawn a little - beware of art that prides itself too much! The French (they are a conservative bunch) seemed to buy it, as did the jury. But Cannes' short film selection is known to be conservative compared to its feature selection, though I'm wondering what's happened in the last few years.
