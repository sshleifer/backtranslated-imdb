I've read somewhere (in a pretty panning-like review) that this is something of a live-action mecha anime, and I think they're on the right track. I saw this movie for the first time when I was very young, and I really wanted to see it again, and when I did it recently all those memories came back. I do not think this should be taken too seriously - it's just a bit of fun on a good 80-year-old TV movie (it's set against the background of a rather dark future, though that point is not emphasized much). What I admired most about this film was that the dialogue did not sound generic - no clich√©s, no predictable lines - all in all, just fun! Maybe the time was not nice to this little movie, but I still find recognition in me. It's by no means perfect, but it's entertaining and does not try to be different. Let the nerds and comic store guys take care of the technology - who cares? Convince yourself and make your own decision. No one else thinks is important.
