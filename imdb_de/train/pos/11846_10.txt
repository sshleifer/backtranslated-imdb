I really liked this movie. The entertainment was well done and the romance was cute. I liked most of the Bryan Adams songs and the score of Hans Zimmer was excellent. What many do not realize is how well it relates to the themes of the Heart of Darkness / Apocalypse Now (what happens when so-called "civilization" invades another home, which means "civilized", etc.). , The opening scene and the music were very moving. The film is a lament over a once beautiful America.
