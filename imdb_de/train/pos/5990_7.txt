I do not have much to add to what was said before, but it's a movie of its time and the first (and probably only) time the studio has completely hung the movie on Dead End Kids. <Br /> <br /> The Warner's have helped the boys a lot, from director Ray Enright and an A budget to an almost magical cast of supporting actors. At every opportunity we receive one of these gem services from real professionals. There are too many to list, but it seems that almost everyone on the Warner lot (without the biggest stars) goes through this picture. (See, if you can see John Ridgely.) <br /> <br /> The only outstanding achievement comes from ever-reliable Eduardo Cianelli as a mob boss with a messianic complex. He plays this character almost as much as the Thuggie leader in "Gunga Din". He is something to see! And Marjorie Main is excellent and gets her best role since "Dead End". <br /> <br /> My bid for this is a second feature on a double bill with something like "City for Conquest". <br /> <br /> Hurray for Warners!
