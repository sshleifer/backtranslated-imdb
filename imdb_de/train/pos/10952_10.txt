Sarah Silverman is a dangerous bitch! She is beautiful, sexy, funny and talented, dark and demonic. I have read the other "comment" to this show as well as the news in the forum and people just do not understand it. Nothing that appears on TV is an accident. Too much money, time and work is put into the production of a TV show to cause mistakes. This show is stupid because Sarah wanted her to be stupid. This show is teen because Sarah wanted her to be teen. I thought the jokes were great and the themed show and the other music numbers are wonderfully bizarre. It's a bit like Pee-Wee's playhouse for mismatched, saggy twenty-five, the Future Pornstars of America from the Valley. The cast is great. The scenarios and actions have gone well. I hope this show succeeds since Comedy Central has not allowed David Spade to keep his show. Who plays Sarah's sister? She was not on the cast list on the show's homepage. I would like to see her standing. Does anybody know about their upcoming show dates or DVDs that might be floating around out there?
