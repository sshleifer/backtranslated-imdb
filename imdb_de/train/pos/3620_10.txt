I just watched this movie tonight. It was great!! I'm a big fan of sports movies, and that was one of my favorites. Dennis Quaid was great. (Oh, by the way, Mr. Quaid, if you read this ... my sister lives in Austin where you live ... and she should buy you a drink ... well ... she somehow got up. .. but she did not want it !: C) [not that anyone will believe that ...]) NEVER, it's a great movie. Anyone who likes a good sports movie should go out and see! : C)
