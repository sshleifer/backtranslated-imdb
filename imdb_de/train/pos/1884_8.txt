This is one of my favorite comedies. Not wanting to tolerate the hero's uninspiring lifestyle but for what it is worth and not considered banalizing alcoholism, the movie is just a lot of fun. It tells the unlikely story of a constantly drunken, irresponsible man named Arthur, who will inherit a huge fortune, but only if he marries Susan, who is chosen because the family thinks she can make something out of him. Arthur suggests, but then Linda falls short of a waitress and a small thief. <br /> <br /> Dudley Moore is perfect as Arthur, the loveliest drunkard in the world whose antics laugh for a minute. Granted, Moore IS Arthur and I agree with those who can not imagine any other actor in the role. The ladies of the play are also well portrayed. Liza Minnelli sparkles as Linda, and her chemistry on screen with Moore is great. Jill Clayburgh plays Susan, the wealthy and fit woman chosen for Arthur. <br /> <br /> However, this movie is literally made by Sir John Gielgud, who represents Arthur's sarcastic but moral butler Hobson. It is obvious that these two had strong mutual affection during Hobson's long-term employment. Hobson is Arthur's best friend and supplier of unsolicited comments and advice. The most interesting relationship in this film is not at all Arthur's romance, but his unusual connection with this witty and of course always disapproving servant. It's the butler you'll remember best long after the end of the closing credits.
