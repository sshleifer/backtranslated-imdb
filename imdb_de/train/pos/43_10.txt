I really liked this movie. I was really fascinated by how Deanna and Alicia became friends in such a tragedy. Alicia was just a worried soul and Deanna was so happy to see someone after she was shot. My only complaint was that it was a bit slow at first and it took a while to get things done. Otherwise it was great.
