I saw this movie years before Cinemax Friday after the dark series (back when the cable box was built like a keyboard) and it fascinated me. Although the film has a pointless aspect, it is well played. The ideas of Depardieu & Dewaere are very pleasing in these politically correct times (at least not in the US), as this seems to sensationalize things like violence, robbery and occasional sex. This movie proves that with a talented cast and a talented director, a good movie is definitely a good movie. It made me sad that Patrick Dewaere committed suicide -Miou in out of your handkerchief.
