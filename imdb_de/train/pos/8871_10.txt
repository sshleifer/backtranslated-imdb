This was a great movie that had many problems. It dealt with racism and class. But it also had the message of knowing oneself and assuming responsibility for oneself. This movie was very deep and there was a message that you and only you can control your destiny. It also turned out that you only fit into society when you know yourself and feel good about who you are. What others think of you is not important. I think this movie has done a wonderful job. The actors I think were able to convey every character wonderfully. I just found it incredible how deep this movie really was. At a mere glance, you can not see how deep the movie is, but on closer inspection you will see the underlined meaning of the movie.
