This movie is a great example of the state of erotic B-movies: bad porn movies without hardcore sex. The action in this is not as bad as these things go; It's about a lawyer trying to prove that her lover is innocent of killing his wife. The rest of the film leaves much to be desired. Bad acting, bad direction, bad looking woman, bad sets, bad camera, bad sound and bad sex scenes. The filmmakers should learn the difference between being slippery and erotic. You do not even have the common sense to have Gabriella Hall naked or in a love scene. <br /> <br /> How stupid is that?
