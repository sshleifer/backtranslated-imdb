After reading the comments on this movie and seeing the mixed reviews, I decided to add my ten cents. I thought the movie was excellent, not just in terms of visual beauty, writing, music score, acting and directing. By transmitting the story of Joseph Smith and the road, he traveled through the lives of hardship and persecution because he believed in God as he had felt and knew he was his way. I am very pleased that I have contributed a small part to telling the story of this remarkable man. I recommend everyone to see this when the opportunity presents itself, no matter what religious path he or she is on. This only gives one more determination to live the life we ​​should, with true values ​​of love and forgiveness, as the Savior has taught.
