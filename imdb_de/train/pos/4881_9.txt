"Kaabee" shows the plight of a woman before and during the Second World War in which her children were raised alone after her husband was imprisoned for "thought crimes." This movie was staged by Yamada Youji and as expected the atmosphere in this movie is really wonderful. Although the historical correctness of some scenes, especially the beach scene, is a suspect. <br /> <br /> The acting in this movie is absolutely incredible. I am amazed how they managed to garner this all-star cast for a 2008 film. Yoshinaga Sayuri, probably the most decorated actress in Japan, will undoubtedly receive more individual awards for her performance in this film. Shoufukutei Tsurube in a supporting role was also very nice. However, it was Asano Tadanobu who delivered the most impressive performance, and the wit of his character and the difficult situation he was in perfectly represented wonderful direction and acting, I was totally fascinated by the story. It was also no left nonsense like "Yuunagi no Machi, Sakura no Kuni" and examines the controversial and sensitive issue of suppression and brainwashing by the government that occurred in Japan at that time. Excellent movie, highly recommended for all viewers.
