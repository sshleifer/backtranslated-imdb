I was a young film student in 1979 when the union of Soviet filmmakers came to Sofia Bulgaria and "Siberian" was premiered by Konchalovsky. Tarkosvky's "Stalker" and Danelia'a "Autumn Marathon". I was stunned by the cosmopolitan dimension of the art form. Then and only then did I see "Siberiade" 4 1/2 hours epic and was speechless. Much better than Bertolucci's "1900". By far! <br /> <br /> Hope Andron will somehow come to the negative and someday make "director's full-length restored version"! Of course on DVD! I also fought violently against this cinema, against most of my colleagues, equating the Soviet film with a bad taste! The time is on my side.
