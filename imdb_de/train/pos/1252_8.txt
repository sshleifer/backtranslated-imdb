The endless limits of our inhumanity over our own kind keep on impressing me. This truly amazing story of a terribly battered and largely outrageous population is captivating, well documented and angry. As an American, I am constantly degraded by the behavior of my country, and this is just another aspect in our long catalog of international humiliation. We suck This is probably the first John Pilger documentation I've seen, but I wanted to see what else he did. My only complaint, and the reason I named this movie only 8 out of 10, is that Pilgrim shows us this travesty and the terrible collaboration of US and British governments. But makes no suggestion how to help. I know nothing about Britain, but the Americans have made it almost impossible for citizens to participate in the activities of their government. A gesture in the right direction could help the islanders.
