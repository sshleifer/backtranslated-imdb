There were 8 squadrons, but it was the first in early 1959, and the last one in fall 1965 was shorter than squadrons 2-7. CBS boss William Paley canceled Rawhide's production after seeing Season 8's first show in September 1965, because he did not have Gil Favor, who left after Season 7, without Eric Fleming. The only CBS broadcast of 1966 on January 4, 1966 was a repeat. <br /> <br /> I've often wondered why Rawhide did not switch to color films last season? Most of the great westerns of the 1960s had settled on color until 1965. CBS sent in color for many of their sitcoms this fall, but westerns like Gunsmoke and Rawhide stayed in black and white. Gunsmoke was on September 17, 1966, the last Western series (and last primetime network series, which was switched to color) for the episode "Snap Decision".
