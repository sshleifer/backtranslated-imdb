After confusing a Halloween broadcast of Orson Welle's classic radio adaptation of WAR OF THE WORLDS for a true invasion of Mars, a group of moronic Martians appear on Earth trying to conquer their plans as they truly recover from their world Element and in reality all alone. <br /> <br /> This is really pretty good and funny, with some decent lines (just the memorable quotes). It will most likely please the sci-fi fans. This has passed the test of time, as I've seen it lately, it turned out to be a lot better than I expected. Despite a cast of nameless stars, this may be the funniest Martian invasion ever made. Interestingly, the Martians themselves seem to portray almost every classic stereotype of Action Hero / Sci-Fi hero (cool 50s teen, fighter pilot, fearless astronaut, brave soldier, and mad scientist). Fun for the whole family. <br /> <br /> "Prepare to die! Earth Scum!"
