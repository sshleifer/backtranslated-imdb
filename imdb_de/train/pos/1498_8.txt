This is a very amusing and sometimes pretty scary anthology that, if a bit short in the script department, more than compensates for the shortcomings of acting, location and general exuberance. The best episodes of it are the first in which Denholm Elliot plays a horror writer who is followed by a character from his novel in the works (a perfect example of acting that draws this from the mere pedestrian). the third, with Christopher Lee as a man who was afraid of his own daughter, and the last episode with the late great Jon Pertwee as a pompous horror film star who gets more than a new role on his latest project. The dialogue between Pertwee and Ingrid Pitt is sparkling and inspired. Both are obviously looking forward to the opportunity to really burden it. Cushing is usually good in the weakest segment, which certainly does not help make the wax figure of the woman he's obsessed with in the local wax museum cabinet anything but "pretty" because we're told it's her! You needed someone of shocking beauty and instead we have a woman with a turtle's chin. In addition to the movie, there are a few little things, and it is a wonderful country house that you can look at as well as possible.
