Well, I gave this movie a 7th. It was better than "Thirdspace" but not as good as "In the Beginning" as far as the B5 movies go. I really think that the TV series with the special effects and the character representation did much better work overall. Let's hope that the producers and the cast bring the next series "Crusade" to the standard of B5.
