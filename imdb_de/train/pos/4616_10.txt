The title of this film comes from a party game titled "Seven Minutes in the Sky". The game was popular with my husband's friends when he was in high school in Brooklyn, New York, and he describes it as something like "spin-the-bottle", "lifesaver relay" and other kissing games. According to the rules, the name of a boy and a girl were drawn, and the chosen ones ordered to go together into a dark closet and stay there for seven minutes. In the meantime, there was speculation among the party guests as to whether they had the nerve to hold hands, hug and / or kiss each other in the privacy of the closet. At the end of seven minutes, the game master said, "Time is up," or knocking on the closet door, and the couple would come out of the closet. After being questioned by the other guests, the couple had to admit what they had done during their "seven minutes in heaven". Then other couples would be selected to enter the closet until all guests had joined. The couple who admitted to doing the most would be the winner of the game. <br /> <br /> Such games have served as a social "icebreaker" for children and adolescents, but for shy individuals, they can be embarrassing and intimidating them. The film was given this title because it deals with the first experiences of teens with love and romantic love.
