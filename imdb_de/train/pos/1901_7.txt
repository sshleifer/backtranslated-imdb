It's hard to put that finger on it. Basically, I think it's a comedy about a lazy rich drunk who falls in love with a (relatively) poor girl he wants to marry, at risk of being rejected by his family. It has funny moments, romantic moments and touching moments. Dudley Moore is funny and somehow gracious in his selfish character, Liza Minelli is a compelling foil while the feisty opposite attracts him, but John Gielgud steals the show as Arthur's wonderfully sarcastic butler. <br /> <br /> It's crazy but it's fun with an unforgettable soundtrack and ran for almost 3 months on our local fleapit.
