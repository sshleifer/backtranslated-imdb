I could not find anyone who saw DiG. With me because no one I knew was a fan of the two bands. Of course, everyone assumed that you can only enjoy this movie if you like the music of The Dandy Warhol or the Brian Jonestown massacre, but this is so far from the truth. The only requirement is that you are generally interested in music and / or pop culture. The parallelism of the careers of the two groups is a perfect representation of the paths a band can take, and it's fascinating to see the public eat and spit on the Dandy Warhols. I agree with other reviews that mention that it would be nice to have a final word from Anton himself, as he is clearly portrayed as his worst enemy and the bulwark for the band's ability to stay simple. <br /> <br /> Most interesting to me is the dandies' respect for the BJM (despite their lack or back and forth) and for Anton (despite his unpredictable behavior). The Dandy Warhols respect the art the group produces, even if the group hates everything the Dandy Warhols now stand for (though that's controversial). The best line is when the drummer of the dandies says, "I will not have them anywhere", and the guitarist unconsciously confuses, "I'll still buy their records." For me, this only shows how powerful good music can be. <br /> <br /> Be sure to watch this movie, even if you do not know anything about either band. It's more about the themes of rock music and how they evolve, which makes this movie so interesting. It's rare to be so close to a group for so long.
