This is an extraordinary movie that constantly outsmart you. There seems to be a clich√© in several places, and then something amazing will happen that really upsets you. It would betray too much to say much more, but stay with this movie and you will be rewarded richly. William Haines is absolutely adorable - he is certainly a star who deserves to be rediscovered. The gay subtext in his relationship with Jack Pickford is amazing - there is even a scene where Haines picks Chest's chest (Pickford has a cold). Both actors play this subtext subtly and with great depth of emotion, so there are moments that are very moving. And I never thought that I could be as involved in a football game as in this movie - and I do not even understand the rules! Excellent is also Francis X. Bushmans son Ralph as Haines' rival for the girl (yes, it is not a completely gay movie). Wonderful Mute Classic - a great example of the commercial cinema of the 1920s with an advantage.
