This show has come this far. At first, ALL in the cast from Eric to Fez were all new actors and actresses, fresh faces, and just look what they've achieved. They stayed at the show and it was a success. It's one of the best shows ever made, and its probably the funniest sitcom I've ever seen in my life. It will be sad to see the end, but when they finish this show, I hope to God that the finale of the series ends with one of the biggest hits a season finale ever had. I do not care if the whole season is shit, because they save all the fuel for the last episode. Take a swinging down and get another final hit. The show deserves it, the fans deserve it. If they leave, let everyone know that it will end, as with Friends, and let the finale be huge. I say Donna and Eric marry, I say Hyde and Kelso have to fight and become friends again. I say there was something interesting going on between Fez and Jackie because Fez took so long, but of course it will not work out for him. Just close the big guys of the series! <br /> <br /> This 70's show will always be the best in my opinion. Eric, Kelso, Donna, Jackie, Fez, Hyde, I wish I had you guys as friends. They are the best! <br /> <br /> 10/10 ...
