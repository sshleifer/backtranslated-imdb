I recently watched this movie in Winnipeg - fitting when using the location. I read Lawrence's book for the first time in the 1970s, and for me it has always been a very strong picture of the aging process in our society. When I was young, it swung along, and it now resonates even more. When the movie came out, I wanted to see if the story could survive. and was very impressed, especially with Ellen Burstyn's performance. She manages to give us a perfect human being, even though the character is generally crazy and judgmental - someone you do not want to live with. It's great to bring your favorite characters to life so authentically.
