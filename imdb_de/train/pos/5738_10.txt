I have just bought and watched the DVD of this film. The DVD broadcast dates from last year 2001. This movie from 1988 is really a great little movie. Overlooked by most people. I saw it in the theater in 1988 and have loved it ever since. I love the opening shot of Pittsburgh (not Baltimore, as another user commented). Make Pittsburgh one of the most beautiful cities in the world! And I have to say, the tour of Pitts on the garbage truck with Nicky is very scenic and interesting! Tom Hulce, as everyone else has said, does a remarkable, wonderful job. The DVD is a good transfer without extras, but with a widescreen format. I recommend it to anyone who loves the movie.
