I really like the original and this movie has its ups and downs. Here are just a few: <br /> <br /> Ups: Most of the votes of the original voice have been returned. <br /> <br /> Downs: I did not like the voice of Timon's Ma. I know she played a voice in The Simpsons, but this show is just stupid. <br /> <br /> Ups: We see Simba as a "teenager". Downs: You wasted it with a slug-slurping contest between Timon and Simba. <br /> <br /> Ups: It was Rafiki who told Timon about "Hakuna Matata". <br /> <br /> Downs: How did Pumbaa find out? <br /> <br /> Ups: Again songs (Some of the original songs were there, but it was just background music.) Downs: But stupid songs. (a.k.a. Timon's solo.) <br /> <br /> Overall, this is a pretty good movie. I would recommend it to fans of the original. But if you do not like the original, you probably will not like this one. <br /> <br /> My score: 7/10
