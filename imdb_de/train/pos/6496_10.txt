Example of how to make a World War II documentary based on reports of real acts of troops and civilians who had participated in this terrible conflict and archived footage from all the time. I did this one more run in the canal a year and a half ago, without really knowing about the Second World War, but it surrounded me, and now I see myself as a World War II. I look and read everything I can about it, but nothing comes close to this remarkable documentary, definitely worth buying. ............. <br /> <br /> This is simply documentary of the highest caliber.
