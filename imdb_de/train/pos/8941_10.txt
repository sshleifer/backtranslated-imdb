I really enjoyed seeing this movie about the Delany sisters. I knew about them, but that was all. This movie opened my eyes for their courage and courage. What a pair of sacrifices they made to live life on their own terms. This is not just a movie for African Americans, but for all Americans. It's a kind of history lesson and a documentary combined with a fun biopic. Acting was superior at all costs and we really get an idea of ​​the hardships that these two sisters have been through for years. Both sisters are very different. They came from a very loving and very strict family with high, perhaps even impossible standards of perfection. It is sad to see Sadie's father refuse to allow his daughter to look on her friend for a possible misunderstanding. I recommend this movie extensively and I'm glad I saw it on TV recently.
