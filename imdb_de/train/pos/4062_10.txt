I just realized that I've been using IMDb for years and have never reviewed my favorite movie. With favorites, I do not mean something I like right now, I mean, this movie is so supernaturally perfect that there's never another animated experience that will touch it. That's obvious because I'll never be a kid again. I have seen this movie about ITV in the early nineties. I was 12 years old, the age group this movie is directed. I'm also male, the gender this movie is intended for (the overwhelming majority of Miyazaki's protagonists are female). Consequently, this film has been an indelible source of inspiration for my childhood psychology and I'm Carl Macek (sp?) Forever owing to producing the English dub of this film, which is far superior to Diney production, which is not even funny - I've never been there Being able to watch them - of course the only way is ultimately the only way, but the Macek version is SO good (the voices are almost exactly the same as Japanese original actors) that this version is available on the Japanese DVD! It is not available in any distribution in an English-speaking country. Go to the picture. <br /> <br /> There are hundreds of expert reviews, so I'll give some minor details here, not that I'm the final archive of information for this movie. <br /> <br /> First I would like to agree with the reviewer, who stated that you need 20 out of 10 to rate Miyazaki's films - they are so in their own league that they put almost the entire catalog on IMDb together to turn an insignificant number. <br /> <br /> The fascinating story of this film is that Miyazaki founded the landscape around the Slag Gorge (Pazu Township) on Welsh mining communities. He visited Wales in the early 1980s (maybe in the late 1970s) shortly after one of the big mining strikes. A zealous supporter of the socialist student movement of the sixties, he felt her plight. The struggle between the citizens and the pirates at the beginning serves to illustrate this empathy among the workers. The scenery and the clouds above all in this movie remind me of where I grew up, since his film is a fantasized version of the rolling hills of the British Isles in the Midwest. <br /> <br /> The island is, of course, of Swift's brilliant 18th-century satirist novel - the story in Swift's book is purposely ridiculous. In Castle in The Sky, Miyazaki interweaves myths like Atlantis and the Tower of Babel - I think the architecture is also based on Peruvian ruins, though I'm not sure anyone told me that. <br /> <br /> Anyone reading this review, who likes REAL, will visit Miyazaki's epic series Mirai Shounen Conan - Future Boy Conan - featured in the short science fiction novel "The Incredible Tide "by Alexander Key based (novel is available online)). Conan is basically a prototype for Laputas Pazu and Shita. You may also be unfamiliar with his previous work for Masterpiece Theater - some of his keyframe animations. He also did the key frame for Sherlock Hound - this has some of the best backgrounds I've ever seen. Also, watch Miyazaki and Takahata's first feature film, Horus Prince of the Sun (1968) - amazing for today's standards. What else ... Gauche the cellist and the flying ghost ship - though they're pretty rare. <br /> <br /> This movie is such a gift, I do not know what we would do without it. This other crap story tells of an oasis. Arigatou Miyazaki-sensei!
