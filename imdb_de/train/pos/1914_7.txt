Eight simple rules started as a very entertaining series. I love John Ritter and his character Paul Hennessey and the relationship he had with his kids was the best part of the show. <br /> <br /> I've always preferred Kerry over Bridget, Bridget has been made unique before and I can contact her in many ways, though I'm not sure if I like the direction in which her character was in later series. <br /> <br /> Early episodes were fun, good, simple teenage acts about the discipline of Paul and Cate The kids, but I think the show has lost its shine when John Ritter died. I admired the cast and the crew because I wanted to continue the series, but when he died I felt that the program was doing it. For me, the whole point of the show was based on the "8 simple rules for dating my teenage daughter" guide. He was written by a real man with teenage daughters and the relevance and angle of the show had changed without the Hennessey father. <br/> <br /> Bridget seemed to get more annoying, Rory stayed the same and Cate always gave her junior lessons, who seemed even funnier when Paul left everything. I think Grandpa is funny (especially when watching Great Escape), but C.J feels unnecessary for the show. It's funny at times, but I had the feeling that the storylines at the time of his arrival were very similar to other American comedy series. With all the newer ones not only is there a lot of excitement, and is it irritating for someone that Cate works at school and that C.J and Granddad are always there? I would always recommend this show to friends as it was very strong in the beginning and worthwhile for Paul and Kerry, but later ones were at best average.
