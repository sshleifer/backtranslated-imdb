The film was very outstanding despite the NC-17 rating and the disturbing scenes. In reality, such things happen and therefore this movie shows a lot of it. It all starts with Maya (Rosario Dawson, an outstanding performer), who recently started college and everything goes well for her. She meets Jared (Chad Faust in a terrific performance) at a frat party that turns out to be a true gentleman and sweet. He invites her to dinner. They look at the stars from a bridge and go to his apartment. They talk and bring them to the cellar, where they flirt with each other. She tries to stop it, but he rapes her. This incident terrifies her. She goes to a club and meets a bartender / DJ Adrian (played great by Marcus Patrick), who sees that she gets drunk and helps before she goes too far. They make a friendship. He also makes drugs and Maya also starts to use. In other words, she introduces her to another world. She goes back to school and works as a TA (Teaching Assistant) and discovers Jared as one of the students. As the students make a midterm, they catch Jared cheating. Jared tries to discuss Maya, but she still has the upper hand to invite her to join her. Will the story be repeated? Or will Maya have a surprise for Jared? You see the movie. Outstanding A. Rosario Dawson portrays the role of focus and stamina. Chad Faust does not like being a rapist, but he does a great job as Jared. Marcus Patrick is a brilliant man who saves Maya and trains her into a new world. This movie deserves an award.
