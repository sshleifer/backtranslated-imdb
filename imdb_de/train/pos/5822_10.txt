The Three Stooges has always been one of the many actors I've loved. I love pretty much every one of the shorts they made. I love all six Stooges (Curly, Shemp, Moe, Larry, Joe and Curly Joe)! All the short films are funny and also face many other great actors and actresses, many of whom have been in many short films! In my opinion, The Three Stooges are among the greatest actors of all time and are the weirdest comedy team ever! <br /> <br /> This is a good three-stooges short. It's fun and features include Christine McIntyre, Symon Boniface, Gino Corrado, Fred Kelsey, Sam Flint, Chester Conklin, Theodore Lorch, Lynton Brent, Judy Malcolm, Vernon Dent, John Tyrrell, Heinie Conklin and Bess Flowers. The Stooges did very well in this short performance! I recommend this!
