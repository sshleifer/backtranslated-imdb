"A Mouse in the House" is a very classic cartoon by Tom & Jerry that is true to its tradition but has its own jokes. It's hysterical, funny, entertaining and quite amusing. Artwork is also of good quality. <br /> <br /> This short is not just about Tom trying to catch Jerry. Butch lives in the same house and also tries to catch the mouse because "there will only be one cat in this house in the morning - and that's the cat that catches the mouse". <br /> <br /> If you ask me, there are many funny gags in this cartoon. The funniest thing for me, for example, is when Mammy Two Shoes sees the two lazy cats sleeping and sarcastically says, "I'm glad you enjoy the siesta" and hopes that they're happy because she does not make two cats gasp Another funny gag is when Tom disguises himself as Mammy Two Shoes and beats Butch with a frying pan, and then Butch does the same trick with Tom. Even funnier than that, of course, is when the real Mammy Two Shoes shows up and both (stupid!) Cats think they're dressed up as Mammy and then attack both on the "tail" - lol. Of course, she gets angry and when she gets angry, she is not a person to be infected with. But even Jerry does not win this time, because he is also expelled from her.
