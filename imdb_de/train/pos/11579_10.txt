This movie is a masterpiece, a story of a young woman during the war, and it's not exactly like the movie, but it's a great story. I was impressed by this movie, the acting and the story in which I think it's great movie because it's a true story, it's a feeling Giff gave me that I was there and I'm sorry for the author, the Maruschka Detmers plays because who wants to end his life here. I recommend everyone to watch this movie, especially the young and ma, to learn something from this movie. You can compare this movie to the orange film soldier or any other story that took place in World War II.
