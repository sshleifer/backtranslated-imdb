Composed, elegant Carol (wonderfully played by the beautiful Rebecca Brooke), her cute husband Eddie (sympathetic David Houseman), Carol's crazy, best friend of Anna (charming with contagious comic zeal of the enchanting Chris Jordan), and Anna's Hunky, the in love husband Pete (usually a fine Eric Edwards) is a quartet of liberated swingers who enjoy frequent group sex with each other. Their usual routine is interrupted when Carol's lonely, oppressed, but still seductive widow mother Jennifer (a very moving performance by the pretty Jennifer Welles) comes to visit. Pretty soon Jennifer relaxes and willingly takes part in the lusty and uninhibited carnivorous lifestyle of swingers, with the exception of Carol, who is all anxious to seduce her. Writer / director Joe Sarno presents a sharp, captivating and insightful study of the fear of big cities and the limitations of the entire sexual revolution of the 1970s. Sarno turns traditional middle-class customs upside down and spice things up with a courageous and provocative incest subplot of mother and daughter. In addition, Sarno pulls out equally first-class acting from the bang-up cast: Welles and Brooke are both extraordinary and are supported by Edwards, Jordan, Houseman, Arlana Blue as fuzzy New Age sex therapist Shandara and Erica Eaton as a cheeky neighbor Fields Better still All women are extremely hot and tempting; Welles in particular, with her exquisite, voluptuous figure and smoldering erotic presence, sighs seriously on the screen. The sex scenes are really sizzling and quite explicit, but never boring or boring. Stephen Colwell's brilliant, polished cinematography and Jack Justis's hopping, melodic acoustic folk score are both solid and effective. Recommended ad for Sarno fans.
