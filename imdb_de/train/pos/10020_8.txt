The legendary Boris Karloff ended his glorious career with four cheap nightmare bunkers in Mexico. This is the atmospheric gothic horror entry from the pile. Karloff gives a typically brisk and dignified performance as Matthias Morteval, an elderly eccentric patriarch who invites some of his petty, greedy and unruly relatives without counting into his sinister, rundown castle to read a will. Soon, the hateful guests are repelled by life-threatening toy people who populate the place. A Mexican sex symbol by Andres Garcia from "Tintorera" epitomizes the dazzling police heroes, and Julissa is the only likeable female character to look absolutely gorgeous. The clumsy, clumsy (non-directional), three-part script, ugly, washed-out cinematography, ridiculous murder-set pieces (a fat, fat slob is blown straight into the face by a miniature cannon!) Overburdened string score, morbid gloomy Doom atmosphere, mostly lousy acting drama (Karloff excepted), cheesy pours, bad synchronization, and rousing fiery inference give this pleasantly awful lemon a kind, cruel, and therefore strangely amusing, crazy charm. A real Campy scream.
