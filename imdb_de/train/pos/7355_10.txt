For a low-budget project, the film was a success. The story is interesting and the actors convince. Eva Longoria, who now plays in the TV series "Dragnet," is sexier than ever. The locations were ideal for the Ganster plot, and the director shows his talent by taking on a lot of roles for his project. Of course, this low budget movie could use better cut transitions and more special effects for the weapon scenes, but the music keeps this script moving. Although this film has problems, such as continuity, I have to say that I would rent the director's next film. If you're a film student, you can learn something from the director's comments.
