One of the greatest movies I've seen this year. Last maybe before sunrise, which can be seen alone in the lab late at night. I like the idea of ​​the film, which suggests the free will of man and our weakness against fate. By the time James and Kathryn have passed away, they will fail and an indescribable suffering will come. I like the end. but there is also a big question. The virus should not be released, should it be in the last scene at the airport. Jose is sent back to see James again from future scientists. When he told him that scientists had already received his message and knew that someone else would spread the virus. They both meet with Kathryn when Kathryn tells James that the real man is DR. Goine's assistant. So it's clear that Jose also gets the true information about the virus (James keeps an eye on him at the time?) And he has teeth. So why did everything still happen? Why do not future scientists do anything after the truth has been revealed? My biggest question after the movie ...
