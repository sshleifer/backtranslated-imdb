What I love about this show is that it follows the lives of modern witches and it's a great time to experience their everyday love, humor and adventure. The literature of magic is so diverse and displays the ideas of classic, medieval and modern wizardry such as Harry Potter and Sabrina. With Sabrina, the teenage witch, this show is so much fun and unique because we can experience a lot of modern wizardry worth seven seasons! This show has so many great qualities and it is a pleasure to see how Sabrina lives her mortal and "Other" life. I would recommend it to any family as the TV series is clean, fun and adventurous. Classic!
