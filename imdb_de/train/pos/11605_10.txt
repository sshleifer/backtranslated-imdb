The main reason I had to watch this movie was that Susan Swift is an outstanding and underrated actress. Time travel films usually do not interest me or films about witchcraft, but this movie was intriguing and scary. It did not rely on unprecedented special effects and did not focus so much on the time travel that the viewer was lost and confused. This was a really creative film that was simple and focused and played great by everyone.
