hi .. I think Just Cause is one of my favorite movies by Sean Connery. It's a tense psychological thriller with outstanding castings from the cast, especially Connery pretty good at this .. It also has one of the best scenes in movies ever, when Sean Ed Harris's character is interviewed in jail is just fantastic .. I have this one very much I can not recommend it enough, really do not miss this! Do not pay attention to the negative reviews that say the last 30 minutes are shit. It was just as intense as the rest of the movie. I really think Just Cause is a very entertaining movie.
