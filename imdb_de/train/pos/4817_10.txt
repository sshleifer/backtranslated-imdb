The Young Victoria is a beautiful movie that presents Queen Victoria in a different light than anyone who thinks about her. The films erase the impression of "I am not amused" from Queen Victoria and show that she was a happy young woman. <br /> <br /> Since I love the story, especially the Victorian story, you can imagine my reaction when I saw it for the first time this movie was advertised, I was so excited and counted the days to the cinemas , I was a bit worried that it would not be historically correct, but it was and I loved it. I found out new facts about Queen Victoria that I did not know before, and I was very interested. <br /> <br /> Queen Victoria in many lights was one of our very best monarchs, and this movie paints a picture of her real personality and how her life was. She was treated so badly by her mother's advisor, Sir John Conroy, because he wanted Britain to have a regency. This inspired Victoria to be a fantastic queen she was! The romance between her and Albert was so deep and this was done very well by Emily Blunt and Rupert Friend, who were both brilliant! The Young Victoria is a love story from the heart, but at the same time a great insight into much of British history ... I love it !!!!!!!!! 10/10 ... no doubt!
