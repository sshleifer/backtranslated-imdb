This movie is a very relaxed, romantic comedy that is thoroughly fun. Meg Ryan does a very good job as an ingenious niece of Albert Einstein, although she believes in her own abilities. Tim Robbins does as good a job as the mechanic who falls in love with her when she comes to his shop with her fianc√© for his car. I loved Walter Matthau as the only Albert Einstein. This movie just has a very relaxing feel, while still preserving some kind of seriousness (if that's actually possible, this happens here) old scientists - I found them great and hilarious! This movie seems to have been underestimated incomprehensible. If you have a cheeky sense of humor, this is the movie for you!
