When the Grinch came out, I was excited, though I thought it would be a happy movie, and it was like that. However, it had a little nightmare before coming in contact with Christmas. You know somehow dark and scary. I loved this movie because it filled people with Christmas spirit. That's how the Grinch saved Christmas. And what happened well in Whoville at the time, it is said that the little heart of the Grinch has increased by three sizes on this day. GREAT GRINCHMAS!
