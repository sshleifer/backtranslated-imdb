Great movie when I saw him. Must say one of my favorite movies of all time. I liked it 8 times in the theater and got the DVD. As I got older and saw again, I realized that the movie is average. Compared to movies known as good comedies, this is nothing. I mean, rock was hilarious in the movie, and the whole thing about racial stuff breaks a few barriers, which is great. Also, the idea of ​​how the movie works is a nice way of thinking. It's like most people think of a movie, but also a little twist, which is a nice touch. I like the movie altogether, so I give it one ... <br /> <br /> Still a good 7/10 for me.
