In general, it is difficult to evaluate these cut films. Some of the segments can be very good, while others lower the overall product rating. In this, for example, the all-girl scene in the doctor's office was pretty exciting ... one of the best in the (limited) audience history of this viewer. Then there is Asia's segment ... the lady is always entertaining. And the story that unites the whole thing was an interesting concept. The swap scene, which excludes the offer, is not bad either. Technically, the production values ​​are quite high. Recommended.
