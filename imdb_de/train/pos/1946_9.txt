I was not a big fan of Star Trek until two to three years ago. Thanks to Netflix and the distribution of video technology after 2000, I can familiarize myself with the past of all the big Star Trek episodes. For those who do not really see every single episode and know it by heart, through TNG, DS9, Voyager, etc., the general consensus of the population is, "I like the next generation" best. That's because Captain Picard and his crew were fresh when they first appeared after decades of Star Trek famine. To be honest, I appreciate the creativity of Voyager episodes more than TNG. Voyager's episodes, unlike TNG, also evolve over time. Approved data from TNG are great, but it will eventually get old, but the Voyager's doctor - that's creativity! Rather than making artificial intelligence awkward and jerky, you're giving it the freedom to express everything you imagine. Picardo is not just such a great actor, but the premise for his expansive self-growth as a doctor. Self-realization is now science fiction at its best! Endgame portrays him as a husband married to an "organic" neuroimplant transceiver for the human-machine interface and even - in the episode before Endgame - to disregard Captain's command and make "human" mistakes. Unlike DS9, who are blessed with 2 beautiful women from the very first episode, Voyager has to survive 3 seasons without Jeri Ryan. I think that Picardo carried her with his personality. Of course, the rest of Voyager's cast chemistry effortlessly runs, Harry Kim and Tom Paris - very natural. I love Tuvoc's occasional humor, though I'm a Vulcan. After all, I'm so glad they got rid of the original captain - oh, if you can see those rare shots - thank God for Kate! She has developed into a highly confident, credible and respectable captain over the past seven years. What a great job! Thank you, Star Trek, for making Voyager. I enjoy each episode, the creative exploration of possibilities, of morality and of our cosmic expansion.
