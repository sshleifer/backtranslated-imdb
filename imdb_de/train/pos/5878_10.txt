Garam Masala is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. Akshay Kumar is excellent as a womanizer, who has three girls affairs and is engaged at the same time. John Abraham is sometimes amusing and this is one of his best works. Paresh Rawail is outstanding in most of his films as usual. Director Priyadarshan has delivered great films in the past. Hera Pheri, Hungama and Hulchul are among the best. Garam Masala is his funniest movie he made. The three newcomer actresses are average. Rimi Sen does not have much leeway in this movie. I was impressed to see how Priyadarshan made a movie with a simple act of a man having an affair with 3 girls at the same time. All 3 girls have one day off the same day and land in the same house. Packed with countless laughs, this is a non-stop entertainer.
