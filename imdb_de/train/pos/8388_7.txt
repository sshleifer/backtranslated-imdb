Maria Braun is an extraordinary woman who is presented in a totally credible way, although she is so dull that it borders on implausibility. She will do anything to make her marriage successful, including shameless opportunism and sexual manipulation. And so she reveals a pretty sweet value system under the exterior of the vice. The film suffers from an abrupt and unexpected end, which then feels completely inadequate, with the convenience one knows from the end of his school's creative writing exercise with "and then I woke up". It also ends with a bookie on the other end, with the most eccentric title sequence I've ever seen, but do not let that put you off.
