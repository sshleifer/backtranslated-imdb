This low budget erotic thriller has some good points but a lot more bad ones. The plot revolves around a lawyer trying to evict her lover, who is accused of murdering his wife. A softcore movie is about going undercover in a strip club and having sex with potential suspects. Since actions for this genre are not bad. The script is fine, and the story is so meaningful to someone who took care of it at 2 am that not too many action holes are noticed. But everything else in the movie seems cheap. The lead actors are not that bad, but pretty much all supportive actors are incredibly bad (a girl seems to be drunk and / or high). The cinematography is poorly lit, everything looks grainy and ugly. The sound is so horrible that you can barely hear what people are saying. The worst part of this movie is why you look at it - the sex. The reason people see these things is for hot sex scenes with really hot girls in Red Shoe Diary situations. The sex scenes are not hot, they are bleak, they were filmed in this porn style where everything is just a master shot of two people walking on them. The woman also looks like she's taking refuge from a porn shoot. I'm not trying to be rude or mean, but they all have these breast implants and a burnt / weathered look. Even the title "Deviant Obsession" sounds like a hardcore strip. Not that I do not mind porn - I love it. But I want to separate my softcore and my hardcore. What happened to actresses like Shannon Tweed, Jacqueline Lovell, Shannon Whirry and Kim Dawson? Women who could act and who would totally excite you? And what happened to erotic thrillers like Body Chemistry, Nighteyes and even Stripped to Kill? Sure, none of them were masterpieces, but at least they felt like movies. They also outperformed the envelope and went beyond Hollywood's relatively prudent attitude to sex, sexual obsessions, and perversions. Now they only do hardcore movies without hardcore sex.
