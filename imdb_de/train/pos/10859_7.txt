Not to be confused with the eponymous Resse Witherspoon high school movie. This is a stylized view of the Hong Kong Triad bands. Called election because every two years a new leader or "chairman" of old traditions is chosen. Two candidates are ready for the position and through egos, bribes and past successes the race is tense to say the least. Learn expertly to acquaint you with an expansive cast, without confusing the twists and turns of history before you reveal themselves in their brutal glory. The Asian godfather is not, but it's an entertaining thriller in a gangster genre that will leave you at the edge of your seat and flinch at violence. Subtitle Volume 1 I think it's safe to say there will be more rates as we delve deeper into the murky Triad world and all its feudal and underhanded deals. In any case, this is a good start and if there are no sequels, this is a great movie.
