There is something about Pet Sematary that I have not experienced anywhere else. Maybe the fact that I was a kid when I first saw it made this experience so memorable. But when I look at it again and again, it never gets old and I never get bored. From the opening credits with this creepy opening song to the very chaotic end, there is something insane, sad and sinister at the same time, and there is always a ringing in your head: sometimes death is better! <br /> <br /> I do not think it would be useful to recount the whole story. All you need to know is that it starts from point A (the most perfect situation for a happy American family) and drowns step by step to point B (which, I believe, is the end of all joy). The music is perfect, the story makes sense, the special effects are cool and the Pet Sematary is the last place in the world I would be. As I said, sometimes dead is better!
