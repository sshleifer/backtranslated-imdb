With a mesmerizing performance by Will Smith and a tale that hits harder than a rock guitarist in the middle of the solo, "Seven Pounds" rushes past the director's previous collaboration with the actor (The Pursuit of Happiness), a movie I loved too. Remember Gabriele Muccino's name because some of his films may be skipped unnoticed if the actor associated with the project is not so well known. Too bad I found out Will Smith's scheme early. I composed two and two when he calls his suicide in the first scene and in the scene where Rosario Dawson's character is introduced with an incurable heart -disease. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, I think that the author / director has made the right choice by putting the bookends (the bookends are the first and the last scene) in this way. This is the source of urgency and tension in gradually finding out exactly how a man can be forced to make this ultimate sacrifice, and it was heartbreaking to see the relationship between Smith and Dawson's character thrive and develop, keeping in mind always knowing what was in store for these unfortunate two. <br /> <br /> One of my friends with whom I saw the movie thought Smith's figure could have a divine gift and I understand why: His performance is almost engrossing when he is in the presence of his seven chosen ones But at other times he could be hard and scary, and when he is alone The full weight of his situation was too much for him and he collapsed completely. It is a very versatile performance. <br /> <br /> Finally, I can not forget mentioning the staging of the crash scene, which was truly amazing in terms of the combination of music and cinematography. Put this on your list.
