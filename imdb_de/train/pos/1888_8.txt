"If I wanted to dribble, I would call a nurse." <br /> <br /> "Do not you have enough?" ... "More than enough." <br /> <br /> "They got me a choo-choo." <br /> <br /> "When I start to die, please remove the cowboy hat My head so I do not want to be remembered." <br /> <br /> Some of the wonderfully humorous and often enlightening quotes from this charming and often revealing movie. Dudley Moore is charming, lovable and rich. Sir John Gielgud is aristocratic, charming and loving ... and poor. The two have a relationship between father, father and son that defines the man to whom Arthur is to become. Will he follow his heart and soul, or only his wealth? For over twenty-five years, I have returned to this film with joy and pleasure. It's a movie that you can come back to again and again and remember what's so important in life, as short as it is. <br /> <br /> Judge Miller
