I remember seeing it years ago when it first came out and Parker Posey's performance impressed me. And the movie was pretty good too. For anyone who has spent too much time in the nightclub / after-hour scene, this movie will have a special appeal for you. Not too serious, mostly funny, and Parker Posey is definitely breaking her talented path through this indie gem. <br /> <br /> I especially liked the Diaz figure (it reminded me of every single ever-fighting DJ). And many other films could be guided by this film, how to preach the virtue of responsibility without being boring and boring. <br /> <br /> Babaganoosh!
