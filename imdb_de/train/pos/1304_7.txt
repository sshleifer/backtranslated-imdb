OK. Yes, this was a very tight film with continuity flaws (like single scenes that were obviously filmed in sunshine and then shadowed and then mixed together), and much as I love Nick Mancuso, he was often too brutal - Partly, and some of the minor castes were really bad (plus at least one actor was used for two different but eye catching roles). But come on. Richard Grieco was hysterical (his hair alone is worth the trip). Steven Ford was very nice. Mancuso had some great lines, while ironically, Nancy Allen was bland and uninteresting. Classic? No, bad parts? Yes. Entertaining? Big yes I would have liked to have been on the set the day they decided which hairstyle Grieco would have. "Are you fast?" ... "You are not fast."
