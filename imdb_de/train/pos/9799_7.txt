A funny Batman animated film. Not equivalent to "Return of the Joker" or "Mask of the Phantasm", but still solid. I liked how the movie got you guessing who Batwoman was. There was a nice twist. Nice action sequences. I've always thought the Batman cartoons are better than the pathetic Batman live action movie episodes. The trend continues here. <br /> <br /> 7.5 out of 10
