Excellent show. Instead of seeing the same old sitcom shows, which are the same old things, just different "stars", this refreshing show provided an incredibly entertaining view of the office situations. We have not watched TV for 2 years and after we returned, we are happy to see this show on W Shame on Global from the available shows because it pulled the plug. I thought that would be a winner. Let's be realistic about things, Canadian SHOWS do it. Everyone I talk to enjoys this show and I think it was stupid of Global to go away. I think they want to stay out of the States with the typical, insane shows instead of standing behind a Canadian show that promised a lot. Do not get me wrong, I have a lot of shows on TV, but guys, let's keep the variety. This unique show offered a very comedic look at a somewhat exaggerated realistic side of office life and relationships with unique characters you will not see in any sitcoms today or in the past. Too bad that Global had to say no to this, stupid mistake.
