SCARFACE was written by Oliver Stone and directed by Brian De Palma. Al Pacino is an impressive performer as Tony Montana, a Cuban refugee, becomes a powerful player in the drug world while ruthlessly reigning over his self-made kingdom of crime in Florida. This gangster stripe is hard, violent, loud, coarse, unpleasant, and must hold the record when he has most often pronounced the word "f - k". Almost three hours and yes, it can be disgusting. A hard-nosed constitution ensures that you cheer for the death of a reckless criminal lord. Also interesting characters play Michelle Pfeiffer, Steven Bauer, Robert Loggia, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, F. Murray Abraham and Angel Salazar Pacino proves to be one of the largest of his generation. He manages to give reality to his character, which leaves a strong impression. This will not be a movie for everyone, as you think you have left disaster. Is that powerful enough for you? Crime does not pay long!
