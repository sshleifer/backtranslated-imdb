....... When playing Kaddiddlehopper, Col San Fernando, etc., the man was pretty far-reaching and a shout. I love to see him working with Amanda Blake or Don Knotts or whoever - he clearly had a ball and I think he also made it easier for his guests - as long as they did not know it disciplined, take 19 sort of the production. Relaxing and being relaxed was clearly the name of the game. <br /> <br /> He reminds me of people like Milton Berle, Benny Hill, maybe Jerry Lewis. Great timing, ancient gags that have sewn the audience for decades, pure joy in what he did. His sad little clown he was playing was also good - but touching. <br /> <br /> Personally, I think he's great after having just bought a DVD set of his '61 shows or so stuff back in a loving way for me. I remember seeing him on TV at the end of his run when he finished the series in 1971 or so. <br /> <br /> Take a look at this if you are a fan or curious. He was a rebellion.
