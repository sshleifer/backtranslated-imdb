Xiao Chen Zhi Chun is a great movie, not only in the year he was shot, but also now. It's an art film that is not outdated even in the 21st century. The director maintained a good narrative ability and made the story so smooth! <br /> <br /> The film reminds me of the later French New Wave movie: Francois Truffaut's "Femme d'a cote", which is a similar theme.
