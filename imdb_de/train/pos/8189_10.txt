This was an excellent 2-part episode, although I had never seen the older ones. I never thought that the doctor would turn against something paranormal, extra terrestrial, but not paranormal. <br /> <br /> This episode brings with it the things we fear most and how would we really defeat and defeat people in a futuristic time evil evil when the most chances point out that this impossible I'm surprised that they've brought some things like fear and faith, especially if they also entertain the American public. But who cares what Yanks says, we rock! Since the first episode of the new series in 2005, Doctor Who has shown potential that was harmless, from fun to serious, from light to dark. I hope many old fans will one day soon say, "The old Doctor Who has returned". <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10
