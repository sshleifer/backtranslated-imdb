It's not the same as the other movies about dancing. A few ordinary people found themselves dancing. Unlike the dancing films in Hollywood, the characters in this film are not pretty or hot young people. You are someone you can see in your office every day. They are depressed about their lives and eventually find themselves and their dreams of dancing. That touches me a lot.
