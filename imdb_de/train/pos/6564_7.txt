Jake Speed ​​(1986) was an amusing parody of Indiana Jones and other adventurous films that were popular in the 1980s. Wayne Crawford plays the lead role as Jake Speed, an adventurer who fights always and everywhere with evil doers. With his assistant Desmond Floyd (Dennis Christopher) they dawdle in search of action (and some decent storylines). The duo meets a young woman named Margaret (Karen Kopins) whose sister was abducted by a wicked white slave trader (John Hurt). Can she find Jake and Desmond and convince her to help save her siblings? <br /> <br /> A juicy and kitschy film that does not pretend it's something it's not. I have to give this a recommendation. That's when you enjoy movies that are fun and for those who do not believe everything at face value. <br /> <br /> Recommended.
