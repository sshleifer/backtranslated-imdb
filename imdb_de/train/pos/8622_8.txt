I just can not agree with the above commentary - there are a lot of interesting and indeed amazing cinematic images, it has an unusual structure and moves well to a fearsome climatic sequence characterized by its effective silence. In addition, it explores the strange impulse of suicide in a very honest manner, without showing what it shows without, however, revising and sensitizing the topic. It has hints of documentary about it as well as horror and arthouse cinema and deserves a place under the canon of "other" horror films like The Blair Witch Project and the Original Ring (both older than them and could well play an unconfirmed influence on) , It is definitely worth a visit if you are interested in the limits of horror cinema.
