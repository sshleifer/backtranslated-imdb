Pressburger and Powell's biggest movie. David Niven plays the RAF bombing pilot who misses his own death but gives him a second chance when Heaven realizes he is AOL and asks an angel to investigate. The scene in which the young soldiers - black and white - all killed in action - arrive in heaven to be prepared for eternal life is unbearably poignant. Also watch out for Roger Livesey, a deeply under-exposed actor, and Kim Hunter as a love interest (later, of course, Zira in Planet of the Apes). Incidentally, Steven Spielberg cast the actress, who played the main angel (Kathleen Byron) as an elderly woman of the same named private individual in Saving Private Ryan, half a century later.
