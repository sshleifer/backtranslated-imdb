I'm not sure under which circumstances Director Visconti decided to shoot James Cain's novel "The Postman Always Rings Twice" (I am not even sure if Viscounti has acquired the rights of the book), but the resulting film is definite Interesting. It's not the best version of Cain's story (I like the 1981 version best), but thanks to Visconti's excellent directing and the cast of Clara Calamai and Massimo Girotti (a very sensual couple) it's a must for noir fans. Visconti mixes neorealism with noir sensitivities with great effects. The movie is not perfect though. My main complaint is that the movie is a bit too long for its own sake; The story is moving at a very slow pace (I do not think Visconti was able to cut his films very well). I think film noir works better with a short runtime. Fortunately, Calamai and Girotti are magnetic actors who interest the viewer. As much as I like this movie and the remakes, I think nobody made the final version of Cain's highly acclaimed book.
