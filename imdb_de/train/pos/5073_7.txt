This documentary drama is what you would expect from Richard Attenborough, the man who gave us "Gandhi": beautifully photographed, convincingly cast, well written in the measured, skilful manner, the Hollywood of the 1930's discarded, and extremely accurate. It is a genre film characterized by its depiction of the Native American culture of America (or better Canadian "First Nations") and with "Black Robe" as a wonderfully photographed piece of Kanurand and its culture (here around 1934). This idyllic portrait derives drama from his motif: Archie "Gray Owl" Belaney, a Scot who was born in Hastings (England) by aunts so obsessed with the "Indian stories" of his childhood that he went to Canada, disappeared in Canada Forest and became a trapper and adoptive son of an Ojibway band. He was a vain man who had the habit of marrying and giving up Indian brides, none of whom seemed to have thought less of him, for he was also an exceedingly charming and piquant character. One of his wives (a wiser person than him in most accounts) made him a glory writer and advocate for the protection of the wild land of the North. This forms the center of Attenborough's story. The chemistry between Brosnan and Annie Galipeau (as pony of Gray Owl) is appealing and, if not fiery yet touching. A good movie, if you need some time from the crowd.
