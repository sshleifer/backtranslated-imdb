Armageddon PPV <br /> <br /> The last PPV of 2006 <br /> <br /> Smackdown brand. <br /> <br /> Score Ahead ******** <br /> <br /> We start the show with The Inferno Match. Kane v. MVP. That was a fitting game. Nothing of wrestling here. This was about the visuals. Overall, that was not bad. There were a few nearby places where Kane came too close to the fire, but in the end Kane won when he first rammed MVP into the fire. <br /> <br /> A nice opener. Here we go. <br /> <br /> Teddy Long announces a new game for the Tag Team titles: London and Kendrick defend themselves against: Regal and Taylor, The Hardyz and MNM IN A LADDER MATCH !!!! Here we go! <br /> <br /> Match Two: Deadly Four-Way Ranked Match. That was total carnage. Judging by three of the four teams here, one would expect a mess. The spots were incredible. A total spotfest. One point at which Jeff chose Poetry in Motion moved London and Jeff came on the ladder! Shortly thereafter, Jeff is on the top rope with two ladders nearby, when MNM wanted to kill Jeff, Matt saves and Jeff hits the jackpot on Joey Mercury! Mercury is hurt. His eye is closed quickly and torn open in a hard way. Mercury is taken out of the game and Nitro is still there. He will fight for the titles on his own! Regal and Taylor then grab London and bring it face first into the ladder! Jeff climbs the ladder and Nitro in a killer spot, dropkicks through the ladder to meet Jeff! Brilliant! In the end, London and Kendrick retain the tag team title. What a game !!! <br /> <br /> That was crazy. I can not figure out why WWE has not announced that yet. The Buyrate would increase enormously. I'm sure the replay value will be good. Mercury has suffered a broken nose and lacerations on the eye. He is in the hospital now. Get well. <br /> <br /> Nothing else will surpass that. <br /> <br /> Next time: The Miz v. Boogeyman. (Ugh) This was no comparison. Will the Boogeyman ever wrestle? The Miz is too shit. After an insane amount, that kills her dead. DUD. <br /> <br /> Chris Benoit v. Chavo. This was a strong game. I enjoyed it. Chavo hit a killer superplex at one point! Benoit also hit EIGHT German suplexes! Benoit wins with the sniper. Good stuff. <br /> <br /> Helms v. Yang Cruiserweight title championship game. That was a good match. Unfortunately, the stupid fans did not care. WHY? Helmets and Yang are very talented and wrestle well. I agree with JBL. He called to the crowd. JBL is 100% correct. Learn to appreciate this or get out. <br /> <br /> Mr. Kennedy v. The Undertaker Last Ride. Not too much here. This was a snail party with a few exceptions. Kennedy once threw Taker off the stage. The place was ok. The reaction was disappointing. The final point was Taker, Grab-Kenned, on the hearse and won the match. Unreal. Kennedy needed that victory. They both work hard. Nevertheless, Kennedy needed this victory. Undertaker should have lost. Creatively screwed up again. <br /> <br /> Next comes a stupid divasache. I like women. Not that. At least Torrie was not here. That's refreshing. Judging by the crowd, Layla should have won. The WWE wanted Ashley. Consider this as a bath break. Next. <br /> <br /> Main Event: Cena & Batista v. Chr. Finlay & Booker T. This was not a comparison either. The focus was on Cena v. Finlay and Batista v. Booker. Batista and Booker can not work well together. Finlay tries to make Cena look good. The departure was botched. Finlay hit Batista's knee with a chair kick and Batista did not sell the shot and finished the match. Lame. No caliber at all for the main event. Overall, Armageddon would have scored less points, but the ladder match was the main event. That was enough money right there. Some others were solid. <br /> <br /> The last word: a good PPV, where the leader of the ladder is the Redeemer. Smackdown is not a bad show, but not convincing enough. Smackdown has to stop, Cena to join. Let Smackdown stand on two legs. This show proves that Smackdown can do that.
