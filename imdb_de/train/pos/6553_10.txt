It's a breath of fresh air when a movie actually gives you a story of beginning, middle and end, a beautiful, clever puzzle, with an appealing heroine for every age that convinces us with its wit and charm. Andrew Fleming's film is indeed a modern wonder, a comeback of the good old reliable narrative that was the norm in Hollywood. He puts off the over-reliance on special effects that now serve as entertainment, and gives us a great movie with a very capable young actress and a talented minor cast. <br /> <br /> The film is based on the old movie Books, but it has been updated enough to put in this century; However, the props may be different, the heart is still a good mystery, and here there is a clever one, one that combines the traditions of the old and the nuances of today's youth. Emma Roberts is an old-fashioned girl who believes in good behavior and respect for others. Details that are painfully missing in today's films. She is still good enough to catch the boys' attention, but she also knows how present attitude and self-esteem. She earns her medals by working hard and is not afraid to show a little wrong when needed to achieve her goals. <br /> <br /> During a holiday in California, our heroine immerses herself in the mystery of a Hollywood actress who was the victim of a bad game; Suddenly, she is "visited" by her mind, which triggers a series of events that can solve the puzzle or make it terrible. What makes the movie quite entertaining are the little details, as it finds out that their familiar world is nothing compared to the Californian scene, and this is well presented without resorting to unnecessary vulgar language or graphic or sexual sexuality. After all, the director has enough control to make all kinds of audiences, from young to adult in the audience, very tasty. It's a movie that deserves to be seen, appreciated and enjoyed, a movie that is rare and delicate and is not afraid to be classified as fun! Five stars
