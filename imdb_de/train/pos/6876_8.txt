"The Groove Tube" was first shown on video in the first "video cinemas" here in Boston. In one room, on high bleachers, there were TV monitors with old cinema seats and small groups facing the monitors. There were old fridges filled with Pepsi, and baskets from York Peppermint Patties. There were no seats in a second, smaller room, just big pillows. That was the "smoking room", d. H. The people were up there. This act only helped make the video funny. <br /> <br /> I was a frequent spectator. The scenes that I liked and remember most are: Koko The Clown, The Kramp Family Kitchen (Kramp Easy-Lube Shortening), Safety Sam / VD PSA, The Chevy Chase Hitchhiker's Guide to the Forest, the finger ballet which finally turned out to be the naked body of a woman. The last point was very reminiscent of the late, incredible Ernie Kovacs. Well, I've lost a lot of readers who are under 48 ("who is Ernie Kovacs?"), But trust me, it's weird. <br /> <br /> One reason why I was a frequent onlooker was that me and my friends would bring other "Groove Tube" virgins to see it. We would sit and watch the faces of the "virgins" smart while the PSA plays "Safety Sam". As the camera slowly zooms on "Sam", we wait for the "OH!" the recognition on the face of the maiden. Each time was funnier than the last one. And then this "maiden" would bring a friend to the show and repeat what we had done. To get this joke, you need to watch the video. <br /> <br /> Yes, some of them are outdated, but most games, movies, TV and now videos. Just watch every video that was shot in the 1980s. <br /> <br /> I saw "The Groove Tube" as a movie in a theater, a grainy transfer from the original video. It was cut and lacked some of the original climax scenes. <br /> <br /> The first "Saturday Night Live" show in which Chevy Chase was heard prompted immediate comments, "this is the type of" The Groove Tube ", so it was a prelude to Chevy. <br /> <br /> I can not see any can of shortening without hearing the voice. "Coat your hands with a generous amount of Kramp Easy-shorten Fat ..." and remember the recipe "Kramp Holiday Loaf". Always make me laugh in the pastry shop in the supermarket. <br /> <br /> The early 70's were a huge time. "The Groove Tube" was fresh, new and really "understood" the humor of the time. It offered a "hip generation," humor that was not available in any other format / medium. MJH
