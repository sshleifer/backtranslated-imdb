This movie is really real and random. It's really hard to find movies like these in Hollywood movies. I really enjoy watching this movie, I bought his DVD this week on Tuesday and watched it four times. I love Paz's spangling accent, it's just cute the way it is. And her acting and Morgan's acting are so funny and natural. <br /> <br /> My movie tastes may be different from the others, but I have to say that I really love this movie. The simple is the best! <br /> <I've learned a little bit more about the life of this movie (or at least the life of the US) ... Life is really random ... Sometimes we meet someone who passes your life and happens to be your friends , and you do not spend so much time with them, maybe just for a while, but you enjoy the '' '' '' 'and they and they will never meet again, but the time you spend together is truly unforgettable , Keep these moments in mind as grateful and beautiful memories ... <br /> <br /> This film is cheap in price, but its meaning is not cheap at all. I rarely learn anything from movies, but this is an exception.
