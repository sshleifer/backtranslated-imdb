This film is still relevant today given the threat of bio-terrorism and the threats of superbugs, the West Nile virus and SARS. As a thriller, the tension is pretty big. Richard Widmark and Paul Douglas are more than useful in their roles. The domestic scenes between Widmark and his wife make a nice interlude for the main plot. The actor who left the most in this film is Jack Palance. His sharply demarcated facial features and his seemingly straightforward appearance make the stingy and cruel man below the surface again and again recognize. The persecution scene through the packaging plant is impressive to this day. Recommended, 7/10.
