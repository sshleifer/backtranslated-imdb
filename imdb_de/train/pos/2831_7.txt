I stumbled upon this movie when I did Caesars Palace stuff on eBay. I love his rich Vegas history as the last of the original luxury resorts is still in good condition (unless you count Ballys, the original MGM Grand). In this regard, this film provides full power. You will be given an extensive tour of the Caesars property, which looks alarmingly similar despite all the renovations and expansions that have taken place in the 40 years it was opened. Overall, the film is somewhat difficult to follow, largely due to the terrible editing. And when I say horribly, I do not use that word recklessly. There are many second, long snippets of the Vegas traffic, casino crowds, and even a scene in which the Robert Drivas character talks to his father about how much he is grown and goes without explanation (Drivas) ( in those notorious clippings) about himself, about a baby to a little boy and then back to himself as he talks back and forth with his father. (This does not reveal any plot details, if anything you can be prepared for that, and maybe they are not as baffled as I am at editing.) The film is otherwise aged and has a good message of the inherent differences between a father and his son, with which most guys could identify with in any form or manner.
