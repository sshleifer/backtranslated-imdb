Seeing Cliffhanger makes me nostalgic for the early 90s, a time when virtually every new action movie could be described as "Die Hard in a / on a". Cliffhanger is "The Hard on a Mountain" and pretty good for what it is. <br /> <br /> But unlike Passenger 57 and Under Siege, who are decent Die Hard clones on their own terms, Cliffhanger abandons the trapped feeling of many action films, framing breathtaking landscapes that in their immensity dispel the conflicts of People who struggle and die between the peaks threaten to overpower and trivialize. <br /> <br /> Years before other films like A Simple Plan and Fargo dramatized crime and murder in snowy areas. Cliffhanger director Renny Harlin recognized the visual impact of brutal violence and cruel battles to survive against cold and indifferent natural environments. The opening sequence has already received a lot of praise. All it deserves: Thanks to its intensity, we can forget the artistry of the camera and the actors and simply believe that what we see actually happens. Not even Harlin's shot of the falling stuffed animal, which is powerfully effective, but nevertheless threatens to joke (and that he repeated in Deep Blue Sea) or the ridiculous look on Ralph Waite's face can lessen the effect of the sequence. <br /> <br /> The next impressive backdrop is the shootout and the raid on the jet. As written by Stallone and Michael France and staged by Harlin, the audience is immersed in the action by initially not knowing which agents are involved in the theft and which are not: the bloody crosshairs are totally unexpected. As Roger Ebert notes, the stuntman, who performed the airborne transfer in the air, deserves special recognition. Later, during the avalanche episode, one of the terrorists / thieves actually seems to fall off the snowwall carrying him down the mountain. As far as I know, no one was killed in creating this movie (a small miracle given the extreme nature of some stunts), so obviously a dummy was used for the shoot. But the recording itself remains impressive because we wonder how Harlin (or probably one of the directors of the second unit) knew exactly where to put the camera. <br /> <br /> I take Sly Stallone as my action hero every day of the week, because he's one of the few movie stars I've ever seen and who, as someone who can stand a lot of physical and emotional pain, absolutely convinced and at the same time feels this pain. The role of Gabe Walker complements Stallone's real strengths: he plays an older, more vulnerable action hero and offers an impressive, unobtrusive performance as a mountain rescuer who has to redeem himself. Unlike Stallone's Walker, he is an ordinary man who becomes a hero and has many paranormal or computer-aided abilities. In Cliffhanger, the hero almost freezes and his clothes show big tears as he barely escapes one dangerous situation after another. He flinches when hit and bleeds when cut, especially in the cave sequence, when he takes a Rocky-style punch from one of the weird puppy dogs. <br /> <br /> It should be noted that the most despicable villains really add to the film's effectiveness: when I first saw this movie as a teenager, I searched for the good guys every step of the way, expecting when another villain would bite the dust (or better the ice). At a certain point in time, I was actually thrilled when one of the coolest-blooded characters in the movie rightly suffered a violent death. <br /> <br /> Lithwow's British accent is not as convincing as the film's occasional model airplane or model helicopter, but it's basically a good actor and one of the few who can perfectly recite a stupid dialogue: in one scene Considering the hostages Stallone and Rooker, to decide what tasks to give them, he actually says: "Stay, you stay, you bring!" Even a better actor like Anthony Hopkins could have problems with this line. <br /> <br /> Although Cliffhanger occasionally pushes credibility aside, this is just an entertaining show. <BR /> <br /> At an early stage of the film, for example, Lithgow openly tells one of his men, "Retire, when he comes down." No true criminal thinker would have made this mistake unconsciously: his negligence makes Rooker call out a warning to Sly on the rock face, and this leads to a gripping tug-of-war between Stallone and the bad guys who want to pull him to the ground The rope on his leg. <br /> <br /> Lithgow could have given his orders in a more subtle way, but the sequence could not have been so much fun if Rooker had not had the opportunity to be open defying the arrogance of his kidnapper. <br /> <br /> The Cliffhanger is very much made in the style of a Saturday matinee series or (at times) a western series. Cliffhanger is built on a solid foundation that has survived some weak elements undermining a smaller movie. <br /> <br /> In addition to the painfully obvious aircraft models mentioned earlier, the weak moments include a few scenes shot on cheap indoor sets of REAL Artificial Snow, as well as two more scenes featuring bats and wolves in an already action-packed narrative seem unnecessary. Finally, Harlin's decision seems to be filming some of the death scenes in slow motion, as the technique does not contribute to the scenes. <br /> <br /> It's a shame that Stallone is now too old for action movies because his character in this movie seems so believable that I'm inevitably wondering what he would look like years later. But perhaps it's best that Cliffhanger remain unaffected for all time: There are already enough tired and outdated movie franchises. There was an unofficial sequel called Vertical Limit: Compared to this clinker, Cliffhanger is one of the top 250 of the IMDb. <br /> <br /> Rating: 8 (Very good, especially considering most other Stallone films.)
