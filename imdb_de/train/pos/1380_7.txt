These kind of films about young teens struggling with their own sexuality were something unique, daring a few years ago, but more and more films like this have been made in recent years, making it difficult for the movies to always be are really outstanding. <br /> <br /> Also, this movie received little attention, except in the usual small film festivals that introduced this little French movie, as well as the big festivals that always like these little movies on everyday themes are not treated too often in movies , The film premiered in 2007 in Cannes and received some awards there. <br /> <br /> The film does not really differ from others, as it does not really offer anything new if you've already seen similar films like this one, but this does not mean that "Naissance des pieuvres" is a bad eye , The film is certainly a good watch that deals well with the theme and tells its story steadily and therefore effectively in a typical, somewhat slow French film tempo. <br /> <br /> It's a coming-of-age movie that focuses on the lives of mostly 3 different middle-aged teenagers. Sexuality is a big topic in the film, which is subtly and subtly treated. All in all, it makes the film and its story quite realistic, albeit a bit predictable, because the film does not offer anything original enough in its genre. <br /> <br /> This type of French movie is probably scary for many reasons, because they probably expect it to be very artful, with deep layers and meanings. However, "Naissance des pieuvres" is a very accessible movie for everyone, and you do not necessarily have to be Euro Teen movies to appreciate this movie. It's a sweet and somewhat sensual kind of movie because of its theme and visual approach. <br /> <br /> The film is also made realistic by its actors, who do not have much experience in film film business, however, are authentic and feel within their roles. The strong individual characters give the movie some nice themes and good moments. <br /> <br /> A good movie on his topic. <br /> <br /> 7/10
