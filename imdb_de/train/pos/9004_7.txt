I had doubts about another love story in which disabled people find meaning and salvation through honest communication. And it's still not high on my list. But the performances of Helena Bonham Carter and Kenneth Branagh were exemplary, almost stunning, and save this from just another jerk. Carter's portrayal of an ALS victim is strong, sometimes exaggerated (sometimes her dialogue dissolves into indistinguishable mumbling). But the overall effect is commendable and rewarding. Branagh could be the perfect compliment to her performance. <br /> <br />
