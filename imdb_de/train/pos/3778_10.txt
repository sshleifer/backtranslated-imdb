The first film had little ambition, so nothing sticks to the canvas. It was a bad version of "Back to the Future" with zero charm. Once accepted that Bill & Ted are jokes, the joke can only affect the audience for so long before it breaks. <br /> <br /> That's a surprise. This is your only spoiler warning ... <br /> <br /> By today's standards this is more fun. At the time of publication, this was shunned, sad, considering that more talents are involved than the first time. We get the photographer of 'Face / Off', the publisher of 'Fugitive', a production designer from Burton's early works, and the sound designer of 'Matrix' first outing with something deep. Since this was avoided by the fan base and the audience, the director probably decided that the style was too extreme. It does not fit the material. Like "Death Becomes Her" and "Catch-22", you dare to be smart, but we like our movies "easy", so we do not buy them. Probably, since this had dared to be different, it took 12 producers to make it. What is so good? <br /> <br /> - Nice self reference towards Keanu; from the airhead to the Messiah. See also Arnold Schwarzenegger. <br /> <br /> - Joss hates his creations as much as he hates their colleagues, he makes his own hatred. The Evil B & T and the "good robot usses" have the same vocabulary as their originals: lesser copies and devaluation of the language. <br /> <br /> - The motive of "duality". Nowhere is this more evident than in the photography styles, many ups and downs. They even use Roy Brocksmith of 'Total Recall' to emphasize the point. <br /> <br /> - The "choices" theme. I do not know where this started in the genre (maybe 'Ghostbusters'), but it's pretty well used here. It's even about the 7 games against death - Battleship and Club. <br /> <br /> - Film self-reference, even in the game against death (Clue). This is smarter than Tarantino or Brooks. Note the title page of the Premier magazine at the end: "Bill and Ted: The Movie". Ironic also commented on how Death and Nomolos villains were in the sequels 'The Hard' and 'Lethal Weapon'. <br /> <br /> I still have a few nits, but nothing compared to the original. Music and film are different media, which is why it makes no sense why many scripts turn around the old - especially in the teen market. Carlin is a great comedian, but he's wasted in these movies. Despite all the daring that shows this effort, even if they crack gay jokes, can not kill a cat? <br /> <br /> Although it looks like a Nickelodeon production, this is incredibly interesting. From this movie we got Beavis and Butt-Head. "We are in heaven and have just attacked three people." <br /> <br /> Final analysis = = Midrange material
