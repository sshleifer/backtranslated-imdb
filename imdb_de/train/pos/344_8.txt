Another entry in the category "Holiday horror" that fills the shelves of your local video store. The "spoiler" - "naughty, nerdy teenager" who takes revenge on the "cool" kids who vilify him will, of course, be known to those who have seen him before. And those who have seen it before will probably see it again; Who expects Ingmar Bergman and later outraged at his waste of time, it should just skip. Marilyn Manson on the soundtrack and David Boreanaz, Denise Richards and Katherine Heigl as eye candy - join in and enjoy it. Oh, and I loved the scary mask.
