I've seen some movies about eating disorders, but this one was definitely my favorite. The problem with the others was that people with eating disorders just end up getting better automatically or accepting the fact that they need help, and that's it. This movie, which I thought was more realistic, does not automatically improve in this one main character Lexi. It gets better and then has a disadvantage. I think this movie shows more than the others I've seen, that better does not just happen, it's hard work and time, it's a long road to recovery. I think this movie shows it all very well. There should be more films like this.
