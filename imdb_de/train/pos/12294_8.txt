I suppose I always had the feeling that the Hotel Du Nord is a studio. The movement of the passenger car and camera was just too effortless to be filmed on location. But no problem - it is still a much underrated beautiful composition by Marcel Carne. The plot is sometimes a bit choppy, as if it would catch it, but because it is unpredictable, it keeps the attention on the bitter end. The shots, when the two lovers are alone in their room, are saddled with a rather stilted dialogue, but it's all so nice to fall into any discomfort. Are these two young people a symbol of a cancerous hopelessness in pre-war France, or simply idiots? Suicide pacts are quite common; If the suicides have a young and healthy life before they are unbridled, would you imagine anything but that they were just misleading idiots? Arletty played the role of the prostitute well - she kept this zipper on her dress consistently anyway! I've only seen a few movies with Jouvet - he's the most impressive invention as a pimp in HDN - my anger is flat: every time I see his face, I think of Sonnie Hale in Evergreen! <br /> <br /> A remarkably atmospheric, well-made and photographed film that happens so much that a few tours are required to do it all. Annabella and Aumont formed an exceptionally beautiful couple; Francois (Heurtebise) Perier had a small amusing role as a gay man in his second movie. All in all: wonderful.
