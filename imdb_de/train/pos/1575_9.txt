The Van Trotta movie Rosenstra√üe is the best movie I've seen in years. Actually, I'm not really interested in movies with a historical background, but with that she won my interest for this time !! The only annoying thing about the movie was the scenes in New York and the impression I had "tried to be as American as possible" ... which in my opinion has absolutely failed. <br /> <br /> The scenes in the background really came to my heart. The German actress Katja Riemann has earned her award absolutely. She is one of the most impressive actresses I have ever seen. in the future I will see more of her films. great luck for me that i am german speaking =) and only for one year in the usa, so i will buy some riemann dvds as soon as i get back. So all those out there who have not seen this movie yet: WATCH IT !!! I think it would be too long to describe what it is all about, especially all the flashbacks and switches of the times are hard to explain, but just watcxh it, you will be amazed !!!!!!!
