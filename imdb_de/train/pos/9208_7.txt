"The Shooter" was a different kind of movie for Michael Dudikoff. Although he is usually associated with action flickers that contain martial arts, because he was a western, this film allowed him to show that he is a far more capable actor than certain Formula Story lines have allowed. The major problem, of course, is that the movie does not allow for solid character development. The meddling is really up to the viewer. We can only guess what sadness the shooter, whose real name is Michael Atherton, is the killer he is - a killer, you, a murderer, a small town terrorized by a local tyrant, as a hero who can be freed from his misery.
