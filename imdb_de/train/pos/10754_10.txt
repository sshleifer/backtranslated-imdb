I was a little skeptical if I was to look at this when it was first shown on CBS. I was one of the many people who were in NYC that day. I went to school at Hunter College. I did not want to see the degeneration and the carnage again, but how many was I curious to see what it was all about. Tears came to my eyes when I saw this documentary. All my memories came back and only the intense pictures were incredible. I bought the DVD for the one-year anniversary and watched it a couple of times. It was amazing how these guys could record this material. If you have not seen this documentary, do yourself a favor and check it out. It is obviously depressing and will bring tears to your eyes, but it is an incredible document of the darkest hour of this land.
