Definitely one of the funniest and most twisted Who Dunnit I've ever seen. Christopher Reeve and Michael Caine were brilliant and guided me through the whole thing. <br /> <br /> Very stylish sets and props really add a sense of atmosphere to the process. The minimalist feel works for the whole picture. <br /> <br /> My only complaint is not the movie itself, but the lack of a decent widescreen version of the movie on DVD. I own the full-screen version (which proves I love the movie enough to endure a full-screen presentation), but a great deluxe or special edition would certainly make my money.
