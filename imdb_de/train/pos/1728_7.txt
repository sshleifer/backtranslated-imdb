The Wooden Horse was one of the first "big" escape stories from World War II. She told the true story of Eric Williams and others fleeing the Stalag Lufft III in October 1943. I read the book in high school after watching a part of the movie on television in the early 1960s. Peter and John's taunting drama tries to flee Germany during the war is more realistic than the curse of flight depicted in the Great Escape. This film is a lost treasure that should be made more accessible to the American public.
