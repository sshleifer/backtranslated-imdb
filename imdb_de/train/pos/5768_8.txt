A collapse in a nuclear power plant makes a majority of people turn into deadly, rotten zombies that are cruel by nature. A ragged handful of uninfected people are doing their best to survive this grueling ordeal. Director / co-writer / producer Todd Sheets shows a genuine, sincere love and passion for an exciting, vivacious and gruesome horror movie: he maintains an unshakeable, pervasive pace and fills the screen with wall-to-wall madness action, holding the terrible dialogue fortunately to a minimum. Plus, Sheets certainly does not save the glorious graphics and exaggerated over-the-top splatter: this image provides a tasty load of meat meltdown, gutting, lots of stomach chewing, a guy has torn his heart out, and there's even a nice task on a branch. Sheets earns bonus points when the tone is kept dark and evil to the literally bitter end (for example, almost all the main characters become zombie chow). Granted, this streak has a lot of bugs: The rough cut, several crazed pathos, and the largely horrible drama of a rank-no-cast leave much to be desired. The best honors go to the pretty and sassy Kasey Rausch for her winning, spooky portrayal of the resourceful Daria Trumillio. Frank Dunlay is also a good opponent for the robust military veteran Ralph Walsh. Best of all, Sheets's confident understanding of an infectious Slambang feeling of unyielding head momentum and an obvious affinity for the horror genre make it a real eye-catcher from start to finish.
