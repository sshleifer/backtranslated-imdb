In fact, this is one of the movies that you should give 7.5. The fact is; As I said, it's a lot of fun. Wonderfully atmospheric. Although Askey may seem exaggerated, it's a great vehicle for him, just like Oh, Mr. Porter is for Will Hay. If you like old Dark House movies and trains, this is definitely for you. Oddly enough, it's the kind of movie you always want to see. It is friendly and charming in a lovable way with all the nostalgic references that experienced great wartime. The 'odd' group of characters just play each other out, as in many other typical British war movies. It would have been wonderful to have seen this movie if it had been recorded in the Ealing Studios. Too bad that the original of 1931 has not remained intact
