I have always enjoyed the Pokemon movies. Yes, I know, everyone is very hackneyed, mediocre and safe in some areas, even if they are aimed at small children who are too grown-up in some areas to protect them by saying, "Hey, lighten, it's one Kids movie. "But apart from that, are not they always good entertainments? In my opinion they are like that and I enjoy them very much. This is just as enjoyable as the previous three and certainly cuter. There have been some really sweet and touching moments since the endearing, fresh Pokemon Celebi. It's not the best Pokemon movie, but I enjoy it more than the third part, even though the third is not bad and the entire series is just entertaining, harmless and the fun of the popcorn family and nothing more and nothing less everything else should be considered. This film is characterized by a lot of intensity and interest, especially with regard to the climax / end, as well as all the rates and the characters. The slightly less glamorous than the previous three are, I think, still sympathetic and humorous. This movie is the lowest rated and the most criticized of the four feature length adaptations, and it does not deserve that.
