Julia Ross (Nina Foch) agrees to take a position as secretary to the wealthy Hughes family to leave her boyfriend who has left her. Almost immediately, she is drugged and shipped to the family estate in Cornwall. When she wakes up, tell her that she is Marion Hughes, mentally ill and kept her locked up ... but why? You probably know why, but it does not matter because it's fun. <br /> <br /> Together with "The Narrow Margin" and "Face Behind the Mask" this is one of the best B-pictures ever made. (B-pictures were low-budget images that were created quickly with low budgets and no big stars). It is only as long as necessary (only 65 minutes), is purposeful, fast and exciting. It just stumbles in the end, which I found too implausible for something. <br /> <br /> Foch (a good actress) is fine, but Lady May Witty is great and George Macready is excellent (and frightening)) like the bad guys. The catch is worth it. A perfect example of how to make a great movie on a budget.
