This film was a fascinating look at the Creole culture and society that few African Americans know. My two children are from a paternal grandmother whose father was a member of the Gens de couleur libre and a black skinwoman whose parents were former slaves. He married outwardly and against his culture and was excluded from his entire family, with the exception of a sister who felt pity for the plight of her brothers; To raise 8 children during the Great Depression of 1929; provide the family with food whenever she could. Of course, she secretly helped this family out of fear for her own ex-communication. My daughter was fascinated by the movie. We have made it part of our library.
