Seeing "Moonstruck" after so many years reminds of how cute and sensationally funny this movie was when it first appeared. Who would have thought Cher could act? Who had ever heard of Olympia Dukakis? Nicholas Cage was the beginning of his career, and Vincent Gardenia and Danny Aiello were not known for their comedic talents, nor was Norman Jewison the director. <br /> <br /> The only really flat note in this great work is "When the moon hits your eye like a big pizza pie, that's Amore," a song sung too often in the movie (once upon a time too many) and that had a long afterlife in pop music. <br /> <br /> Cher is - forgive me - sensational as Loretta Castorini, a widow who wants to marry and does not need to be in love with the groom. Aielo (Johny Cammareri) suggests this and offers her his small ring as a substitute for an engagement ring, then hurries to Sicily to be with his dying mother. He accuses Loretta of making sure that his brother Ronny takes part in the wedding. Loretta confronts Ronny and quickly falls in love with him. Meanwhile, her father (Vincent Gardenia) cheats on her mother (Olympia Dukakis), whom Loretta accidentally discovers when Ronny invites her to the Metropolitan Opera. <br /> <br /> Everything works out in the end as it is inevitable in films of this genre. Meanwhile, all actors are admirable and the audience enjoys. In its own way, "Moonstruck" was what Hollywood was once best at: insane entertainment without any social meaning. If only they had lost That's Amore, that would have been perfect.
