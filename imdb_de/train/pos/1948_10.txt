This is a great ending to the show. The fact that Adm. Janeway, who was able to switch Borg twice, was great. The fact that she became infected, infecting the queen with a "poison" that essentially ended the Borg, was great. The way they ended also left something, not much for a reunification film. They brought them home and it was fantastic !! It was sad to say goodbye to a part of my family. I finish by saying that Tom and B'Lanna got their baby when they enter the Alpha Quad. was a great way to show a fresh start. It would be nice to have a reunion film - just to see where the characters are today.
