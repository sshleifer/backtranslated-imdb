Since I'm so interested in sea monsters, I really dug up this movie. This movie is worth seeing. If you like the horrible things, they are good movies. The effects are really good, just think of "Land of the Lost". I originally watched this movie in the early 90's, maybe more like 89/90 in a local channel show called "Morgus Presents". I was not scared, but I was 8 years old and everything B was more like an A Years later I saw it on a DVD in a local Circuit City and bought it right away so I can give it a 9 because it has a personal spot in my heart with The Monster Squad and Gremlins. Good B-movie fun for all ages.
