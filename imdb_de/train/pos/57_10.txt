I have to say that this is one of the best movies I have ever seen! I was bored and looked through the TV. and found "Home Room" and it was already in about 5 mins, but I became addicted. It was so interesting and moving. It shows what can happen in every life. I give a 10, if possible more. The director / writer and the actors have done a great job. I think teens should see this movie and learn from it. It was great, drama, puzzles and more. I cried for hours! I think the director / writer should write more movies like this one. I loved it! I did not know about this movie, which is sad because it was so good. I wish it could see more people in the movies.
