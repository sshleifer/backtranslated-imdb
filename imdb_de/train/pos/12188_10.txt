Pure Orson Welles genius makes this one of the best movies. Welles is implicated in a murder conspiracy, only to be pitched as a fall man, which he calls the sarcastic commentary "big fool I am". The plot is so complex that I still do not know if the victim knew his life was about to die. The Carnival Mirror Hall shootout scene is one of the most amazing ever shot. This scene alone is worth the price of admission. This is the only time that Rita Hayworth has played a complex but credible role. No one except Welles would have had the nerve to cut her hair and dye it blonde blonde. Nobody should miss this picture.
