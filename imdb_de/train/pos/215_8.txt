The word "classic" is being thrown around too easily nowadays, but this movie deserves the assignment. The combination of Neil Simon, Walter Matthau (possibly the world's best living comic actor) and the late George Burns is a masterpiece of comedy. It's interesting to think about what the movie would have been if Jack Benny had not been prevented by death from playing George Burns as planned. As it stands, the reunification scene in Matthaus' apartment is unlikely to be outdone as a page splitter. Definitely one of my lonely island films. <br /> <br /> "Enter !!!!!!!!!"
