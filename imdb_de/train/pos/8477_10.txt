in a less conventional sense of the word. <br /> <br /> This movie was one of my favorites as a young kid, and I remembered it recently and thought about looking it up. While many details in my head are no longer clear, the general feeling that the film has given me has stayed with me over the years. <br /> <br /> If parents feel that their children can deal with mature and sometimes violent topics then I recommend this movie. It has taught me a lot about life and death and has produced a lot of emotions in me. To this day it is one of my favorite movies.
