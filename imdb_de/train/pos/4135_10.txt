This is an absolutely adorable movie, one of my favorite romantic comedies. It's extremely funny and the cast is wonderful. Although Laurence Olivier is mainly associated with his Shakespeare work, he shows in this film that he is by no means allowed to play only classical theater. He makes the transition from a cynical divorce lawyer who shuns women and their treacherous ways to a lovesick puppy effortlessly played by Lady X. The dialogue is wonderfully funny and refreshing and the atmosphere is charming. Ralph Richardson was also a pleasure to look at. I highly recommend it.
