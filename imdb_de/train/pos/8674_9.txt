This is a typical Tom and Jerry short form - a situation is created, conflicts arise and chaos arises. The characters behave appropriately, the natural tensions between different characters lead to general chaos. The best (and funniest) part is when the peace treaty is in force and respected - all sorts of strange wonders occur before your eyes. A word of warning - it is extremely unwise to help Tom carry out your morning cleaning routine! Highly recommended.
