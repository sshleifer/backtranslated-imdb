Reda is a young Frenchman of Moroccan descent. Despite his Muslim heritage, he is very French in his attitudes and values. Out of the blue, his father announces that Reda will drive him to Hajj (pilgrimage route) to Mecca - something Reda is not interested in, but agrees to without obligation. As a result, Reda is upset from the beginning, but since he is a traditional Muslim, it is difficult to talk to his father or discuss his concerns. Both father and son seem very rigid and inflexible - and it is very ironic when the father tells his son that he should not be so stubborn. When I read the abstract, it talks about how much the characters are growing and getting to know each other. But I do not think they did that, and that's the fascinating and sad aspect of the movie. Sure, there were times of understanding, but so often there was hostility and oppression. I really liked that and estimated that there was no complete solution - as it would have proved wrong. <br /> <br /> Overall, the film is well played and fascinating - it gives the West an unusual insight into Islam and the Hajj. It also offers a fascinating juxtaposition of traditional Islam and the secular younger generation. While the slow pace and lack of clarity about the relationship throughout the movie make some annoying, I think the film has given it intense realism and made it look like a movie about people - not just any formula. A beautiful and unusual movie.
