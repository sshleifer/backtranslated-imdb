Finally, I set up for DVD sending by mail order, so I could find movies that are not available to me in stores. I chose The Souler Opposite because I love Christopher Meloni and also like small, often ignored movies. <br /> <br /> This is a real treat! Meloni has such a charm in this part. It's easy to dip him in a pigeon hole if you only see him as his alter ego Elliot Stabler (LOSVU). In this film, Meloni is an out-of-the-way mid-lifer who kicks in various ways to find an unexpected path to happiness. <br /> <br /> The relationship between Barry (Meloni) and Tim Busfield's character is realistic and not exaggerated. I have not seen Busfield for 30 years, and it was fun to watch him. But it was all Chris' movie. I became such a fan girl again. <br /> <br /> In the beginning it's a bit slow, I'll admit. I thought some of the "flashbacks" might have been cut down. But overall, this movie will inspire you - male or female - because it has an honest, refreshing view of today's relationships.
