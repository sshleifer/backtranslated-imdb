"Midnight Cowboy" was rated 1969 with the original release X. There are some scenes where you can only understand this a bit. The movie about Joe Buck (Jon Voight), who came from Texas to New York City to become a hustler, is sometimes a bit disturbing. Disguised as a cowboy, he tries to live as a hustler by making money through love. It does not work the way he planned. After a guy named Rico 'Ratso' first made a joke on him and stole some money from Rizzo (Dustin Hoffman), they become friends. You live in an empty and very dirty apartment. Then Ratso gets sick and Joe has to try to make some money. <br /> <br /> The movie was probably rated Main Theme X, but on the way we see some weird things. The editing in this movie is great. We see dream sequences of Joe and Ratso interrupted in a nice and sometimes funny way by the real world. Dustin Hoffman, Jon Voight and the supporting cast are performing well. Especially Hoffman delivers some fine lines. The score is by John Barry and sounds great. All this makes this movie a great movie that has a good reason to win the Best Picture Oscar.
