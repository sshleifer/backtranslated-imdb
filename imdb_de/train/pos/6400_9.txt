This movie is a great example of good storytelling. The spectacle is great. The story is inspirational without being overly manipulative or fake. There were a few issues where people probably did a bit more good or bad than they really were, but since it's a Hollywood movie, they showed amazing restraint. The film did not show a single explosion, though they had an opportunity. Although the film had exciting parts, it was not turned into an action movie. The story thus focuses on an extraordinary man in unfortunately ordinary times. Well done!
