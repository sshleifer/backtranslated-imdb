Do not listen to the biting critics, who are probably bitter gamers, still hurt by the roast that Silverman awarded at the Spike TV Video Game Awards a few months ago, fits in well with an Adult Swim lineup. When Silverman cheers down the youthful "doody" jokes and underscores the show's darker, mean undercurrent program, the show so far is just an indication that we might have one of the biggest cult comedies since the canceled "Strangers With Candy". But just watching the pilot is just a solid, not outstanding, unconventional dark comedy / musical, but with enormous potential. <br /> <br /> Silverman has created a witty nanny with a figure - a prettier, younger American version of the deceased great Jerri Blank's American princess, and the show features one of the most unconventional, non-stereotypical depictions of a gay couple, I've ever seen on TV. Early reviews indicate that the next episodes will surpass the pilot. I can not wait to see how this series evolves.
