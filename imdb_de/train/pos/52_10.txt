This movie is incredible. If you have the chance, look at it. Although, a warning, you will yell your eyes. I do it every time I see it, and I own it and have seen it often. The services are excellent. It deals with darkness and pain and loss, but there is hope. This film has made me look at the world differently: Deputy experience, according to my English teacher. If you have seen it, also pay attention to the interesting use of shadow and light. Home Room is a phenomenal movie and I appreciate it 10/10 - really - because of the outstanding acting, the amazing plot and the heartbreaking dialogue. Very tense, very moving. Does not give all the answers, but makes many good points about humanity
