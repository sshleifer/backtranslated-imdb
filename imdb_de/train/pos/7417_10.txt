This beautiful story about an older son who comes home and has learned to love and be part of all the things he has left to get away is poignant and moving. It shows a society that may be alien to us in the Western world, with a sense of family that we have lost. The story is beautiful, sad and sometimes funny and funny. It has the feeling of realism that we no longer seem to see in our western films. <br /> <br /> The spectacle is unusual, as it almost gives the impression in the course of the film that this is not the case, but a documentary by ordinary people. That's brilliant directing and filmmaking. <br /> <br /> I would like to see more films from this director.
