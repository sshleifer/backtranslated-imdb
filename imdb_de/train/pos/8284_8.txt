This is one of those unique horror films that requires a much more mature understanding of the word "horror" to honor it. The main thing that people can not realize is that this story is told from the point of view of a little boy, and like most younger kids he gets scared easily. Mainly because he just does not understand things, for example, why his father is hardly there for him. As you watch the movie, you can see how the husband and wife cut the balance between working hours and family time, and you can easily understand it, but the little boy does not. One can also imagine that the boy is afraid of the forest, because early in the film it is determined that the family comes from the city. In the beginning, when the family travel to the house, they beat a deer, then they are stopped, then they quarrel with the locals about it and the little boy certainly did not find this introduction to the forest pleasant. <br /> <br /> The "Wendigo" is ultimately what his young, innocent mind invented to explain all of this. There is the Native American legend, but if you look at the scene in which the boy learns about it, it is explained to him simply and simply. Not because that's the Wendigo, but because he understands it that way. If you look at the movie from this point of view, you can really appreciate it. Obviously the budget had been shot low and cheaply, but the bouncing montages, the use of light, and the general weirdness more than make up for it. And the last question the movie asks is: Is it all in your head or is it really out there? 8/10 <br /> <br /> Rated R: Obscenity, violence and a sex scene
