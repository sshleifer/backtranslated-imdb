I've read a couple of reviews of this movie and I have to say, "What's wrong with you?!?!" That was an excellent movie! I loved this movie from start to finish and the story was told extremely well. I'm convinced that people who did not like this movie did not pay much attention to the movie. There are a number of very important scenes in which you get confused if you are not careful, and the following scenes may not make sense. I urge anyone who does not like this movie to look at it again and look at it alone, so you can really be careful. The story made perfect sense for me and was, as I said, very well told. Every scene in the movie has a point and at the end of the movie everything fits together. <br /> <br /> All the actors did a fantastic job! Sean Connery was as always very good in his role. Laurence Fishburne was outstanding as Tanny Brown and played a very interesting character. Kate Capshaw was also a nice touch and looks awesome. Blair Underwood was a pleasant surprise, I did not really expect anything big, but he did a great job. Ed Harris was the true gem in the movie. He plays a really sick person and lets you really see how disturbed his character is. Watch his eyes in his scenes, just great !!! There is also a very young Scarlett Johansson (as Kate) in one of her first roles ... not a bad starting place. Excellent cast in this movie! <br /> <br /> I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes one of the performers or just likes thrillers. This is a great movie and should be seen. Do not listen to the opinions of these others, watch the movie and come to your own conclusions. I hope you will see the movie and I hope you enjoy it as much as I do. Thanks for reading, <br /> <br /> -Chris
