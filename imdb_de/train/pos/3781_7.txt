I would not say that this movie is better than the original, but it is already very good in itself. But the comedy in this movie is as good as the original. There are so many scenes that make me laugh, just thinking about it. <br /> <br /> The story in this movie is even more bizarre than the original, but that's what makes it so great. Peter Hewitt is doing a great job with a great cast. The core of the original movie returns to its characters and everyone does a fantastic job with their roles. I do not care what anyone says. I think Keanu Reeves is a great actor! I really enjoyed his portrayal of Ted in these two films, as did Alex Winters Bill. I was very happy to see George Carlin return to the role of Rufus, very cool! Hal London Jr, who plays the role of Ted Logan's dad, does a really good job. The scene in which Ted owns his father's body and Hal London Jr behaves like Ted is a great scene, and he does it impressively well. I can not forget to mention William Sadler as a death, he made the movie completely for me. The rest of the cast is pretty good too. <br /> <br /> If you liked the first part of the series Bill and Ted, I would hope you enjoyed this movie. But do not expect it to be as good as the original. I really hope you like the movie, thanks for reading, <br /> <br /> -Chris
