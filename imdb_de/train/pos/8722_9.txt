For starters, it's a very funny movie with some crazy characters making you laugh (see the two Russian bugs). A Bug's Life has a classic Disney storyline, but that's one of the good things about the movie. Family values ​​are praised and the main characters of the film undergo a certain development in order to assert themselves against the grasshoppers in the end. And there are some great voice-overs by Dave Foley, Julia-Louise Dreyfus and Kevin Spacey (of course), but the coolest thing about this movie is the animation. It's just wonderful. Every detail, great colors, every ant looks different, beautiful backgrounds ... And the guys and girls from Pixar made everything look so realistic. All in all a very nice job. This is the best animation of Disney since Aladdin.
