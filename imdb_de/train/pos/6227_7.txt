Definitely one of the smaller of the Astaire / Rogers musicals. It is very badly plotted. For example, it only runs a few minutes longer than the swing time, but feels much longer. This is partly due to the secondary romance between Randolph Scott and Harriet Hilliard. Scott is rarely interesting. I like Hilliard. She is cute and I love at least one of her songs: "But where are you?" ("Get Thee Behind Me Satan", her other number, is a faint rest of Top Hat, fortunately cut out of this masterpiece). Follow the Fleet would actually be a bad movie if not for at least three brilliant dance sequences between Astaire and Rogers. The dance competition competes for the first place of his numbers. The dance is just fantastic. "I put all my eggs in a basket" introduces the two, rehearsing a dance that they have not yet perfected. Their imperfections make it even more perfect. And "Let's Face the Music and Dance" is undoubtedly one of Irving Berlin's best songs. The movie is well worth it for its great moments.
