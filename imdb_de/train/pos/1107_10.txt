In the classical sense of the four humor (which does not refer specifically to the concept of the funny or even the entertainment) Altmans "H.E.A.L.T.H." treats all jokes in a fun and entertaining way. There is the slime, as embodied by Lauren Bacall's very slow, protected and protective figure, Esther Brill, whose life's work seems to revolve only on the outside, protecting the secrets of her age and beauty more than her well-being. There is Paul Dooley's choleric Dr. Gil Gainey, who breaks frenetically like a fish out of the water (perhaps more like a seal), barks and admonishes the crowds to sign his madness of water. The melancholy of Glenda Jackson's Isabella Garnell smells of Shakespeare's restless and self-righteous Hamlet - and even offers one or two monologues. And let's not forget Henry Gibson's bile character Bobby Hammer ("The breast that feeds the baby rules the world"). Then there are the characters Harry Wolff and Gloria Burbank (respectively James Garner and Carol Burnett), relatively healthy characters, who are looking for a balance between all the companions and extreme humor required for H.E.A.L.T.H. - a kind of World Trade Organization based on H.E.A.L.T.H. specializing in anything but health. This is Altman at his best.
