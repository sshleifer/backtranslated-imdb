The steel, mighty gangster leader Frankie Diomede (the always grandiose Lee Van Cleef in fine, robust form) was himself arrested and put in jail, so that he can find a treacherous partner without arrest. The shabby Goofball fan and the mad wannabe Tony Breda (a loveable portrayal of Tony Lo Bianco) is also defeated. Frank and Tony form an unlikely friendship behind bars. Tony helps Frank escape from the joint and helps him to take revenge on a rival gang of gangsters led by the reckless Louis Annunziata (smoothly played by Jean Rochefort). Director Michele Lupo, who works on a gripping screenplay by Sergio Donati and Luciano Vincenzoni, tells the neat story at a constant pace, receives a suitably somber but occasionally light-hearted tone, and stages the rousing action sets with a sizeable, rattling Brio rough, incontestable prison shower beating and a lengthy chase of mondo destructo as definitely exciting highlights). Van Cleef and Lo Bianco show a nice, easy and responsive chemistry on the screen. The relationship between their characters is alternately funny and touching. The gorgeous Edwige Fenech is unfortunately not much to do as Tony's tiny friend Orchidea, but she can carry her insanely gorgeous and voluptuous body in a very popular, bare shower scene. Riz Ortolani's groovy, pulsating, syncopated funk / jazz score certainly hits the soul-stirring point. The polished cinematography of Joe D'Amato and Aldo Tonti is also impressive. A really chic and entertaining little winner.
