Spielberg's first dramatic film is not a flop. It's a beautiful movie with no flaws in the life of an African American woman. It also proves that not all films with the African-American ethnicity at the heart of the story need to be led by an African-American director. <br /> <br /> What I love about this movie is Spielberg's ability to make it very realistic, even though it's based on a book. Also, Danny Glover was excellent as a Mr. and usually he's just himself in most of his movies. But here he branches out completely and is somebody else. The power resistance of the entire film, however, comes from Whoopi Goldberg. She is honored as Celie. You will never forget these characters once you have seen this movie. <br /> <br /> Well, I've heard that the musical version of it will be a movie as well, and I can only say: I hope it's about as good as this, because this movie should not be missing.
