hi, im scott (A.K.A woody7739) I love the movie Twisted Desire, and I love watching Melissa Joan Hart on TV while I think she's fine. I'm also a real fan of Sabrina, the teenage witch, and that helped me to look at her (not ask). I love the way nicole murders her parents to kill very carefully because she makes sure someone else pulls the trigger and applies it to the bottles so she does not give away her fingerprints (a very well-planned idea), Back, I think everyone failed at Nicole when she was caught when her old friend came and put a hidden camera under his shirt. I give this movie nine out of ten and put it in my top 10 movie list. And last but not least, if someone sees this movie in stores, please tell me how I saw it on TV and did not record it. bye
