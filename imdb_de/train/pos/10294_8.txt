Jim Carrey and Morgan Freeman team up with Jennifer Aniston to make one of the funniest films of this 2003 season (late May), and a great improvement on Carrey's crazy and personally forgotten roles in past comedies. With a little mellow Carrey antics, but only with the crackle and crackle of his old self, Carrey powerfully carries this movie to the climax of laughter and also to dramatic, tearful, bleak moments. Elements of Jim's real acting skills continue to show in this film. This adorable summer entertainment works on most buttons, including dramatic elements and the silly moments that go perfectly with this script. While Bruce Allightly does not yet have the superbly honed comedy / drama ensemble, it does deserve to be a great date movie, along with a solid message and gentle spiritual cynicism and a parody that preserves its good-natured taste. Eight out of ten stars.
