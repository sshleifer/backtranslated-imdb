If you are a purist, do not waste time - otherwise, keep your hat and enjoy the adventure. I loved the Stewart Granger / Deborah Kerr version - I've seen it several times, but this movie is just as good, just different. I will not go into the differences as this would spoil the movie. It's also a pleasure to see Alison Doody again (I'm a big Indiana Jones fan). I think the quality of the understudy is one of Hallmark Production's hallmarks, and this movie was no exception. The cinematography is great and the score is perfect. If you are looking for entertainment, you will not be disappointed.
