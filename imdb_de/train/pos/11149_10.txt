Joe Buck (Jon Voight) decides to leave his small Texas life and grow up in the big city. The women are there to ask, and the men are mainly "Tutti-Fruttis". With big eyes he comes to New York City, not prepared for the series of humiliating mishaps he experiences, one that is worse than the other. In the midst of this chaos, he meets and befriends Rico "Ratso" Rizzo, a homeless-looking man living in what appears to be a condemned building. <br /> <br /> There's no big story MIDNIGHT COWBOY is a series of vignettes designed to bring Joe Buck not only in the city, but also in his past and show us in shock cuts and semi-psychedelic dream sequences of his past: his failed relationship with his girlfriend Annie (Jennifer Salt), who was raped by a gang, his abandonment of his mother, and his apparent mistreatment by his grandmother, who also had a habit of forcing men over for money. A touch of pessimism dominates the movie almost from the wistful beginning, while Nilsson plays his deceptively flowery "Everybody's Talking" during the opening credits; Even if we want Joe to take his mark in the city sometime, we think the odds are high that he will not work for a few cents on a dead end - which is shown in a masterful shot from his outer point Later in the movie you will see a man in a soup kitchen working through a window as a dishwasher and seeing himself. We know from his eyes that he does not want to end like this. <br /> <br /> John Schlesinger, a dark story with destroyed hopes, creates haunting images of lost souls at the end of the 60s Focusing on the prevailing friendship between two men struggling to make sense of their lives, in the midst of the elusive comfort of a dignified life. There's the implied idea that they might be lovers - Ratso strives to hug Joe in the party scene, and her final hug in the end certainly indicates - but this is essentially a buddy movie that literally survives to the death and bring Joe a form of hope that in the end in Florida seems much different, older and wiser.
