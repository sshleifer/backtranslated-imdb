If you like Deep Purple, you'll be starring in this great movie starring Stephen Rea. The story is about the most famous rock band of the 70s, Strange Fruits, and they decided to play together again. But of course there will be many problems during their concerts. Jimmy Nail and Bill Nighy are great and the song "The Flame Still Burns" is perfect. You have to see it.
