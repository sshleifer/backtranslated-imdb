This movie was a really great movie about something that concerns us all. I know that I have often encountered it personally. Fortunately, Will Smith has addressed the social problem of the SMS while driving. People, do not do it. An hour and forty-five minutes is not enough for this thing. Personally, I wanted to throw my phone away after the movie. I was glad to see other people in the theater seeing the news and shaking their phones with the empty bags of popcorn. I decided to disable all text messages on my phone and encourage others to do the same. If you care about your family, you should force them to watch this important public service announcement about text messages while driving, or kill seven people. Thank you for showing us the way.
