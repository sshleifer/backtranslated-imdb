When I was about ten years old, I watched Pufnstuf every weekend. It was right after Bay City Rollers. I saw that one day it came to Family Channel, and took it for my then three-year-old daughter. I forgot all the things I had loved as a child, the Magic Flute, the Zoom Broom, the makeup of Witcheepoo. <br /> <br /> This show is very low-tech. The mayor is certainly a precedent for Mayor McCheese, and everyone is a stuffed creature with annoying googly eyes. But kids love this stuff. By the way, they would watch a guy working on a sock puppet instead of sitting in front of high-tech computer animations. There is a (mild) slapstick, but no adult themes like sex or dying, and children accept Jimmy's programs. Kids think it would be nice to carry a bag of smoke around and convince someone that their house is on fire, and I loved that my daughter thought, every time she saw a ray in the sky, Witchypoo flew over them. The music is old, but you really get used to it, and my daughter really loved it. She sang in the car "different is hard, different is lonely". My daughter watched this show at least once a day for about 5 months, and she is still one of her favorites. <br /> <br /> I see that a new Pufnstuf 2000 is in progress. I really hope they try to keep the old flair and do nothing like computer animating characters, etc. I think a whole new generation would love Pufnstuf.
