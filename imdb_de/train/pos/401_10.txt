I just came from Hong Kong for my summer holidays and saw the legend of ZU. I thought it was happening! It was so creative and unique. It's the crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon with much less drama. Although some thought there were too many special effects (yes, right!), One can not complain about the cast. Zhang Ziyi and Cecilia Cheung are so good !!! The legend of ZU ..... enters * s !!!!!!!!
