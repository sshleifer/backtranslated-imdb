I caught the last night on the plate. I liked the movie. I traveled to Russia three times (adoption of our 2 children). I can not say exactly why I liked this movie differently than seeing "bad" "good" and "good" half bad. I liked the look Ben Chaplin made throughout the movie. Like "I can not believe that happens to me", whether it's good or bad, it looks the same (and it works). Great ending. 10.7. Rent it or catch it like me on the plate.
