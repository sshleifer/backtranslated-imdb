The film begins with Bill Coles (Melvyn Douglas), in which he tells a story of how his best friend - Jim Blandings (Cary Grant) and his family - make him a client - and is closely involved in a small apartment in New York Inadequate storage space housed too few bathrooms. When Jim's wife, Muriel (Myrna Loy), wants to renovate the apartment, the advertising expert Jim falls in love with an ad for a house. As soon as he's bought the house, bills and frustration keep piling up as anything that can go wrong with building Jim's 'Dream House' goes awry. <br /> <br /> One in three collaborations between Grant and Loy is a charming little comedy - not very exhausting, without a really great message, but a great way to spend an hour or two. The laughter is there from the beginning, when the alarm rings and Jim tries to shut it off, only to be thwarted by Muriel at every turn. The timing and implementation of the comic lines and situations can only be specified by a few experienced professionals, and that's what Grant and Loy offer us: brilliant achievements, simple chemistry and lots of fun. Myrna Loy is in a pretty ungrateful role (it's obvious that Grant's character gets Jim the lion's share of the lines and acting and Grant, as always, subtracts both with remarkable sovereignty), but she gives Muriel color, life and bite that only Myrna Loy can give a character. Melvyn Douglas also plays to the perfection of a funny pleasure and never hits a wrong note. <br /> <br /> One of my favorite scenes must definitely be when Bill locks himself in the "storeroom" and Jim goes to "rescue" him ... just to catch everyone! Every little problem that crops up in the Blandings renovation project - including petty jealousy and an advertising campaign for "Wham" - seems to bring together everything that might go wrong in building a new home, but makes it believable and makes it a pleasant watch. 8.10
