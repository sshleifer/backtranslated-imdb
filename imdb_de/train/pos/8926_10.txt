I do not think that apart from Terrence Malick and maybe Tran Anh Hung, cinema is on a purer level than Claire Denis. That said, I do not love this new movie as much as its 2001 masterpiece "Trouble Every Day" (though it comes very close), which itself is one of my absolute favorite movies. It's just because the story here may be a bit too elliptical to do any good for yourself. Do not get me wrong, the fact that this movie has hardly any plot is really one of the best stuff, but I think Denis took it about a degree longer than was necessary and so the movie flirts with incomprehensibility, and one a few important points of action would have to be clarified somehow (so the main character goes to South Korea to transplant his heart instead of suddenly showing him there, without explaining where he is right now or why he is there). Also, some of the other characters seemed to be needless and as if it were only excuses for Denis to use actors she likes again (Beatrice Dal's character is a bit distracting, because you always expect her to have some meaning). Still, the movie is unbelievably exciting and the cinematography is incredible. It's definitely a masterpiece in its own way. At least as good as Denis 'Beau Travail', if not better. Claire Denis must be my favorite director at this point, even better than Leos Carax. I also have to admit that the South Korean sequence "Lost in Translation" really does better than the movie itself (and, unlike some, I'm also a big fan of this movie).
