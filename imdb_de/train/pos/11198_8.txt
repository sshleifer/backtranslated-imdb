Hitchcock shows his already developed understanding of visuals in this early silent movie. The action of the film, in which two boxers fight for a girl, is a straightforward drama, without much to recommend. However, Hitchcock's talent lies in his impressive use of images. Almost every shot is filled with visual symbols. Especially memorable is the jewelry a boxer gives the girl just before she marries the other boxer. He puts it clearly sexually in the arm and with a simple movement Hitch has shown us everything we need to know. The boxing scenes are well treated with some interesting point-of-view footage, once again showing how far Hitchcock was ahead of his time. The film also gives insight into his later treatment of women. The goal of the boxers' wishes is determined by money and lust, not by reason or love. The only other women in the movie are either beautiful party girls offering open sex offerings or old women helping to break up happy relationships. All in all, the ring is a must for anyone interested in Hitchcock's early work and his development as a visual storyteller.
