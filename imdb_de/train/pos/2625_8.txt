Surprisingly not terrible and well animated for one of Disney's direct to throw away videos. As with the previous sequel (The Lion King 2), I was glad that Disney brought most of the original voice actors with them, which makes a big difference and keeps traditional animations at a good level. The action wanders around for a while, but we are distracted by an endless series of jokes ranging from funny to dull. To break the freestanding plot and jokes, they gave us some stupid musical sequences that, like the jokes, range from entertaining to a quick trip to the fridge. For the most part, the MST3K-like moments are boring and full of untapped potential and really add little more to the movie than a vehicle for a one-hour flashback. The new characters are at least sympathetic, and the old characters are doing their thing, so I can not fault them. Overall, this movie is not bad and provides a frivolous filler between the more serious Lion King titles.
