I recommend images that try something different. Many films seem like an imitation of old ideas. That's why I recommend Passport Pimlico so much. <br /> <br /> The movie is shot shortly after World War II and the post-war shortage and rationing seems to be London's "Barmy". The film is about a small neighborhood in London called Pimlico. They too are tired of not being able to buy what they want, but they see no way out. Until they happen to find a hidden treasure and a charter that officially designated this area as a sovereign nation hundreds of years ago! With this document you can bypass all rationing and coupons and live life at will, as it turns out that they really are not British subjects! Where the film comes from and how the crisis is ultimately resolved, you should see for yourself. Leave it to the brilliant minds of Ealing Studios to find this gem!
