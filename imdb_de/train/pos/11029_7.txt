I'm far from a Sylvester Stallone fan and I guess the only time I really appreciated him was the French movie Taxi 3, which is an almost unfulfilled little role. And yet I have to admit that this movie was not that bad, even though I feared the worst. <br /> <br /> When Gabe (Stallone) can not save the girlfriend of one of his friends, she falls to his death. From a 4000 meter high mountain peak, he can not force himself to continue to work as a mountain guard. For nearly a year, he has not put food in reserve, but returns. Soon after he returns, they receive an emergency call from a group of hikers who have fallen into a blizzard. At least the Rangers believe. In fact, it is a group of robbers who have crashed their plane into the mountains after their brave plan to steal cases full of money from a flying government plane has failed. The cases are spread all over the reserve and they need the help of professional mountaineers to find them again ... <br /> <br /> Of course this is not one of the most intelligent films of all time, but in its genre it's a treat on. I particularly liked John Lithgow as the evil master spirit and leader of the band of robbers. I know him best from the TV series "3rd Rock from the Sun", but I enjoyed his performance in this movie as well. Overall, the acting is fine, it had a lot of action to offer and of course some one-liners, but it also had a very nice decor. This movie was shot in a beautiful natural environment. I loved the snow-capped mountains and valleys, the mountain streams and forests ... Maybe that's why I give the film a higher score than I normally give to an action / adventure movie of this kind. I give 6.5 / 10. If you do not expect too much, this is a pleasing movie.
