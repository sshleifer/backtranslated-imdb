This scary and rather bloody adaptation of Stephen King's great novel features outstanding central performances by Dale Midkiff, Fred Gwynne (who unfortunately died a few years ago) and Denise Crosby and some truly gruesome Gore effects. and manages to make this one of the few versions of King's work that is not only worth seeing, but truly disturbing. The portrayal of the zombie child Gage (later called Miko Hughes in "New Nightmare") is as remarkable as what is easily possible. A ridiculous character was made threatening and scary. As for the people who think he's not scary - look at him alone in the dark (maybe with your squeamish girlfriend) and I guarantee you that "Pet Sematary" will crawl you go out. Some horror movies like this or "The Texas Chain Saw Massacre" should not be viewed in the group. Recommended for horror fans!
