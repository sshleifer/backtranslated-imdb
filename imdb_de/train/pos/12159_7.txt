- After her sons have been sentenced to life imprisonment, Adelle (Debbie Reynolds) and Helen (Shirley Winters) receive threatening phone calls because someone easily drops their sons. The couple decides to move to California to avoid public access to the process and start a new life. They found a dance school, which is very successful soon. One of the students has a rich, unmarried father in whom Adelle quickly falls in love. In the meantime, Helen is busy raising rabbits and beguiling a little too much of an evangelist on the radio. It is only a matter of time before everything breaks up and the women enter a world of madness and murder. <br /> <br /> - I can not help but compare What What Matter with Helen. to Whoever Slew Auntie Roo ?, also with Shelly Winters. While this film was almost restrained in his presentation of Aunt Roo's madness, there's nothing Helen holds back in this film. It can take a long time to film, but as soon as it snaps, Helen is one of Bad Mad Mutha. You do not want to play around with her. Winters is so delighted that I was unable to enjoy her performance. I will not spoil the movie, but the things that Helen is capable of are absolutely exaggerated. <br /> <br /> - As good as Winters is, Reynolds is absolutely ridiculous in his role as gold -digging tap dancer I got the impression that she thought she was in a movie that would nominate her for a prize. This is not a citizen Kane! Stop acting so seriously. Hey, Debbie, do not you understand that your main purpose is to be a victim of Winters' madness. <br /> <br /> - I love these former female stars in the dusk - their career horror movies. What's up with Helen? is as much fun as no one.
