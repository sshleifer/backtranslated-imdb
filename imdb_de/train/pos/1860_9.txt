I went to Antone Fisher, who did not know what to expect, and was extremely pleasantly surprised. The acting job of Derek Luke was outstanding and the plot was excellent. Of course, Denzel Washington did his usual job of acting as a director. You realize that you can help people with mental health issues and this movie is a perfect example of that. Do not miss this.
