This movie, together with WESTFRONT 1918, is my favorite movie under Pabst, and I enjoyed it more than its much more famous movies, in which Louise Brooks (like PANDORA'S BOX) starred. Probably because both are very similar to the neorealist films, the Italians perfected in the 1940s and 50s. This style film called for the use of non-actors (just typical people) in everyday life to create intense and realistic films. In this case, it is a film about French and German miners. Correspondingly, people in the roles seem like miners - not actors. The central conflict at the beginning of the film is that there is a huge mine at the German-French border. Instead of a large mine, it is divided at the border, and German workers are not welcome in the French mine, though there is greater unemployment in Germany. As a result, language differences (wonderfully illustrated in a dance hall scene) and World War I lead to a big gap between the factions - this leads to a WE vs. THEY mentality. Later, an explosion leads to a great collapse of the French, and the Germans refuse to sit back and do nothing. They risk their own lives and prove that there is a real camaraderie between miners and men in general. <br /> <br /> The film is a fierce criticism of xenophobia, trying in vain to convince the German public to see the futility of war and hatred. It was a great moving movie with some of the scariest and claustrophobic images I've ever seen. In terms of history, however, the impact of the film was minimal at best. It is a shame, because WESTFRONT 1918, J√ÅACCUSE (Gance) and ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT (milestone) had great messages of peace and harmony, but ultimately were a failure in positive public opinion. From a historical perspective, it is an amazing and sad relic that is worth seeing.
