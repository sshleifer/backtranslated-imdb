It's a shame that this movie is so hard to come by in the US. I found it through a rare video retailer, and it was definitely worth it. This is undoubtedly the best pre-code era movie and the best movie of the 1930s. The masterful director Frank Borzage made wonderful films about the depression, and with MAN'S CASTLE he created a fairy tale in the midst of the hardships of the epoch. Loretta Young and Spencer Tracy have a wonderful chemistry between them and they help make this movie a wonderful romance. Young's Trina is sweet and hopeful, while Tracy's Bill is rude and closed. The dynamics between the characters creates one of the most difficult but ultimately rewarding relationships in the film. <br /> <br /> MAN'S CASTLE is the softest focus code I've ever seen. Borzage uses the hazy and dreamy technique to turn the squatter's village, where Bill and Trina live, into a palace. The hardships of depression are never ignored, they are indeed an integral part of the film. However, since Borzage handles the movie as a fairytale tale, the love between the characters makes the situation less harsh. It makes the movie warm and loving. <br /> <br /> MAN'S CASTLE is the culmination of the pre-code era. If only more people could see it.
