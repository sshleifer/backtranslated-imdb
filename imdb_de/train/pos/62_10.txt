I absolutely loved this movie. I bought it as soon as I found a copy of it. This movie had so much emotion and felt so real that I could really sympathize with the characters. Every time I see it, the end makes me cry. I can really identify with the character of Busy Phillip, and how I would feel if the same thing happened to me would do the same. I can recommend this movie to everyone. Especially those who were affected by school admissions. <br /> <br /> It's really one of the greatest movies ever.
