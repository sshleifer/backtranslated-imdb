After seeing You've Got Mail and feeling disappointed, I decided to watch the original movie that inspired this movie, The Shop Around the Corner. I was excited about this movie. It's a true gem and from that moment one of my favorite movies of all time. The drama is so perfect, the story is so beautiful that if you have not seen it before, I'd like to urge you to see it today. I'm not against recovering and sometimes I like the new version more than the original, but this time I have to admit that you've got mail is a bad adaptation of this classic. Do not miss it, visit your video library and rent The Shop Around the Corner today!
