What I expected: a rather lame, over-stereotypical portrayal of a sporty crazy man and an equally lame stereotypical portrayal of the Gal who likes him, but he suffers as he pursues his overly eager support for his favorite sports team as a second banana. <br /> <br /> What I Got: An immature story in which both the guy and the woman end up admitting that they both have passions in their lives, each one forgiving the other to save the love which he shares <br /> <br /> Sounds juicy, but with uninterrupted humor and great performances, this story works! Barrymore is a classic Barrymore: this perfect blend of sweet, strong and adorable. We expect that from her and she has delivered. <br /> <br /> But Fallon is the nice surprise in this movie. He brings with him the perfect mix of sports nuts and appreciation for the normal things in life, such as caring for children and his girlfriend. Fallon delivers his lines with subtle perfection. He can worry ("You've just walked across the field for me!") And in the same breath through his love for the Red Sox ("How did the grass feel? A bit spongy?") Blinded. Fallon's presentation has "made" the film. Hopefully this movie marks the beginning of a better movie career for Fallon, just beyond the exaggerated SNL alum-typical Willow humor (ie Will Ferrell). In short, a movie that could do this are stereotypical male vs. female. fallen victim to female characters, they went beyond that limit and made a baseball fan for uninterrupted punctual humorous lines, most of which were delivered with brilliant subtlety from Fallon - and she loved it just as much as I did. It's neither a "guy flick" nor a "chick flick". It's a terrific make-you-laugh movie. Look at it!
