I really enjoyed the 60s. Since it is not a generation of this generation (I'm waiting for "The 80's"), it was interesting to see a unique four-hour capsule for that time. <br /> <br /> One major problem in the movie, however, was how unbalanced the movie was in the portrayal of the families. According to promos I've seen for the NBC movie, these were essentially two families struggling with problems in America in the 1960s. Now maybe I've missed something, but I think we've learned more about the white family than about the African-American family coming from the mouths of the actors (all of them very talented). This is very visible at the end of the first part (about two hours) of the miniseries. <br /> <br /> Very good movie!
