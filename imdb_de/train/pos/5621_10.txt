Gentle, tiny, almost insignificant. Polanski finds the invisibility of his characters and makes something enormous out of it. In front of and behind the camera he creates one of the most uncomfortable masterpieces that I could see and see again. It never lets me down. People, even people who know me pretty well, think / think that something is wrong with me, based on my attraction, or I should say, devotion to "Le Locataire" is something irresistibly intriguing in Polanski's darkness and I have the humor not even mentioned. The mystery surrounding the apartment and the previous tenant, the mystery that takes over him and of course us, me. This building was populated by major Oscar winners: Melvyn Douglas, Shelley Winters, Jo Van Fleet and Lila Kedrova. For anyone who loves movies, this is a compulsory consideration. One, two, three, many, many visits.
