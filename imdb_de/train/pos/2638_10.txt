One of the best films for all ages. You'll never see LION KING again without thinking of the extra story this movie adds. Almost 40 years old, I have seen this with my wife and two sons after work tonight. I have not laughed for a long time and have enjoyed a movie for a long time. <br /> <br /> Take your time and look at it with the children. It will remind you how Disney used to be when you were young.
