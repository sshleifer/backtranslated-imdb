This movie was amazing. It is an inspirational piece of cinema. The characters are fully developed by the truth in which director Lucy Walker brings the film. I recommend it to anyone looking for that special movie that shows humanity in the human situation. Lucy Wlaker shows the scenic beauty. This film is a true example of man against nature and sometimes against man. The inner turmoil and triumph is enormous in its theme. Interesting is the theme, as the Tiebtaner blindness as a sign of demons consider. This film highlights a culture that has never been shown. Lucy Walker has given Erik Weihenmayer a voice if he would not normally have been heard. Thanks, Lucy, for being true to your vision as a filmmaker.
