Greetings from this Portuguese :) <br /> <br /> I think the sopranos are one of the best productions ever, the reality and fiction are so mixed that the difference is barely recognizable. It has the same quality as GodFather! James Gandolfini fits like a glove to the newspaper! I would love that the sopranos would never end. It's perfect! It should be a topic at school :) I saw Sopranos when I was a kid, but I was too young to stay awake until the episode ended. I have now bought all the episodes in DVD format and look at all episodes at home and after dinner I become addicted, as I did at Prison Break. In my opinion, Prison Break and The Sopranos are the best series ever made for television. The arguments of both are great and the actors are perfect. Congratulations on such work. Excuse my English. Thank you for reading.
