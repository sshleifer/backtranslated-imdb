This movie is completely ridiculous. The plot is not only cruel but also terrible. The special effects are small and the entire movie plays in a post-apocalyptic desert. However, it is by far the most amusing movie ever allowed to be produced. It's 101 minutes of laughter, as we all know there will be no fuel in the year 3000 or at El Camino. There are other aspects that I do not want to ruin just because they make the movies so wonderfully stupid. I recommend this movie only because of his idiocy. I have no idea who would expect this, assuming that it is a high-quality feature. But if you need a good laugh, consider Exterminators of the Year 3000!
