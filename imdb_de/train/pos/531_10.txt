This movie has the most beautiful opening sequence ever made. I saw this movie for the first time a week ago, since then I see the opening every day and every time I heard it the first time I heard David Niven say the immortal words of Sir Walter Raleigh's pilgrimage: <br /> <br /> Give me my seashell of silence, My wand of faith on which to walk, My joyful pleasure, Immortal diet, My bottle of redemption, My dress of glory, The true measure of hope. And so I take my pilgrimage (?) <br /> <br /> Do you know why it would be a truism to say that the lives of Michael Powell and Emeric Pressuburger are quite justified in having made such a wonderful opening? Because they had been recorded in the poets' paradise long before they were filmed. <br /> <br /> I imagine that both are brought to justice during Doomsday and casually say to an angry God: I apologize, sir. Do you want to know what we did during our lifetime? Well, you'll see: we've written and directed: I know where I'm going, Colonel Blimp, red shoes? Do you think that enough, sir? It is quite obvious that these two great artists had fulfilled their duty to God, the Muse Nature, or whatever you call it, when they shot a life and death affair. The fact that other people's lives are justifiable for their actions might not be clear to everyone, although I believe that my life has meaning if I had never done anything else to see this film. <br /> <br /> Of course classic cars will be tempted to say: they do not make films like these anymore. They will be partly wrong; In the past, they have not made any films. <br /> <br /> I have already quoted Keats here, but I repeat his words: A beauty thing is always a pleasure.
