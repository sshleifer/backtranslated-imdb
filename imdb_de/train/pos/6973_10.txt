BSG is one of my most popular TV series ever. I was fortunate enough to see it when the series reached its final season. It was a marathon from start to finish for me and what an incredible ride! <br /> <br /> As soon as I noticed the pilot on Hulu, I knew exactly what I wanted out of the title - Caprica! Although some things do not match when comparing the two series, it still works nicely. Nothing was said about the holobands in Battlestar Galactica or the mention of virtual worlds, but maybe I did not get far enough into the series to explain why the universe, technology and alternative fantasies of our world. This show is very interesting and will want to see you more!
