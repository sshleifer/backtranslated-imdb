It's a very nice movie and I would definitely recommend it to anyone. However, there are two drawbacks: - The level of stories has a wide range. Some scenes are very good and others are just boring. - Many stories are not self-contained (when compared to coffee and cigarettes, where each story is a dot, a message, a punchline or whatever you want to call it), but most stories are really good, some are really good Great and overall, it's certainly one of the best movies of the year! Annoying that I have to fill at least 10 lines, I do not have to say anymore and do not want to start analyzing the individual sequences ... <br /> <br /> Well, I think that's it it!
