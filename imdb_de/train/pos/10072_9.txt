An unexpected pleasure, as I had not heard anything about this movie. <br /> <br /> Shameful, as it guarantees a wider audience. <br /> <br /> A wonderfully humane story with a gently narrated social message, though admittedly predictable in its resolution. Firmly traded by the clients. Beautifully photographed with subdued colors that float against gray and capture the nostalgic tone of the film. <br /> <br /> My recent excursion into the Chinese movie (Shower, The Road Home, Not One Less) was an exciting movie that I hope to explore further. China and its people are an amazing canvas for filmmakers. "The King of Masks" can be recommended as a starting point for anyone interested in Chinese film. <br /> <br />
