I turned the TV around and HBO showed a double blow of unbelievably horrible complaints, so I turned to my twin sister and said, "Hey, that looks like fun." At first I thought that Jonni Kennedy was a young man, but then it was explained that because of his condition, he never went through puberty, the high voice and the smaller body. He was on a crusade to raise money for his cause. He had the most wonderful sense of humor, combined with a good sense of spirituality ... I cried, looked at something, laughed, got up to get another Kleenex, and cried even more. When Jonni Kennedy's "time" had expired, he flew to heaven to be with the angels. He was more than ready; he had learned his lessons from this life and was free. I highly recommend this. If you do not fall in love with this guy, you do not have a heart.
