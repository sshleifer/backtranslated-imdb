This is actually a groovy-cute little movie that was made with absolutely negligible budget with video creasing. It takes a while to get used to it. The spectacle is so bad that it soon gets a Zen charm. After a few scenes, you stop noticing the awkward lines or the well-rehearsed sound of some deliveries. The characters all develop a quirky charm, especially "Richard." Forget Anthony Hopkins, Maidens is the type I hired to play a raging psychopath. He just seems to enjoy it so much! Mixed with the scenes of mad-slasher gore and zombie infestation are some really visually powerful footage from the title character, "The Midnight Skater," zipping around the campus in a black hoodie, searching and saying hello across the globe for a cross between the Grim Reaper we, the silver surfer. These recordings make the sometimes ridiculous things the characters say about the skater almost ominous. The soundtrack contains some very fun garage-punk tunes, and the rough, rough meanness of it fits the mood of the movie. Thumbs up, I say.
