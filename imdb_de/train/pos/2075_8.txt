To say that a movie is depressing is not necessarily a bad thing. I am very willing to watch a depressing movie when there is a point that needs to be made and this one certainly has one. It is the often heartbreaking story of a Chinese and his family as they experience many years of hardship and abundance. BUT, I have to warn you that in the thirties this could only be the most depressing movie that came out of Hollywood, because rural life in China was hard to say. Be prepared to see segments of hunger, death, and disease. <br /> <br /> The only negative, besides the ongoing misery, is that Paul Muni plays the lead role. Although he was an exceptionally talented man, it's just a shame that Hollywood has always used people of European descent to play Asian leads. If you are careful, it is quite obvious that Muni is wrong in the role.
