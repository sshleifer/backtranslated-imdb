Certainly one of the best British films ever shot, if not one of the best movies ever made. Screenplay, cinematography, directing and acting independently in a class. This movie works on so many levels. So why is not it completely available on tape or DVD? Never shown on TV? Why is it hidden when it is regularly screened in front of crowded houses at the National Film Theater in London?
