OK, what I say: <br /> <br /> The film was excellent. I'm a big fan of Nancy and I read all the 1-56 original books, and then I read more. I am now at 96. Beware of bad guys who give this movie a lower rating than it should have. All hints indicate a wonderful movie! I loved the whole thing. So, what is Nancy in the current time? She is still old fashioned as in the books! People who have not read more than 5 books complain about Nancy's view. I read all of them and I think that Emma is perfect and that Nancy was perfect. I found parts of the movie scary. I was thrilled with the exciting chases. I loved the hints. I solved the puzzle myself! It was really wonderful. I suggest you see it, because people who complain do not know about A, which is a good movie, and B about Nancy Drew. Look at it. It may not be Oscar-worthy, but it's really a good movie.
