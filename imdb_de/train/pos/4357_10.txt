I saw the movie at the Nashville Film Festival. It was beautifully done, from cinematography to acting. It is the story of father and son and how they learn to appreciate each other in a family crisis. Beautifully written with a dialogue that never sounds wrong, the film shows, among other things, the theatrical talents of Paul Reiser and Peter Falk. The film begins with the aging father (Peter Falk) trying to figure out why his wife (Olympia Dukakis) has left him. The father presents himself unannounced at the door of his son and his daughter-in-law. The father and son leave the next day to look at a property and make a classic road trip. They fish, play billiards, watch a baseball game, get drunk, engage in a fight and dance with strange women. More importantly, they face the unspoken tensions that can affect any family. It's the kind of movie that touches the heart and makes you appreciate the people closest to you.
