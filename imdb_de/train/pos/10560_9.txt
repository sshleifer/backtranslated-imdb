Jimmy Cagney keeps racing through your eyes in the story of a stage producer fiercely battling the coming "talking" movies. <br /> <br /> This story of love, deception, women and dancing is presented in such a way that you as a spectator never experience a boring moment. The direction of the mass scenes in the rehearsal rooms was extremely well done. History has never really been lost at this frenzied pace. <br /> <br /> Some of the material presented here is a little dated, but it does not matter, because if you look at it in a 1933 timeframe, it does not matter. It's fabulous, among many other drags from To see films released during this time. Jimmy Cagney is a sight sore eyes in this movie and never loses his serenity as a producer of cinema previews as intros. In this way, he tries to save his ass before leaving the store, he was a Broadway producer before he started. Joan Blondell is fabulous as the neglected love interest, Nan, she gives such a spirited performance that is so unusual for films of that time, so cool, to see a woman portrayed as a strong woman for a change. <br /> <br /> The only problem I had with the movie was the huge productions at the end. These were great in themselves, beautifully choreographed and wonderfully produced, but they just did not seem to fit into the story. The only connection they have to the main story is that Cagney had to create 3 previews within three days to get a contract. It was hard to believe that these were the girls throughout the movie and that these sets could fit into a movie. In this way, sitting on a backyard fence was much more appropriate for the story. <br /> <br /> The productions at the end seemed to bring this desperate story to a standstill, and that was not a good thing. I was tired after seeing the first musical sequence and then realized that two more were coming up. These sequences also laughed a lot from the audience. <br /> <br /> All in all a great movie with a sour end. <br /> <br /> 9/10
