This is a brilliant science fiction movie that is very strange when men and women watch the same movie. I talked to many people about the movie, and almost everyone loved the movie and said it was great - while most women thought it was just disgusting and stupid! This is the only film that I know has such polarized views based on sex. Maybe many women have less tolerance for disgusting or depressing conspiracies - but whatever the cause, I've always found that difference fascinating. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a murder and subsequent investigation conducted by Charlton Heston. This is set in the near future and the head of the major international Soylent Corporation was murdered. As the movie evolves, it quickly becomes clear that this is a terrible and highly unfair future American society. The rich live in beautiful homes with security and all the amenities that money can buy (including "furniture" - a euphemism for paid mistresses who go with the apartment). At the same time, the masses are slippery, unemployed and in many cases live in abandoned cars or apartment corridors. Overpopulation and smog have taken a heavy toll and the future looks really terrible! <br /> <br /> I should NOT argue about why the rich man died and the terrible truth he could not live with - he could ruin the film for you. However, the film has a great plot and acting and is super exciting to watch. In addition, it shows Edward G. Robinson in his last screen performance as a crispy buddy of Heston. While not for the slightly depressed or squeamish, this is a great science fiction movie that is allegorical and profound.
