Insane, almost flippant mood piece and if it's more LSD-inspired than the devil, we need to remember when it was made! After a startling SM opening (which itself is not what it seems), we focus on soft focus and dreams or fantasies or memories. Many literary and cinematic references, and indeed this is the Franco film that Lang himself has praised. Beautiful and fascinating, the film unfolds at a leisurely pace, but has plenty in every crease. A rare movie to languish in. Old Jess could do it when he tried. Fine central performances, including the indomitable Jack Taylor and Howard Vernon. I did not even mention the locations in Lisbon - ah!
