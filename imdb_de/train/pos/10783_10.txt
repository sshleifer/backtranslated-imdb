I enjoyed this movie. I have not seen Andy Griffith for ages and felt that he was a perfect match for this role. I combined him with comedy, but I'm glad he's versatile. <br /> <br /> I was not worried that Dotty's "anxiety disorder" did not come literally from a psychiatric textbook. There are thousands of phobias and neuroses that can take on a variety of quantitative and qualitative forms. She is clearly sensitive to extrasensory forces, as understood by the Indians on the ground, by no Anglos. It is not surprising that this character is vulnerable and nominally eccentric. <br /> <br /> Although this is understood as a light "family movie", it is actually more demanding than it seems. The turn of Hiram at the end was a pleasant surprise for me and tied all previous actions together in a bundle. It's fun to think about the possibility of such spiritual guidance.
