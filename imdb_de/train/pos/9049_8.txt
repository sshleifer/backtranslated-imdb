There is an old adage that refers to the rousing new movie by Joe Johnston that looks something like this: "The man who thinks he can, and the man who thinks he can not, has both Law." This is a highly presumptuous statement that refers to self-motivation and belief in an individual who stands in the way of roadblocks and family difficulties in this film. <br /> <br /> "October Sky" is about "October Sky" a young man who believes in himself was called Homer Hickam and grew up in the fifties in a strict, traditional family. Homer loves in a small coal mining town where almost every man grows into a miner. All of his friends, Quentin, Roy and O'Dell, all believe that their life after high school will be like any other. Homer is not excited about this future. <br /> <br /> One night, while everyone is staring at the sky, a Russian spaceship called Sputnik comes by. This is something new for Homer, and he finds it spectacular and overwhelming. From that point on, his view of life will never be the same again. First, he tells everyone that he wants to work in rocket science for a job. Perplexed by what he says, his family passes this idea over their heads and continues life as usual. His friends, however, believe that this idea could have potential. After all, Quentin is a very smart person when it comes to these kinds of things. <br /> <br /> When the four friends start to test model rockets and blow up a white picket fence, it seems they are. A forest fire is scared of them, they are forced to stop their progress. <br /> <br /> The performances in this film are absolutely fascinating from beginning to end. All actors give performances as if this were the real hocus-pocus. Outstanding in all its glory: Laura Dern as Miss Riley. This may well be Oscar material, if the jurors can remember the beginning of the year this film will be released. <br /> <br /> The characters are also very well developed. Not only do the filmmakers give clear, obvious reasons why Homer is interested in the subject, they also explain to the audience how they manage to engage in rockets. We understand all the motives and beliefs of the characters, especially the Father, who has dedicated himself to an everlasting tradition. Unfortunately, the film loses momentum because it is stupid, recycled romantic negotiation with Homer's love interest and how his brother stole it from him. This is so common in high school movies, not that this movie is aimed at high schools. The actors stare thoughtlessly at each other as if they were in a trance. I accepted it without complaint in 1997 "Inventing the Abbots", but I just had enough. <br /> <br /> But that's just a minor complaint. With an authentic-looking timeline, an Oscar-related camera, and real-life clips from Homer and friends, all of which were filled with their dreams, especially Homer, this is the first big movie of 1999. <br /> <br />
