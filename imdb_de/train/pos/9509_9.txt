Wow, this movie was absolutely brilliant. I really do not know why everyone says it has a slow pace. I found the pace perfect. The film is about Michael Sullivan, played by Tom Hanks with perfection, a kind of hitman / killer working for John Rooney (Paul Newman). He does not like this job, but does it because Rooney paid his house and helped him financially. He had nothing and Mr. Rooney gave him everything. But his children do not know that this is his job, and when someone witnesses a cold-blooded murder, he is put in an awkward position. And when an atrocity occurs, he leaves his son and relies on revenge. They rob much and more and build a connection. You are the perfect team. Hanks does a great job as usual, as does Jude Law, who plays his spooky role perfectly. This drama is highly recommended as it shows a beautiful story and shows how the 1930s were.
