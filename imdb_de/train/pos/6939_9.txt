I was very impressed by this movie. I would have to call it one of the better westerns of the classical era. I say that for the whole: acting, the mature dialogue, the no-nonsense story and the excellent cinematography. <br /> <br /> Director Anthony Mann, who made several well-photographed film noirs in the same era, has also made some westerns like this one. It has the same movie noir look. Mann and Jimmy Stewart worked on several Westerns during this time. , If you like this movie, I recommend the Mann Stewart movie "Bend Of The River". <br /> <br /> In short, the story is about a man, "Lin McAdam" (Stewart), who owns the prestigious Winchester 73 rifle, a weapon he won in a contest. It is then stolen and passed from rogue to rogue. All these villains are interesting characters. <br /> <br /> Help Stewart to play this interesting story are Shelley Winters, Dan Duryea, Stephen McNally, Millard Mitchell, Charles Drake, Will Greer and J. C. Flippen. Everyone is fun to see. Rock Hudson was a bit ("Young Bull"), but you can not have everything.
