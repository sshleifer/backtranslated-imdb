"I've looked into the eye of this island, and what I saw was beautiful," announces one of the main characters on ABC's award-winning television show "Lost." The series could be summarized as a drama story about a group of plane crash survivors on an unknown island, but this would prove the show unsuitable. "Lost" follows a large group of characters who clash with the island, each other, and ultimately themselves as they struggle with their new way of life and dependence on each other. The situation becomes more complicated when it becomes clear that this too is not an ordinary island - and that they may not be alone. <br /> <br /> My initial fear, after listening to the concept of this series, was the lack of new stories that they could tell us after a while, but proved unfounded. The narrative flows naturally, the dialogue is funny, the characters are memorable and the execution is outstanding. The island is a very unique character, and to understand that comment, you would have to see the series for yourself, which only expresses its originality and size. <br /> <br /> At the time of writing this review, only the first two seasons were aired and they are filled with strong episodes. My only mild criticism is that the second season seems to slow down halfway, but fortunately for the last few episodes it returns in admirable shape before now it would certainly be this. If you like excitement, adventures, character-driven stories, an extremely strong cast and crew, beautiful locations and an island that seems more spiritual than natural, "Lost" is for you. Just be sure you start at the beginning.
