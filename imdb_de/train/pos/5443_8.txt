For what it is, this is a pretty good movie. I like both Johns-Stamos ("Full House") and Stockwell ("Christine", "Top Gun"). Both give strong performances. The love interest is OK, but this is more of a movie than a good date movie. I love Harleys, and I hated painting them over the "14 coats of paint" with a good old Army Olive Drab. There's a little history lesson here in which Harley-Davidson motorcycles played a key role in World War II. I do not know if the training was like that. The movie kept my interest, without slowing down, with good action sequences. I like to watch the demographics of the voting history - an 18-year-old man gave the film 10 (true bicycle lover, I think). I would not give a 10, but I gave an 8. I do not like every movie with the same scale. There are big budget films and great actors you expect to be good at. If they fail, they fail big. (Star Wars - Episode I is my best example) I loved the first three SW movies, but I thought Episode I was weak in comparison. It is rated lower by me than in this film. I expect more from George Lucas.
