Based on Neil Simon's play from the same book, The Odd Couple tells the story of best friends Felix Unger (Jack Lemmon) and Oscar Madison (Walter Matthau), who in the end share Oscar's massive bachelor block after Felix tries to kill himself. <br /> <He had a big argument with his wife over compulsory forced cleansing and weird phobias and sent her a suicide telegram. She calls Oscar and lets him know what happened. Felix appears during his weekly poker game with her friends at Oscar Vinnie (John Fielder) Murray, the cop (Herbert Edelman), Roy (David Sheiner) and Speed ​​(Larry Haines). After some hysterical hysterics, it is agreed that Felix will stay with Oscar. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film The focus is on how these two are so different characters. As well as looking to see if Oscar can stand the really weird and unique habits and cleanliness of Felix and if Felix can stand it, that Oscar is such a jerk and his relaxed attitude to everything. Really a film about two opposing opposites and the joys, ups, downs and necessity of the gift that is friendship. With Spectacular Actors, a smart and very funny writer, and the great Monica Evans and Carole Shelley as the British Pigeon Sisters, the Oskar Invites for a Double Date. <br /> <br /> This is guaranteed to make you laugh, every line is priceless and Jack and Walter are fantastic with great chemistry. In addition, she was with Jack Klugman to a successful and equally funny TV series as Oscar and Tony Randall as Felix.
