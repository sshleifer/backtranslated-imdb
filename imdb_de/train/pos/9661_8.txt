After losing Emmy for her performance as Mama Rose in the TV version of GYPSY, Bette won an Emmy for BETTE MIDLER the following year: DIVA LAS VEGAS, a live concert special filmed for HBO in Las Vegas. Midler, who has been performing live on stage since the 1970s, proves she is still one of the most exciting actresses in the industry. From her opening number, her classic "Friends", where she lifts her wings on a beautiful prop cloud, Bette orders the stage with style and charisma from a rap number called "I Look Good," proving she has one a joke like few other artists in this field, as she moves through a variety of musical ideas. The section of the show in which she welcomes Burlesque takes a little too long, but she manages to bring up her old Sophie Tucker jokes here (though she actually forgets a joke that tells her, but only her publicity) until she finds herself reminds that it is hysterical). Bette also pampers us with "Rose's Turn" by GYPSY and the theme song from her smash movie THE ROSE as well as a shameless plug for her hit movie THE FIRST WIVES CLUB. She brings the house down at the end with "Stay with Me, Baby" by THE ROSE and her only # 1 hit "Wind Beneath My Wings" by BEACHES. It's a dazzling evening of musical comedy entertainment and a must for Midler fans.
