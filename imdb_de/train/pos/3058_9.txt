I bought it for $ 2 a year or more (yep, $ 2), kept it on the shelf forever, and watched DVDs while catching a cold. <br /> <br /> This is a haunting movie. Brilliant performances of all involved, especially the 6yo boy (about the only smile you get in this movie). Plot reminds me of perhaps my favorite movie of all time, Grosse Pointe Blank, but obviously that carefree is a heavy heart. <br /> <br /> As a psychologist, clinical and forensic psychologist, a shiver came over my back as the identity of the new treaty was revealed. Creepy stuff! All-round brilliant work. <br /> <br /> Pete
