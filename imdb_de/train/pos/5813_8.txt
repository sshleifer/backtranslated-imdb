This movie is great. <br /> <br /> Now I tend to burden my films with the story and the dialogue, but now and then something like Moonwalker comes along and can be observed despite numerous shortcomings /> <br /> This film is not more than a very entertaining Michael Jackson ad. Starting with a sickly video that features "Man in the Mirror", a montage that lists his achievements and bits and bobs from his career, it goes through all the highlights of his life and then plunges into a really, really entertaining segment, acting as a kind of "fun" scene, the fun music video for 'Bad' and 'Speed ​​Demon' follows the adventures of MJ as he races in front of manic stop-motion fans and finally dances against a rabbit costume. The stop movement is not as bad as some would think. It is passable. <br /> <br /> Then we see the great video for 'leave me alone' and go directly to the main function. <br /> <br /> Yes, the plot is ridiculous. Very ridiculous We see Michael running out of a building and being shot at by thousands of soldiers. Then we did a flashback and showed MJ and three kids tripping over an underground camp. "Mr. Big" (Joe Pesci) is the vicious villain who intends to make every child in the world addicted to drugs (no peculiarities are mentioned). MJ and the little girl he's with are caught and then followed ... yada yada yada. The plot is not really important. We get two very cool sequences in which MJ becomes a car, then a robot spaceship thing and of course the amazing "Smooth Criminal" sequence fantastic for those who like MJ. It has most of its greatest hits and some cool little pieces and some pretty good special effects (especially the sequence Robot / Spaceship). It will keep the children quiet for a few hours, as well as most of the 20 children who were children when it was released.
