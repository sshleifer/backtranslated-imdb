"The Straight Story" is a really nice movie about an older man named Alvin Straight, who drives his lawnmower across the country to visit his strange, dying brother. But that's just the basic synapse. This movie is about much more. This was the last role of Richard Farnworth before he died, and it is definitely one that he will be remembered for. He's a stubborn old man, not unlike the many old men you and I probably know. <br /> <br /> "The Straight Story" is a movie everyone should see at least once in their lives. It will reach down and touch a part of you, at least if you have a heart, it will.
