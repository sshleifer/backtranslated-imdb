Great voices, many adventures and clever dialogues make this movie a very good movie. The addition of "character" to the three main animals gives the story much more depth and meaning, especially the relationship between the older guy Shadow and the young Hell Runner Chance. The earlier versions of this film were not able to give the animals a real personality or motive, which is perfectly executed here. Sally Field is adorable in everything, but in this movie she really seems to see Sassy as the proud cat. Great contrast between cat and dog perspectives in life and just the right amount of mind and warm flacons to make the plot and resolution outstanding. There is even an uplifting result and a beautiful mountain landscape. Definitely perfect for a night alone or with the kids. Hats off to Disney.
