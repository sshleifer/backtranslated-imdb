This is a beautiful, rich and well executed film with a rich and meaningful history. Basically it tells how an old storyteller has to find a (male) heir to continue his craft, but in the end he does not get what he expected in his male-dominated world. The characters then have to deal with their situation, and the old master has to deal with the conflict between his desire for a companion and heir and the traditional notions of his and his society. The story is funny, emotional and complex. The exploration of the characters, their lives and their emotions is rich and compelling, the character development is strong, while the characters are complex and not one-dimensional. The film skillfully conveys the feelings of the old man and his desire to find an heir and shows how he and the child deal with the situation. In appropriate places there is also humor, sometimes quite subtle. The film also explores the good and the bad of traditional Chinese culture, giving the film further interest and depth. <br /> <br /> Director, drama and scenery are all outstanding. Other strengths include rich and compelling visual imagery and engaging, real characters. As a result, the film evokes a strong empathy and feelings for the characters. <br /> <br /> Some have said that the end of the movie weakens, but I do not necessarily agree. Maybe it could have been stronger with another end, but any improvement in the overall movie would have been rather small.
