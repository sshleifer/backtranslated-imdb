A meteor falls from the sky and wakes up a Plesiosaur, which was terrorizing the area around Crater Lake a long time ago. As the monster eats the locals, they try to find a way to kill the monster. <br /> <br /> The recent attempts to spread old horror and science-fiction movies like Lost Skeleton of Cadavra and Alien Trespass are somehow irritating, films like Crater Lake Monster have been available for screening. It's the kind of movie that these movies just play, just that's the real deal. It's all these movies are trying to do without tongue in cheek, and it's so much more fun. This is a true drive-in movie that had the unfortunate luck to come just as Star Wars changed our view of special effects. The monster, a mix of stop movement and a life-size head, is a charming little creature. The filmmakers pamper the audience with frequent shots of the monster and its chaos. Sure, it's clear that everything is fake, but are not there any films about the attitude of unbelief? Actually, I think it's really cool monster that has this. <br /> <br /> I like this movie in a kind of cheap drive. If you are looking for a real, authentic drive in monster movie, look no further. This would be perfect for a double or triple feature with similar Lake Monster movies (Boggy Creek, etc.).
