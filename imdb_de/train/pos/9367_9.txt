It's not very often that a movie can literally make the whole audience laugh and five minutes later fill their eyes with tears. Many films try to do that, but few can provide the emotional impact of this film. Adam Sandler practically pulls you in with his heated and often violent outbursts, but also makes you laugh when the shadow of his past does not tear him down. I'm not going to ruin anything, but there's a scene where your eyes are tears and your lips are trembling. Even most men's machos would have to be heartless bastards so they would not feel anything during the movie. Don Cheadle shows another great performance, but is outperformed by Sandler. Liv Tyler and Jada Pinkett Smith give solid performances, but nothing in the series of the two main roles. Sandler's humor is still there, which actually saved the film from being pushed to the limit. There are several laughs, but do not think that you will stay there long because it will become serious again without any serious warning about every emotion that the human body contains, I will cut it short. I have the feeling that there is no need to tell you more. Do yourself a favor and take the time to see this movie. Even if you have to wait for it to appear on DVD, it's worth 100% of the time. A deeply moving movie that brings tears to your eyes and a smile on your face ... unless you are a heartless soul.
