I just used this video and saw it last night. Acting started extremely badly (hey ------ hey ------ Twister), but became very good after the stations. The tornadoes looked extremely fake, and many of the CGI effects were very dodgy, but the scene where the house broke and the contents were blown and sucked out was extremely well done, comparable to movies like Twister. The scenes of devastation were also very well done. The story has been very well written, and it's refreshing to see a movie like this, which takes off from the same old "catastrophe formulas" films of this genre and seems to have got stuck for 30 years. <br /> <br /> The film had a very strange mix of FX and acting quality, this deserves an A in my book.
