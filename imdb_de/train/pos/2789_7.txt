Bend it as if Beckham is packed with mesmerizing scenes but has an overall predictable Stroy line. It's about a girl named Jess, trying to achieve his long-standing dream of becoming a famous footballer, and finally gets the chance to offer a position on a local team. there are so many boundaries and boundaries that she faces, that restrain her and yet be determined and endeavored. I would recommend it to anyone who likes a nice light film and is inspired by what people can achieve. The song selection is really good, "Silence my child, just keep going ... to your destination and you make boundaries and complications." Anyway, hope this was helpful in a review for your needs. Bend it like Beckham
