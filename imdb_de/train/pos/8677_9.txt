This movie seems to be well remembered when Tom and Jerry signed a peace treaty. Things are idyllic for a while, but as expected it gets sour. The most memorable moment was probably the endless fight with a whistle, a pan and a baseball bat, in which the two plus butch, the dog, participate at the beginning and end of the shorts. I enjoyed a lot and you should try to catch it on the Cartoon Network.
