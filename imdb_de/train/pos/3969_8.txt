Did anyone notice that James Earl Jones is the waiter serving when Hagarty's wife reveals she is pregnant while at the lakeside restaurant? I saw this movie in a video I took from the TV. When I saw this scene, I thought I recognized the voice of Jones when the "waiter" laughed in the end. I rewound the tape and walked slowly through this part as the camera retreated and pointed to the waiter. Listen carefully to how the waiter laughs when Hagarty looks up and tells him they're going to have a baby, and then looks closely or slows down the scene if the camera shows the waiter quickly.
