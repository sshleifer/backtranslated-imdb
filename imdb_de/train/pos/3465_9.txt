I watched this movie with a lot of trembling and little hope. I do not think this movie could do justice to its theme. But it absolutely did, and then a lot more. First, I must say that Jared Harris has done an extraordinary job as John Lennon. Sometimes it seemed Harris was channeling Lennon. The likeness was often scary, and he clearly studied Lennon's behaviors and vocal inflections. Aiden Quinn was pretty good as McCartney, he also had a striking resemblance to Macca, though he occasionally tripped over his scouse accent. <br /> <br /> This fiction was well written and purposeful. It was, of course, pure fantasy, but sometimes I felt like a voyeur peeking through a keyhole at this reunion. The scene on the roof was particularly moving when McCartney told Lennon what he had never heard as a child - that he was worthy and important and that it could never be his fault that he was abandoned by his parents. I also enjoyed the scene in the park where the two danced with absolute devotion to the reggae band! <br /> <br /> My only complaint would be this: I am not so sure that John was as corrosive as he portrays at this stage in his life. He had gotten used to his home situation very well, and he was actually quite friendly with fans. Only a few years later he was very friendly when, on the day of his murder, he was first visited by his assassin for an autograph. <br /> <br /> Mostly, this film was used to rekindle those feelings. John had lived a little longer. I'm pretty sure the Beatles would be back together someday. And I'm pretty sure Lennon and McCartney would still be friends today. <br /> <br /> Well done, VH1. I will see it again and again. <br /> <br />
