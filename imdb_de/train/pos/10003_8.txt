This is not the typical Mel Brooks movie. It was much less slapstick than most of his films and actually had an action that could be traced. Leslie Ann Warren made the film, she is a fantastic, undervalued actress. There were a few moments that could be worked out a bit more, and some scenes that may have been cut to make room for it, but all in all, it's worth the price to rent it. The acting was overall good, Brooks himself has done a good job, without his trait has spoken directly with the audience. Again, Warren was the best actor in the film, but "Fume" and "Sailor" both played their roles well.
