I have to say, as a BSG fan, I was not sure what I think of this show. I saw it on the big screen at the Arclight Cinema tonight (as part of the Paley Center performances), and the cast and filmmakers talked about it. Ron Moore said they wanted to take a clean break from Battlestar and do something else, and they would lose some fans, but hopefully they would win others. "Even without their conversation, I would be I am now a fan of the new series, but I thought of the movie. <br /> <br /> I loved it, it was really good, I think I'm a true science fiction (or 'syfy') "- do I really have to type that?) geek, because I would watch the show as a series. It has a strong and rich history and has sparked my interest. <br /> <br /> It starts with a small one to a group of teenagers who plot something, which was the weakest and most confusing thing for me: The actor who plays "Ben" would have given us more insight into his intense I played a teenager (and I'm sure I'm not the only one who thought that "Zoe" was initially a Cylon and was at risk of being a BSG freak.) If they hope that This is the new Bamber / Helper / Park, maybe you want to rethink it. Not only the adults caught the attention of the audience. Eric Stoltz does an outstanding job as Daniel Greystone, a man who is so haunted by his family tragedy that he gets out of his first chance to jump out of grief, does not let go. He does a terrible and captivating job by conveying the crafty knowledge of his character about the inner world of computers and people, especially in a scene where he spins a net for his daughters young boyfriend, includes them, releases them, and dismisses them. None of the "serial killer" he played in Gray's Anatomy, a truly impressive spectacle. <br /> <br /> Equally strong, if not nearly as much, is Paula Malcomson as well as his wife Amanda Greystone. She's just as clever and well-written as Stoltz, and I thought it was a couple, a couple that is together forever and has a strong relationship, something that's rarely seen nowadays. I look forward to seeing what happens to this family, and hope she gives her as much to do as Roslin does in BSG. She is strong and smart and when she strikes after her child, it is really great. Not to mention their eyes, which might have magical powers, so intense are they. The scene in which she picks up the government agent - very short scene but beautifully played - really gives an idea of ​​her power. <br /> <br /> The other part of the show, which did not work 100% for me, was for me the scenes with Esai Morales and the mafia-type clan. He does a good job overall, but I did not believe in the power of the mob nor intimidated by their threats. I wish this whole story would be a little more mysterious and hard to figure out; The way it's presented is almost a tribute to the Godfather, they'll beat you a bit over the head. But over time I can see how it turns out to be an interesting thing with the poor minorities (Morales et al.) And the rich who rule the planet (pride, etc.). And to be honest, I liked it when he talked to his son about the origin of their name - that was a very well performed scene. <br/> <br /> Note to BSG fans, the boy plays 'Willy Adama' does not look very much like Olmos, but he's just a kid. Whether he is shown more than in this movie or not, who knows? I could not say it. But that did not bother me, because he was not as interesting as everything else around him. Polly Walker plays "Sister Clarice" and she's strange and weird in every scene she's in right now. I am not sure where she will go or with whom she will end, but I was very impressed with her acting. In this film, she was somehow by the way, but apparently prepared to play a very important role later. She was not like her character in "Rome", something I always find impressive with actors. <br /> <br /> A nice surprise - the music is actually better and less obvious than BSG, although the same guy does, Bear McCreary. It is a haunting and unusual approach that has surprised me. I would buy this score if I had the chance. <br /> <br /> The panel discussion after the show was moderated by Seth Green. Ron Moore was very smart and eloquent, David Eick was very smart (similar to his video diaries), Esai Morales told a long story about his cast, and Eric Stoltz was very funny and did not really answer the questions (but I've always had something for had him). Paula Malcomson was tough (she blamed Seth Green for falsely saying she was "24"), and the girls who played Zooey and Lacey were both darlings. Grace Park and Tricia Helfer were also present, answering questions about how they played the scenes with BSG. All in all a very interesting and beautiful evening. <br /> <br /> I give the show 9 out of 10 points and look forward to seeing it all unfold. <br /> <br /> NOTE: I just looked at this a second time and I really hope they find out what the original HOLOBAND was made for. I have no idea what that may be, but it fascinates me a lot.
