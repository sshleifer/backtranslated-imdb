Part of what was so great about the classic Looney Tunes cartoons was their disrespect and their fear of doing nothing they wanted. In this case, Marvin the Martian has the mission to bring back an earthling. Sure, he meets Bugs Bunny, who warns of a mutiny of Marvin's dog. After Marvin has finally caught bugs - with the help of an Acme straitjacket that bazooka emits! - Bugs has more planned for the return to Mars. What I mean is, if you thought that it was a big change in the solar system when they robbed Pluto of its planetary status, then you have not seen anything! Yes, "The Hasty Hare" gets it all out. How they buy Acme products in space is probably superior to most people, but the point here - I mean "bunny" - is to have fun. And believe me, you definitely will. After all, a little space has never hurt anyone.
