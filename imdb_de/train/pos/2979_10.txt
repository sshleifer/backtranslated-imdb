There really is not much to say about this film ... it's crude but funny. <br /> <br /> Plot Outline (from IMDB) <br /> <br /> /> Two losers from Milwaukee, Coop & Remer (Parker & Stone) invent a new basketball game with baseball rules. If the game becomes a big hit, with the help of a billionaire, they form the Professional Baseketball League, where everyone receives the same pay and no team can change city. The Milwaukee Beers team at Coop & Remer is the only team that stands in the way of the main rule changes that the owner of the Dallas Felons (Vaughn) wants to establish. <br />> The Acting is pretty good, as there are not many big stars in this movie. Although I'm not a big fan of 'Southpark', Parker and Stone do a pretty good job in their first real movie. <br /> <br /> There are so many funny moments in this movie that I can not name almost anyone. It never really fills, and they do not try to put in any scary drama to make it more serious. <br /> <br /> And my favorite aspect of this movie: The Soundtrack. It is great. I especially like "Take me on" and "Beer" by Reel Big Fish. Very underrated. <br /> <br /> All in all a raw but extremely funny movie. 10/10 <br /> <br /> James "Black Wolf" Johnston
