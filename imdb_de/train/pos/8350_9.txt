As with this film, we follow the implausible, though always exciting, adventures of the 2 main characters. But while C + J misses sex for a girlish journey into childhood, the two in their carnival even rave to exploring homosexuality. Most of the sex they get from reluctant or unwilling partners, and yet, despite their deep PC-less behavior, everyone comes up smiling. Like C + G, they remain innocent at heart and rebel against the quitidia, the bourgeoisie, the restrictive. As someone else has commented, I do not want to know these 2, and it's a small miracle that their journey has scenes of mostly comedy and very little tragedy (and what does not exist at their door) and therefore reason for doing so seduced me, but with a sweet taste in my mouth. May I say that only the French can get away with such films. And that's part of her genius.
