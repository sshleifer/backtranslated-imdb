This is a romantic comedy with a focus on comedy for a change. As always, the lovers - Sally Field as almost over the hill opera queen Celeste Talbert; and Kevin Kline, a marginally talented and marginally talented actor, Jeffrey Anderson - work for mutual purposes and do not seem to realize that they are immortally in love. She owes a little to Bette Davis' Margo Channing in All About Eve (1950) and a whole Sally Field has dedicated herself to the slapstick theatrical tradition, and she exaggerates herself in the merriment as she fails her way to love and luck. Kevin Kline, one of the more underrated senior men of recent years, is also very good and very successful, as he manages to be pretty, vulnerable, selfish and amiable at the same time. <br /> <br /> Celeste's Center for Wrong Developments Fear of losing her audience when she got to her forties and with the arrival of her niece, up and coming actress Cori Craven (Elisabeth Shue), who DOES NOT consider herself her niece turns out, with the complications of the complications. Cori manages to win a small portion of the soap opera as a homeless dumbass before she discovers her true relationship with Celeste (and to Jeffrey Anderson as well) - but no matter. <br /> <br /> As a romantic counterpoint or The main roles are Robert Downey Jr. (director of soap opera David Barnes) and Cathy Moriarty (Montana and Nurse Nan). David Barnes is so hot for her, but she only cares about one thing: get rid of Celeste so she shines brighter on the set. To do this, she gets Barnes to do everything possible to ruin Celeste's career, but by accident and / or perverse logic, all his attempts go awry, much to the viewer's delight. <br /> <br /> Whoopie Goldberg plays Rose Schwartz, the show's lead author and Celeste's alter ego and confidante, while Carrie Fisher plays a modest role as producer of the series. <br /> <br /> I thought that would be funnier than just another parody of the soap opera world I've seen (Young Doctors in Love 1982, who burlesqued the General Hospital of the TV and was pretty good). Soapdish is funnier with a nude script and lots of laughing one-liners and great performances by Field, Kline and Downy, Jr .. But see this for Sally Field, which is outstanding.
