Probably one of the best examples of an exciting, dramatic episode (in this case, the superb balance of horror) with a lighter matter. Shore Leave is the first real attempt by the Star Trek writers to produce a more entertaining piece of sci-fi, and although the formula in this entry is still not quite true (the true triumph is Trouble with Tribbles in Season 2), that comes Laughing pretty fast, as long as the viewer is ready to allow all the stupidity. <br /> <br /> In order to deviate from the tradition of the show, the company has no real mission in this episode. Instead, Kirk has found a perfect planet for his crew to spend some free time: a deserved break after three months of uninterrupted work. The earth-like planet (a budget fact) is very appealing, but it only takes a few minutes for something strange to happen. McCoy begins to have visions of a white rabbit that seems to come directly from Lewis Carroll's work. Soon, other people begin to experience similar things: A woman meets a Don Juan-like character, Sulu meets a samurai and Kirk encounters a double encounter with the past, in the form of almost love and the guy who uses it has to tackle him at the academy. Throw in a crazy, real-looking tiger, and it's easy to see why Kirk and Spock are determined to find out what's going on before someone gets hurt. <br /> <br /> The Idea is Classical: Idyllic Place Far from the Heavenly Sky The humorous setting of the episode on this topic is quite successful, if it were not a dark turn of events that does not go well with the rest (of course it works all right well and the end) and the general unwillingness of the cast not to show a funny side of yourself (especially and ironically the otherwise so funny William Shatner). And yet, Shore Leave deserves credit for being another great example of writers trying out new, previously unknown things: the definition of Star Trek's success. <br /> <br /> 7,5 / 10
