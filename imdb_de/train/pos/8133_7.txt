Well, I do not like rap personally, but I still think Fear of a Black Hat is funny. I'm sure I did not get any internal jokes, but some that I knew, and it was weird enough that I had to laugh just after I stopped laughing. I'm a big fan of Spinal Tap and had to check that out, of course. The film was rejected by This Is Spinal Tap, sometimes blatantly, but this movie was still a stand-alone, intelligent and witty satire. My personal favorite: "In times of slaves, they had no hats to protect them from the sun, so at the end of the day they were too tired to revolt, and now we have hats."
