First of all, let's clarify a few things: Zombies do not exist, so the filmmaker can have them WALK, RUN or even FLY if he wants. That's what makes this original zombie movie so good. Everything they did was so damned original. I hate it when filmmakers do anything like Romero or when fan boys expect everything like Romero. Some idiots think that zombies should growl like a typical Romero movie. Again, there are no zombies, so a filmmaker can have zombies whistle if he wants to. The zombies in this movie all look very good, but it's obvious that they do not spoil corpses because they're just freaking out! They are quite confused and full of hacked faces and blood. One of the coolest scenes was a half-eaten cat. It looked so damned real that my daughter cried when she saw it. This movie received really good reviews in Fangoria and Rue Morgue, which is why I really wanted to see it. I'm glad I listened. You are always right when it comes to the taste of real horror fans. 10 out of 10! Rent it!
