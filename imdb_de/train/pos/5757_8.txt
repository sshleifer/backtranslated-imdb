This film could only be created in the 70s !! It's a bizarre action movie that takes place in a small California working-class city. A kind of mill or plant closes, so that suddenly on the street malicious behavior occurs! The city dwellers are tired of it! Ben Arnold (Jan Michael Vincent) goes to another city to recruit his brother Aaron, whom Kris Kristofferson plays. Aaron is a Vietnamese veterinarian who gets a little out of balance and works. He's hanging out with a bunch of grumpy Vietnam veterinarians. They come to the city to clean it up (they are deputized), but under their good deeds they actually operate playhouses and ask for protection money etc. !!! It takes a while for people to assert themselves, and in a biblical Cain and Abel showdown, Vincent has to turn to his older brother. In this movie, there is an interesting sleaze atmosphere that makes it interesting (watch the cockfighting scene!). Vincent is almost too angelic in this role? he values ​​his brother so much that he can not imagine that he is committing the evil deeds he is accusing. Finally he comes to his senses? His girlfriend Victoria Principal is brutally stabbed in the back and he himself is beaten up in his apartment. Kris Kristofferson is incredibly effective as Aaron. He coolly denies any misconduct and even begrudges himself gently and talks to Vincent's little daughter (she calls him "Uncle Aaron"), even if he threatens her father's life and always smiles! Vincent and Kristofferson have a good contrast chemistry. Bernadette Peters makes an interesting appearance as a "saloon" girl who attracts Aaron's attention. This is a good action movie from the 70s, if you can find it !! It is NOT available on DVD yet?
