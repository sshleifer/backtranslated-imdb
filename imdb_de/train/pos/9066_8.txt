~~ I saw this movie on an early passport yesterday morning. ~~ <br /> <br /> I am a mother of 2 children aged 11 to 6 who may refer to having to watch a lot of "kids" movies. That was refreshing for me. I have not read this particular book, so I do not know if it has remained true to the book or not. The gross factor has certainly reached a high level. This is the story of the "new" kid in town, and it's just that there's a group of boys who have started a kind of club and love to pick up kids. Have not we all suffered one or the other time? He has the little brother he can not stand and parents who are embarrassing. What I enjoyed most was seeing each character different from another they all stood out for. The Tyrant (why do you always turn the tyrant into a red head? My daughter has red hair and she is not a tyrant!). It took twists and turns, and you fall in love with all and really find yourself for all the characters! Even the parents, great connection between father and son. All around pleasing, sweet, funny, coarse, etc. ...... Take your children with you !!! You will enjoy it as much as you!
