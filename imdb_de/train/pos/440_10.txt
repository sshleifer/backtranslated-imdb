My favorite movie. Oscar caliber work of all involved in front of and behind the camera. The script is perfect and definite, unlike the novel, completely satisfying the relationship between Lady Caroline and George Briggs. The care with which the other main characters were drawn is a tribute to scriptwriter Peter Barnes, and the intense visual beauty should have won Oscars for director Mike Newell and cinematographer Rex Maidment. It is by far the best work of Josie Lawrence and has changed my mind about Joan Plowright. After seeing this movie at least 50 times, I can not find a mistake. The music of the famous composer Richard Rodney Bennet is a miracle.
