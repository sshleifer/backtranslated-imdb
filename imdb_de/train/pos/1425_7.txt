Just as Al Gore shook us with his painfully honest and cleverly presented documentary "An Inconvenient Truth", directors Alastair Fothergill and Mark Linfield remind us that it is time to improve our way of life to save our beautiful planet , "Planet Earth" is also a wake-up call that the global warming of our planet has catastrophic consequences for all living things around the world. Al Gore showed us the bleak future of planet Earth by presenting hard facts that have been documented by long, but always interesting, monologues. The creators of this documentary choose another equally powerful way to accomplish this. They do not give us any future depiction of what might come to our planet unless we radically change things, but they show us the true beauty of planet Earth in all its amazing glory. We see places that we knew existed, but never thought they could be so beautiful. In this film, we see a plethora of extraordinary places like deserted deserts, vast forests full of wildlife and flora and icy landscapes as far as the eye can see. And in all these very different environments we see the most beautiful animals trying to survive. <br /> <br /> This is exactly the kind of film that had to be done in combination with Al Gore's film. To make us realize that our planet is too valuable to interfere with. The voice-over by Patrick Stewart is always relaxing and therefore very well done, although at first it sounded like I was watching an X-Men movie instead! Cinematography is probably the most notable feature of this documentary. Sometimes: What you see is so unreal that you tend to forget that a man with a camera actually had to film all the adorable footage. <br /> <br /> In short, this is definitely a must for everyone as it is about every single person on this beautiful planet Earth! The truth is: I never thought that our planet is so amazingly beautiful!
