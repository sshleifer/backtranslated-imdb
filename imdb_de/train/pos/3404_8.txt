The audience in 1936 must have been taken aback by what it saw: a full-fledged, beautiful, full of Technicolor movie. I can not say for sure, but this was perhaps the first (3-strip). On DVD, it still looks nice after more than 70 years. How good it looks is amazing. <br /> <br /> Kudos will have to go to director Richard Boleslowski, cinematographer Virgil Miller, Selznick International Pictures and the DVD MGM Home Entertainment. Together they made us one of the best-looking films of the classical era. <br /> <br /> I thought the story was so-so: excellent in the first half, stagnant in the second. In the end there was good news, although many people may not be happy with it. I can not say more without spoiling things. <br /> <br /> Marlene Dietrich never looked better, I do not believe and never played such a soft character ("Domini Enfilden"). Heartbeat Charles Boyer was the male star and Domini's love object, but some of the smaller characters were the most interesting to me. People like Joseph Schildkraut as "Batouch"; John Carradine as "The Sand Diviner"; Most memorable for me was the dancer "Irena", played by Tilly Losch. Wow, there is a face and a dance that you will not forget so soon! I've never seen anything like that in the thousands of movies I've seen. Just to see her doing her thing was worth the price of the DVD. She only appeared in four films on her IMDb CV, but they were all well-known films. Basil Rathbone, the actor who became truly famous with "Sherlock Holmes," is also here, as well as C. Aubrey Smith, another famous British actor of his time. By the way, Schildkraut is recognized by classic movie fans as the man who played the arrogant salesman in the big hit "The Shop Around The Corner" starring Jimmy Stewart and Margaret Sullivan. <br /> <br /> The beautiful direction, photography and color and Tilly's dance are the things that I remember best from this movie, which are many good and less good things in one. If the last half hour had been better - though I admire the end - I would have rated it even higher. It's definitely a film collector who wants to complete his collection.
