It's not always easy to explain what a movie looks like, but this time I think I found it. It reminded me of two films: Trainspotting (small time criminals who made some drugs in Schotland and did some stupid things) and The Blair Witch Project (because of the film style). <br /> <br /> It's about the loyalty between two friends, one comes out of jail, the other has not been caught yet. With a stolen vehicle they drive through the Scottish countryside, but then the gasoline goes out. As they search for fuel, they find a farm in the middle of nowhere. The farmer says they want to rob him and point a gun at one of them. Then everything goes wrong. One of the friends inadvertently shoots the farmer's daughter and they have to run. What follows is a hunt through the fields and forests of Scotland. The two friends literally have to run for their lives. This movie was apparently shot in just 12 days. OK, that's not unbelievable, because most of it is always in the same place: in the Scottish countryside, but I still find that amazing. Especially because this is not really a bad movie. It may not be the best movie ever, but you can still be proud of what you've achieved. I had a nice time watching it and overall I liked the movie. I give a 7/10.
