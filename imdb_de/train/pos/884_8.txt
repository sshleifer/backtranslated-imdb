If you're a fan of Film Noir and think they're not doing it the way it used to be, here's your answer - you just do not make it in Hollywood anymore. We need to turn to the French to remember how satisfying, subtle, and great a well-made movie from this genre can be. Read My Lips is a wonderfully nasty little gift to the faithful of director Jacques Audiard, narrative and eminent performances by Emmanuelle Devos and Vincent Cassel. <br /> <br /> The basic plot might have been written in the 1940's: stupid But an appealing ex-swindler and a clever but smart femme fatale (who proves ruthlessly ambitious) discover each other while living living in bleak desperation and longing, manipulating each other to achieve their own goals, developing complex love / hate relationships, cooking a criminal system with robbery, double crosses, conversations, and lots of money. All measures take place in oppressive, troubled and / or poorly lit places. <br /> <br /> Of course Audiard has made some modern twists. The Femme Fatale is an underrated office worker who is almost deaf and uses her lip-reading skills to avenge those who marginalize her. And where you can expect hot love scenes, discover that both characters are sexually awkward and immature. Add a little modern technology and music and it seems like a contemporary movie, but do not make mistakes - this is Old School Film Noir. It's just about every movie in the genre and no doubt one of the best movies I've seen all year.
