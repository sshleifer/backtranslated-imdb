(Spoiler?) <br /> <br /> I was not sure what to make of the movie. Not too much of a children's movie. In any case, it should be observed with a parent as it involves death and dying. But I was surprised that I was a bit entertaining. <br /> <br /> I was a bit disappointed with the 81 minutes we had. (even less without credits) And the trailer makes you think the rodent is a major creature. But unfortunately they torture him. Until the end of the film. These two handles coupled the film with 2 stars. But I recommend the movie. Also for a sequel. <br /> <br /> 8/10 <br /> <br /> Quality: 9/10 Entertainment: 7/10 Repeatable: 7/10
