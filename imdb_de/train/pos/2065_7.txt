The anxious symmetry is a pleasant episode with some mistakes. The first thing about the episode is that it takes place near Mountain Home Air Force Base in southwest Idaho. 'Deep Throat' takes place near Ellen's Air Base, also southwest of Idaho. I wonder if the Air Force bases are one and the same, but they decided to use the correct name in Fearful Symmetry. Mulder and Scully have good dialogues, always a plus. Ed Meecham, the zookeeper, reminds me of crazy old teachers. You must have liked children once, you just can not imagine how. Just as he must have cared more for the animals in one place. I liked the concept of the episode, but I felt there were some inconsistencies. If aliens are so good at kidnapping people and bringing them back safely, why can not they return the animal to the right place? And the aliens have problems returning the animals? I do not buy Mulder's theory of a problem with the space-time continuum. As if he was an expert. I also thought that Jayne Atkinson's performance as Willa Ambrose was not good. Apart from these nitpicks, I still enjoyed this episode because of the intriguing concept of aliens harvesting both animal and human DNA.
