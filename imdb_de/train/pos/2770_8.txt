Looking at David & Bathsheba is a much better way to attend the Bible lessons for Sunday School. Despite a script that is occasionally unintentionally funny, the movie is extremely entertaining. The studio system had its mistakes, but no expense was spared when a complex production was required. Peck portrays King David as a lusty, but tormenting poet who, what's synonymous with the murder, puts a sexy Bathsheba, Susan Hayward, to bed. Raymond Massey as Prophet Nathan delivers his usual Saturnine and wild performance. Look for the silent film star Francis X. Bushman as King Saul and a young Gwen Verdon as dancer. Hurray for the Old Testament and Hollywood.
