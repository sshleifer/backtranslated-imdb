This movie completely ran around the original Dolemite. It had everything that makes a movie great except for real actors. (Ernie Hudson could not do it alone and you know that! LOL) I admit that I've killed my first videotape of this movie and I plan to buy the DVD version as soon as possible! This movie has so many catchy lines, it's pathetic! It is embarrassing to say that I know the title song back and forth! I love the figure of Jimmy Lynch to death, and he should have won the Best Supporting Actor award in Blaxploitation, but the Oscars were NEVER ready for that! This is a random movie consisting of Crooked Cops, Breasts, Chases, Bad Editing and of course Martial Arts. (It's the 70's and I can tell everyone knew some kind of martial arts). I think this movie should be restored and shown in the middle of a marathon in the local theaters one evening!
