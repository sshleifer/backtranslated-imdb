The only reason why I give this movie 8/10 stars, and not 10, is because 1) Sinatra is terrible and 2) the love interest of Kelly's character leaves something to be desired (IMHO). I love that Dean Stockwell, Quantum Leap - Al, is the little boy. The dance sequence with Jerry Mouse is one of the most entertaining and amazing dance sequences I've ever seen. Tom and Jerry are still a personal favorite of mine and my daughter. I'm 28 and she's 4, and although the character is less iconic than Mickey, today he is still a favorite of many children and adults. Kelly is as always fascinating, his eyes are full of fun and excitement. In every movie I've ever seen, he always steals the show. One of the best dancers of the 20th century. No wonder Paula "tasted" Abdul Kelly's moves. I would also call Gene Kelly one of the most beautiful people of the 20th century. If you only see one part, do not miss Kelly's dance with Jerry Mouse. You will not be disappointed.
