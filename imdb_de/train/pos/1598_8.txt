Either or, I love the suspension of any formal action in this movie. I have visited it many times and it always lasts. A bit too stylized for some, but I think every opera lover will love it. Norman Jewison, a Canadian compatriot, has tremendous chances with his films and his casting, and it's almost always worth it in films that are not in the middle of the picture and somehow delicious, as is the case here. I've often wondered about the lack of Cher's acting roles, whether she chose to keep this part of her life to a minimum, or that she does not get enough good roles to chew on. I've found out she's an outstanding actress, who can retreat into a role as in this role, or be loud and brave and wild as in "Mask." I sometimes found the comic strokes wide (a hair salon called "Cinderella"), but this was the whole intention of the writer and the director. Nicolas Page plays the frightened tenor of the opera, all extravagant gestures, and once demanded a knife to cut his throat. The Brooklyn scenes are magical, this is a Brooklyn under moonlight, romantic and dramatic like an opera. All in all, a very satisfying movie that was by no means to everyone's taste. I loved the end, all were brought together like a Greek choir, each part subtly nuanced and blended with the others 8 out of 10.
