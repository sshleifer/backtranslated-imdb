Dominion Tank Police is undoubtedly one of the most amazing shows ever produced, but not just in the animation space. While the first part (Acts 1 and 2) is mostly action and fun, the second part is more serious and you should not treat the second part the same way you did the first part. The intricacies are really out of this world and the characterization is unimaginable. You must have some intelligence to appreciate the subtleties of the second part (Acts 3 and 4). However, I have some complaints. In the first part of the tank Bonaparte literally jumping over a tank shell, and that made no sense at all. One could also question the plausibility of Bonaparte jumping on the wing of Helicopter Gunship, though it was cool. Buaku rules
