I saw the last Region 2 DVD of this movie in the Horror section of the Oxford Street store and advertised it as a "classic thriller". In fact, it's almost just a vehicle for Arthur Askey, one of the most popular names in British comedy and light entertainment for over four decades. <br /> <br /> Perhaps his relentlessly cheerful, boisterous and essentially good-natured humor will come as a cultural shock to many who have grown accustomed to the sour and cynical taste of many British comedies over the past 25 years. However, there are still those who appreciate his lively and happy personality and the complete avoidance of pathos. Askey was an idol to the great Tommy Cooper, who frequently borrowed the "self-strangulation gimmick" Arthur seeks to entertain the stranded passengers Travers, who acts as a mysterious Julie.
