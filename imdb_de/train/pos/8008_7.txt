As far as I know, this show was never repeated on British television after its original run in the late '60s / early' 70s, and most episodes are now unfortunately classified as "supposedly gone." <br /> <br /> Series 6 from 1971 still exists in its entirety, and recently I had the chance to see everything, the best part of 4 decades. <br /> <br /> After Freewheelers had hurried home from school, it was indispensable for me and for many of my contemporaries in these halcyon days with flared pants, slade and chicory tip. And to see again, brought a nostalgic lump in the neck. <br /> <br /> Do not mind the bad / hammering action, the unintentionally amusing fight scenes, plot holes big enough to go through a big high yacht night and the "awful, scary" RADA accents of the leading players. No. Forget it all. Because Freewheelers goes back to a bygone age (which I may call "golden") of the children's TV drama when the shows were just fun and did not take themselves so seriously. Before they became obsessed with all the fearful "Ishoos" that today's scriptwriters weary of their young protagonists like relationships, pregnancy, drugs, sexually transmitted diseases, and so on. <br /> <br /> No doubt, if it were "again" a modern audience "in these days of all-pervasive political correctness, the boss would be a black woman, one of the young male heroes would be a Muslim, the other a white one A guy who's confused about his sexuality, and the girl would be an all-action get-getter with an off-scale IQ that will make the guys out of scratch forever and make them look stupid - in other words, a million miles away from Wendy Padbury's sloping, ankle-busting wash upper. <br /> <br /> It's a show that's very "of its time." But is that a bad thing? I do not think so.
