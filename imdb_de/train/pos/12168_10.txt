"A Guy Thing" is not a classic, but a good, funny comedy. The plot focuses on Paul (Jason Lee) waking up in the morning after his bachelor party with no memory and Becky (Julia Stiles) lying naked in his bed. Before he can figure out what happened, he dumps Becky out of his apartment because his in love Karen (Selma Blair) is coming. After that arises, as you can imagine, chaos. <br /> <br /> Almost every single scene in "A Guy Thing" delivers a loud laugh. The funniest moments come when Paul imagines what might happen when he tells Karen about it. Selma Blair is a really talented comedian and the worst thing about this movie is that it's under stress. Although she turns out to be funnier than the character of Stiles, which is actually not that interesting. Of course, not every comedy is perfect. As I said, "A Guy Thing" is not a classic, but not bad, 7/10.
