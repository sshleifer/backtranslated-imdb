I had no idea what this movie was until I read about it in the L.A. Weekly. I generally agree with the reviews in LA Weekly and decided to get a ticket for this film. Film stars Molly Parker (from my favorite TV show Deadwood) and Lukas Haas - who I suspect will see more of this in the near future. The movie is funny, heartwarming, shows great acting and beautiful photography. I do not know if the movie will be expelled, but I hope that will soon be the case. This is a true indie gem. it even has music from my favorite band, the silver jews! The only disappointment was that Molly Parker was not present at the show. even without them there ... that was undoubtedly the best movie I saw at the festival.
