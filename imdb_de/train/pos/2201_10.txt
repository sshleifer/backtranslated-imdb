I've just completed the first CD in a collection of 4 discs (26 episodes) created in conjunction with the UCLA Film & Television Archive (S'More Entertainment, Inc.). So far (apart from the 1st episode) the picture quality is pretty good. The DVD box can be seen on the front page here on IMDb. <br /> <br /> "Mr. Peepers" is as charming as it was when I saw it for the first time (then 5 years old) and Wally Cox really is adorable in this role. If you're in the mood for a quiet comedy that sneaks up on you rather than knocking you over, you'll take the chance to experience all the wonderful characters you know from your childhood. Although some of the jokes are a bit stupid, most are awesome and well executed ... and even the stupid ones are fun. This is a television series that lives up to my early childhood memories.
