A nice story about how to follow your dreams and actually try to do something about it when the opportunity presents itself. It was not easy for Morris - he had a family, a job, a job opps elsewhere, a mortgage, etc. - it was not like he could just drop what he did and jump on the Greyhound without any problem, to play AAA ball for 4 months. It took courage. I'm glad they showed his indecision until he called the majors. I remember seeing him against the Red Sox (I think ...), it was a great story. Although Morris actually looks more like John Kruk or a Mills Watson than Quaid, that's okay. <br /> <br /> Quaid does a very good job of playing the man, the teacher, the trainer and the "oldest rookie". As someone who is in the same age group, I can no doubt identify with his plight. You are not too old to do what you dreamed of as a child, but it comes there. You have to do it sooner than lator. <br /> <br /> It is said that it is well edited, reworked, traded, good to see the familiar faces of the late Royce Applegate, Brian Cox and Rachel Griffiths here. <br /> <br /> Good work all around, glad it was hit. <br /> <br /> *** outta **** ... who would have thought that the Tampa devil rays would be the subject of such a good movie early?
