Although it does not follow the book very closely, it is still a very entertaining version of the story. Swayze was much better in the role than I expected. And Doody avoided the "silly woman from the deep in the wilderness" that most of us probably expected (see Kate Capshaw in "Indiana Jones & the Temple of Death"). It's surprisingly better than Richard Chamberlain's terrible quatermain strip. <br /> <br /> It's reminiscent of a western in many ways. The only thing that did not interest me was the whole mysticism, but I think that's part of the genre. For example, "How can you have an African adventure story without witch doctors and supernaturally wise wandering tribesmen?" Heh.
