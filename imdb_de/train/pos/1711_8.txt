Abhay Deol's second film, written by Imtiaz Ali, first directed by Shivam Nair. Soha probably has her first (?) Meaty role as Megha, a girl who ran away from home and waits in the marriage office in Delhi for her boyfriend Dheeraj (Shayan Munshi) to meet her. She waits and waits and is finally discovered by Ankush (Abhay Deol) as a girl in need. They spend many days together as he frees them from one troubling situation to another and finally falls in love with them. Then the friend returns! Aage pardey par dekhiye! Sounds familiar? This is another adaptation of Dostojewski's White Nights with a bit of borrowing from Le Notti Bianchi (but very tiny - Ankush keeps the lovers apart by telling the friend she's dead!). However, this is a more earthy and realistic adaptation (Duh) than the much outwitted and exaggerated Saawariya. I wonder why nobody gave birth to this little gem when we all talked like mad about Saawariya a few months ago. The settings in Delhi are wonderful - there is the obligatory passage through old Delhi, shots of Jama Masjid from a rooftop, Connaught Circus, streets with rickshaws (what? How?). The colorful lights in the hotel are enough to let you know that this is a shabby place to rent by the hour! <br /> <br /> The more I see of Abhay, the more I like this young man. In this second movie he is pretty good, because he has a meaning in life from a beautiful woman. Soha looks beautiful and when she smiles, she suits the role, but I could not convince her in the more serious moments. I'm not sure if she's a great actress, or maybe she'll bloom as late as her brother. The music of Himesh Reshammiya is not great, and indeed the film breaks in with the songs, they interrupt the narration and do not sit well with the characters trying to sing them. The minor cast is outstanding and I give the White Nights adaptation a thumbs up. By the way - the fact that I love Abhay Deol's sweet dimples has NOTHING to do with my rating.
