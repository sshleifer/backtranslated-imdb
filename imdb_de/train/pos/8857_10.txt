Director Sidney Lumet has done some masterpieces, like Network, Dog Day Afternoon or Serpico. But he did not have much luck with his last work. Now Lumet brings his best movie in decades and in my view, a true masterpiece: Before the devil knows that you are dead. I think this movie is like a rebirth for Lumet. This film has an excellent story that takes deep, has many layers. I think the end of the movie is perfect. The performances are brilliant. Philip Seymour Hoffman does a great job, as usual, and he is undoubtedly one of the best actors of our time. Ethan Hawke is also an excellent actor, but he is underestimated by my point of view. His performance here is great. The rest of the cast is also excellent (especially the great Albert Finney), but these two actors bring with them monumental performances that were unfortunately ignored by the actress's pathetic Oscars. The film has a good intensity, sometimes nks to the performances and partly thanks to the brilliant script. Hell knows that Dead is a true masterpiece with perfect directing, a great script and great performances. We need more movies like this.
