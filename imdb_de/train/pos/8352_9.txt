This movie is a stunning piece that will convince even the most skeptical audience that Gerard Depardieu is one of the best movie actors of the past 50 years. His performance shocks, entertains, disgusts and charms you, leaving you breathless. This film was shot in the early days of his film career and is very raw, but he can still convey the championship of Depardieu. A must for every Depardieu fan and by far his best early work.
