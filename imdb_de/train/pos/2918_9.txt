... I saw this on cable in the late 1980s, having been a big wrestling fan since 1986. I saw and bought this on VHS in a sales container. <br /> <br /> 1998, I started training as a wrestler after the Air Force and kept checking to see how it was a very accurate representation of the people involved in wrestling (Families and friends who do not understand us, the journey, the heartache), etc.). Henry Winkler is funny and sometimes sad to see how nobody else can understand what a genius he is creative. A great way to break up. The Fonz figure he played on Happy Days back then. Check out the cast members ... William Daniels (Knight Rider), Polly Holiday (Alice) and the wrestlers Roddy Piper and Chavo Guerrero Sr. If you have a chance, look at this.
