In a detention center, four prisoners occupy one cell: Carrère (Gérald Laroche), who was guilty of fraud at his company and betrayed by his wife; the Resistance Lassalle and his protege, the retarded Pâquerette, who ate his six-month sister; and the intellectual Marcus (Clovis Cornillac), who killed his wife. One night, Carrère finds an old journal hidden in a hole in the wall of the cell. They recognize that the book was written by Danvers (Geoffrey Carey) at the beginning of the last century and is about black magic. They decide to read and use the contents of the prison if they find the truth about Danvers' fate. "Maléfique" is an original, fascinating and claustrophobic French low budget horror movie. The story is practically in the same place, has no clichés and draws the viewer's attention to the last scene. I'm a big fan of French cinema, usually romances, dramas and police stories, but I've noticed that I've recently seen some good French horror films like "Un Jeu d 'Enfants", "Belphegor" and "Dead End" , My voice is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Sinais do Mal" ("Sign of the Evil One")
