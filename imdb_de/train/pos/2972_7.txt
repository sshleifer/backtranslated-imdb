I have to admit that I'm a big fan of South Park and I expected basketball to be fun, but not nearly as good as it turned out! I think that happens when you mix David Zucker, Matt Stone and Trey Parker together. This movie has so much repeatability and never bothers to take it seriously. Stone and Parker mixed humor in slapstick style works flawlessly. The kind of humor that exists in basketball was not popular at the time of release, and if it came out today, it would be a hit. Do not try to be critical, just leave your brain at the door and expect endless laughs. Recommended for everyone with a good sense of humor.
