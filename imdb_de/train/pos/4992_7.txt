I generally find Loretta Young hard to bear, too concerned with her looks and all too false qualities. But in this lyrical Frank Borzage romance, and although she plays a low-self-esteem patsy that boggles too much with the superhuman Spencer Tracy, she's direct, honest, and irresistible. It's a strange little movie that's mostly played in a one-room cabin in a Hooverville, oddly open about depression but romantic and idealized. Tracy plays a stupid, hard-to-take "normal guy," who by today's standards is a terrible chauvinist and bully. He softens the hard edge of his character and makes him almost appealing. Marjorie Rambeau and Glenda Farrell (who have never got as far as they should) support the work, and Jo Swerling's screenplay is humble and efficient. But the real heroes are Borzage, who always loved to dramatize true love in a lyrical close-up, and Young. You want to slap her and tell her character that she's too smart, she's too good for this guy, but she's so numb and convincing that you're satisfied with her story coming to a satisfying conclusion.
