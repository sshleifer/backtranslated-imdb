Vertigo co-stars Stewart (in his final round as the romantic lead role) and Novak highlight this film, Stewart's other "Christmas movie," for above-average entertainment. The chemistry between the two stars provides a rather moving experience, and further revelations can be taken from the film when witchcraft is seen as a metaphor for private pain that obstructs many people's relationships. All in all a nice change with legendary stars, 7/10.
