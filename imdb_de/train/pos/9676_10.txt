The movie was very sweet and heartwarming! I cry almost every time I see the movie. I would recommend this movie for everyone. The movie was so inspiring for me. The actors did a great job and the movie was very well played and done. The film was about a little girl who had a parrot of which she called Paulie. Paulie had been separated from her parents because they thought it would be best for her. After experiencing so many people, Paulie ended up in a cage in a basement. After all, this Russian man who got a job as a janitor. He had found Paulie in the basement and Paulie started talking to him and telling him the story of his life. In the end, the man helped Paulie unite with Marie (the little girl who had raised Paulie). Love has overcome all obstacles.
