Personally, I really loved this movie a lot and it moved me a lot. The two main characters give us such great performances that it's really heartbreaking to know what happened to their characters in the end. The alchemy between Barbra Streisand and Kris Kristofferson is wonderful and the song is just great as it is. <br /> <br /> So I was not surprised when I learned that he won 5 Golden Globe Awards (the most awarded Golden Globes movie), an Oscar and even a Grammy. This movie is a classic that deserves to be seen by everyone. A great film that has often been criticized (perhaps because Streisand dared to get involved, certainly as a "co-director"). Your craftsmanship is the greatest, and you'll love it!
