Yesterday I saw the new redubbed and edited version and was thrilled. Then I went home and saw it with subtitles and I loved it. I am ready to see it again. <br /> <br /> I am a fan of the mild, secret identity and what could be milder than a pacifist librarian? The scenes in which he reveals his superpowers to his friends or absentmindedly forgets to be meek are my favorites. <br /> <br /> Of course the martial arts are breathtaking. I can not really say much about it if you are familiar with the HK style. But if you do not ... we paused briefly, and Walker, Texas Ranger was on. We noticed that there was a cut after every beat. Not in black mask. <br /> <br />
