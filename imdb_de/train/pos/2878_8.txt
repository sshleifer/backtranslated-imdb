I either did not like this movie for a long time or I liked this movie but not so much anymore. I looked at it recently (at a sleepover, strangely enough) and I liked it more than I did since I was under 6 years old. I appreciate it more now because I'm doing it with some of the other Disney classics I've reviewed recently (including "Sleeping Beauty" and "Pinnochio" or whatever you spell it out). <br /> <br /> I really appreciate the animation, the clever "Disney" -plotation, the humor of the mice, the emotions expressed and the plot. The animation is very well done, often it seems like you are everywhere, where the other characters are, and look at it. The animation also shows the styles of the backgrounds, including the city (which is briefly shown twice). Disney changes this in a surprisingly good way from the original fairy tale by introducing clever twists such as mice making the clothes and the key part (usually I do not like Disney movies very much if they are not very similar to the original story, but I'm not I think they have made necessary changes to make this Disney movie a good movie, and I often think that Disney did not change the book in a good way in some movies. <br /> <br / > You know the story, Cinderella is a girl who works for her terrible stepmother and step-sisters, she goes to the ball with her fairy and loses a glass slipper ... <br /> <br /> This is a movie that The immediate family is not good enough To enjoy this, I recommend you share it with friends (and your immediate family if you wish). Watch. :-)). <br /> <br /> I recommend it to people who like Disney at least a little, people who like fairytales, and people who like mice. Enjoy! :-)
