A great idea: 11 stories about 9/11. 11 directors from different countries with different results. Ken Loach, who (as usual) talks about an immigrant, is just awesome (as usual). The Frenchman is also doing a very good job, while the Burkina Faso film was a nice surprise. However, the Israeli film was a bit boring, and the Mexican, well, he should stop directing and working in a Mexican restaurant. 8.10
