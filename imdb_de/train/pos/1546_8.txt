I saw this movie before or near its year of publication 36 years ago (1969). Although all I can remember now is that I long to see it again. The parts I rightly or wrongly remember include Mustard gas in the trenches and Suzie Kendall as a German spy, offering some sexual favors on the back of a closed truck for military information. The music score was especially memorable and moving in the Gone With The Wind league and I would like to hear it again. There must be a commercial or copyright reason why this movie is not available. Does anyone know why? I doubt it has anything to do with a lack of quality or interest.
