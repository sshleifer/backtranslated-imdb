Another small piece of the huge picture puzzle of the Holocaust is revealed in this docudrama about the protest against Rosenstrasse in Berlin, an event that I did not know started at the end of February 1943. The details are given in an addendum to this review. <br /> <br /> The movie narrative puts the story of this protest into another, contemporary story that begins in the present day in New York City. Here, a wealthy, non-observant Jewish woman whose husband has just died shocks her children and others by insisting on an extremely orthodox mourning rite. She even goes further and demands that her daughter's non-Jewish fiancée leaves the house. The desperate daughter Hannah (Maria Schrader) then finds out for the first time of an older cousin from the Second World War in Berlin, her mother, then eight years old, had been taken and protected by an Aryan woman. Hannah drops everything, goes to Berlin and finds this woman, Lena Fischer, now 90 years old. Hannah easily persuades the woman to tell her story. Everything seems to pat. <br /> <br /> The film is improving and, through long flashbacks, focuses above all on the events of 1943, which surround the protest in which the fictitious main character of Ms. Fischer is the same at 33 (played by Katja Riemann ), a baroness and trained pianist who is married to Fabian (Martin Feifel), a Jewish concert violinist, one of the men imprisoned at Rosenstraße. <br /> <br /> The narrative weaves back to the present from time to time and ends again in New York City. While scenes in the present are saturated in color, the scenes of 1943 are washed out, strongly on blue-gray tones. <br /> <br /> The quality of acting is generally pretty good, which we can expect given the deep talent reservoir in Germany and directed by Margarethe von Trotta, the most prominent filmmaker of the New German Cinema, herself a former actress. The protest story is simply told. All that is missing is a feature that would have helped: silent text notes at the end, showing the final outcome of those arrested on Rosenstrasse, a result that, as the addendum below makes clear, is incredibly positive. <br /> <br /> Rosenstraße has not developed well in the opinion of most movie critics. Excessively long, unnecessarily multi-layered, carriers of gender-specific stereotypes, manipulative with music: this is how the usual raps go. It is too long. However, I found in this film a stern, powerful, spontaneous, and totally convincing protest vote of the women who kept the vigil outside the Rosenstraße area, where their Jewish relatives and others were detained. I have found nothing striking, contemporary or manipulative in this presentation. <br /> <br /> The lack of extreme violence (nobody gets shot or otherwise physically brutalized) increased my tension, which increased as the movie progressed. They are constantly waiting for a malicious attack that starts every minute. The fatigue of the film stayed with me afterwards. Later that night I saw the movie, I often woke up, and my thoughts were filled with bleak, melancholy, chaotic imagery and feelings that the movie set off. That rarely happens to me.

Usually, the detainees were remanded for only two days before being loaded east on trains. But before the deportation of detainees could take place in this case, wives and other relatives got wind of the events and appeared at the address of Rosenstrasse, first in groups of two and then in ever-increasing numbers. <br /> <br /> Up to six thousand may have participated in the protest, though not all at the same time. Women called their husbands day after day for a week. Unarmed, disorganized and leaderless, they were at the disposal of the most brutal forces available to the Third Reich. Joseph Goebbels, the Gauleiter of Berlin, anxious to have this city racially cleansed, was also responsible for the public morality of the nation. In both cases, he was concerned about the potential impact of women's actions. Instead of inviting more open differences of opinion by shooting the women into the street and fearing the secrecy of the "Final Solution", Goebbels dismissed the prisoners on Rosenstrasse with Hitler's consent and even ordered them to return to Auschwitz. <br /> <br /> For Hitler and Goebbels the decision was only a shift in the inevitable. But they were wrong. Almost all of those who were released from Rosenstrasse survived the war. The women won an amazing victory over the destructive powers.
