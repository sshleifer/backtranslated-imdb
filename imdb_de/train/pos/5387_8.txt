Even in the 21st century, carrying children is dangerous: women have miscarriages and give birth prematurely. 75 years ago, it was not uncommon for women to die during childbirth. This is the theme of "Life Begins": A look at the station "difficult cases" of a maternity hospital. Loretta Young plays the lead role, a woman who was brought out of jail (the crime she committed is not relevant to the conspiracy) to give birth; She is in conflict with the fact that she has to give up her baby after giving birth. She is in a ward with several other women sharing their joy and pain. <br /> <br /> Although Loretta Young plays the lead role, Glenda Farrell will perform as usual. Farrell was one of Warner's "B" women in the 1930s, who appeared quite frequently in supporting roles and sometimes took the lead role in B movies. Farrell plays an expectant mother who does not want her children because they only get in the way. She does everything to get in the way of the nurses, including smuggling alcohol into the ward (of course during Prohibition Days) and drinking like a fish - apparently they have never heard of fetal alcohol syndrome in their thirties. Interestingly, unlike most early-thirties films, women are not idiots who stand in the way of heroic men - this situation is reversed, with the expected fathers trembling hills being jelly. (Note the seasoned character actor Frank McHugh as one of the expectant fathers.) "Life Begins," an early talkie, treats the theme with a ton of melodrama, but it's a pretty charming little movie. Turner Classic shows it, albeit rarely; I only saw it on a few days when I honored Loretta Young. However, it is highly recommended if it is displayed.
