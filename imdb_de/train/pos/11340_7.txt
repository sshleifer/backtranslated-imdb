Every child experiences a trauma, and each child's active imagination has gotten the best of them, but for Jake (Anthony De Marco of the forthcoming Clint Eastwood movie CHANGELING - which resembles Henry Thomas around 1982), the combination can prove fatal. <br /> <br /> A lone six-year-old whose imagination is in full swing when he's desperate to meet his quarrelsome parents Peter (Sean Bridgers, late of "DEADWOOD") and Jules (Brooke Bloom, "CBS: Miami") to learn. ) suddenly decide to divorce, leave him on his own and release a new tenant? a zombie in his closet. <br /> <br /> Jake actually gets that seed planted while playing with neighborhood friend Dillon (Matthew Josten), who provides him with an expression from the FAQ's FAQ: Zombies. Jake is so convinced that he wants to get him out? and his family ?? He starts shooting an action plan to protect her before it's too late. <br /> <br /> Indie newcomer Shelli Ryan ?? who wrote and directed ?? He mixes domestic drama with horror of the sub-cube, but the first outweighs (the latter) smarter than the other, with a decent story carried by his acting (De Marco is the rare kind of child actor with whom he is a CHILD and not "acting" - all of its nuances are very obvious from the clumsy, shy, introverted kid that many can tell (I certainly can): Bridgers makes his cheating husband realizing that he really loves his son while Bloom does It's no help having Dillon's mother Ruth (Monette Magrath resembling Laura Dern) constantly feed her implied information between Jake and his father Force Wedge, and Magrath also has a hard task. Its manipulative character is relatively sympathetic, though she proves in a revealing scene that I do not go into details, but show why she is the way she is (and more importantly, that she has influenced her own child as well). <br /> <br/> The filler's subjective camera is also well used (many angles show Jake's POV at waist height or a bit crooked;) (the upturned shot of Peter carrying his son in the same position while having fun in the backyard ) and the editing is relatively flawless. <br /> <br /> Ryan relied on personal experiences that grew up in the script, and also experienced how a friend goes through the same situation and how damaging the effects of relationships between adults His fears, anger and stress cause her children to be here.The film here is very successful in conveying its theme. <br /> <br /> However, the horror repressions are a bit incoherent, but the homage to George A. Romeros Zombie movies are lovingly shown by Ryan (Jake's mother) sleeping in front of the TV, while NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD unwinds, reflecting his own belief in the undead v made to stay in their house). The metaphor of a monster that serves as a substitute for domestic violence may be a bit cumbersome, but the child's fear of something under his bed is universal.
