After seeing Deliverance, movies like Pulp Fiction are not that extreme. It may not seem so nervous after today's blood and bullet standards, but if you think this was in 1972 and the film has a really sinister core, then you'll think differently. <br /> <br /> When I first started Looking at this movie, nothing really seemed unusual until I came to the "Dueling Banjos" scene. In this scene, the brutality and the edge of this movie is really visible. Watching Drew (Ronny Cox, Robocop) face a seemingly retarded boy, he really showed how edgy these films can become. If you think that the child has a small banjo that he probably made by hand, compared to Drew's nice, expensive guitar, you can really figure out how far the four men from their territory are. <br /> <br /> The story is credible and never goes beyond its borders. But what sets this movie apart, of four business people getting more than they expected on a canoe ride, is that director John Boorman (Excalibur) frees all characters from simple cartoons or stereotypes. When the movie was in total horror and tension, I really took care of all four men and what would happen to them. <br /> <br /> The acting is universally outstanding. With Jon Voight (Midnight Cowboy, enemy of the state) and Burt Reynolds (boogie nights, striptease) led the big cast. Jon Voight is probably the heaviest in the film and makes his transformation from father to warrior very believable. Unlike Reynolds, whose character is a warrior from the start, Voight's character changes throughout the film. Ned Beatty (Life) is also in an extremely tough role if you're raped by a hillbilly while Ronny Cox shows a credible performance. <br /> <br /> One thing that made these movies really powerful for me was that the villains were as horrible as I'd ever seen them. Bill Mckinney and Herbert "Cowboy" Coward were excellent and scary as Hillbilly's. Overall, the relief was excellent and I recommend it to everyone, except for people with weak stomachs and children. 10/10. Watch this movie.
