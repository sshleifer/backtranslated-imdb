I did not have high expectations for this movie, which surprised me pleasantly. The story is sometimes strange, but overall I believe it has acceptable credibility. The action scenes are pretty nice and the accompanying music is used to create some of the patriotic feelings that are common in US movies. This may not be the best movie of all time, but unusual for Sweden, and I hope to see more similar films in the future.
