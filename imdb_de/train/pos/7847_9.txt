Believe it or not, at 12 minutes this film (for 1912) is a feature film. Very, very few films were longer then that, but that is definitely NOT what distinguishes this little movie from the others! No, the difference is that all actors (with the exception of a frog) are mistakes ... yes, mistakes! This simple, little domestic comedy might look like productions with Chaplin, Laurel and Hardy or Max Linder, but instead this Russian production uses bugs (or, I think, models that looked just like bugs). Chaplin and Laurel and Hardy had not been discovered yet, and I assume Linder was busy. Maybe that's why they used mistakes. With stop motion, the bugs moved and danced and fought amazingly well - and a bit more realistic than King Kong 21 years later! <br /> <br /> The movie begins with Mr. Beetle sneaking away for a good time. He goes to a shabby club while his wife is supposed to be at home. But for Mr. Beetle, he is unfortunately caught by a local movie fan in front of the camera. Besides, he does not know, but Mrs. Beetle also runs a Bohemian locust painter. Of course there is much more to this domestic comedy than this, but the plot is ancient and very entertaining for adults and children. <br /> <br /> Scary, but also very amazing and observable.
