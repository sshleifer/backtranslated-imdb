This is an excellent documentary, packed with racing action, beautiful pictures and a great story. The IMAX cameras give you a very wide perspective, as a DVD movie it is perfect. You hear every speaker that almost always works. The movie does not speed up and gives you that natural feeling of 230mph. Of course there are a few sound effects, but I think they're good, they give depth to the driving scenes ...
