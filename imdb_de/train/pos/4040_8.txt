An imaginative, exciting exercise in claustrophobia. A Japanese thriller that puts itself in two rooms. Not quite successful, but taut, surprising and good-natured. You could remind the movie something about SAW? two men trapped in the room and hanged against each other ?? Unlike this film, however, it dares to stick to its premise and keep the hero in his cell throughout the movie. It's like a lab experiment. Some find the tension contained boring, but this reviewer found it fascinating. The sound and imagery of the film are surprisingly well implemented. This is certainly a good movie to show a good home video system. Just right for a late-night film festival when in a paranoid mood. It certainly kept me awake that night.
