All dogs go to heaven is one of the best movies I have ever seen. I saw it for the first time when I was 3 years old. Now I'm 12 years old and have rented it, it makes me think about things and brings back so many memories, these were "the days". I love the music, I love it when Charlie arrives in heaven, I love the song "Let me surprise you". I love how Charlie looks and how his voice is. Bert Reynolds could only play Charlie's voice so well. I love this movie, the first one is the best because it is so original and great. It really brings back memories nobody can describe, not even me. If only I could return to this time. I love the characters. If so, the memories will come back when I'm 12, and imagine how I'll feel when I turn 19. I hope I can watch this when I'm older. When I saw this for the first time, I never knew that I would really look back and feel that way. I hope it will be available. I am so happy that this movie was made and the amazing idea came to mind. On a scale of 1 to 10, I would give a perfect 10. It's an amazing movie. It's so hard to explain the feeling as I get older and when I have kids, I hope they can experience that feeling.
