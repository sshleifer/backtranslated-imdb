How much can the General Hollywood director learn from this movie? All ... when it comes to really scare people. This movie really shows that it is possible to really scare and scare a viewer, and that monstrous monsters and long knives will never be the best way to accomplish this. Everyone who loves a real psycho thriller needs to see this movie ... it's the best.
