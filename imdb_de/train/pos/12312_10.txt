I can not believe a movie that can do so well in 1987 and is virtually unknown in the West. Do not repeat other reviews here. The score is very good and moving. Literally, "dawn never comes" - when it comes to it, the beautiful spirit and the lover will be forever separated. After 24 years, Joel and Leslie still look great. I enjoyed Joel in God of Gamblers and many of Leslie's films, including Better Tomorrow.
