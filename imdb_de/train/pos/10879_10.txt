I've wanted to cut since the day I heard about what happened last year. Anyway, I got to see today, and when the movie started, I thought it started earlier in the week, but it got better after about 10 minutes. I thought the movie was pretty good. What I did not like was how the killer was created. I thought just before I rented that he probably looks exactly like the legends of Urban. Mostly everything had to be improved in the UL final section. CUT is 100 times better than UL: Final Cut. The best thing about CUT is the killer and the death scenes. The killer kicks MO F *** ING ASS. <br /> <br /> I give 8 out of 10 points
