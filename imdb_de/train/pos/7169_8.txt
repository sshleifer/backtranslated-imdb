As a rule, "kids" movies have something annoying quality that makes it too uncomfortable and unbearable for anyone over 13. Sure, it has exactly the same moments that often give a children's film the quality mentioned above, but this film does well against such conventions. The drama was decent, and the unruly momentum Stanley had with some of the other campers was more realistic than what most movies would portray. What I really liked about this movie was the fact that this movie did not try to break your heart or make you cry. The emotional power was a little more natural than most would imagine, in many ways like The Shawshank Redemption (which also has a similar redemptive end). The only disadvantage? The hot lizards. Overall, however, a 8/10.
