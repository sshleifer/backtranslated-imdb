I am a 53-year-old college professor. I went with my wife and my 12 year old daughter. We all enjoyed the movie. The film is original, funny, fast and absolutely charming. The plot was easy enough for a 10-year-old to follow, but she was so intricate that an adult was interested. I thought Emma Roberts did a great job and the rest of the cast was fine. My only criticism is that the Los Angeles sets were not as interesting as they should have been. They were functional, but nothing was noticeable. On the other hand, make-up, costume, lighting, cinematography, editing and directing were outstanding. All in all, I found it a totally enjoyable experience. I am disappointed that the professional critics (almost all adult men) have brutally attacked the film. Obviously, they have something against films that show strong, intelligent and independent young women. Her writings reveal more about her own sexist nature than anything else about this wonderful family movie. I highly recommend it to every child and parent.
