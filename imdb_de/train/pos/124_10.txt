* Contains spoilers, because I have to describe some film techniques, so read at your own risk! * <br /> <br /> I loved this movie. The use of tints in some scenes makes it seem like an old photo comes alive. I also enjoyed the projection of people on a back wall. For example, in one scene Leopold calls his wife and she is projected behind him instead of a typical split screen. Her face is huge in the background and Leo's is in the foreground. <br /> <br /> One of the best applications is when the boys kill the Ravensteins on the train, a scene shot in almost political poster style with facial close-ups. It reminded me of Battleship Potemkin, that intense, constant style, paired with the red beam, to deliver tons of horror without much blood. The same goes for the scene when Katharina finds her father dead in the bathtub ... all you see is the red water on the side. It's one of the things I love about Von Trier, his understatement of the horror, which makes it even scarier. <br /> <br /> The use of lyrics in the film was unique, as in Leo's character pressed by the word "werewolf". I have never seen such a thing in a movie. <br /> <br /> The use of black comedy in this film was well done. Ernst-Hugo Järegård is great as Leo's uncle. It brings forth the giggles I got from his role in the kingdom (Riget.). This humor makes it easier to concoct the conspiracy of the absurd anal remanence of trainers against the terrible backdrop of World War II and all the chaos. It reminds me of Riget, how the hospital administrator tries to maintain normalcy at the end of Part 1 when everything goes crazy. It shows that some people are really unaware of the terrible things that are happening around them. However, some people, like Leo, are hired but do not do anything positive. <br /> <br /> The voice made by Max von Sydow is also amusing. It pulls you into the story and lets you jump into Leo's head, which is sometimes an eerie place. <br /> <br /> The film sums it up that you're a coward if you do not opt ​​for one side. I see the same idea used in Dancer in the Dark, where Bjork's character does not stand up for himself and ultimately is their own destruction. At one time Trier seemed to be a woman to me by doing Breaking the Waves and Dancer, but now I know that his male characters are not feeling well! I found myself at the same place at the end of Dancer, if you really want the main character to redo their actions, but of course they never do!
