Yes, these are the full ten stars. It is a day when this abundance is awesome. The universe sent Trent Harris a young, wonderfully strange man one day, and Harris recorded him on tape in all that stupidity that you just can not fake. Too bad that it ended in tragedy for the young man, if only an alternative end could be written for the story of this man. The other two steps of the trilogy tell the story again, with Sean Penn and Crispin Glover in the roles of the young men. The world is expanded and the strangeness is contextualized by the retelling, so we get a broader insight into the strange growth in vanilla America. Recommended for everyone!
