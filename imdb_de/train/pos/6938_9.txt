For the viewer, who meets him long after his birth, "Winchester '73" has something in common with "Casablanca". As you look at it, you feel like you are looking at a number of clichés that are so common in the genre. then you realize that the clichés only became clichés after copying out of this movie and that they were so prevalent because this movie was so great. In other words, it's a groundbreaking work. "Winchester '73" is a pleasure to see. The plot's features are reasonably predictable, but mostly because you've seen them copied so often in later movies, and yet they still contain some twists that surprise you. The dialogue, the pace and the direction of man are excellent. Stewart shines especially, and if you're a fan this is a must, but he's not the only one who performs well. Remarkably, many of the most thoughtful and / or funnier lines refer to minor characters. Since these characters are (much) more than cardboard cutouts, they have given the film additional realism. <br /> <br /> This is a remarkably undervalued movie, and it's worth paying attention to. The DVD also includes an interview with Stewart, which provides some background information about the movie.
