I finally saw it after listening to great things about it. It exceeded my expectations. Given the budget, this was a surprisingly competent and well-made film. The lack of funds has helped the film in several ways, especially given the plot. Just like the Blair Witch Project, this movie was even better than being shot on video instead of film. Another bonus: While most low-budget horror films (even the best of the best) suffer from mediocre to unintentionally hysterical spectacle, this film actually had a talented cast (except one or two characters), especially the two main roles. The only thing missing in the film was an original plot. It leans heavily on more well-known films like "Deliverance" and "Wrong Turn," but if you're like me, movies of this kind will never stop being scary. In addition, the director remains interesting throughout. I would be very interested in what the director would do with a bigger budget, and I feel like it will only be a matter of time before we find out ...
