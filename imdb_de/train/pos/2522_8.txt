I have to admit, I did not expect anything good at first. I was just expecting a cheesy movie that would enhance the image of Gackt and Hyde, but I'm happy to say he has much more to offer. <br /> <br /> Yes, the acting is not great, but it does not hurt. All performers are disciplined and bring enough strength to their characters. The effects lack consistency, but action scenes are satisfying enough. <br /> <br /> What really impressed me was the essence of the plot, though it combines fantastic elements and has a rough reality. The development of the characters, their doubts and their feelings have really impressed me and I think that's the key to this movie. It makes you think and it transmits all fears. <br /> <br /> It meets all expectations for a good drama. I would definitely recommend it to anyone.
