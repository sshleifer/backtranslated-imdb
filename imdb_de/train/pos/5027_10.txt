I gave this movie a 10, because it had to be rewarded for its creepy elements and actors AND my god, the Enging! The thing is, I do not want to tell anyone about acting or history because it will ruin the movie. But I recommend that you immediately go to your next movie and rent it! (Do not forget popcorn!)
