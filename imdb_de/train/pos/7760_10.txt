Director Douglas Sirk scores again with the grandfather of all dysfunctional family films. This lush, trashy saga is a masterpiece that beautifully combines all the elements of Sirks Soapers and strategically unites them in one movie. "Written on the Wind" obviously influenced the 1980s TV series "Dallas" and "Dynasty," as this is basically a feature-length version of these later nocturnal soaps. Wonderful and subtle, Lauren Bacall plays Lucy Moore, a secretary from New York City, who marries oil baron Kyle Hadley (Robert Stack). Mitch Wayne (Rock Hudson) is unfamiliar to both, but also loves the quiet but sexy secretary. They all return to Kyle's family in Texas, where we meet his white garbage bitch Marylee (Dorothy Malone in an Oscar-winning round). Yipee! Sparks are starting to fly - from romances to catfights, this is a camping journey. Mitch not only has to fight the feelings he has for his best friend's wife, but Marylee tries to sleep with everyone because she can not have her only love, which is Mitch. In short, Kyle learns that he is unconscious, but somehow Lucy becomes pregnant. <br /> <br /> This is pure soap and pure melodramatic entertainment. How can you not love it? This film features one of Universal's most popular films and one of director Sirk's best works. Part of the dialogue is absolutely crackling and visual metaphors are cast in every aspect - the topic of wind is great. The cast is great, though Bacall is completely under challenged despite top billing behind Hudson. The Oscar loss from Stack reportedly devastated him. He saw this as his best performance and was apparently not too eager to lose. And he proved to be a whimpering alcoholic as a fabulous achievement. What a breathtaking movie! This film proves what I've been thinking for ages - Sirk is the master of classic melodrama. Where is his Oscar? <br /> <br />
