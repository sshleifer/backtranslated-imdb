I really loved it, although I found it rather annoying reading the reviews. But as an anime art fan, I can fully understand this perfect work of art, even though some of them were against my cultures and say that it's the art world .. !! The beginning of the film is very strong, strange and confusing. The content is difficult to understand why I respect the person who made it. Only those who are extremely open can make such a daring film. The characters, while sweet and adorable, go through some disturbing adventures that can not be erased (if the spelling is wrong).
