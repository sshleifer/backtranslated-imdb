Shawshank, Godfather, Pulp Fiction ... all good movies. Great movies. But nothing and I mean, nothing will do justice to the greatest Christmas movie, Santa Claus. The movie is so great and has so many messages that I cried while watching it. Seriously, this is one of the movies you need to see ten times. When we see that Pitch has to learn that he has to eat ice cream, we see the sadness in his eyes, and we feel the deep sorrow, and then we ask ourselves ... What's so bad about this ice cream? Does that mean that as humans we treat ice cream as good if it just makes us angry? Think movie makes you think. <br /> <br /> This movie has the best rendering of Santa Claus ever. Unlike other Santa Clauses, he is a normal person. We see him imprisoning children and spying on children's dreams, and we ask ourselves; Is Santa Claus, whom we believe in, really good? Also, this Santa Claus actually mentions Christ, the whole meaning behind Christmas. <br /> <br /> You owe this cinematic masterpiece. We should just stop making films and send nothing but this epic around the clock. Whether it's Christmas or not, this movie gets 500/10. Who says this movie is bad is a fool.
