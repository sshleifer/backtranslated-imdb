No one would argue that this war film of 1945 was a masterpiece. (How could a war film from 1945 be a masterpiece?) And yet this is a very powerful narrative of a true story by Al Schmidt, blinded to Guadalcanal, like John Garfield, who tagged the nuances with blindfolds for days on end Actions of a blind man. Robert Leckie detracts from Schmidt's popularity in favor of his fox-hole mate who was killed in "Helm for My Pillow" and wrote, "The country must have needed living heroes". <br /> <br /> Well, I think the country has done it. And they had one here. There is a single movie-themed fight scene tied to the studio lot, which lasts about ten minutes and less than half of the movie, rather than being saved for climax, but it's the scariest and most realistic portrayal of men under attack. which I remember seeing on screen, even in "Saving Private Ryan". Men scream with fear, yelling at each other and the enemy, bleeding and dying without the help of color, stereophonic sound, squibs or gore. <br /> <br /> Simply from a technological point of view film is outstanding. It's not just that we find out how complicated a caliber .30 mechanism and a water-cooled Browning machine gun are, or that it has to be triggered in a few rounds or that it's not waved around like a fire hose, as in so many other war films. The technical precision contributes to the fascinating quality of the scene. The need to make short bursts is frightening as dozens of screeching enemies fifteen yards over a creek to destroy you and your two isolated comrades who confine themselves to a small artillery base. <br /> <br /> The performances are solid, if not courageous, including the ubiquitous support of the 1940s, John Ridgeley, and a radiant, youthful Eleanor Parker. The framing love story is frugal, but it works and is quite moving in the end. A striking dream sequence is included. It is not Bunuel, but for a routine film from 1945 it is original and effective. <br /> <br /> Albert Maltz may have overwritten the script or been changed by another person. It could have used the kind of circumcision that could have led to much needed ambiguity. Nevertheless, there are strange verbal punctuations that surprisingly influence the viewer - "Why does not God kill me?" And: "In the eyes, Lee, bring her in the eye!" Depths of fear in a few crazy words. And surprisingly much bitterness, expressed by wounded veterans in a war movie of 1945. <br /> <br /> Notes that may or may not seem like a contemporary viewer, but the dated natives, of whom it is hard to believe, that many of today's children could believe he was ever spoken - "private," "dope," "dripping," "gee," "you stupid kitty," "lady," "a puffy guy," and "pity yourself. " Let us look at the historical context and be friendly in our judgments. At that time some of this silly language was up to date. <br /> <br /> Real weaknesses? The wounded veterans come together and argue with each other about how much of a collective future they have, and the argument is resolved with one conclusion as follows: "Just because you have a silver platter in your head does not mean people do that you'll think you're a bad person. "There are sometimes voice-over and quiet prayers that are both unnecessary and downright unimaginative. "Please, God, let him come back to me" and such. <br /> <br /> Well, the filmmakers worked within their time. Maybe that's why the final crossfade takes place in the background on a setting in the Independence Hall and the inspiring sounds of America the Beautiful. <br /> <br /> None of this can undo the virtues of the film, which are considerable, especially the effects of this terrible fighting scene. It is not that often on TV. If you have a chance, you definitely catch it.
