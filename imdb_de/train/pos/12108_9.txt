Yakitate! Ja-pan (translated as Fresh Baked! Japanese Bread) is the story of a young man named Azuma Kazuma and his journey to make the perfect Japanese bread or yes-pan for Japan and for the Japanese whole world. <br /> <br /> This is of course only from the outside. In reality Yakitate! Ja-pan's not really about the bread, but the reaction that occurs after eating the bread and the pun that accompanies the reaction. The series is adorable because of these puns. From popular anime titles like Naruto, Detective Conan and Dragon Ball to blockbuster movies like The Matrix and Lord of the Rings. Everything is here. <br /> <br /> What makes this title different from other titles in the same genre as Cooking Master Boy or Mr. Ajikko? Well, unlike the others who use cooking for world domination, Yakitate! Ja-pan is pure comedy. Sure, there are times when the story turns into drama or even murder, but the comedic atmosphere makes you laugh at them. They will laugh at their own view of the sky. Just look at this. <br /> <br /> Remember that this is a fiction too, even though some of the breads made here are based on real bread. Turn your body into gum.
