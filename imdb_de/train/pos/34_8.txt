What a funny movie! If you're a Giallo fan, Red Queen Kills 7 Times is a real winner. At first it is difficult to make a mistake with Barbara Bouchet and Marina Malfatti in the same Giallo. Both are wonderful - especially the big-eyed innocent Bouchet as a guilty woman who fears for her life. The kill scenes in Red Queen Kills 7 Times are especially beautiful and have enough blood to make most fans happy. One of the first killings is quite unexpected and makes the movie really good. The killer, the red queen, is one of the most cocky and interesting killers I've seen in an Italian movie. The 70s sets and fashion are wonderful. In fact, all the visuals are interesting because the laughing Red Queen walks across the bridge at night and is one of my favorite moments in the movie. The intricate conspiracy held my interest consistently. Finally, Bruno Nicolai's score could be the best I've heard from the composer. The main theme is so memorable that for two days I could not get it out of my head. <br /> <br /> The only two issues I have with Red Queen Kills 7 Times are in the final of the film. First, the person responsible for the murders is far too easy to spot. If you have seen more than a pair of Gialli, you have no problem determining who is behind the killings. Second, the end feels a bit too hectic and therefore a bit confusing. I'm definitely not someone who needs every plot point I've been told, but I admit I do not understand how to explain everything. A second consideration could only clarify this.
