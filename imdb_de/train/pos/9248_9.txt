Hold Your Man finds Jean Harlow, a working-class girl from Brooklyn, who is interested in Clark Gable and faces all sorts of difficulties. The movie begins as his movie, but when it's over, the focus definitely changes to her character. <br /> <br /> The movie begins with Gable pulling off a street con game with partner, Garry Owen and the brand The Policemen. When he's chasing Gable ducks in Harlow's apartment and he's such a charming guy, she shields him. <br /> <br /> Soon she is busy with him and unfortunately with his thugs. Gable, Harlow and Owen are trying to play a drunken Paul Hurst with a roof game, but Gable will not stand it. When Hurst realizes that it was a scam, of course he is still sore and becomes belligerent, and Gable has to beat him. But then he ends up in front of Harlow's apartment and this platinum blonde hair makes her easy to spot. She goes to an accomplice of manslaughter. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie is hers and her adaptation to prison life. Her interaction with the other female prisoners gives her some very good scenes. I think part of the material was later used for the MGM classic Caged. <br /> <br /> Harlow can also do the theme song and it's made as a torch-style ballad that was very popular back then. She talks / sings it in the style of Sophie Tucker and pretty well. <br /> <br /> Gable is well-to-do, like the cheater who develops a conscience, a role he would often play, especially in my favorite gable film Honky Tonk. <br /> <br /> Still Harlow, who can shine in this movie. I think it's one of the best she has made at MGM. Your fans should not miss it.
