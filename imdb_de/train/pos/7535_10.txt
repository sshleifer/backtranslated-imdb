The 700 Club offers a great perspective on events in the world. Some have described it as insincere or cheesy. I think the program is informative and inspiring. It is only natural for many to spray mud with a program that has proven so successful. There are few shows that have a 40-year track record in the world of television media, and The 700 Club is one of them. While Mr. Robertson may have been wrong to say that someone should be murdered, I find it curious that so many people literally stumble upon themselves to get on the train of criticism. I've certainly said some stupid things in my life. I would certainly be willing to forgive Mr Robertson for showing a great show.
