I have seen this movie about 6 times now. And every time I see it, I am more impressed with the story and the spectacle. It's like watching the wreckage of a train. His approach is subtle but very effective in achieving his goal. <br /> <br /> Spoiler-> At the heart of the story is a very nice dichotomy. On the one hand, we have the deputy major, Eddy Calhoun (Cusack), who unknowingly tears at the old boys' network that is the heart of the New York City's major, and on the other hand, we have mob boss Zappati who purposely tries to uphold the status quo by all means necessary. This situation culminates in the end when Zappati orders Alselmo to make it easy by killing himself, and Calhoun orders Pappas to do the same thing politically. <br /> <br /> The film also contains some really good one-liners For example (a personal weakness of mine): - You do not summarize a man's life in a moment - The only thing new in this world is the story you do not know. All in all, a great movie that deserves a much higher rating.
