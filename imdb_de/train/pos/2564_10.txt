I personally believe that Sayonara was the greatest movie he has ever made. It touched every feeling of anger, romance and even complete tragedy. And Brando should have won for the best actor. Anyway, the movie is awesome, the man is attractive to BOTH MEN AND WOMEN and now you have no reason not to see him! Do it and fall in love.
