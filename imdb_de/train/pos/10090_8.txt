I was prepared for a nasty soap opera with a travelogue, but I was pleased with a quick script, an underlying moral, excellent portrayals of all actors, especially Peter Finch, amazing special effects, suspense and beautiful cinematography. Even a shot of the majestic Steinbuddhas recently released by the Taliban were destroyed. Not to mention Elizabeth Taylor of her lovely and likeable side, before yielding to the airy hysterics who interfered with her later work. All supportive players round it off and I wonder who trained all these elephants. <br /> <br /> Talking about the Stone Buddha sequence, you can really tell that Vivien Leigh is in the long shots. Her form and the way she moves differs from Taylor. The only thing that interferes with this sequence are the poorly performed process shots, in which the background for horses moves too fast during a walk. <br /> <br /> If you want a thought-provoking film that is beautiful to look at and never to see boring, spend a few hours on Elephant Walk.
