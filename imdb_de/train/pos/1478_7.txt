I liked this movie, though I could say in the middle of the movie who the secret admirer was. I also wonder if he was based on a true story as he told of the "real" people at the end of the movie. I think I have to research it and let it know. <br /> <br /> Does anyone remember what happened? I think they moved to North Carolina, if I'm not mistaken. Of course, states could have been changed to protect the innocent. <br /> <br /> You might think that this man could have figured it out as easily as I did. Was he stupid or something?
