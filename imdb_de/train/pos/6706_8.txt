I remember this show because it became a regular visit on a Saturday night. <br /> <br /> Sabrina is a young girl who moves in with her aunts, who turn out to be witches and she is one. So Sabrina has to learn how to control and use her powers effectively. She also has to deal with a bad rival named Libby, her ditsy best friend and friend Harvey Kinkle ... <br /> <br /> The show was fun and entertaining. It entertained Saturday evenings for a 10-year-old boy ... making him laugh ... and flirting with 'Libby' ...
