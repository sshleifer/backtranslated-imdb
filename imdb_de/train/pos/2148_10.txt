I'm always looking forward to this movie when it's on TV. I have to have the DVD, I think. The range of different types of people is great. It tells me that everyone can be a dancer if he tries hard enough. My favorite character must be Mr.Aoki. He is so quirky, but full of emotions. It's a perfect movie with wonderful dances. Unfortunately we never have the chance to drive her to Blackpool. Would care for the perfect sequel if they had. But I think it leaves it to your imagination what might have happened. <br /> <br /> A very simple and innocent story. He remains true to his wife and daughter. <br /> <br /> I have not seen the Hollywood remake. Not sure if I want. I do not really like Jennifer Lopez. I think Richard Gere suits the original better than Lopez. I feel that the remake is not so easy and innocent.
