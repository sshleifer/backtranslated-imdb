Pegg has had some hits in the last few years, starting with "Shaun Of The Dead" in 2004, the movie "Hot Fuzz 2007", in the beginning of 2008 he came out with "Run Fat Boy Run" and now comes this. "How To Lose Friends And Alienate People" is in many ways one of my favorite comedies of the year. The film is about Sidney Yound, a man who writes a failing journal that makes fun of celebrities mainly because he is not one of them. Anyway, one of the most successful owners of the magazine (Out of Nostalgia) invites him to work in his magazine. Sidney, of course, is excited and moves to America, where he meets a girl who is writing a book and follows joy. <br /> <br /> This movie is great and I hope that more of it will come out in the near future. Pegg has given people a good movie again everywhere and I can not wait to see the third part of the blood and ice cream trilogy "Paul". I rate this movie at 81%.
