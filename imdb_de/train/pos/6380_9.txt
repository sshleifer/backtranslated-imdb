Atlantis: The Lost Empire is a better movie than I thought. I never thought that this movie would lead to my expectations. The movie started off slowly, but as the movie evolved, it was more appealing to me. The story takes place in 1914 and is about a man named Milo. Milo believes in the legendary Atlantis. Together with his grandfather's friends, he undertakes a great adventure. Along the way he has to endure friendship, betrayal, trust and more. The voice is great. You certainly know how to wear movies only with your singing talent. The music is nothing special, but nevertheless sympathetic. The animation is not the best, but still good enough. Overall, this is a good family movie for all ages. I rate this movie at 9/10.
