When the US entered World War I, the government forced Hollywood to produce propaganda films. THE LITTLE American is probably the best because Mary Pickford are stars. Pickford plays a young woman who is torn between two men: Jack Holt (German) and Raymond Hatton (French), but their decision lies Because of the war, both men are delayed. <br /> <br /> When the ship on which Pickford sails is sunk by the Germans (think of Lusitania) because it carries ammunition, Pickford has a great scene while she stands on the fortress lifeboat and screams German commander. Later, of course, she meets Holt and Hatton when she is being held in a castle as a prisoner of war. Cecil B. DeMille, director Cecil B. DeMille, offers a really great scene in this movie as Pickford and Holt wanders through a bombed out village. You pass a ruined church, of which there is only one wall left. On the wall is a very large crucifix. As they stand and watch, the wall collapses, but the Jesus figure remains in the air. It is a very surreal moment in a movie that is otherwise very uncomplicated and inartistic. Pickford is, as always, a pleasure to look at. She was always a very natural actress who avoided the many other actors of that time with the arm-waving histrionics. She is also very pretty. Holt is very good in a leadership role here. Hatton is fine. Among the list of actor names in "additional" parts are Wallace Beery, Ramon Novarro, Colleen Moore, Ben Alexander, Hobart Bosworth, Norman Kerry, Walter Long, James Neill and Edythe Chapman. <br /> <br /> Not a great movie, but interesting to watch US propaganda at work.
