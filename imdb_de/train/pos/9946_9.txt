Dream Quest was a surprisingly good movie. There were some eye-catching antics, but you can expect that in a movie that was shot in such a short time. I did not feel any urge for a fast-forward during the movie and found it quite entertaining. It gets silly sometimes, but overall I recommend it. They probably used up all the glitz in the nearby stores and some of the costume designs were pretty good.
