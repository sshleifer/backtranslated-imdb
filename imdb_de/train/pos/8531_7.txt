Although the conspiracy was sometimes juicy and ended up being very nervous, as if the director had used up all of his available time and had to hurry to finish the story, the Made-for-Backwoods were pretty good overall - cable TV genre. <br /> <br /> However, the actress who played the babysitter Mariana Klaveno was very good! I hope to see more of her in Filmland. The music was also well done to calm down the restful music-based build-up of dah-DUH-dah-DUH (think of "JAWS"). <br /> <br /> I do not think I want to see "While the Children Sleep" again, but if I did I would focus on the talent of the talented Klaveno.
