Surprisingly good. Acting was fun, the script was fun, the music was fun, the action was so much fun. This was a fun movie to watch and give your brain some rest. Parts of the plot and quotes I found very creative. Actually, it would have earned 10 out of 10. You should not compare this to an arthouse movie or a bloody slasher movie.
