Once I looked at The Tenant and interpreted it as a horror movie. It uses many of the tropics of the genre: the sinister dwelling, suspicious neighbors, apparitions, mysteries, hallucinations. The life of the hero, Trelkovsky, seemed to be surrounded by evil, secret forces trying to drive him mad. Last time I saw it, I challenged that original interpretation. If this movie is a horror movie, it's just horror in the sense that a Kafka novel is horror. In fact, this movie can literally be understood as a lonely man who is slowly going crazy without any outside influence. Polanski has made in his career three films dealing with madness: rejection, which I do not particularly like as the development of insanity in the heroine has never convinced me; Rosemary's Baby, in which the heroine is driven by evil forces; and The Tenant, which is perhaps the best study of paranoia ever made in the cinema. Trelkovsky is a young man who rents an apartment in which a woman has killed herself. He is obsessed with her and slowly becomes her: he wears her clothes, decorates herself, speaks like her. But is he obsessed with a ghost, or does he just let his wild imagination get the best of him? It is this hesitation between what is real and imaginary and what Polanski never solves that makes this film so fascinating. Many events in the film can be attributed to the supernatural as easily as normal causes may be, and it is up to the viewer to decide what to believe. <br /> <br /> Although this is not my favorite movie in Polanski It is a good example of his ability to create excitement and portray the madness in convincing words. And technically, it's also a miracle. Suffice it to say that he collaborates with film composer Philippe Sarde and legendary cinematographer Sven Nykvist (Bergmans DP) to create this film. A slow pace and sometimes uninteresting segments may make the movie hard to enjoy but still an experience.
