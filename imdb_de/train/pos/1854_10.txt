After taking a critical look at the movie and the love of good cinema, I walked to Antwone Fisher with a symbolically held breath. While I'm an unwavering fan of Denzel Washington - both his abilities as an actor and his public personality; I'm an honest fan to admit the (very few) times when he did not hit the mark in the one or two movies. And I could be wrong - after all, I'm not an actor. But that was different - Denzel would put the experience of his career in a film that dealt with one of mankind's most sensitive issues - the abuse of a child. As his directorial debut no less. And develop the film to successfully portray the success of a man. I did not want to be disappointed. <br /> <br /> And I was not there. <br /> <br /> What I've seen is a movie full of promise that connects a wide audience and the inexperienced gave viewers a brief but truthful look into the life of a young man whose childhood was a living hell, but who despite everything triumphed. This movie has done it - and a dry eye of every color in the theater has proved it. It takes someone who knows the themes in this movie to know when the truth is being presented. A talented filmmaker must tell the story convincingly if you have not experienced it yet. And if he can attract an audience and cause the audience to react emotionally without pity, the filmmaker has done his job. In any movie. Black, white, purple or dotted. That makes good cinema. Bravo, Denzel Washington, Derek Luke, Joy Bryant and above all Antwone Fisher - you've actually won.
