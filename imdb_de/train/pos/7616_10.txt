Here is an innovative television drama; which easily mixes a compelling story, brilliant character development, humor, romance and drama into each episode. Here's a show that sings on its own tune, whether the audience wants to follow it or not. How many other shows on TV are changing so boldly from one season to the next? Where most of the other top shows on this site have found a formula that works, that brings in the spectators and the money and sticks to the formula (Prison Break, 24 and Desperate Housewives) - LOST takes a different route, where, even after reaching this plateau and the formula for success, the team of executive producers is brave enough to completely reinvent the show to achieve its ultimate goal of convincing storytelling. Here LOST differs from the normal television. So defiant to conventional television. That is why LOST is one of the most modern and innovative creations of modern television. Forget the naysayers - LOST, was and will always be there to leave the cult behind and the public next. But it is a testament to his ingenuity that it has a fan base made up of the best of both audiences.
