UC 0079, the one-year war is almost over. A neutral colony of Side 6 was targeted by Cyclops, a Zeon taskforce. Their target is a new Gundam built exclusively for Newtypes (supposedly for Amuro Ray from the original Gundam saga). When the little boy Al Izuruha, a fan of Zeon MS, encounters a Zaku after the fight breaks out in the colony, he befriends the new MS pilot Benard "Bernie" Wiseman. The two become good friends, Al is treated as an honorary member of the Cyclops team. Over the course of the show, Bernie appears as the father of Al (whose real father always works) and appears to be associated with Federation pilot Christina McKenzie, but eventually they have to meet ... in the fight. Soon, Al learns that war is not child's play, and Bernie has to make the ultimate sacrifice to fulfill his mission. <br /> <br /> For just 6 episodes, Gundam 0080 is a well-made show. The mobile suits are very well designed and the animation looks outdated, but really shows emotions in the characters. If you liked 0083 then check this out or if you're new to the Gundam world, this is a good show to start with. If you're looking at a show for the development of dramas and characters, this is for you. It focuses more on the fight with the mobile suit. I would call it drama rather than action. <br /> <br /> Mobile Suit Gundam 0080, Was in the Pocket. <br /> <br /> Sometimes you have to lose to win.
