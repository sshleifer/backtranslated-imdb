Since her bad divorce from the Disney Company (where Disney retains the Miramax brand), the Weinstein Company seems to specialize in above-average films that are then under-represented and seen by a few. THE FLOCK is a prime example. <br /> <br /> A story about officials who have the evil task of keeping track of registered sex offenders. In this picture you will learn more about sex offenders than about a whole series of Law and Order - CSR. <br /> <br /> Richard Gere gives his best performance so far as a soft-spoken agent who is exhausted from the task. Claire Danes once has the opportunity to take a solid role (instead of the garbage she usually gets stuck with) and she makes the most of the beginner. The cinematography, the tempo, the editing, everything is top notch - and I could not see any trace of attention deficit disorder camera jump-around or excessive camera cuts that others complained about. The subject is treated with restraint, but it is still a difficult topic and could make you sick. <br /> <br /> Fifty years ago, there were almost no problems with the sex offenses shown here, which are shown to be dull. Then came the decisions of the Supreme Court, which at the same time tied the hands of the police, when the "rights" of sex offenders were opened and America was turned into a paradise for buyers, willing and unwilling. Each of these steps was praised by the Liberals, who celebrated the misdeeds of Warren Court with glossy covers on Time and Newsweek. The liberals of everyday life also praised the lawsuit of the court and mocked those who disagree. Like many Americans, in 2007 they know that the kind of pornography that is the brutal violence and torture of young women can be subscribed to, and that the provision of it is subsidized by US Post's fee rates. Only part of the problem - a problem that can ruin everyone's family. Richard Gere is a Liberal, but he does his best in his performance here. Maybe he got some wisdom at his age.
