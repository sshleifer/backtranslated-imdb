<br /> <br /> I have problems with the other reviewer's comments for the simple reason that this is a SECRET FILM, not a supernatural movie! It is not the only movie that has a seemingly "supernatural" explanation ("vampires"), but proves to be very lush. <br /> <br /> Other films that come to my mind are Edgar Wallace's "Before Dawn" and the (more famous) "Sign of the Vampire". <br /> <br /> The film creates a WONDERFUL Work by creating a very "spooky atmosphere", much like DRACULA, when Renfield meets the Count on the stairs of his castle or in MARK OF THE VAMPIRE, when the two people look through the windows of the ruined castle, they see a "corpse", the organ plays while Luna descends with wings VERY surreal! <br /> <br /> If you like these (often silent) atmospheric touches, THIS movie is a must! <br /> <br /> Norm Bird
