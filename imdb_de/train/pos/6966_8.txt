Overall, I was quite impressed by the pilot. The first fifteen minutes were worrisome, as they felt the creators were trying to create a sci-fi version of The OC. However, this fear is corrected when a terrorist incident occurs, and the show enters topics and situations that I rarely see tv tackle. <br /> <br /> The BSG dealt with topics such as monotheism, existentialism, reality, death and terrorism, but they were primarily subtext that the viewer could look at or ignore if he so desired. On the other hand, these topics are the focus of the show, and I personally remember mentioning works such as Ghost In The Shell and The Matrix as points of reference while watching and amazed at how well the topics were discussed. I think if you're a fan of the two aforementioned or other movies / TV shows that deal with the topics I'm referring to, I think you'll find something here as a starting point to explain how the Situation that we know in BSG, I believe that they have dealt with it very interesting. I particularly liked how they explained where the Cylon's belief in a god came from and the creation of Caprica was just enough advanced and contemporary technology thrown into the future, but not completely alien to us as a spectator. <br /> <br /> The only real flaws I noticed were the relationship between the parents of Greystone and the actress playing "Lacy Rand". , Although I like Eric Stoltz and Paula Malcomson individually, their scenes apparently lacked chemistry. At this point, it could simply be the development of their characters, but in my opinion, this is a bit of work. Magda Apanowicz was also unconvincing in her role. This, in turn, may be due to the experience and time required for development, but throughout the episode its acting was forced and not completely sovereign. <br /> <br /> Because of the pilot, I'm really looking forward to seeing where 'Caprica' is heading for the future and hopefully it will touch the size that BSG once did.
