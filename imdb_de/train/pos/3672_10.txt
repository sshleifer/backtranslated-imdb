A mock documentary about a pair of Canadian producers, Bobby Myers (Matthew Modine) and Paul Linder (Saul Rubinek), who wanted to make their first film in the late 1970s. Hollywood North is the comic story of their struggle to pull everything together despite contradictory threads. Hollywood North works as a film in a manner very similar to the example of This Is Spinal Tap (1984). Although in some ways exaggerated, it is very close to the truth, and the truth is facts that are "behind the scenes" and different from the public face of the industry. It's not easy to shoot a movie, and it must have been particularly difficult in Canada in the late 70's. Films include dozens, if not hundreds, of people. Many have incompatible desires, motivations and personalities. Particularly important are the financiers and the talents on screen, because if the film fails or becomes unreliable during production at any point in time, it could jeopardize the whole affair, requiring either a full replacement or a complete cessation of the movie. > <br /> So it's not surprising that Hollywood North focuses on this kind of relationship. The result is an excellent movie that is both funny and tragic. The script is impeccable and the performances are top notch. This is a must for any aspiring filmmaker and anyone who has a serious interest in the craft. It should also be more than entertaining for every viewer who has a little intelligence and a sense of humor. <br /> <br /> A 10 out of 10 points from me.
