This movie is so cheesy. <br /> <br /> A group of people trapped in an abandoned school. They are killed, they know they are being persecuted. What will they do then? One girl decides to take a bath, another decides to trick his husband (who is also there) with an old friend so that they somehow find a bed (in an old, abandoned school?) And go after that. <br /> <br /> And it comes through with the Gore and the T & A. <br /> <br /> And it's also interesting from a historical / sociological point of view. Where the usual 80s Slasher is a reflection of how we see ourselves or how young people see young people or how Hollywood views the rest of the country, this has a unique perspective. This is a British movie made to be an American Slasher. It's funny to see how many times the British actors who accidentally want to speak "American" fall back into their British accent. <br /> <br /> If you like cheesy 80's Slashers (like Pieces) you will like them here.
