I really liked this movie! When I first saw the poster, I thought it was just another light romantic comedy ... but it's just more than that! I personally think that this idea (of which I am sure a good portion of the audience just before watching the movie) is another important part of the big concept of the movie itself (or even its marketing strategy)! What I mean is that today we are slaves of pictures! To the impressions! I went to the movies to see this film with the wrong impression and the wrong expectations. In the end, I felt how superficial I could be! I remember the sequence near the end where Sidney buys the plane ticket for the return trip to New York and because he is asked to sign an autograph, ie signing the ticket, he believes only because of the scandal at the awards in the Having arrived on television, he is now a kind of celebrity. And that, I think, is the culmination of this main theme that the films revolve around. In addition, I believe that the film also offers us a solution to cope with, illustrated by Sidney's attitude throughout the film: Do not be too serious with yourself or with anyone else ... "Even saints were people in the beginning" ... as Sophie once said in the film. The saints of the moment are the stars. We attribute to them an 'aura' of perfection, of eternal happiness, but the reality is much less. Even the saints of a religion are images, ideal models, how to behave and how to live one's life. Even they were not real ... they became 'real' after they died and we looked at them. And that's the catch: we need our saints! We need our stars! We aspire to them as if we have nothing to look for. Television and all other media are means to create and capture our efforts. We urgently need benchmarks to measure ourselves against. And so we came to the cinema to watch this movie in the first place: to see if we fit the benchmark or if the benchmark is too small for us. This time it was bigger than we expected.
