It sang. It has drama. It has a comedy. It has a story. It's one of the greatest movies ever made. If you can not enjoy this movie, you must either sleep or be in some kind of mental disorder. In "Yankee Doodle Dandy", James Cagney sings and dances to an Oscar. but in this movie he is BETTER! This is James Cagney in his best BEST! He is fast with the singles! He is fast with his feet! It is an uninterrupted action. And the song and dance skits are classics, especially "Shanghai Lil". And the side occupation is great. The entire film is optimistic, fast and radiates self-confidence. And although this movie was filmed over 70 years ago, it is still there today. And of course this movie features Miss Ruby Keeler (who was married to Al Jolson). She is the perfect partner for James Cagney ... and also for Dick Powell! If you like fast, fast movies with a lot of singing and dancing, this is the movie you can watch.
