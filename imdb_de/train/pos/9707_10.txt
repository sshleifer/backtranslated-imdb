About a year ago, I eventually quit American television. I thought of giving up the television completely, until a friend who had lived in England showed me programs that included The Office, Extras, Blackadder, and The League of Gentlemen. Then I decided on British television. Of all the shows listed above, The League of Gentlemen is by far the darkest and most twisted of all, yielding guilty laughter and material that can not be found in any other comedy I've ever seen. The characters are the unlucky married couple, a butcher who puts ingredients in the meat that are unsaid (probably for the best), a confused couple who looks over a local shop that appeals only to locals, and the worst vet, that ever was. This program is one of the best I have ever seen.
