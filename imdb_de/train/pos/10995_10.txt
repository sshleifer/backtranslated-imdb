I saw this movie in the theater when it first came out a few years ago and it was a great hit. But I wanted to see it again this year to see if it's still good compared to movies that are released now, and I have to say it's one of the best movies I've ever seen in my life !! !!!!!!! !!!! <br /> <br /> What you need to know is that you do not have to miss a minute of this movie. If you do not follow the action completely, you will be lost and unable to understand the end. <br /> <br /> The end makes the movie so good that you can not wait for it. <br /> <br /> Congratulations to the producer!
