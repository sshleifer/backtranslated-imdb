Dahl seems to be under the influence of Wender's The American Friend. Innocent Nick Cage is recruited for a hit. Dennis Hopper plays a real hit man. Lara Flynn Boyle is dangerous. The hero gets involved the more he tries to save himself. And the small town of America does not seem as safe as the big city. As his predecessor mentions, this film has many plot changes and twists that seem unlikely but all lead to cathartic self-discovery.
