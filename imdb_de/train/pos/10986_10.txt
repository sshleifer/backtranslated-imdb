We came across the documentary Gray Gardens last Sunday and were "sucked in" without warning. Everyone who entered the room was spotted on television and Edith and Edie's haunting pictures, seemingly spending their lives in a room in a large, dirty beachside villa, ice cream and corn on the cob (which was cooked on the bedside table) - and the cat that urinates on Edith's bed, and her incredible words, "I thrive on it [the smell]." We had not seen the beginning and wondered what we were watching and how these aristocratic women managed to get into the position they were in. Fascinating! something you must have seen !!!!
