**** Contains Spoiler **** <br /> <br /> I've been a horror movie fan for many decades. Just when I think I have seen all the big ones, another window appears to surprise me. I had never seen this movie before. It was a treat, even off the beaten path ... not just the way to the marsh ferry. Here was a horror movie from the 1940s that dared to try something different. The pretty girl is fearless for a change (sip) and saves the men, including the man she loves, from the monster! How is that for a turn. This girl was the complete opposite of most women in movies of that time, no screaming for her own shadow, no fainting from fright, no tripping over a leaf as she ran. This girl was not afraid to live alone in a remote cabin, far from the rest of the villagers. Not only that, but the place was in a misty swamp that was allegedly persecuted. Heck even takes her out on the marsh grass for a nap ... like a normal Ripley version of the 1940s. No snake, gator, or ghosts would dare to disturb this girl. Books about early feminist films should definitely include this overlooked work. <br /> <br /> If you, like me, are a fan of these wonderfully atmospheric classic SW horror movies shot only in the 30s and in the US 40s Wear your cast-iron turtle neck for protection.
