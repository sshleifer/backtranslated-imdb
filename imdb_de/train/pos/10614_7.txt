Three girls (a purely female media crew, including cult actress Barbara Bach, no less), who visit a small town to discuss a festival, eventually rent rooms in a house to avoid them like the plague. Well done little shocker that suffers a bit from superfluous dialogue scenes and a rather thin plot line (the secrets are not hidden so well). In particular, a subordinate theme is quite disturbing (as in: vintage shock material), and of that the movie lives. Performances & Cinematography are way above average (compared to many other films of the late 70's / early 80's), but what really makes me recommend this film is the rather long climax scene in the basement. From the moment the "Keller Junior" character was introduced, his performance opened my jaw and it did not close until the end of the movie. A very pleasant surprise when actor Sydney Lassick (who had gone completely crazy in "One flew over the cuckoo's nest" and now in "The Unseen") took on one of the leading roles.
