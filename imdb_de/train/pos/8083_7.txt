When you've read the books, forget about the figures Tolkien has built into your head. The representation of hobbits, dwarfs, etc. was treated "disney". The dark drivers are excellent and as I have always imagined in the books. <br /> <br /> Cinematically, this is a great movie that combines live motion and animation to create amazing effects for the year. I just wish he (Bakshi) had gotten the money to complete his epic. <br /> <br /> It's worth having the video as it will be worth a bit after the Lord of the Rings 2001 !!
