I saw this movie last night in a special cinema in Nuremberg, and it was great. I must admit that the original music composition of the cellist and percussion / xylophone player influenced the mood of the film, but the film itself also had power in its depiction of the tragic Nibelungen saga. <br /> <br /> If you are interested in silent films or the Nibelungenlied, I highly recommend this film. The costumes were fantastic and creative, the sets were opulent and exotic and the acting was dramatic and breathtaking (as is typical of silent movies "tragedies"). Unfortunately, I have not seen the first part of this film duo concerning Siegfried. The story of this second film begins after Siegfried's death, when Kremhild (Gudrun in the Nordic versions of the story) plans her revenge on her brothers. <br /> <br /> I also saw this movie in German; I am a native English speaker and have basic knowledge of German. It was difficult that? Subtitles (what do you call that in silent films?) First because of the old German writing to read. I advise you, if you look at it in German, you should make sure that you can distinguish your "K". , "f" and "s" in the old script. :)
