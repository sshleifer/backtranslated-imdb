"The Invisible Ray" is part of science fiction and part horror. It was also the third of seven Karloff / Lugosi functions. In this post, the dominant role is transferred to Boris Karloff. <br /> <br /> Dr. Janos Rukh (Karloff) demonstrates his colleague Felix Benet (Bela Lugosi), Sir Frances Stevens (Walter Kingsford), with specially designed astronomical devices), his wife Lady Stevens (Beulah Bondi) and her nephew Ronald Drake (Frank Lawton), that a meteorite with a mighty element in front of many millions Landed on the African continent for years. Rukh impresses his guests, who invite him to join them on an expedition to Africa to find the mysterious element. Rukh goes off alone and discovers the place where the meteorite landed and the element he names. "Radium X". Due to Rukh's long absence, his pretty young wife Diana (Frances Drake) attracts Drake and the two fall in love. Meanwhile, Rukh gets so contaminated by Radium X that anyone he touches dies instantly. The contamination causes his skin to glow brightly in the dark. <br/> <br /> Rukh goes to Benet for help. Benet develops an antidote that provides temporary immunity to the element when taken daily. Unfortunately, the deadly element also affects Rukh's brain, slowly turning him into a vengeful killer. <br /> <br /> While Rukh continues his work, Sir Frances brings the news of the discovery back to France. Diana and Ronald accompany him. When Benet informs him of this action, Rukh accuses the party of betraying him and his discovery and secretly plans his revenge. When he returns to France, he learns about the healing power of Radium X while healing his mother's blindness (Violet Kemble Cooper) and about Benet's work in curing his patients' diseases. <br/> <br/> But Rukh's madness is getting more intense. First, he murders an innocent man identified as Rukh. When Diana and Ronald hear of Rukh's apparent demise, they marry. This annoys Rukh and he begins to take revenge on the five other members of the expedition. One evening, Benet lures him into a trap and ........... Karloff is superb in the lead role, from a happily married, ambitious scientist to a raging maniac. For once, Lugosi has a direct role and does what he can with the limited role. <br /> <br /> At 79 minutes this movie was the second longest of the six Karloff / Lugosi collaborations. Karloff's movie all the way.
