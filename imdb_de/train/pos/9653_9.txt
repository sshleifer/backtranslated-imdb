The first love is a desperately difficult topic that can be persuaded convincingly in the cinema: the all-encompassing passion is generally a pale imitation or, worse, a little ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Lifshitz manages to avoid all pitfalls delivering a moving, sexy, penetrating story of love, disaster and possible salvation as he touches on some of the deeper issues of human existence. <br /> <br /> The core story is by Mathieu, 18, a loner. introverted boy who meets Cédric, braver, more open-minded, but also lonely while on vacation with his family. When the summer gets warmer, they fall in love and decide to live together when the holidays come to an end. A year later, the relationship ends in disaster: Cédric cheats Mathieu, who desperately tries to take his own life. He survives and returns to the coastal city where they met for the first time to regain a new sense of life, this time chilled in the winter. <br /> <br /> If the story were told that way, it would be like this. They never have the effect that causes it: much of it is implied, everything does not happen sequentially. <br /> <br /> The complicated narrative is essential to a deeper sense of experiencing passions through the use of counterpoint and temporal perspective. Fortunately, the three time series used (summer of love, post-suicide psychiatry, and winter of rebuilding) are color coded: warm yellows and oranges for the summer, an almost terrifyingly cold blue for the hospital scenes, and warming browns and blues for the winter seaside , <br /> <br /> Both protagonists have performed well and it is a pleasure to see that Stéphane Rideau (Cédric) is taking full advantage of his abilities (I am more used to seeing him down). Jérémie Elkaim (Mathieu ) (stretched out in Gael Morel's rather limp drama) is particularly noteworthy: one feels his loneliness, then his almost incredulous passion, then his character collapses behind a wall of aphasia. Beautifully designed gestures convey far more than the dialogue ever could. <br /> <br /> The themes that are addressed are almost classic in French cinema: our difficulty in really understanding what someone else feels; our difficulty in fully communicating; the moving sands of meaning? The title of the movie "Presque rien" (Almost Nothing) refers to all of these and indeed to one of the film's key scenes: to understand why Mathieu tried to kill himself, a psychiatrist asks Cédric if he would have ever cheated on him?? "Not enfin, oui? Une fois, mais ce n'était rien" (No, well, once, but it was nothing). Cédric still loves Mathieu? he took him to the hospital during the attempted suicide (of which we see nothing) and desperately tries to get back in touch with him as soon as he leaves? But I can not understand that he lost him forever because something that did not seem to him (a meaningless matter) is everything to Mathieu. <br /> <br /> Although the film is darker than the rather unfortunate Pierre et Gilles poster suggests, it is not without hope: you can see Cédric's slow, painful attempts to bring life back into contact, first through one Cat, whom he adopts, then by working in a local bar and finally contact with Pierre, who is possibly his next love. But this is where the story ends: a teenage passion that starts later in the year, another that may be beginning. So what was it? Nearly nothing? Certainly not if you live it?
