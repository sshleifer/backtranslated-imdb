Well, for all cinematographic fans, this movie may not be high on the list of things you can see. But if you know something about the plot's development, the profound truth, and the intentions of this movie (the series), you would understand my pov. <br /> <br /> Granted, the peculiarities of the movie are renderings by the writer, who is not expected to know what will happen in the end. But the film is biblically accurate and rightly scares viewers into what might be. I am a Christian, not because of this film, but because of my personal decision to accept Jesus as my Savior. The film and the potential, which is similar to the circumstances presented there, can make someone think about their actions and decisions. It is not a cheap attempt to scare people into believing in God, but rather a means of gaining your attention. As a Christian, I know that I will not lag behind, and thanks to films like this, I can look beyond the superficialities of entertainment, acting and film budget to appreciate the depth of the film. This is a movie that you should not only see but also feel with heart and soul.
