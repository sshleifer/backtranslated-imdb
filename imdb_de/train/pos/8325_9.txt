I loved the idea for this movie when I saw a trailer for it for the first time. Einstein was always one of my heroes, and the image of him as the friendly, playful, slightly crazy genius was enough to make me see the movie. The addition of Matthau as Einstein made it even better. <br /> <br /> The story is pure fantasy, but a delightful one. A car mechanic falls in love with a beautiful woman who is Einstein's niece. With the help of four fair-haired physicists, Ed sets out to find Katharina's heart. Put a jealous fiancé (who exemplifies the worst experimental psychology) and Eisenhower into the mix and you have pure fun. <br /> <br /> The movie is full of great character actors and wonderful sweet and daffodil appearances. Walter Matthau plays Einstein as a rogue gnome; Cupid with a slide rule. Tim Robbins is beautiful, Ed and Meg Ryan are one step above their normal Rome com level. Stephen Fry is a joy as "RRRatman" and Ryan's fiancé; which lacks a single romantic bone in his body. <br /> <br /> The film fell under most radars, but is a delightful treasure that will not stale on repeated reviews. It is characterized by first-class writing and performances and is a gentle pleasure in a less than gentle world.
