It's not well filmed, well written or well played, but it must be the most addictive show I've seen since Twin Peaks. Every single revelation is so well tuned that you need to see the next episode to get some kind of degree. They've even slowed down the pace of the show, where they're only giving away tiny amounts of information per episode, but it feels like they've told you everything you want to know. However, part of the acting is terrible and part of the duo is downright brutal. Some characters are very two-dimensional. The more experienced actors, such as Locke and Ecko, really stand out for the actors who play Jack, Kate, Sayid and so on. The development of the show can also be very frustrating because the following episode may not show what the previous episode has stated. Annoying subplots have become part of the story, sometimes betraying nothing. The second season, however, has developed to a point where background stories tell more about the island than before. All in all, a great show, but not perfect.
