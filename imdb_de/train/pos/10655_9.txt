It seems to be a perfect day for swimming. A normal family would like to benefit from this and make a trip to the beach. Unfortunately, the father is trapped under a pier and neither his wife nor the baby son can help him as the tide rises. The woman (Barbara Stanwyck) takes the car and seeks help. <br /> <br /> John Sturges' short film (69 minutes) is powerful because of unanswered questions. Stanwyck finds a man who could help, but there's a price she has to pay for it. There is a double question that the movie poses. How far would you go to help the man you love and, on the other hand, if you observe Stanwyck's behavior towards the stranger, does she really love her husband? Like a good short story, this film leaves the viewer with questions he can only answer himself.
