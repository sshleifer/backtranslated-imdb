That's how I feel about the show. <br /> <br /> I started watching the show in 2001 in repeats. <br /> <br /> I like the show, but she had too many mistakes. <br /> <br /> I hate the MICHELLE & JOEY CHARACTERS! <br /> <br /> The story series stolen from old TV shows. They even stole from "The Partirdge Family". One episode mentioned "The Partridge Family". Actors playing different roles in different episodes. MTV Martha Quinn was most notable for this, especially when she played herself in an episode. <br /> <br /> The Michelle character CAN NOT joke, but then they had to "avenge" this little kid at her sisters' wits on them. <br /> <br /> Story lines that came and went in a row. Joey got the TV show with Frankie & Annette, then never heard of it again. Danny suddenly played guitar. 1 episode he trains football, 1 episode he trains softball / baseball. 1 game & you're out huh Danny? <br /> <br /> Jesse & Joey always get orders that are REALLY FAST without any experience. Only in a television program. <br /> <br /> I liked the D.J. & Stephanie characters. I wish Jodie Sweetin could have known about Candace Cameron Bure and had a pure adult life without drugs.
