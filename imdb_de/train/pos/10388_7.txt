I'm a big fan of the Dukes of Hazzard TV Show. And I really enjoyed this strip. I enjoyed myself here much more than with other summer blockbusters. <br /> <br /> It's weird when people start off against this movie with apologies like "lame plot" and "it's a lot coarser than the show". Does anyone remember the cruelty of humor in the pilot episode? Daisy makes incest jokes, and Bo says that Luke had probably conceived half the children in the orphanage. The only reason it has been cleaned up is that it has been changed to an earlier time slot. <br /> <br /> And as far as the plot is concerned. It was the perfect Dukes plot. As a remake, it's likely to be the source material rather than any television program that has wandered onto the big screen. <br /> <br /> While Sean William Scott and Johnny Knoxville are not as accurate as their small screen versions, they do a great job and work very well together. I was not particularly interested in Burt's Boss Hogg though. And I would like to have some more incompetence from Sheriff Roscoe. In the movie, Roscoe is a little ... scary. <br /> <br /> And who did not have a smile on his face as General Lee races through the streets of Atlanta and the side streets of Hazzard? <People, treat yourself to a movie that's just an excuse for nostalgia, bikinis, and car chases. You will not regret it. It's just a great stupid movie!
