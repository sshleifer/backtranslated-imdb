I became a fan of the TV series "Homicide: Life on the Street," which ran late in the series, but quickly became a fan. It was a cop show that was different from any other: visually different Using handheld cameras that take the viewer everywhere with its multi-ethnic and mutiracial cast and its various and fascinating personalities, and that it covers all the good and the bad of one's police, including corruption and personality conflicts that bubble to the surface. <br /> <br /> Homicide: The Movie, the series' reunion follow-up, is as good as a TV movie can be made. After Lt. Giardello (Yaphet Kotto), now a candidate for the mayor of Baltimore, is shot dead, the cast members of the series are back to find the killer. In addition, cast members who have left the troupe and those who have died make it into the movie. The intensity and the fire that marked the series return, and the script is characterized by the same fire as the series. All in all, a terrific TV movie. <br /> <br /> Vote Result: 9
