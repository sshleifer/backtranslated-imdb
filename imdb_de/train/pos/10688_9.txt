I did not really know what to expect when I watched the movie, except for the slightly surreal idea that a lonely man ordered a Russian bride over the Internet. That and it had Nicole Kidman in it. I absolutely loved the movie and found out he thought 'wow'. <br /> <br /> Refreshingly down to earth, the movie moves well, with a few surprises on each corner. The relationships in the film are credible, Nicole and Chaplin work wonderfully against each other. The humor is subtle, with some great "office" -like scenes in the bank, and the thriller element creates excitement without being Hollywood. <br /> <br /> All in all, the film is about real people in an unusual situation. It is less about heroic deeds than about sensitive relationships. Brit-Filmmaking at its Best ... <br /> <br /> (9/10)
