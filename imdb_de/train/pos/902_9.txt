I really loved this movie, because nowadays you only see skin, music and bad acting in Indian cinemas. In this movie you can see some tradition, ethnicity and at least some decency ... although some parts were a bit dramatic, you know what? that's what Indian cinema is about! After watching this movie, you have no headaches from all the loud overrated music or violence, it's just the truth. They teach about love and, of course, caring for the person you love in life ... I think it was an amazing movie ... children can undoubtedly see it, and adults will enjoy the simplicity that India's assured depth was ... until all those rap hits, miniskirts and skin shows became part of it.
