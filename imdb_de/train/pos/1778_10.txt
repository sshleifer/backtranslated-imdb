I just want to say that I'm so glad somebody spilled the beans in this movie. Bravo "The Spaz", Bravo! This movie is a ridiculous farce of filmmaking. Especially for a student movie! I just want to thank Spazz for using the absurd time to find such a rare picture, and then COMMENTS! Most of the people I know do not have that kind of time, and very few will end up reading it. Kudos to you, sir! Anyway, the movie follows a thin storyline that is at least unbelievable and just stupid. I understand the idea of ​​creating a satire of Charlie's Angels, but why make such terrible actresses! And what kind of director did the picture itself write, produce, edit and even edit? Choose a job and put all your love in the man! It's a shame, because I've heard that he made a good movie about a killer toothbrush. Thanks to Spazz, who has withdrawn this film, people like you are a rare find.
