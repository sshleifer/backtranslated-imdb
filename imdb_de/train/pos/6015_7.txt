By the early 1970s, many of us who had embraced the hippie / acid / alternative culture had realized that mainstream society would not change as we had imagined. For me, this film defined the tension of "What now?" that many people I knew felt then. Are we going to the community and creating our own vision of utopia, or are we radicalizing and pushing for change? <br /> <br /> From the senseless gestures to the police, the radical rhetoric, the music of Pink Floyd to the love-making and the explosive images in the desert - there's so much in it. It captures well a momentous moment.
