Ashanti is a kind of film of the seventies (to be exact, 1979). It kind of reminded me of The Wild Geese (Richard Burton, Richard Harris and Roger Moore on a mission in Africa). It's also a very good movie, and I really enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> David (Michael Caine) is a doctor working in Africa and married to a beautiful Ashanti woman named Anansa (Beverley Johnson), who has been trained in medicine in America and is also a doctor. One day during the dissertation she is abducted by slavers working for an Arab slave trader called Suleiman (played perfectly by Peter Ustinov). The rest of the movie is David trying to get her back. <br /> <br /> Michael Caine, of course, is a brilliant actor and plays a character who is very determined and willing to do anything to get his wife back. but pretty hopeless with a gun and action stuff. First, he was helped by an Englishman fighting against the slave trade, which nobody knows he's doing (Rex Harrison!), Then briefly by a helicopter pilot (William Holden) and then by an Arab named Malik (Kabir Bedi). Malik has been able to settle for Suleiman (he is very intense all the same, a very captivating character) and rides away with David to find him and bring Anansa back - this includes a wonderful scene in which David fails miserably at his camel climb . <br /> <br /> Then there is a lot of adventure. There are also a lot of moral issues. History's progress is somewhat predictable from this point on, and there are some freedoms involved in planning to speed things up, but everything is pretty forgivable. The question is, David will come to Anansa before Peter Ustinov sells it to Omar Sharif (yes, of course, Omar Sharif is here!)?
