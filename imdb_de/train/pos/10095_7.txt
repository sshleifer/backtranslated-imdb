My parents brought me to this film at the age of nine. I never forgot it. I've never seen anything as beautiful as Elizabeth Taylor. (She was twenty-two when she did Elephant Walk.) Remember, I'm nine, so the feelings are not sexual, I just could not see anything else on the screen. I just wanted to sit like a puppy at her feet and stare at her. She has begun to show her age (she is nearly seventy-four), but I still think she is one of the most beautiful and breathtaking women who ever lived. <br /> <br /> I've seen the movie several times since, and it's a juicy melodrama. What it saves is, of course, Miss Taylor's beauty, the magnificent scenery, the impressive elephant plague, and a well-made point of human arrogance in the face of nature. <br /> <br /> All in all, a well - spent a few hours watching the movie channel or a rental video.
