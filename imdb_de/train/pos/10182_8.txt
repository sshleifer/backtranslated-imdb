good movie, good music, good background and an acceptable plot. But the main point, like his films, is the best actor in Idia and can turn dust into gold. Nana Patekar. This could be his second best performance after Parinda (others may disagree). although other films are not far behind. A man who will never disappoint you. <br /> <br /> A good movie, though I think Shahrukh would be a luxury that this movie could do without. You can see in his films, others try hard to reach their height and move out of their skin. but this man is really something elase. <br /> <br /> the movie is cool, the music and the direction is excellent. a must to look at it.
