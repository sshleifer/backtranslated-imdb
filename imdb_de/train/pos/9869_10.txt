I have to say that this is one of the best animated films I have ever seen. I liked it the first time, but I really enjoyed it on the second visit a few weeks ago. I can see why Sequel is doing so well at the box office. Apparently, many people liked this movie. <br /> <br /> A gorgeous color palette (man who looks great) and lots of good adult (but cleaner) humor make this movie a big winner. The 3-4-minute opening scene with "Scat" is outstanding, as well as the subsequent interludes with him. "Sid", the sloth (voiced by John Leguizano), however, provides the main joke in the movie. Usually he always has something funny to say in the film. <br /> <br /> Ray Romano is the voice of mammoth, the great character of the movie, literally, while Denis Leary is the cruel villain sabertooth tiger <br /> <br /> This is not just humor and pretty colors, but a nice, sentimental story about how a little baby softens some hard characters. This is not interrupted by many songs: One is short and there is nothing insulting in terms of language. <br /> <br /> If more animated movies were so good, I would have more.
