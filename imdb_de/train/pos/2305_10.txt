I thought that was a very good movie. It would have been nice to learn more about the movie that the two sisters know that everyone likes the same boy before he was killed. I'm sure if the movie had been shot this way, it would have given a different ending. That's why this move became a good movie. It shows that regardless of what happens to your siblings in your life, you can always come through and that when two sisters are dealing with a boy (the same boy), working through pain and pain does things making it look better and easier to work between the two of them. It's nice to see love stories that have a terrible thing to do in a person's life, that you can still get through when it's over. I really enjoyed watching this movie, and I still do it when it comes up. I look at each time I see it. It would have been nice if there had been a part 2 for this movie. Maybe the older sister would have brought up and got his baby. This would have really led to a good end to the story, since he died he is alive, even though he is dead.
