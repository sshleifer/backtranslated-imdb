If anyone mentions the name Victor McLaglen today, the answer is most likely "Who?" or maybe "why?" Well believe it or not, Victor McLaglen won the Oscar for Best Actor in this film, which is about a poor, desperate man ready to sell his best friend for "Carfare" to the United States , It's an interesting movie that shows how low even the most benevolent glances are for just a few dollars. The film is set in British-dominated Ireland. While all other characters are fighting, either directly or indirectly, for Ireland's political independence, Mr. McLaglen's character is worried about getting money and getting drunk. The film raises the question of whether political activism is worth the effort, because while the activist struggles to formulate a point, many others not only do not care, they do not even know what the uproar is about. The moral of this movie is: Watch out for the friend who can sell you for a penny.
