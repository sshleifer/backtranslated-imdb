Stylishly directed, picturesquely photographed and brilliantly implemented? Crosby's interpretation seems to be just right, Hardwicke has his best role, while Bendix is ​​also a treat? The attraction of this Yankee is universal and irresistible. <br /> <br /> One of the main pleasures of the movie is, of course, the songs. As you might expect, Bing has a good voice. And though Hardwick's solo was cut, we can still hear him singing warmly as he happily dances with Crosby and Bendix in their famous novel number "Busy Doing Nothing". It's also a treat for Rhonda Fleming, who, although she had an extensive stage and concert career as a singer, seldom had the chance to be heard in the movies. She has a lovely voice that goes beyond her ravishing looks, and she really looks very poignant in her Mary Kay Dodson costumes. <br /> <br /> Director Tay Garnett gets the most out of his wasteful budget and uses all the resources to present each fabulous scene as effectively as possible. (Maybe the solar eclipse looks a bit too elaborate, but who complains?) In short, as the trailer actually describes, an entertainment pleasure from start to finish.
