This film has a very simple but smart premise - an unemployed man trying to steal from a convenience store, and the store clerk does indeed catch him ... the thief runs after the store clerk. Meanwhile, the store clerk gets into trouble with a low-ranking Yakuza chinpira (gangster). In the hunt for the thief, they catch the attention of the yakuza, who was looking for the convenience store seller. The story then goes into high gear in the form of a Tom & Jerry (cat & mouse), but is added as the dog chases after the cat. The entire second act of D.A.N.G.A.N. Runner (can be translated into English as "PINBALL RUNNERS") is about the chase, and the chase goes so far that at the end of the second act the bum forgets why he runs away, and the Yakuza Don I can not remember which of the two guys he hunts, and he does not know why they are running away from him. <br /> <br /> Similar to SABU's later POSTMAN BLUES movie, the main part of the movie is just a chase and action with a lot of physical comedy and dark humor to keep the audience engaged. What's not enough is the end of the hunt, when the three men run out of breath, and into one of the most chaotic Mexican intervals you'll see in the movie, which looks like Sabu is paying homage to Tony Scott TRUE ROMANCE (written by Quentin Tarantino).
