<br /> <br /> Robot Jox is a great little movie. OK, some of the sets are bad and the acting is not great, but the special effects are great for a movie of this size and age. You must remember that this movie is now over 10 years old and was made very cheap in the first place, so you can not moan much about the bad parts. So just sit back and watch a cool movie with great big robots.
