This film was excellent for the following reasons: 1) It contained great sets and sets. 2) It showed the inequality of a war-torn environment alongside a technological one. 3) John Cusack's acting was great. He portrayed very well. 4) It showed the weak points of everyone in a war-torn situation. 5) It gave us a picture of what could happen in many ways in the future. I was also impressed by the acting. Hilary's acting was, as I found, the most stilted. The morals and values ​​of everyone in a war-torn situation are available. The liberal journalist and the conservative businessman are able to do everything in every situation and are equally unpredictable. Great stuff. PSP
