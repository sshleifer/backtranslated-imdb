Diagnosis Murder has been featured on most Weekday afternoons on BBC1 since I first saw it from school over ten years ago. I know, I should not really enjoy it, just as I do not like it. 'Murder she Wrote' But I'm totally addicted to both and even have the DVD box sets ... OK, I know that's sad. Dick Van Dyke wears the show while working as a dr. Mark Sloan plays doctor at LA's Community General Hospital, which is also LAPD's police advisor - his son Steve (Dick's real-life son) is a police officer who needs his father's help in many suspected deaths. <br /> <br /> Dr. Amanda Bentley (Victoria Bentley), who was a community general pathologist, and for the first two seasons, you had Scott Baio, Ph.D. Playing Jack Stewart, who left the show in 1995, he hoped for bigger and better things ... he should have stayed where he was, since then he has done nothing ... and his only theatrical appearance was in Baby Geniuses 2 for many years: Superbabies .... Oh dear !!! Anyway, Dr. Jack Stewart by the younger Dr. Replacing Jesse Travis, played by Charlie Schlatter, who stepped comfortably into Baios shoes. <br /> <br /> The series is highly implausible, but what is the Whodunit series not? (Murder she wrote - wherever Jessica gets, someone is dead, or The undervalued Father Dowling Mysteries about a murder that solves priests with nuns sidekick). <br /> <br /> The series was much easier until 1997, as it was. A side cast that included confused hospital manager Norman Briggs, played by Michael Tucci with Nurse & Mark's secretary Dolores of Delores Hall , After 1997, these two characters were no longer included, and the series became a bit more scary budget episodes containing far more action, an episode of the entire hospital is blown up. <br /> <br /> This was a family show. For the Van Dyke's, because besides Dick's son Barry, there were also Dick's daughter and all his grandchildren appearing in different episodes. <br /> <br /> When the show started, it got a bit stupid. One episode I remember is that Dick van Dike plays his entire family, which was a bit unusual, but on the whole "Diagnose Murder" really good TV show with lots of good guest stars. <br /> <br /> Since the end of this show in 2001, Dick & Barry have been back together in the 'MURDER 101' series of Hallmark Channel TV movies, much the same way and still enjoyable. Dick, now in his mid 80s, does not seem to change much and looks like he's working to the bitter end. <br /> <br /> TV SHOW **** OUT OF *** **
