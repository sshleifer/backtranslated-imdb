This is the second Eytan Fox movie I've seen. Fantastic actor Lior Ashkenazi, who starred in Walk on Water, also plays a subordinate role in this film. But the real stars are the young Israelis living together in a small apartment - Noam (Ohad Knoller), Lulu (Daniela Virtzer) and Yelli (Alon Friedman); and the Palestinian who joins them - Ashraf (Yousef 'Joe' Sweid). There is something like friends / sex in the city (mostly gay) and everyone just wants the war to end so they can live in peace. <br /> <br /> But that's the rub. No matter how many posters you hang or how much you care about peace, the war will not end. Many have tried over the years to bring the two sides to the table, but they just want to continue it for some reason. There are many on the Israeli side, both here and here in the US, who want everything and do not consider peace. On the Palestinian side, there are many who seem to be unemployed should there ever be peace. It is not in any interest to end this war and the children are suffering. <br /> <br /> This is always in your head when you see this funny and engaging movie. It will not go away. You know that something tragic will happen and of course. With feelings on both sides and revenge as a motivator, there is always a tragedy, and that makes them an adult version of Friends / Sex in the City. There is no superficiality. It's a real life and it was a nice thing to see.
