Freddy Krueger, the dream hunter from Ulmenstra√üe, returns, the great character actor Robert Englund is back in this sequel to Nightmare 5, Dream Child. I hope I got the number right. There were so many and he is one of the best. Especially for the cameos of Rosanne Barr (then Arnold) Tom Arnold, Johnny Depp (who did the very first nightmare in 84), Alice Cooper (singer), you will see Freddy as a tormented child, a teenager who loves pain and a family man (scary) the effects are very funny and creative, the cast also includes Lisa Zane (Billy's sister) and Meyer (road trip) Yaphet Kotto (Alien, live and let die) and Amanda Donahue (dad best knows) one of the humans, who saw this in 3d, also the end. I love 3d movies. i missed the first 3d wave in 1953 (i was not even born) the second wave was in 1983. like all freddy movies. This is one of the better ones, without counting the first, which was absolutely brilliant. Freddy became the new monster of the '80s and' 90s with Jason Voorhees, Chucky, Micheal Myers and Leather Face. Can you imagine a movie with everyone? I recommend this to all Freddy fans and horror fans alike. Freddy is a cut of 8 out of 10.
