I found this movie exciting from the start. When Miss Stanwyck starts her narration, it will only be a few minutes before you realize that it is causing trouble. The deserted area, the lock on the abandoned gas station door, everything prepares you to wait for it ... here it comes. At first you think it's about the little boy, but too soon you hold your breath and watch the tide. I found this film very exhausting, although I had seen it before and was prepared for dissolution. Well, a movie that can hold you in suspense, even if you've seen it before, deserves a special rating, maybe a white ankle price?
