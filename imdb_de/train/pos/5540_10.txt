At first the movie seems so bad that I almost fell into a trance the first time I saw it. It was like a bad dream. A cosmic boredom. But I gave him a second chance, then another and another, etc. I finally became addicted to this movie, because of its dreamy slow tempo, wonderful natural scenery, bathed in a mild autumn light, and especially because of the music from the 70s Progressive rock and absolutely exquisite folk songs of the actor / singer / songwriter is Derek Lamb (The Troubadour). You should hear the song about hazel wood, silver trout and lady disappearing in the air ... that can be heard in the middle and at the end of the film. In the beginning, there are some carnal scenes that exist Let us appreciate the natural charms of Elizabeth Suzuki. If this film had been filmed by some "repertoire" directors like Bergman, Lars von Triers or Jean-Luc Goddard, the critics would have rolled on the floor and raving about this movie as if it were a cosmic masterpiece. Personally, I think that this movie is a million times superior to Fellini's movie sh # Â¤ @ t! By no means for the presumptuous.
