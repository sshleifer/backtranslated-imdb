I saw this movie in 1975 in a London cinema and have not seen it since. I thought it was funny. I loved the originality. It's rare for someone to make a movie like this - and he's sad too. <br /> <br /> I mean, I once read a book called "The Black Hotel" - and as a movie fan I always have "picture" books as movies. A little "adjust", you know? But when I read it, I thought, well, that would make a great movie - but of course it would have to be "adapted" to the point where it has little relation to the book. <br /> <br /> But then I thought, why? Sure, it could never be shown on TV on Sunday afternoon, but assuming it was shown ADULT in theaters, who knew what it contained, where is the HARM? Damn, my civil liberties were crushed here. A director should be able to make a literal film adaptation of The Black Hotel. <br /> <br /> In an ideal world, adult censorship should not exist. But even though I agree that when INTELLIGENT adults such freedom may be harmless, there would always be those who lack the rationality to distinguish between fantasy and reality, and are being tempted to commit evil acts, it is but difficult to see how "La Bete" falls into this category. <br /> <br /> When he appeared in England, she was put out of action by British censorship. Despite the relaxation of nudity in 1969, given the theoretical theme of the film about bestiality, the censorship would have ALL of it, had he on Monday looking for a new job. <br /> <br /> BUT ... in those days there was an alternative. The G.L.C. This was a council with a department that had the power to deliver a film only for London, where the audience was classified as "sopical", as those who lived in the sticks. The film was duly submitted and passed. Later, however, it turned out that the "Board" consisted of only four people - three voted, plus one "chairman". And one of the voters was sick that day. So the remaining two voters and the chairman sat down and looked at "La Bete". One of the said voters said, like me, that the movie was hilarious and hardly prone to induce anyone to misdeeds. The other one had no imagination and thought just disgusting. And the chairman did not understand, so he decided to err on the side of FREEDOM. When the missing voter finally saw the movie, they thought it was disgusting, but it was too late! The film had received its "X-London" certificate and opened for mixed reactions. The G.L.C. Film censorship board was dissolved soon after! So "La Bete" was only opened in London, which could best be called FLUKE! But I'm glad it was like this. It is great! If you have not seen it, do it. It's a FANTASY and as such, it's far less disturbing than most of the things you see on the news today ...
