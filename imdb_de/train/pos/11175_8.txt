So often in Stephen King adaptations, you get just a collection of characters reciting dialogues from the books. That really captures the heart of the book. Maybe because they do NOT use large blocks of text directly from the book, but it's a bit more of an improvement in events in the story. A big part of the success is Miko Hughes as Baby Gage. Dale Midkiff and Denise "Tasha Yar" Crosby really behave like his parents. There is a scene where Louis Gage cuddles and they are very natural together. Fred Gwynne is wonderful. He nails the Maine accent perfectly, without parodying, and is wise and warm, just as Jud should be. (8 out of 10)
