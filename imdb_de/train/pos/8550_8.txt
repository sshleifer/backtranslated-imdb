Now I love American Pie 1 and 2, while 3 was great only for Seann William Scott's performance as a Stifler, but after that, the quality has diminished. Band Camp kept up the standard with the characters you were really interested in, but Naked Mile was the same joke and the plots were recycled (Erik Stifler's sex problem is like Jim's). There were some amusing moments like the football game against the dwarves and the "punishment" of Coozeman, but in general there was a lack of originality and the "mile" was just stupid and moronic. Not to mention the irritating girlfriend who does not want to have sex. <br /> <br /> That's enough about the Naked Mile. I watched Beta House with concern when I thought the series could hit a new low, but I was pleasantly surprised. To be honest, there is no real conspiracy, but it's full of hot girls (Ashley is incredible) and sex jokes. Yes, it's a formula and the jokes are old, but Dwight Stifler (Steve Talley) raises the bar with an exuberant performance. Above all, the Greek Olympics entertains the penultimate and final events, while Christopher McDonald's cameo is hilarious. However, there are weaknesses. Coozeman is just as irritating as in the first time. I am still at a loss as to how he ever got a role. <br /> <br /> While Coozeman is bad, Erik Stifler is worse. John White made Naked Mile a real pain, but in Beta House he takes his performance to a whole new level. Above all, he lacks charisma, a Stifler requirement. You really can not care less about him. The only reason I was worried about his relationship was that Ashley could be on the screen! She shines over him like the rest of the cast. Seriously John White is the ultimate in bad acting and has about as much charisma as a dead fish. <br /> <br /> To say that the movie is entertaining and Coozeman's fear that his girl is not exactly a girl is incredibly funny. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie is worth a haul, get some of your buddies in and laugh at the Incredible Feast and let your anger out with Erik 'Loser' Stifler.
