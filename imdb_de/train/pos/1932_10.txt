I think I usually go to film festivals with the low expectation that they will invariably be "quirky" and that any intended humor will be derived solely at the expense of the simplicity of the characters in the face of a complicated context. The special feature of Big Bad Swim was that the director was able to maintain the integrity and development of his characters in his film while still finding loud humor in scene by scene. There was a sophistication, perhaps because of the DP's sharp work, which I've rarely seen in an indie movie, and even rarer in a comedy. A special note here: Paget Brewster is the math teacher as Amy. Having seen this idea, I can not understand why Brewster was not "discovered" by a larger audience. It brings the necessary mix of anger and sympathy into the role that really helps this image unleash its potential. This is a great job that deserves a bigger audience. I'm looking forward to more from the director and this cast!
