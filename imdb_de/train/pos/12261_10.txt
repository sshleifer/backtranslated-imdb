Tintin and I have recently seen as a consequence of PBS's P.O.V. Series. It is based on a recorded interview with Georges Remi u. Her. Herge, the creator of Tintin, from 1971, in which he tells about his various experiences when he published his popular character, first in a Catholic newspaper, then in his own comic book series. Great, far-reaching views of various comic pages and surreal images of Herges dreams. I first met Tintin in the pages of Children's Digest at my local primary school library and read the unicorn's secrets. My mother later got a subscription to CD, and in 1978 I read all of Red Rackham's Treasure every month. I remember seeing some Tintin comics at a local bookstore after that, but for some reason, I probably did not get any because I was 12 and I thought I had outgrown them. I wrote Breaking Free, a book written by J. Daniels, 1989, six years after Hgege's death. I have not read it yet. This film also describes the artist's personal life when he left his first wife after an affair with a colorist whom he later married. Her name is Fanny and she is interviewed here. If you love Tintin and its creator, this movie is definitely worth a look. Update: 9/4/07 - I have now read Breaking Free. Tintin and The Captain are the only regular characters that appear here. They are tailored to the anticapitalist views of Daniels, with Tintin portrayed as a mob hacker with a chip on his shoulder, who still takes care of the captain he is staying with. The captain here only tries to make ends meet with his wife and daughter, whom he loves very much. She and other construction workers swear to strike after another employee is killed by a faulty equipment accident. The whole thing takes place in England with intact Cockney accents of the working class. Not what Herge would approve of, but still an interesting read. Oh yes, the dog Snowy appears only in the upper left corner of the cover (where Tintin walks over the police!) And the dedication page.
