... it's even about the evil "raw". This show is almost twenty years old and I still laughed a lot when I saw them last night. It shows Eddie Murphy in tight red clothes (Old School) and he jokes with everything that goes from Celebertis to his family. He was only 22 years old at the time and that is a must! <br /> <br /> 8/10
