The cast was good, and I thought it was a good performance by Christopher Lloyd, which I like from previous films. The movie was a great family movie, nothing that would worry you to show it to younger kids, a good story, lots of laughs, carefree and enjoyable. If you want to entertain children without getting bored, this is the bill. Kind, and it's not hard for parents to look at them.
