"Written on the Wind" is an irresistible, wonderfully confused film that only director Sirk could have done. The film is immersed in a bucket full of Freudian symbols, funny melodrama and colorful contrasts. The connection between financial success and moral decline is the main theme of the film. Sirk seems to suggest that sexual dysfunction is one of the side effects of capitalism. However, I prefer to consider the film as a prime example of what Sirk could do with kitschy material. Particularly impressive is the color palette. The drama in the movie is great, too. Rock Hudson and Lauren Bacall are terribly glamorous and give the film an aura of elegance, but the film belongs to Robert Stack and Dorothy Malone (she rightly won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress) who manage to put the film on a hot spot hold. Kudos to Frank Skinner's vibrant score, the brilliant camera work of Russell Metty (each shot is a masterpiece in itself) and the production department. The theme song is also a beauty. It is an unforgettable movie.
