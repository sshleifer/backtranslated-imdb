This is one of the funniest and best movies ever made! I've only seen forty minutes of it and I have to say that this is a good movie. The plot is funny and because there is sex on every corner of this movie. It's really funny and I do not see that someone could NOT like this movie. I really want to see the rest of the movie. It has a slightly sick scene (trust me, it's not very pleasant), but apart from that, this is a great movie. I rate this movie 7/8 for the comedy, 10/10 for sexual content and 10/10 for the plot. Please, if you're a fan of American Pie and you want to watch a movie that's pretty much all about sex when you buy this movie. You will like it. <br /> <br /> 10/10
