As a Pokémon fan I really liked this movie. It introduces new legendary Pokémon (like any movie) and adds depth to the relationships between its characters. However, I do not expect those who are not Pokémon fans to enjoy it (this includes MOST adults). Some of the lines were hackneyed, but that may be somewhat inevitable if the film is dubbed in English. The entertainment was beautiful, although there were a few parts that did not look good. And though the villain is kinda crazy, I think the films did a good job of cycling through different types of bad guys, and I guarantee you that they're not all like that. Those who do not like it, I tell everyone, but Pokémon fans will love it.
