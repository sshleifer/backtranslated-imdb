This movie has a lot of comedy, not dark and Gordon Liu shines in this movie. He shows his funny side and it was really weird to see him beaten up. His training is "unorthodox" and who would have thought that nodal bonding could be so deadly? Many great stunts and choreographies. Very creative! <br /> <br /> Add Johnny Wang and you have a fantastic showdown! Do not mess with Manchu thugs. they are ruthless!
