"The Sentinel" is one of the best horror movies ever made in the movie industry! I find it very scary, because only very few films are actually. Alison Parker is a model with some fame. She mentions a lawyer named Michael Lerman and has another model named Jennifer as her best friend. Everything was great in her life, until she decides to live alone for some time and to rent a nice and old apartment. <br /> <br /> The problem is their neighbors, who are very strange. Suddenly, Alison starts having health problems and often faints. She also remembers some painful facts about her past that cause her to have nightmares or illusions. But there is a reason for everything and it has to do with the new house she lives in. <br /> <br /> Personally, I find "The Sentinel" a very scary movie and together with "The Exorcist" '' They are two of the scariest films I have ever seen. When we realize that Alison's house is occupied only by the priest, my blood froze! It's also terrible to see that she has to go blind at the end of the movie to be the new guard to keep the monsters out of our world.
