I love this movie because it showed that they did not kill for fun, but to save those they loved! Heath Ledger and Orlando Bloom have made Ned and Joe great. It has a few quick inappropriate scenes, but other than that, it's fine. The language is very mild and sometimes I do not even know she is there. This movie shows that crime only means when they are outlaws. I hope people will see this movie and learn about important times in the story like this one. One thing that fascinates me about this movie is that they get their inspiration for their armor from a book that Ned has viewed! That's how people remember their armor. I hope people will watch this movie and be as interested as me.
