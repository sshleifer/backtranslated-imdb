I loved the kids in the movie. I have to deal with children in this age group, and I thought their behavior was very credible. I had a problem with the reference to the private parts of the 5-year-old. I did not think the comment was necessary and lowered my opinion on the film. <br /> <br /> I think Luke Benward is an aspiring star. I would like to see more of him on the big screen. I really enjoyed his reactions to the situations in which he found himself. Often children in this age group do things without thinking through the consequences. Almost all actors have done this throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> I also think that the message of bullying in movies with this age group needs more investigation. It is a big problem in schools today. <br /> <br /> The end was quite unexpected. Billy's thoughts about whether he won the bet or not were very surprising. How he dealt with this situation was excellent. Too often, children are not prepared to compromise. The actors in this film have shown that compromise is an important part of life.
