I'm proud to have an uncut copy of this select 70's drive-in sexplo-comedy cheese on DVD. It's a really dumb and enjoyable inconsistent movie with a nice 70's flair. It is trying to honestly say that true love and friendship in life are more important than a cool wheelset and a fast tail. Sure, it's essentially an obvious youthful male fantasy photo - adolescent goofu's star Bobby Hamilton brings the girls, the respect of his friends and the chance to show a local van racing bully - but it's way too stupid and to hate good-naturedly. Stuart Getz, as our gawky protagonist makes for a loveable Dorky track, Deborah White is definitely cute as the main object of Getz's affection. Connie Lisa Marie is also pretty voluptuous like a pretty blonde, and down-to-earth Beefcake Neanderthal Stephan Oliver (a 60-year-old biker movie) is wonderfully hateful as the brutal Dugan Hicks. Above all, the well-known Danny DeVito is an absolute uproar, as Getz's cranky Autoschwad boss Andy, a gracious, curious guy who wears very ugly loud Hawaiian shirts and suffers from strict gambling habits. I especially love the scene where two thugs brutally beat Danny - one holds his arms behind his back while the other man works over Danny's torso! And Sammy Johns' insidious, catchy escape hit song will hop around your skull for at least a week. In short, it's a great groovy retro 70's fun!
