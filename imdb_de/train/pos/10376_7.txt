I just saw Roll and what a pleasure it was. The performance of Toby Malone was really outstanding. I really cared what happened to Matt throughout the movie time. There are also many good twists on the whole, it will let you guess until the very end. Other characters to watch out for are the totally insane Tiny and the devious attractive Jesse. It does not have the huge budget of a Hollywood blockbuster, but do not be put off. You could do a lot worse than checking this, you will not regret it. Have fun. 10.7
