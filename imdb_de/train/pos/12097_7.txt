This complicated story begins quite simply: An English journalist accepts a bet by Edgar Allen Poe and his friend Lord Blackwood that he can not spend a night in the haunted Blackwood Castle. Once there, the writer wanders through the dusty rooms and corridors until music and a look at an espousing couple lead him into an empty room. He sits at the harpsichord and begins to play the piece he has heard, and is surprised to be tapped on the shoulder by the stunningly beautiful Elizabeth Blackwood. She informs him in an ambiguous charming / weird way that she has prepared his room upstairs and that someone is always expected that night ... the night of the dead. Thus begins a startling series of supernatural events that confuse the journalist for the rest of the night. SPOILER AHEAD: It probably will not surprise many bystanders when they learn that pretty Elizabeth is indeed a ghost. This does not stop them from falling in love with the journalists, but makes it more complicated for them than for an average couple. This is a funny movie with absolutely everything: ghosts, the creepy castle, repeated visions of past events, sex and violence (though both have been toned down in the version that most Americans have seen over the years). Seductive, intriguing Barbara Steele is the main reason to see it. She has a strange charisma that you have never seen before in the movies. Recommended!
