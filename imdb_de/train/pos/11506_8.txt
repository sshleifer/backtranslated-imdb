"Kolchak" was a TV series that did not fit into any category. Part horror, part comedy, some social awareness, and what we have is something that I think people were not ready for. It's a pity when I started seeing these shows in the Chiller network (I never saw the originals), I realized how different and interesting it really was. <br /> <br /> With Darren Mcgavin as Kolchak as a reporter for the International News Service and Simon Oakland as his always angry boss Tony Vincenzo, the show followed the exploits of a Chicago news reporter more often than not part of the story itself he searched the windy city for modern scary things that get restless at night. The underlying charm of Macgavin really sets the show apart. A rather daft guy who always wears the same suit, you can not help but love him. His jokes are great, and the back and forth between him and the skeptical editor Oakland is downright funny. <br /> <br /> The stories are pretty good for the most part and the acting is very good. The 70s were not a * great * time for special effects, and the show suffers, but if you expose the unbelief, you have a fun series that was ahead of its time.
