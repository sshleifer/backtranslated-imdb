I have never commented on a movie. I saw this movie last night with my girlfriend. I've read comments that say this movie stays with you. It does. It's been almost 24 hours and I'm still completely affected. In this movie, I questioned myself. How can I compare myself to a character like Ben, who is completely selfless? I loved this movie. I love films that let me guess and wonder until the end. Above all, I feel two feelings, happiness and sadness. An incredible movie to feel good and a very sad movie. I wanted Ben and Emily to be together, but in the end they were forever. If you have not seen this movie yet, pick it up and look at it. Just make sure you have no distractions. You want to see every nuance in this picture. One for my library.
