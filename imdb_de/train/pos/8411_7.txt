This early version of the fairy tale "The Student of Prague" was filmed in Germany in 1913 with Paul Wegener (who was also in "Golem" a few years later). In this film he plays a double role (technically impressive for a 95-year-old film to see her in the same setting) after meeting a mysterious old man who signs a pact for gold with him - the gold he needs to win a countess he has previously promoted Rescued from drowning. <br /> <br /> At a fast pace (the movie runs just over an hour) and pretty well written and characterized, "The Student of Prague" has echoes of the fist legend as well as dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, beginning with a pact with a mysterious figure of potential evil and developing to good and evil sides of the same person.
