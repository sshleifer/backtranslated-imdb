Well, the movie is not exactly "funny". <br /> <br /> Okay, I admit, there are a few HUMOROUS lines, but definitely nothing that is funny. For example, just before a hot sex scene between Eleniak and one of her male soldiers, Sh is tied to the bedpost and he can not pull off her shirt. Before leaving the room to fetch the key, he says to her, "Okay, go nowhere." See, humorous, but not funny. <br /> <br /> The plot and acting is pretty good. <br /> <br /> But Erika Eleniak is definitely stealing the show. She is hot and sexy and there is a really steamy scene with her that you can not help but rewind and look again. <br /> <br /> There are also some other very sexy scenes with her and she has some very provocative lines. <br /> <br /> 5 stars altogether. I would only give it to three if Erika Eleniak were not.
