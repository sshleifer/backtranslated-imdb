Two years ago I saw "The Matador" in the cinema and I loved everything about this movie. Obviously, I got the impression of Pierce Brosan's great role. Yesterday I caught this movie again on TV, so I looked at it a bit deeper. Well, I can say for sure that this movie is not special, but you just have to love it for a man. <br /> <br/> In my opinion, Brosnan increases his rating with astounding performance from Julian Noble, a tired hit man who has no friends. Soon, Julian meets Danny Wright (Greg Kinnear) in Mexico City, a man unlucky: his son died from an accident, his job is not working so well, and he's not sure he's his wife Bean (Hope Davis) can keep. <br /> <br /> I've always liked movies so much; Crime with a lot of humor. Most of the humor comes from Brosnan as he talks jokes about dwarves with Big D ... or one of my favorite lines in the movie: "I look like a Bangkok hooker on a Sunday morning after the Navy left the city." Brosnan says it with his charm while drinking his margarita as usual. I also like Greg's 'typical American face' Kinnear in the role of the loser, which is made very lively because there are many people like Danny Wright. <br /> <br /> So I recommend you to probably see the best role of Brosnan ever. He will make you smile and admire him at the same time. Great Brosnan in not the same great movie.
