Anyone who finds this film boring is a hopeless beaver who should engage in car hunt movies and romantic comedies. This movie is fascinating and has no boring moment. Why? It essentially consists of an intelligent dialogue between real people in times of crisis and details of their efforts to survive this crisis. I repeat - intelligent dialogue! That's what makes most of Rohmer's films stand out. That's why many people do not like them. They prefer action. Well, let them spend the rest of their lives watching action movies while those with taste and discrimination continue to look for movies like these. Rohmer was always accused of being "talkative." Well, he is, but for me that's a compliment, not a criticism. Shakespeare was also talkative. Is there an inconspicuous piece as "Hamlet"? Whenever the theme or theme of a work of art is made up of ideas and conflicts of value, it inevitably involves a discussion of those ideas and values, and that is what this film is all about. Aristocracy and noble birth vs. egalitarianism; Loyalty to old friends who will be put to the ultimate test if this friend takes a wrong path in our opinion the value of human life and the responsibility to help save this life, even if the person who owns this life not so nice or even despicable. (Who ever heard of Dostoyevsky or "Crime and Punishment?") That's what this film is all about. <br /> <br /> The two main roles in this film are flawless, as if they were born to play those roles. Lucy Russell, who speaks English and speaks French as a second language, is particularly brilliant. Do yourself a favor and see this fascinating movie. It may be the last movie of this screen master.
