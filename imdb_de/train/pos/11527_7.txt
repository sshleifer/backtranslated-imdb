Miriam Hopkins is "The Red-Haired Lady" in this 1940s biography of Mrs. Leslie Carter, which also mentions Claude Rains as David Belasco, Richard Ainley as Lou Payne, and a stellar cast of supportive players such as Laura Hope Crews and Victor Jory , <br /> <br /> Miriam Hopkins and Claude Rains give wonderful performances. Hopkins was a beautiful actress who really leads us to Mrs. Carter. Rains is great as the extravagant, selfish producer / writer / actor / impresario David Belasco, one of the big names in the theater. <br /> <br /> Although Mrs. Carter's second husband, Lou Payne, served as a consultant for this film, it is a poor representation of the true events of Mrs. Carter's life. Although there was a much publicized and bitter divorce, she was undoubtedly considered a scandalous character and an actress. However, she had custody of her son Dudley, so there was no custody battle. After breaking up with Belasco, she did not return to work, but started working in vaudeville and actually made a few films towards the end of her life. She actually married Lou and he became her leading man in many productions. <br /> <br /> The driving force for Mrs. Carter at the beginning of this film is to regain her son's custody, but she finally realizes that. In this time, he is firmly attached to his father. Also in the movie (and I'm not sure if it's true in real life) she traveled with her mother and lived in a theater board, giving the movie an extra interesting atmosphere. <br /> <br /> Not a bad movie, probably not the size of Carter or Belasco. One of Mrs. Carter's most famous moments was in the heart of Maryland, where she was wearing a wig with five meters of curls. Next to the stage, the fans blew their hair as she hung 35 feet across the stage, clutching the center of a bell so she would not ring. Pretty visual.
