John Singletons best movie, before blockbuster wannabees like the Shaft remake, a memorable movie with great acting and great balance between the three protagonists of the stories, each with identifiable problems with teenagers, <br /> <br/> What I Am It also likes to cover the problem of self-harm among young blacks, a problem that is mostly ignored by the media and other films that focus mainly on socio-economic issues and white racism. This film shows that blacks can be equally ignorant and racist. <br /> <br /> The master of this movie is that it deals with so many topics without getting flattened. It's not just about racism, it's about how hard it can be to move to a new world (college), find rape, and discover sexuality and isolation. Omar Epps, Michael Rapaport and Kristy Swanson perform well, and the side cast is equally interesting with Jennifer Connelly as lez (yay) and with Ice Cube and Busta Rhymes as college bums leading to minor riots. <br /> <br /> The only negative is the caricature of a professor by Laurence Fishburne ("Peppermint?"). Sure, many professors are crazy. But they are not so flat. The skinheads are also a bit of a caricature, but I think they are like that in real life too. All in all, a great underrated piece of movie work, if you like American History X, you'll love this <br /> <br /> 8.5 out of 10
