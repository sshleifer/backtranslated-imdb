Titanic is a classic. I was really surprised that this film did not have a solid ten in the IMDb ranking. Maybe it's just cool not to credit the Titanic these days, but when it was made it was really something. When the movie came out, people were pouring into the theaters. When it came out on video, my sister and I watched it twice a day for a month. It is safe to say that we were obsessed and for good reason. Some of the catastrophic scenes were hard to forget, like the frozen baby or the man who had committed suicide after killing someone in the troubled crowd. Many people died on this ship, and to convey this on film with the immediacy and the feelings it needed was a difficult challenge for James Cameron. And let's not forget the amazing romance between Jack and Rose. Whether her relationship was a fantasy of someone or not, it was lovely. They hardly knew each other, but they would die for each other. They trusted each other. They certainly give Romeo and Juliet money for their money. "I'll never let go, Jack." Titanic is a great movie to the core. It is a powerful story told by brilliant acting, excellent cinematography, beautiful music and a crew full of hard and dedicated workers. I'm so excited when someone says he hates this movie.
