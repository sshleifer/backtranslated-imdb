Since the day I saw this movie in 1981, he was one of my three favorites. The cover text I wrote for Amazon is down, and I'm just thrilled that it will finally be released on DVD on October 17th, 2006 - the 25th anniversary of the movie. <br /> <br /> The final acknowledgment of this film explains it's appeal - "Many thanks to the people of Manhattan on whose island this was filmed." A charming and witty romantic comedy, a love story written to New Yorkers (Peter Bogdanovich is native) who can identify any place (West 12th Street, Ansonia, Old FAO Schwartz, Plaza, Roxy, Chez Brigitte, and City Limits ( One gets the impression that the whole ensemble was clicked from the screen as well as from the image and that intimacy is clearly communicated.I laughed, I cried, it was better than CATS, it was not just one Ode to Dorothy Stratten, but also the last appearance of Audrey Hepburn (she had a cameo after this movie) and her inner beauty is coming out of the screen - buy it, make a big bucket of popcorn and make yourself comfortable with someone you love.
