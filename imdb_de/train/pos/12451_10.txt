Although I bought the DVD when it first came out and watched it several times, I never wrote a review. <br /> <br /> I loved her when I saw her for the first time and I still love her. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it never seems to make enough money to motivate someone to do a follow-up. I have to assume that QT still controls the rights, but after Kill Bill, when he makes a movie that is as faithful to comics and books as My Name is Modesty, with another tough female lead role, everyone who comes along with it Unfamiliar with the character, see this as a disappointment. <br /> <br /> Peter O'Donnell wrote his stories to focus more on psychic tension than action thriller. <br /> <br /> The stumbling between Modesty and Miklos is very true to the raw material and is tense, exciting and intriguing to anyone who does not need to have blisters and explosions. Alexandra did a great job showing how O'Donnell's character took over the situation. <br /> <br /> I find that especially before the turn after the much needed reboots of Batman and James Bond. After two bleak previous efforts, though not nearly as well-known in public, this is really a restart of the Modesty character, and it's really sad that most likely no more films are being shot about them.
