In Lizzie Borden's "Love Crimes" (1992), Sean Young plays a grim D.A. in Atlanta. She is a loner who is too deeply involved in the case of a man (Patrick Bergin) who portrays herself as a famous fashion photographer, seducing women, taking uncompromising photos of them and then leaving them. <br /> <br /> Of course. This tough loner decides to go into the life of the fake shutterbugs by pretending to be a loot and intending to bring him to justice. They meet, they love each other, then comes the next thing she knows, she is over his lap and gets beat up. (Note: The spanking scene is only included in the "Unrated" version of this movie.) In the R-rated version, these and some other scenes that would make the plot clearer are omitted.) This psychological thriller contains several scenes female nudity and disturbing pictures B. Bergin, who chases one of his victims in the room and nudges her with a riding crop. <br /> <br /> As a thriller, "Love Crimes" is best when Sean Young plays her cat - mouse with Bergin trying to catch him in a stressful act. It's unfortunate that the movie does not end, it just stops. That's right. Director Lizzie Borden may have just finished the story but after 92 minutes the credits roll and we have an enigmatic "What happened?" Confusion. <br /> <br /> The development of Young's plan is played in an appealing style, but the lack of a coherent ending will be a turn for some viewers. Dan (daneldorado.) @ Yahoo.com)
