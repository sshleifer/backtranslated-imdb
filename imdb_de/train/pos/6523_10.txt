Sure, the story in this movie was "Hollywoodized" - but it's far from the only piece of history rewritten for the masses. Lafitte sided with the Americans because he considered himself a Frenchman and therefore hated the British, not for some patriotism for a nation that had recently taken over New Orleans; he broke his consent and returned to smuggling, which sent him to Galveston; He was more like a little criminal and a rogue than a hero or a shit. But who cares? This is a movie that is pure entertainment - and frankly, we all wanted Jean to choose the intrepid girl instead of the prudish daughter of the governor. Brynner rises again over mediocre writing to perform a fascinating feat.
