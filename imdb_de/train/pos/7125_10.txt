Goodnight Mister Tom is so beautifully filmed and beautifully realized. It is not completely faithful to the book, but does it have to be? No not at all. John Thaw is as fascinating as Tom Oakley. His transformation from rough to caring was so well accomplished that he became more credible than Scrooge in Christmas Carol. After Inspector Morse this is the best hour of Thaw. He was seriously reconciled by a young Nick Robinson who deeply convinced an evacuee traumatized by his abusive relationship with his mother. The script and the music were worth it, and Thaw also plays the organ. Amazing! The most moving scene was that Willie learned about Zak's death, and then Tom told him about his deceased family who died of Scarlatina. Buy that, you will love it! 10/10 Bethany Cox
