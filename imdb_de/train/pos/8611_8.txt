I really enjoyed watching this movie. I recorded it while watching TV so I can watch it later. The second consideration was more fun for me since I was able to better capture the clever dialogue between Natalie and Adam, the two main characters. I thought that the development of this story was very thoughtful. I was very fascinated by how Natalie would interact with her daughter's friends. At first it seemed like she was spewing out a lot of animosity, but when she started to interact more pleasantly, I had to see how this visit would develop. I was not disappointed. Gradually revealing the secrets that kept Sara in front of her mother, a daughter who was not as perfect a defective human being like most of us who wanted to free themselves from a domineering mother who thought he knew her daughter, which they do Unfortunately, learning in a very good way had a painful way that sometimes you really have to love someone to give them the freedom. The spectators, who held with the movie to the end, saw a very touching performance by Diane Keaton (which is always wonderful, even in some of its less well-received films - think Town and Country). The final scene in which Diane Keaton drove home was worth it to wait for everyone who loves another person has to learn that we have to live our own lives, we love others, but does not possess, and ultimately must let's go for that. It's a difficult lesson, but it pays to think about it occasionally. Thank you, CBS for this broadcast, it has been worth it to wait a long time.
