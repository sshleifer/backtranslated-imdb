The fear of a black hat is a funny parody of hip-hop culture. It's as funny as This Is Spinal Tap, if not weirder. The actors are incredible and the documentary style is outstanding. Mark Christopher Lawrence is a tremendous talent that should be seen in many other films. This movie is a true cult classic!
