This is a great movie, I made it a while ago. It had a special incentive to do so. I loved Vanessa Williams as Rosey, and Jason Alexander has a good voice, too. It was great. The attitude was also very good. Apart from the fact that it is 2 hours and 50 minutes, it is quite long. Overall, I give 8.5 stars. They also added a few parts, but it was still cool.
