"Bye Bye Birdie" is not one of the best musicals of all time, but it's great fun and open to many viewers. The original movie could have been wonderful, with Dick Van Dyke repeating his unmistakable Broadway role, but instead, they tinkered with the plot, making the film very unsatisfactory. This replay, which aired on ABC in 1995, is far more faithful to the original script and also includes some original songs used on a national tour, this one featuring Tommy Tune and Ann Reinking (who choreographed this movie) br /> <br /> Jason Alexander is a very different type from Dick Van Dyke, but he is well cast as Albert (before his "Seinfeld" days he started in music theater.) Vanessa Williams is a perfect fit for Rose. It's also a great work by Tyne Daly as Mae and Mark Kudisch as Conrad Birdie (a role he played on the national tour). <br /> <br /> This movie is not without problems. A major debt is Chynna Phillips, who, though she is attractive, looks simple and seems too old to be a teenage Kim. And George Wendt is a bit boring like her father and throws away the number "kids" (a number of original actor Paul Lynde has also stolen the show). <br /> <br /> But all in all, this is a delightful one , well made film that the material deserves.
