Jack Frost is really a cool movie. I mean ... it's funny. It is violent. and very pleasant. Most people say it's B-rated, but that could not be further from the truth. It has great special effects and good action. The only strange thing is of course The Killer Snowman. I think this movie was actually one of the best movies of the late nineties. Most films of these days are missing the criteria of a masterpiece of Clive Barker. So be original and give the viewer what he does not expect. Jack Frost is very cool. 10 out of 10. Review: A +. Ed also recommends The Movie Uncle Sam fans of Jack Frost.
