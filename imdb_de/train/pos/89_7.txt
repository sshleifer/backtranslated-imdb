To be honest, I had no idea what this movie was about when I started the movie. So I watch movies whenever possible. No prejudice I thought this would be a movie about stonemasons in the woods or something. I was wrong, somehow. <br /> <br /> Loaded was a bit boring in the beginning, but when it started I was really fascinated. I know the feeling of being pulled into something dangerous where you feel helpless but doing things you do not want to do. <br /> <br /> Another user commented on how this film is stupid and implausible, but I want to say something else. Such things actually happen. I'm sorry, but not everyone lives in a dream world where nothing bad can happen and crazy situations are "implausible". I'm sorry, but the reality of the world is that they actually happen. Both the creator of this film and the actors have described very well how bad things can go wrong and how people can make really bad decisions. Sometimes things become good, sometimes bad and that's life. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie.
