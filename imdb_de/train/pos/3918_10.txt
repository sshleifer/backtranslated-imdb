Passionate, dramatic, intriguing like the flamenco itself, the movie is just amazing. It is set to the immortal music of Bizet. The original music is written and performed by one of the greatest classical guitarists, the leader of modern flamenco style, Paco de Lucia, who plays a musician of the same name. Legendary flamenco dancer and choreographer Antonio Gades has written the script and choreographed this fabulous version of the famous Georges Bizet / Prosper Mérimée novella / opera. He plays a protagonist Antonio, the famous dancer / choreographer, who is working to retell the history of Carmen in flamenco style, combining dances with song and rhythmic clapping and a highly charged dynamic that appeals to the viewer enormously /> <br /> The brilliant and graceful Cristina Hoyos, whose technical excellence matches the elegant art of her dance, shines in the supporting role. Hoyos was the first dancer in Gades 'company for twenty years (1968-1988), and she was the protagonist of three films Carlos Saura made of Gades' three big shows: "Bodas de Sangre" (1978), "Carmen" (1983) and "El Amor Brujo" (1985). Gorgeous Laura del Sol is a young dancer named Carmen, in which Antony sees at first sight another Carmen immortalized by two Frenchmen, the writer Prosper Mérimée in his most famous novella of 1846, George Bizet's world-famous Opéra-Comique inspired version of 1875. <br /> <br /> As in the opera and novella, Carmen is desirable and deadly in Saura's film, the ultimate femme fatale, which, above all, must be free. She could not tolerate the possessive love of a man and would prefer death to submission. There are about 50 films of history and opera on the screen, and as different as they are, they all share the only tragic end in common. Saura / Gades' film is unique as the most sensual and truly Spanish. I've fallen in love with it since the first time I saw it over twenty years ago, and it's as special and beautiful as it was back then. Highly recommended.
