As a longtime Barbra fan, every post will be biased like this one. Apart from that, this film is considered a classic. It has its faults (highlighted in other postings), but gives a glimpse of a time (late 70s) that will never be there again, and it's fascinating to see the unfold on screen. <br /> <br /> Streisand has fought hard to make this film her own. I do not think she was ever satisfied. But it gives their fans a new Barbra (for the time) with LIVE vocals, a young fresh performance and some very strenuous acting. The story is crude but exciting and holds your interest during. The extended "final" by one frame is hard for most non-Barbra fans to sit through, but speaks volumes to those who admire their talent. <br /> <br />
