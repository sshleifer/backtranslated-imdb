Like his earlier film "In a Glass Cage", Agust√≠ Villaronga achieves an intense and highly poetic canvas that is visually even more refined than its predecessor. This is one of the most visual and haunting images you could ever see. The heightened drama, intensity and undertone of violence threaten melodramatic or farcical, but never invade it. In this way, an almost impossible achievement emerges: so exaggerated and yet so painfully restrained, so charged and yet so unobtrusive, and even the explosives make virtuoso feast for the eyes. Carefree, beautiful and highly tense ... this movie is just great!
