I have not seen this movie for years, so my knowledge is a bit rusty. I remember thinking that this movie is twice as big as Braveheart. It's just more realistic and has more believable characters. Ridb Roy looks like you can imagine Rob Roy wearing plain clothes like messy hair and beard. Also, the Liam Nesson has a Celtic look, he looks like a Scot and above all, he looks like Rob Roy. It's a comparison that upset some people, but compare him to Mel Gibson as William Wallace. Gibson allegedly plays a man whose legend has led him to be called a 6ft 7 giant while Gibson is almost a foot shorter. The story contains a little romance, conspiracy and an underdog story. Does everything sound like Braveheart? But instead of a movie screaming for "freedom," freedom, and nationalism, we get a movie that says honor, love, and justice. This makes the movie more interesting. Similar to Gladiator. The cast is fantastic and Liam Nesson is a very strong leader in this endeavor. The story is great in dealing with heroism and humanity. On the scene where Mary is raped and she walks out of the burning house with a look of true Scottish vigor, she washes the seed out of her crotch in extreme panic. This is something a heroine in Braveheart would never do. Overall, this is a stunning and almost flawless watch. Go and see it!
