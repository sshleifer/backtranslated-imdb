This is one of the funniest shows I have ever seen. It is really refreshing to watch and I was often in stitches. I think there is also a social awareness factor that makes it pretty interesting. If they were white girls, would they get the same reaction? maybe they would, maybe not? The characters know no boundaries (see my lyrics) and exclude anyone from their twisted sense of fun! There are so many funny sketches. My favorite is Bob the Builder. It's so stupid, it's awesome. If you like black comedy, then this is the thing for you. If you would like to keep the bill, this is probably not the case.3 Not Blonde is another funny British BBC comedy screened on TV! It's such a funny show and the characters unleashed by the unsuspecting audience are laughing out loud! It would be impossible to look at the crazy characters and the reactions of the public with a straight face! This series easily contributes to the outstanding comedies that are produced!
