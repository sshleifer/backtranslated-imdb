Why was not this published? I somehow thought that it must be a bit of garbage, because it was not so. How can a girl be wrong! In short, this movie is fascinating. <br /> <br /> You will be amazed. It keeps your attention from the beginning and its pace never slows down. <br /> <br /> The last part of the movie, the "episode" (almost nothing to give away, you can see in the trailer) is also not to be overlooked. You will pick a favorite, you will be shocked, you will not be in the Be able to make a cup of coffee because you have to figure out what's going on. The adrenaline is rising and you can not watch. Cudos to the actors, that's very credible. And it does not stop, they have one last shock for you. <br /> <br /> It also makes you question Reality TV and whether you would watch. And how far away are we really? Endemol (the big brother) made a television show last year in Holland where patients in need of a transplant are offered a dying female kidney. The show ended up being a hoax, supposedly raising awareness of organ donation, but are we getting too close to comfort ourselves?
