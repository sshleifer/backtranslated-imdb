This movie is amazing for several reasons. Harris takes a very awkward documentary and turns it into a relevant social commentary. Groovin 'Gary is a townspeople who (supposedly) is popular because of his many imitations. When he decides to play Olivia Newton John on a local talent show (for which he is very passionate), Gary's actions show that he disagrees with the conservative social environment in which he lives. As a result, he takes various actions for his actions, so people do not believe that he is actually a transvestite or other social outsider. In the second episode Harris uses the fight between Gary and Beaver in an attempt by a beginner to make a narrative from the original documentary. The third and last part of the trilogy is really amazing for Harris's extreme sensitivity to the subject. In contrast to the second episode "The Orkly Kid" shows Gary as a really restless character. He struggles to succeed in his own community without success. His secret passion for dressing like Olivia Newton John distances him even further from the people who already consider him a social outsider. The film is so realistic that, like reality, it lends itself to many reactions. Certainly one can regard Gary as a ridiculously miserable character, but identify himself as an outsider.
