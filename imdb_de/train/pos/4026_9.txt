Pinjar is truly a masterpiece .... A film that makes you think and think, and challenges our culture. It is without a doubt the best Hindi movie I have ever seen. This film should have been shown at film festivals around the world, and I think he would have been a serious contender in Cannes. All characters were perfectly staffed and Urmila Matkondar and Manoj Bhajpai were peppered in their roles. <br /> <br /> The story the film tells about Partition is a very important story that should never be forgotten. <Br /> <br /> It has no prejudices and prejudices and has given the division a human history. Here no country is represented as good or bad. There are evil Indians, evil Pakistanis and good Indians and Pakistanis. The cinematography is excellent and the music is melodic, meaningful and haunting. Everything about the movie was incredible ... and acting took my breath away. All were perfectly staffed.
