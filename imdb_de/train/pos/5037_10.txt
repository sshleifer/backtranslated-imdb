This could be the most underrated film in its genre. I do not remember seeing any ads or advertisements for them, which could be the reason why the box office was not doing so well. Frailty, however, is an excellent and truly original horror movie. I rank it in the top 10 most popular horror movies of my list. <br /> <br /> The film begins with snapshots of photos and news articles telling us about a murderer who calls himself "God's Hand." Then a man comes to a police station and tells the chief officer that he knows the killer is his brother. Two of them go together to a place where victims are buried, which could help solve the case. During this journey, the man tells the story of his brother and we go back to the past when the events began. Fenton and Adam are two young brothers who live together with their strict and religious father. One day he claims to have received a divine message from God inviting him to kill demons that seem to be normal people. He receives from God a list of names of demons to be destroyed and asks his sons to help him in the execution of this divine mission. <br /> <br /> This is an absolutely terrifying and exciting movie that puts you on the verge of your seat. The tension is rising, innocent people (or demons?) are being killed and religious experiences are being questioned. It has no, but few very smart twists in the end. If you like this genre, I recommend Frailty. I own the DVD and she's one of my favorite horror thrillers.
