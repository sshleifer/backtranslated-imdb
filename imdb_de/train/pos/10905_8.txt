In September 2003, 36-year-old Jonny Kennedy died. He had a terrible genetic disorder called Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa (EB) - which meant that his skin literally fell off at the slightest touch, leaving his body covered in tormenting wounds and leading to a final battle against skin cancer. In his last few months, Jonny decided to work with filmmaker Patrick Collerton to document his life and death. The result was a movie that aired for the first time in March and was an uplifting, confusing and provocatively humorous story of a unique man. The film does not shy away from the gruesome reality of EB, but was also a celebration of a life lived to the fullest. Produced and directed by Patrick Collerton and first shown in March 2004, The Boy Whose Skin Off has become the most talked about documentary of the year. It attracted nearly five million viewers, and after the screening, the public donated over half a million pounds to Jonny's charity DEBRA. A Jonny Kennedy Memorial Fund has been set up to raise another half million to ensure that Jonny Kennedy has left a legacy of a million pounds.
