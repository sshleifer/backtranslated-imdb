Yes, a true classic! That's what British drama is all about, realism and the minimal use of special effects (and excessive budgets). I last saw this drama when it was shown on British television in 1994. It should really be viewed by anyone who likes a frightening storyline, not big names, but still great spectacles unknown and as such this big drama is not likely to be aired soon. I recently acquired The Woman In Black on VHS, so I can enjoy this really great British drama again. You should also try and enjoy it! Mark R. Horobin
