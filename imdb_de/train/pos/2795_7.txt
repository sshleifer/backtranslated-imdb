I love playing football and I loved the movie because it contained a lot of football. This was a good Hollywood / Bollywood movie and I'm glad he won 17 awards. Parminder Nagra and Kiera Knightley were good, as was Archie Punjabi. Jonathon Rheyes Meyers played the role of coach. Jazz (Parminder Nagra) loves to play football, but her parents want her to learn how to cook and marry. When Jazz starts secretly playing for a football team, she meets Juliet (Kiera Knightlety) and Joe (Jonathon Rhyes Meyers), who are their coaches. When her parents find it difficult, her father plays the big match at the wedding of her sisters Pinky (Archie Punjabi). In the end, her parents realize how much she loves football and let her go abroad to play.
