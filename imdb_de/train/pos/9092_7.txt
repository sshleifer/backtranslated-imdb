I think that this film contributes to diversity and is very accurate in terms of historical reconstruction. The way in which the various communities depart in Thailand is very interesting ... The Portuguese, the Japanese and the various communities administered by the King. The conspiracies around the square are, as always, a power struggle with much betrayal. The wardrobe is ok. The film is also being filmed locally in Thailand in a reasonable production. The scene with the elephant as executor is very interesting. It's fun, and I think it's also useful in schools for its historical accuracy because it shows that Europeans in Asia were subjects of local kings, who are very different from the traditional Hollywood perspective.
