A typical hubbub through the reality of Cheech and Chong, the drugs, singing, more drugs, cars and driving, more drugs, pee wee, aliens, gas, laundry, stand-up comedy, surprisingly more drugs and SPACE COKE !! It's not as coherent or plausible as Up in Smoke, but it's still incredibly funny to be as unfamiliar as Nice Dreams. There are some classic scenes, including the opening scene where they get gas for their car and drive to work. Funny is also the song of Cheech (Mexican-Americans) and the follow-up song of Chong. Another notable scene is the social bureau scene with Jones (Human Noise Machine) from the Police Academy series and the old laughing man. All in all, this is a great succession of Up in Smoke and can be observed if sober or not. <br /> <br /> celluloid rehab
