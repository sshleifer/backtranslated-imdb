"Moonstruck" is a love story. There is no romance, there are at least three, but they all have to do with the same family. Loretta's family. Loretta (Cher) marries Johnny Cammareri (Danny Aiello). She does not love him, but he is a sweet and good man. When Loretta visits his dying mother in Italy, he meets Johnny's brother Ronny (Nicolas Cage). He and Johnny have not talked for five years and Loretta wants to invite him to the wedding. Of course, they immediately coincide. <br /> <br /> As these stories and love stories of Loretta's parents and uncle and aunt develop, you just have to see for yourself. Everyone seen is delighted to see Cher as a bright star in the middle. She won the Oscar this year and really deserves it. Cage is pretty good and stupid and Olympia Dukakis as mother of Loretta and Vincent Gardenia as her dad are great. This movie is funny, charming and therefore very enjoyable.
