Bette Midler is divine again! Rampant humorous. In love with Burlesque. Can either make you cry with old jokes with new clothes or just old songs with more Power & Punch than ever before. All in all, new ballads are singing, singing good old / perennial songs like "The Rose"; "Stay with me" and yes, even "wind under my wings". The best way to appreciate the divine Miss M has always been love - as this is the next best thing, I recommend everyone with a mix of adult enchantment and appreciation and a mischievous desire by the child to push all boundaries!
