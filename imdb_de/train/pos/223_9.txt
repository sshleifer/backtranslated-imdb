in one of Neil Simon's best games. Crisp, crazy ex-vaudeville stars, played by Walter Matthau and George Burns, are frolicking in a TV comedy special. The problem is that they have not even met in over a decade. Full of nimble one-liners and showbiz jokes, this story flies with a steady sense of humor. Good work also by Richard Benjamin as the hired nephew, Rosetta LeNoire as a nurse and Howard Hesseman as a television director. Steve Allen and Phyllis Diller appear as themselves. Trivia: The opening montage features footage from the 1929 Hollywood Revue featuring Marie Dressler, Bessie Love, Polly Moran, Cliff Edwards, Charles King, Gus Edwards and the singing Brox Sisters.
