This is the best movie I've ever seen in all categories. Forget about Hollywood - their movies are always shitty - that's art! Moon Child's story begins with Kei - a Japanese vampire who loathes what he has become and lives in denial. His desire for definitive death takes him to Mallepa, where refugees from several Asian countries live. Here he meets Sho, an orphan who lives on the street. From here, the film is an intense experience based on the visual and emotional part of the film. It has everything; you laugh, you cry, you get angry, excited, sad, happy ... Never has a movie touched me so much as this movie. And the actors are awesome - I've never heard anyone speak so many languages ​​without it sounding weird. Kudos to the publisher who created this masterpiece ... <br /> <br /> One final commentary on this brilliant film is that it includes Gackt (ex-singer of Malice Mizer) and Hyde (singer of L '). Arc) as a star shows ~ en ~ ciel) in excellent roles as Sho and Kei. I am amazed how Gackt can change his way of speaking and acting according to his age. <br /> <br /> This is a must. If you never watch movies, check out Moon Child, The Crow (Brandon Lee) and the recently released masterpiece Final Fantasy VII - Advent Children. Of course in the original language!
