An uncommonly straightforward actionist cast by a cast and filmed by a director who obviously took the material seriously. Imperfect, as one would expect from a movie that was clearly shot on a tight budget, but incorporating the drama - it's one of those movies that will be repeated on Cinemax 2 or More Max, or whatever they call it anyway 40 minutes blocks if you are to go to work. W / "Deathstalker 2", "Chopping Mall" and "The Assault" recall that Wynorski is a much more talented director than many of his low-budget colleagues who really have the ability to go through a genre movie. if he's actually interested in the material (ie, not watching the Shannon tweed flicks with a 3 or 4 after the title!) actors who have not had much time lately (Mancuso, Ford, even Gary Sandy) (for Chrissakes), it's all put into their best roles of the last few years - as for Grieco he has the right look, though his acting is a bit monotonous - it's clear that his character is supposed to be self-defeating the movie, but Grieco mediates not quite. I checked IMDB and I see that the author also wrote "Sorority House Massacre 2" & "Dinosaur Island" for the director - both minor classics in their own right, but obviously "stupid" Roger Cormon-like cinema - this is more like some The better B-pictures of Jonathan Demme and Jonathan Kaplan from the 70s - they have the exploitation element, but at the same time offer drama - a real step forward. Not "Citizen Kane" and the funny closing moments are a bit annoying, but a well-written, character-driven, above-average direct-to-video actioner. Small achievements like these should not be overlooked as they come by, which is rare enough (as I was reminded when I tried to buy myself through an Albert Pyun monstrosity called "Heatseeker", the "Heatseeker") it just looks - but that's another story!)
