I would like to know why John Amos left the show and how he died out again? I could not relate to everything, but sometimes they came home with the problems. Did they ever make it out of the ghetto? I think the black Jesus episode was my favorite. We have experienced a few good times. something they did not often have. I wish they would bring the show back. During the day, people can stay awake to watch. I do not think a movie or a new show would work. Especially without the original cast. They are really what Good Times did at good times. These are my questions and comments. Thank you!!
