In the areas where they overlap, this fine film is light years ahead of the 2004 Innocence, which gave the impression of a rheumatic eye and a heavy breathing with young girls. Here the effect is much more realistic and really invades the minds of the three protagonists as they move through an adolescence of pitfalls. The three main characters unknown to me give very sure-footed performances. This style is indeed so natural that it will be difficult for them to reproduce this quality of acting in other films if they are not heard again. It would be nice if this could get away from the art houses and the multiplexes, where there is only an external chance to 'talk' to the gum quantity it does not aim at.
