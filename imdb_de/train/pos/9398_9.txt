This is an outstanding, modern film noir ... "excellent" as it is interesting, from beginning to end. There are some holes here and a few dumb spots that make you shake your head in disbelief ... but I did not find anybody who did not get involved in this story. The movie has the right amount of action, excitement, plot changes and interesting characters. In addition, it offers some nice colors and cinematography as well as a good guitar sound. <br /> <br /> I have called this thriller "Film Noir" because it is dirty and all characters are not good. Even the only supposedly good guy, played by Nicholas Cage, gets into trouble through lies and has a quick fix he should not have. He also does something in the end, which is not right, but I will not spoil it by saying. Suffice to say, the rest of the characters are so bad that they make Cage look good! <br /> <br /> Speaking of "bad guys": Does anyone better than Dennis Hopper? Not many. At least in the "crazy" category he is hard to beat. Lara Flynn Boyle is fun for many reasons. J.T. Walsh also offers another great supportive achievement. <br /> <br /> This is one of the films that never got much advertising, but it should have. You will have a lot of fun watching. By the way, try to say the name of this movie three times quickly without screwing it up!
