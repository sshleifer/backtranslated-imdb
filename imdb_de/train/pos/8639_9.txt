I have to start with the apology because I thought the first 75-80% of this movie was hilarious. It's mainly because of the performance of Brad Pitt. Spot on. <br /> <br /> The acting of all involved was pretty good, but Brad stole the movie. The atmosphere was perfect in every way. I'm not a big Pitt fan, but this must be one of his best roles ever. <br /> <br /> Brutal, Honest, Gritty. All good words to describe this movie. <br /> <br /> I read a previous review and the person said that the reasons for Early's violence are not explained. It's explained, but luckily they do not have to go into the graphics to get their point. <br /> <br /> All in all, I've given this 9 a 9 because every scene was 1 or 2 effective. I think the humor in the first half is perfect for this movie. underrated
