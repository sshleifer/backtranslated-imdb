I rated it with 8 stars. Although the story had fallen behind to 3/4 of the image, but the performances remained consistently strong. "Men of Honor" was understandably changed by "Navy Diver". Anyone who has served in any branch of the armed forces will likely think that "honor" is a suitable word for the title.
