I'm so glad I saw this video in the store. I was looking for some happy movies, and this turned out to be a real gem. I loved that the movie, a kind of love story, was not about a nice twenty something. It is more like a story of some beautiful sixties, who used to be twenty. It's a good, well written and wonderfully played story with great WWII band music. For Scottish castle lovers there is a wonderful surprise. It made me smile and wanted to see it again, which I had done a few more times before I gave it up.
