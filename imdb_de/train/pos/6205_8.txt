Fay Grim is confused, annoying and implausible. It's hard to get away with it, but Parker Posey is really the only actress who can take this story with her. She is touching, funny and smart. The supporting actors also commit to it. <br /> <br /> I will not even try to explain the plot to you. These are characters from Hartley's Henry Fool, trying to tell a story of international espionage. <br /> <br /> The movie works well if you continue to understand. completely ridiculous in a sense. It gets more and more ridiculous when you join in. (I resisted the temptation to turn off the DVD twice.) Fay Grim requires an adventurous moviegoer willing to engage in something that is not a cookie cutter. In the end, it offers something that contradicts a description.
