This film and its successor, Barry Mckenzie, claims they are the two biggest comedies ever produced. A great story that a young Aussie guy travels to England to claim his legacy and meets with his comrades, who are just as adorable and innocent as he is. where else could you find someone who needs such a drink that he is as dry as a thing made of dead dingoes? great characters, first-class acting, and there are great Sheila's and more Foster's consumption than all three other films together. First class. <br /> <br /> And some of the funniest songs you'll ever hear, and it's full of great celebrities. In any case, my two favorite movies of all time, I look at them at least every two weeks.
