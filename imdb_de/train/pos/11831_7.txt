Despite great and breathtaking animations, this is probably one of the least interesting Disney movies I've ever seen, and I do not often pop Disney movies. Spirit is a wild stallion who is constantly being captured, either by the cavalry or by Indians who are both trying to "break" him. The mind connects with the Indian and that, in short, is history. With the exception of the beautiful animation of the horses, neither I nor my five-year-old were very inspired or enthusiastic about this film. It is ironic that it is called "Spirit" because Spirit could have used this movie a little more. An additional point was for the soundtrack, which was very pleasant with songs by Bryan Adams and Hans Zimmer. And although this movie is rated G, you probably still need to explain what "breaking a horse" means to your five-year-old. I have. <br /> <br />
