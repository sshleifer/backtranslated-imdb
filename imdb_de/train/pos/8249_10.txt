My goodness. This movie really shows the talents of the actors. Billy Connelly bends his protective muscle. Really an amazing man, if you consider him in absolution as a rebel, Boondock Saints as a madman / murderer, and finally in Fido as a zombie! His character in Fido looks cute to scary, absolutely fabulous! Cariie Ann Moss is not a hack either! Career in the career of Matrix and Momento as a darker character, to a heartwarming conservative housewife of the 50s! Rarely seen in these days, that actors can not act as type-appropriate. <br /> <br /> Now to action (no spoilers, no worries). This movie would make Max Brooks (author of Zombie Survival Guide & World War Z) happy! Finally a successful variant of zombies and comedy. <br /> <br /> If you like zombies, if you do not like zombies, if you are just bored or if you are too busy, watch this movie!
