This is like "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" in a surreal fantasy environment with incredible special effects and computer-generated images that would shame Industrial Light and Magic. The plot may be hard to follow, but that's the way to translate Chinese folklore onto the screen. Certainly the entire story would probably be more familiar to the domestic audience. However, an intelligent person should be able to keep up. In addition, the potency of martial arts scenes is enhanced by the breathtaking CGI.
