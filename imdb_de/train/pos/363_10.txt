This movie is about development. People are growing and people are fading, surprising and disappointing. It has everything and much more. There is hope, frustration, injustice, justice, love and hate. It's really a classic drama with fantastic performances of the entire cast, but especially Whoopi Goldberg in her debut. <br /> <br /> In this film, I felt very human and proud of it, and I suggest that this film should be mandatory every Saturday in all the prisons of the world - it touches your compassion. Rating: 10 out of 10. <br /> <br /> PS: I admit it: I shed a happy tear during the final scene.
