and possibly the Dickens plot next. Although it's hard for me to watch the young Ebenezer (whose idea was that the old hair would be better than that!), Scott does an incredible job as a Scrooge. His delivery of some lines from Dickens has brought it to life for me. Edward Woodward is everything we expect from Ghost of Christmas. I find G.C. Scott's Scrooge is much more of a credible miser than the more recent version of Patrick Stewart. The scene of Christmas Morning, where Scrooge finds he has not "overlooked", is enough to convince Scott that he knows how to act against exaggerated acts. He is phenomenal here. Almost the entire cast is incredible. Little Tim in this version of The Christmas Carol is a little hard to look at, almost too sweet. Nevertheless, the music and the landscape make every holiday a must. Enjoy!
