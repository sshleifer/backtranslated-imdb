The snobs and pseudo experts consider it "far from De Sica's best". Those who suffer from serious lack of innocence will find a problem related to this masterpiece. De Sica spoke very directly. His Italian does not have the complicated self-examination of modern Italian filmmakers or the bitter self-parody of Pietro Germi, the sharp bittersweet of Mario Monicelli, the solemnity of Visconti or the cold observation of Antonioni. De Sica told us the stories like a father sitting on the edge of his children's bed before they went to sleep. There is no attempt at intellectualization. Miracolo A Milano and to a lesser extent Il Giudizio Universale are realistic fairy tales, or what we call magical realism today. The film is a jewel from beginning to end and Toto is the kind of character you accept with an open heart, but of course that requires having a heart. Cinema in its purest form. Great
