SPOILERS INSIDE <br /> <br /> It seems that Trotta, with the balance between personal story and story of events, is much more relaxed than in her previous film Promise, The (1995) /> <br /> The direction seemed to be meticulous Being visually controlled, I found it very appealing - especially when it came to visual narration (the title sequence mix and the lighting of a new candle in modern times reminiscent of the death of various characters in the past). <br /> <br /> To clarify two points that confused many people: <br /> <br /> First, Lena did not sleep with Goebbels. Although this seemed to be implied, it was not the intention. Trotta told me herself! (And by the way, she is a very nice lady!) Second, the timing of the events was indeed historically accurate (the actual dates are shown in the close-up of the memorial). and the prisoners were released as suddenly as in the movie. There are indications that Goebbels was annoyed that he had done so and intended to recapture the volunteers. <br /> <br /> Overall, what impressed me the most is that this is an original story of a "moving" era. It seems a shame that it took so long (for a variety of reasons) for this movie to reach our screens. <br /> <br /> More please Margarethe!
