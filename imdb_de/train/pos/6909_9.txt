... and if you are very, very good, it will look like Moon Over Parador. <br /> <br /> This movie had a bit of a stupid story, but at least it was a fantasy and the casting and the acting very precise! Dreyfuss was perfect as an actor / cheater, full of all the little neuroses and vanities that one imagines as an actor. You get an idea of ​​what actors look like behind the scenes. <br /> <br /> This was one of Dreyfuss's best roles, just as his character has his best role as a dead dictator! And the farewell scene: like from Casablanca! <br /> <br /> Raul Julia was outstanding as a Paradorian head of the secret police. He gets some really funny lines, some of which are homage to other movies, like "Round the usual suspects!" <br /> <br /> And Sonia Braga was excellent as a friend - in addition to a really hot number: "You should get an Oscar tonight!" <br /> <br /> Let's not forget Johnny Winters as CIA agents and the various guest stars: Sammy Davis Jr., Ike Pappas, Dick Cavett - all done perfectly. <br /> <br /> All in all an unforgettable move under the Paradorian moon. <br /> <br /> -R.
