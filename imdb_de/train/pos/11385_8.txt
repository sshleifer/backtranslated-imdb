This is your typical happy and colorful MGM musical from the early 50's, and it's definitely one of the better ones you can see here. <br /> <br /> The film was directed by the genre-expert Vincente Minnelli and the stars Gene Kelly the main lead Both of them had already made a couple of films back then, the best known of which. <br /> <br /> The film itself has actually won the Best Picture Oscar during the year, which means that he has made films like "A Place in the Sun", "A Streetcar Desire", "The African Queen "hit", "Quo Vadis", "The Blue Veil", "Death of a Vendor" this year - a real achievement, but at the same time a bit too much recognition for this sexy, bright and entertaining movie. <br /> < br /> If you watch this movie, you will certainly be entertained by everything, which is the case, thanks to the film, it is very beautiful and the many beautiful characters in this movie.The musical numbers are also all well done, which is not a big one Surprise is when you have people like Vincente Minnelli and Gene Kelly at work. <br /> <br /> But really not that not everything that's been told in this movie was halved for half an hour or so? we already know where the movie is going, but he creates e s to extend everything as long as possible. It's not that the movie is drawn in any area, but just a little too long. The film could definitely have been made with a few less pieces of music. <br /> <br /> One of the better MGM musicals, but not without its flaws. <br /> <br /> 8/10
