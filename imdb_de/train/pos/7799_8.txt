Very slow, but complicated structured and ultimately very touching. A beautiful, very realistic view of a small beach town in Florida in the middle of winter - I was there and that is absolutely accurate. <br /> <br /> It's also the debut of actress Ashley Judd, and she makes a big impact here. It's hard to believe this film is 12 years old - I remember seeing it in the cinemas and I recently rented "Ruby". Apart from the 80s-looking clothes, it has held up very well. Ashely is so radiant and touching that it's hard to think about her later career without flinching. Boy, talk about not fulfilling your early promise! Anyone who sees Ashley here in "Ruby In Paradise" would assume that this elegant, natural beauty has led to all sorts of interesting art films and serious acting - instead, she has become the "go to go" girl for stupid action movies and slasher movies. Movies! Very disappointing, but at least we have received this nice achievement to present her early promise. <br /> <br /> As other commentators say, this is not for everyone as it is very slow. This is not an action movie nor a romance. The director (Victor Nunez, "Ulees Gold", another excellent character study) treats the life of this ordinary young woman with deep respect and lets her story build slowly and with much detail. In that way, I think that this is one of the most moving and respectful stories about growing up young women I can remember - it's not about Ruby's sexual awakening or "how she lost her virginity," it's about hers Life decisions and their growing maturity. <br /> <br /> A nice movie, if you take the time to look at it ... I think it would be a really excellent movie to show teenagers and young girls (or boys). and give them the opportunity to think about and discuss it. <br /> <br /> Special thanks to director Nunez, who also wrote the script, which is so realistic and rich in detail that I could assume the whole movie is based in a female novel or in memoirs, but in Reality is the work of Mr. Nunez. Rated 8 out of 10.
