this movie takes you in the early minutes and holds you to the end. It has a very humane history and very good selected music. The acting of Moritz Bleibtreu (Giancarlo Amato) and Barnaby Metschurat (Gigi Amato) is satisfactory. Recommended for people who are bored with action movies and want to watch a good movie.
