A bizarre and brilliant combination of talent between the director, Robert Siodmak, and Ella Raines as a secretary trying to rescue her boss from the electric chair by tracking down a mysterious "phantom" woman, and Franchot Tone as a crazy and murderous sculptor. There are also some intriguing minor parts played by Elisha Cook Jr as drummer from the drug, as well as the other characters that make up the plot. If you're used to seeing Raines in healthier places, she may overboard here, especially in her scenes with Cook. Franchot Tone also plays a very different person, and although this does not play a convincing role, he seems phenomenal. While the conspiracy is too thoughtful, the movie has a real atmosphere and is very interesting.
