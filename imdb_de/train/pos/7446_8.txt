I can not agree with any of the comments. The first time I saw the movie on a British TV channel, it was presented as an indie movie, and if you look at it from that angle, I think that's a different story. I could not believe what I saw and became addicted immediately. The plot may be as bad as the show of a JS (ie there is no plot), but the drama is evil, it's weird and, all in all, an incredible trash movie. <br /> <br /> It says so much about America, like a Bully or a Ken Park, without the perspective of the drama, but it does give a glimpse into American society, and more specifically, what the television viewers in America are doing in the afternoon ( and I think there are enough of them!) are interested in it. After all, we talk about the neighbors, right? <br /> <br /> 100% fun!
