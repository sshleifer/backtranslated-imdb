OK. This is a favorite since I was 14 years old. Granted, I do not see it several times a year, but ... This is not a movie for an older generation that wants to have a deeper meaning or a brilliant message. This movie is fun. It's pretty old-fashioned, it almost fits, but Parker Posey is so brilliant it's unbelievable. If you're looking for a 90s breakfast at Tiffany's, 90s raves or Parker fans, this movie is for you. Otherwise, do not bother.
