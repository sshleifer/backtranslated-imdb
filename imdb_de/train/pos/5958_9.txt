Unlike some comments, mine is positive. This movie runs around the dining table with a group of friends. Some like you, others do not. Some are related - mother, daughter, son. Their stories are not a smooth, happy with all and all life forms - just like in real life. Some storylines do not develop, they just happen. But like real families and good friends, they stay together. The expectant parents who buy a baby are such holes! They are happy for the end. Poor Delmar is stuck between a rock and a boulder caring for herself, her mother, and her son, trying to keep his whole life together. This does not end with a walk at sunset or a house in the suburbs and all live in a dream world, but is a very real representation of the people who live day by day, month by month. All in all, this is a good story and a great movie !!
