This movie has a very good performance with almost all actors, a gripping story with a refreshing ending, great music and excellent visuals without any special effects. It's interesting to note that, as with so many science fiction films, his predictions for the future will not appear as likely as it is presented. That does not mean that we're not out of the forest yet, but by 2022 it's obviously too early to be in that state. It shares this failure with a rather illustrious list of sci-fi classics: "1984", "2001: A Space Odyssey" (compare their space station with our International Space Station) and Isaac Asimov's "I Robot" (positronic brains were invented In the 1990s).
