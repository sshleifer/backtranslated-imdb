These movie stars Emily Watson of Breaking the Waves fame. This movie about a man's obsession plays in a resort where a chess tournament takes place. A chess master arrives and soon falls in love (at first sight) with a woman played by Emily Watson. She falls in love with this spinner of a man obsessed with chess. This is all to the horror of her mother, who is much more interested in meeting her with another young gentleman; a real gentleman. Her mother feels that this is just a passing pleasure for the young woman. What follows is mostly a journey through the psyche of the man. It tells the story of how his past is closely linked to his presence. Emily Watson is great and the actor who plays the main character. It is definitely slow, but worth the reputation. The end was even satisfying. :)
