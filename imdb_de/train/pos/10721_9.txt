This is one of the most guilty entertainment films ever! <br /> <br /> I'm ashamed to say that my favorite character is TABLE, but I still enjoy it when she likes her space outfit "like super cool" with a "totally" bitchin 'belt and sticking with rhinestones on her face. <br /> <br /> But the film is actually one of the few "family movies" that arouse your interest, I know that the beginning tugs, especially if you know what's going to happen, but the second Half is probably one of the most nerve-wracking segments in a family movie, I would not stand up in front of millions of people and proclaim I love this movie, in fact it's pretty embarrassing to rent it, but I admit it to the internet here to hide behind it. <br /> <br />
