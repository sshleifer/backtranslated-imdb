If you are not privy to the Gundam world, this is a good starting point. If you're burned out on Star Wars or Star Trek, you'll find here a captivating, realistic sci-fi series that lets you immerse yourself in a complex, emotionally arresting space war drama that marks the border between the "good" and the "bad" men clearly less pronounced. Gundam 0080 focuses on the story of Al Izuruha, a young, naive living boy in a neutral space colony. He spends his days dreaming about Mobile Suits and playing war with his friends. In the course of this series, Al befriends the "enemy" soldier Bernie Wiseman. In the end, little Al learns some hard lessons about the reality of war and the suffering and sacrifice required. <br /> <br /> I loved this OAV series with its cool mecha designs, stories and sympathetic characters. I recommend this series to anyone who likes realistic SF anime or all those who think of anime, just stupid or sexy entertainment.
