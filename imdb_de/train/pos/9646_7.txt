There are certainly emotions between the two main characters as they explore their relationship - one that relies primarily on physical attraction from the beginning. There are also emotions in the inner contexts of Mathieu's family that deal with his mother's problems - and how this affects their relationship. But the problem is that many things go unanswered (unless I'm just too stupid to pick them up). Why is Mathieu in a mental hospital? What led to the separation of the boys? And the flashback between the present and the past is a bit difficult to follow. It seems that the main reason for lending this movie is homoerotic experiences or male nudity. But as a love story or character study it is missing and unsatisfactory.
