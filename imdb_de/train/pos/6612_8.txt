Just as Final Fantasy CG has taken it to a whole new level, this is a rebirth for motion detection. Neither film nor cartoon, this movie looks like a tribute to Film Noir, Akira, Sin City, Blade Runner and the new generation of European cartoonists. You see Paris the way it could be, the characters are as real as you and me. They blink, stumble, tremble like real actors in a way that has never been achieved before, hoping to find a thought twister. You will probably find out before you reach the movie halfway. The scenario is certainly too simple compared to known thrillers, but this is undoubtedly a feast for the eyes.
