As a fan of insight into the phenomenon of school shooting, this film was presented in an interesting and different way. Presented as a series of video footage taken by the two disturbed men (I can not refer to people who kill as boys or teenagers). The months of preparation that lead to a zero-day (the codename for the day they will attack) try to show the film the situation from the other end of the weapon. It seems to be the intention to portray the pain they suffer from, but focuses on the literal preparation. The problem is that in terms of emotion, there is little direct delivery. The only point where the emotions became overwhelming was, as expected, the end. But up to this point, it's never clear why they're planning this. We are told the compulsory story that they were ridiculed, but the film seems to contradict that as well. Without ruining the film, it's easy to say that it was a great attempt and had equally great intentions, but was neglected due to the sloppy filmmaking. All director is amateur to promote the homemade video concept, but the story and continuity is weak. The film seems to want the audience to decide a lot, but does not provide the information for such an event. The ending is abrupt and does not feel like it finishes everything the movie started.
