In my opinion, this must be one of Barbara Stanwyck's best achievements. She was one of the few actors back then that could say more than a whole page of dialogue at a single glance. I was lucky enough to see the original and uncensored film with an additional 4 minutes of additional footage. Too bad that the movie is so short. Lily is a young woman who barely holds together and works for her father in his illegal way of speaking. Her only connection to anything is her good friend Chico, who is wonderfully played by Theresa Harris. Although Chico is African-American (and a white woman with a black woman in her thirties was best friends, was as controversial as the theme of this film), and Lily is not, but they have a special bond. And it is not sexual. Only two women were or were in a situation beyond their control. After Lily's dad dies and she does not know what she's going to do, she's told she has the power to come out and get what she wants. Yes, it's immoral, but that's the whole point of this movie. Then "they" had to ruin the last few minutes. Until the last minutes of the movie, it's an excellent movie worth seeing. The "lesson" of the film is still as valid today as it was then, and I'm sure it will take 100 years. Women, it's awful what Lily does to get what she wants, but it works. Men, take note.
