"SÃ¥ som i skyen" .. as above so below ... this very special point where divine and human meet. I love this movie! A gem. YES amazing grace! <br /> <br /> I was so touched by its very HUMAN quality. I laughed and cried through a whole register, indeed several octaves of emotions. <br /> <br /> Mikael Nyqvist is BRILLIANT as Daniel, a world class passionate performer, charismatic and powerful. His inner light and his extraordinary talent radiate in every scene, in every interaction, in every meeting. I was totally fascinated, enchanted and caught up with the story that is our collective story, the story of life itself. <br /> <br /> The film also contained many archetypes, Messiahs, wounded children, magical children, artists, teachers Priest, perpetrator, abused, victim, tyrant, divine fool - ALL such real and life-like characters - all awakened in me great fondness and compassion. <br /> <br /> It is a real pleasure to provoke such an idea, but it is a very entertaining and entertaining movie. Oh, I must not forget the angelic choir of the angels and the breathtakingly beautiful sound. <br /> <br /> THANK YOU EVERYTHING - This Swedish film will fascinate people all over the world. BRILLANT!
