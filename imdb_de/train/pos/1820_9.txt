I remember this movie when I was a little kid. I loved him then and still do. I got it on DVD for my 18th birthday and was overjoyed because I had previously found it so hard to find it and it had only been rented when I was younger. My favorite character is Charlie, because he learns to be a good dog. The movie is full of funny songs and music. The animation is brilliant and the character voices are perfect. This movie has always been a tear-jerker to me, but I think if I had not seen the movie when I was little I would not find it as brilliant and intriguing as I am, though I still think I still love it because I'm really into animated movies.
