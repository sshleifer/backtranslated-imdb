Love the characters and the plot. Very funny with a lot of action. Thomas Ian Griffith and Tia Carrer are doing great things. I enjoyed the dynamic and funny interaction between Griffith and Career. Donald Southerland plays a very sympathetic and surprisingly likeable, burned out Hitman. All three actors are among my favorites and have made them in this movie for a special treat. A nice addition to my extensive DVD collection. I highly recommend this movie. If you want ... Mr. and Mrs. Smith, The Replacement Killers, Confidential, A.A., The Long Kiss Goodnight, The Abyss and The Whole Nine Yards ... you will love this movie.
