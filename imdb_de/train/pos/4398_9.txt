When I heard that this movie was directed by Ang Lee, I absolutely saw him. The Taiwanese director became famous a few years ago with "The Wedding Banquet" and "Eat Drink Man Woman" and then switched to "Sense and Sensibility" and "The Ice Storm". Now he turns to another American icon - the Civil War. <br /> <br /> This story takes place in Missouri, a Union state with southern sympathies. These have never officially joined the Confederation Army. Instead, they formed outlaw bands called "Bushwhackers", grew hairless and sometimes confiscated Union uniforms that they wore over their normal clothing. <br /> <br /> The film shows their moral dilemma of killing the high drama of the times and their supposedly heroic missions, storers and farmers who helped the Union. There are no stars in this film, unless you consider "Jewel" as a singer, starring as a young allied widow. <br /> <br /> Tobey Macquire is cast as a young German peasant boy, for whom it is mocked his heritage, because the Germans allegedly were sympathizers of the Union. This young man is an outstanding actor, full of young, fresh faces whose performance encompasses his miracle and his subtle insights, exposed to the horrors of war. Jeffrey Wright is a liberated slave who travels with the Bushmen to his loyalty to the young man who bought him his freedom. He gives a fine and unobtrusive performance. <br /> <br /> However, some of the plays are made of wood, especially in the lengthy conversations they make about morality. And her costumes are too new. The "southern gentleman" theme of manners and hats and politeness towards women seems a bit too much - especially because they are committed to killing all the men who pull them from the arms of their wives and burn down the shops and houses. <br /> <br /> Although I do not think this will be one of the "great" films by Lee Ang, I was fascinated by 140 minutes despite the slow parts and their excessive length. I was interested in what happened next, and felt compassion for each of the characters, all of whom appeared as real and imperfect people hanging in the forces of history. <br /> <br /> Not as much action as the usual war movie, but still recommended - especially for fans of the Civil War. <br /> <br />
