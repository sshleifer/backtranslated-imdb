The beautiful Danish actress Sonja Richter steals this movie under the noses of everyone, not an easy feat given the terrific performances she surrounds. Judge plays Anna, an unemployed, independent person, slightly open-minded neurotic (and maybe suicidal) actress who is looking for a desperate job to take care of a wheelchair-suited, restrained dad named Walentin (the great Danish actor Frits Helmuth, who died shortly after this movie) Age 77 died). <br /> SPOILER ALERT <br /> <br /> Walentin refuses to respond to anyone - until he confronts the gifted Anna, whose whimsical and mischievous nature imposed the poor, old, battered devil on himself Return death sentence. <br /> <br /> The author / director / actor Eric Clausen has made a powerful film about the difficulties that a lumbering businessman (Jorgen, played by Clausen) loves a father who has never accepted him. The film is about to end, but Clausen has some important things to say about euthanasia, the nature and value of love and care, and how a person, undisturbed Anna, can change the course of a human life. Highly recommended. The performance of Sonja Richter alone is worth the price.
