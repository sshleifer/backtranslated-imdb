I saw it ages ago, when I was younger and never remembered the title, until one day I flipped through IMDb's John Croy's movie credits and noticed an entry titled "Once Upon a Crime ...". Something was ringing and I clicked on it, and after reading the plot summary it brought back a lot of memories. <br /> <br /> I've found that it has aged quite a bit, although none of it means a "big" comedy. However, it is quite enjoyable and is a good reef on a Hitchcock formula of false identity and worldwide thrill. <br /> <br /> The film has many characters, including an American couple who finds a female dog during their holiday in Europe and decides to return it to them for a reward - just about their dead body on arrival Find. From then on, the plot gets crazier and darker and they go on the run after the police took them for the killers. <br /> <br /> A mix of "It's Mad Mad Mad Mad World" and a Lighter Hitchcock Feature This was led by Eugene Levy and he managed to get some of his good friends - like John Candy - into it to play. The film is usually captivating due to its cast and the ending has a fun little twist that is not totally unpredictable, but also unexpected.
