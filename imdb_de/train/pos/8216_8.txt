*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** Dirty Harry seems to have taken a step backwards after two such trips ("Magnum Force" and "The Enforcer") in "Sudden Impact" Charisma by Clint Eastwood, who also directed, and a story that spends just enough time on exposure and reserves its energy for the big scenes. <br /> <br /> By way of exception, the case takes Harry outside his hometown of San Francisco (where he again gets in trouble with his superiors because he first has to "shoot, ask questions later") to the hamlet of San Paulo. (WARNING: Potential Corrupter) A group of Lowlifes are each cruelly murdered by a woman who has raped her for years and whose sister has been in a state of catatonia since the attack. <br /> <br /> The murderer is portrayed by Sondra Locke and she does Figure of Jennifer Spencer to an interesting mix of compassion and cold-bloodedness. Locke's cold eyes and chilly voice, either trying to console her hospitalized sister or to take revenge on the rapists, are very effective at painting a portrait of a woman who has done wrong and whose years of suffering and rage are now deadly fruit begins to wear. The rapists are a despicable crowd, especially the leader who practically put a "psycho nut job" on his forehead, and a lesbian who, despite her anatomical inability to be one of the boys, seems to be almost one of the boys. While the Flashback scenes are not graphically explicit, they are nightmarish enough and clearly aimed at getting Jennifer to kill her attackers. Some will dismiss "Sudden Impact" as a trash: manipulative revenge story. At a certain level this is true, but it is well made garbage. What is beneficial to the film is the power of the Sondra Locke performance, which gives us a complex figure whose wounds are more visible in her images than in her gestures or speech. What we have here is an action movie with a point of view. <br /> <br /> You can accept or let the idea that some wrong is punished by all means, but the mystery behind the murders becomes clear. For Harry (a knowledge that is wisely not explained in dialogue), it becomes him offered the choice - which is to do with a murderer, with whose motivation he can sympathize, whose behavior he is obliged by law, however, not to tolerate. This makes the story more interesting than the usual Dirty Harry offer. <br /> <br /> The other redeeming quality of the movie is the Eastwood direction. After all, this is a Dirty Harry movie, and Eastwood knows the character better than anyone else. The film is staged with style and humor and edited so that the action scenes pay off heavily. Some of the best "Harry Moments" in the entire series are here, including Harry's most well-known line, "Come on - make my day." Courage for his conviction to present a story about a heinous crime and the resulting brutal consequences. It's also an exciting detective story, well done and well told. And it's certainly never boring. By these criteria succeeds enormously.
