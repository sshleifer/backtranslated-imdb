This movie could be one of the most underrated movies in Bollywood history. This blockbuster from 1994 had good performances, music and directing. The people there played the song "Ooe Amma" on their loudspeakers at the highest volume. If someone who likes Some Like It Hot and drooling wants to sing about Marilyn Monroe, then he should watch this movie. It goes on Govinda with films like this Indian comedy could never be dead.
