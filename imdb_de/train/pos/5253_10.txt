I really do not understand why people get so mad and wave this movie! Remember, people, this is an SNL movie, not everything that should be unpredictable and original in the plot or direction! The Ladies Man is a funny movie, albeit sometimes stupid, with a crazy cast and, as usual, Werryfull's performances by Will Ferrel and Tim Meadows. Yes, some of the jokes are stupid, and yes, the characters are incredible, but their comedy! I really do not understand that someone could not laugh much during this fun movie. Anyway, I'm just asking people to take it the way it is - a SNL, stupid and irreverent comedy. Nothing that will win prizes, but still a modern comedy gold. "10-4 apricot!"
