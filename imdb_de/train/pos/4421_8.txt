Gojoe is part of a new wave of Japanese cinema. He takes very creative directors, editors and photographers and works on historical topics, what the Japanese call "historical pieces". Gojoe is extremely creative in terms of color, photography and editing. Brilliant, even. The new wave of Japanese samurai films allows a glimpse into the traditional beliefs of shamanism, demons and occult powers that were certainly part of their ancient culture, but were not really explored in Kurosawa's Samurai epics or the Zaitochi series. Another good example of this genre is Onmyoji (2001). I would call director Sogo Ichii one of the most interesting and creative Japanese directors of the new wave. Other pieces from the Japanese period that I highly recommend are Yomada's Twilight Samurai (2002) and Shintaro Katsu's Zatoichi: The Blind Swordsman (2003).
