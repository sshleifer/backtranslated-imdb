OK, I just overestimated it to make up for at least one of those grumpy reviews. But I enjoyed it. I did not laugh out loud, but it kept my interest and pulled me along without ever dropping me off. The story is built. Yes, you knew it would have a happy ending - this genre always has it. By now it was a little weird and there were visible gags you might miss. Stiller and Black provided expertly again. Great team. They should work more together. I do not know that it will be a cult classic, but it was definitely a fun ride. Not as good as BOB or DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS, but what is it? It still pays to go out of your way to watch this movie.
