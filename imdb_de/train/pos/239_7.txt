I saw that with my girlfriend in the cinema and I can say that I did not have the best time, mainly because I did not know anything about Ned Kelly or his story. <br /> <br /> But since then is a biopic, it is important to know at least what is to be expected of the figure. <br /> <br /> I do not know if the way the events are told is true or if everything is fictional. But as Ned Kelly is portrayed as a hero and a fighter for justice, it really makes me believe that everything is true. I do not think he's portrayed as a redneck criminal or thief, but that's just my opinion. <br /> <br /> This is a solid western movie for every taste. Heath Ledger is as always great and the sexy Naomi Watts charms the screen. <br /> <br /> Give this movie a chance when it is being broadcast via cable. Otherwise, I do not think I could recommend it.
