That's what one of the girls said in the end. <br /> <br /> Is the football game a metaphor for a qualifier between the girls (or more generally a free-thinking group) and the authority? "To Germany" means into a future with hope? <br /> <br /> It's one of the most memorable cinematic experiences I've ever had - despite the raw cinematography and plot and the mild over-function (though I like the cast - they are adorable and high up the expectation for amateurs). The ridiculous situation is well recorded. I can feel the deep frustration of a game failing (female and football fan), and I can not stop thinking about how to make a compelling disguise. I wonder why there is no women's section where protection from dirty language and bad behavior can be offered - by defeating the flawed grounds for denial. <br /> <br /> The film is very clever - the amazing title, the actual game's shooting, the spontaneity and various ways to put the viewer in the shoes of the characters - the game is so important, though unattainable (not shown), the enticing light and the cheering sound of the stadium, the limitation of the van and the uselessness of it, when the people inside connect with the celebrating crowds. I can feel the comfort of the radio, the drinks and the food and of course the friendliness and consideration of each character for others. During the credits, I am amused that no character has a name - he is just some "soldier" and she is just a "girl" or "sister".
