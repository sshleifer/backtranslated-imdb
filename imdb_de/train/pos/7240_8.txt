When I found this movie in my local video store, I expected it to be another cheesy American vampire movie that's in the same line as "The Lost Boys" (1987). To my surprise, "To Die for" is a really good movie. Sometimes a bit cheesy, but still there are enough stylish set pieces and surprises to satisfy vampire lovers. This is a perfect mix of romance and horror, which is sometimes surprisingly bloody. We recommend.
