I was fortunate enough to see this last night (October 20) at a preliminary visit, and I was incredibly surprised by the wonderful plot and really hearty acting. <br /> <br /> Even though the plot is not particularly complicated, the story unfolds in a way that feels fresh, unique and unmistakable. It's not something that compares easily to films of the past, it's a unique approach to a kind of depressive middle-aged love story. <br /> <br /> I was particularly impressed by the casting of the film. Except for the last extra in the family, it was a beautiful and talented cast. The three daughters did a wonderful job, the talent was evenly distributed between them and none of them "outshone" the other two. <br /> <br /> It really was a delightful movie that is suitable for all ages and makes you laugh loud, funny and at the same time very touching and heartwarming. It was a wonderful break from the sex jokes and nudity of recent movies.
