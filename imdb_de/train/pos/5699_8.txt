One of the most disturbing and tragic periods of American history began. The members of the Summer of Love culture were old at the end of the seventies and the beginning of the eighties for love beads and all night celebrations, and they developed back into mainstream life, whatever that meant. For those who could not develop their youthful and sometimes irrational exuberance, this was the culture of Wonderland. A love of drugs and a sense of entitlement coupled with an aversion to authority, values ​​and "the establishment" is the world the film captures. <br /> <br /> The sixties were a time of revolution and violent change that tore apart the American "house". After the battles, we all had to deal with the consequences of the carnage. The figures in the Wonderland house are icons of the outsiders of the seventies. Part biker, part hippie, part crook, all outcasts. No ideology to express, just a sense of dissatisfaction with everything and fidelity to nothing. Ron, Billy and David introduce themselves as a kind of Robin Hood with Dope. They speak of love and behave violently; They take from the rich and sell themselves to the deformed. They steal from everyone. <br /> <br /> Holmes and his company are the culmination of a strange collision of antimatter like sex and drugs and rock and roll as lab technicians get bored and moving. <br /> <br /> The film is skilfully staged and timed, capturing the frenetic world of drug addicts in its element. The fact that Holmes is a pornstar is almost irrelevant. This story was told in "Boogie Nights". This is a story of a transitional period and an unforgettable time.
