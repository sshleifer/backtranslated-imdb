Despite the excellent trailers for Vanilla Sky, I had expected to be disappointed with the film, as I had heard that it did not receive great reviews. However, I completely admired the cinema for how good Vanilla Sky is. <br /> <br /> There was not a bad drama in the whole movie, every single character is believable. The romantic moments between Cruise's character, David Aames and Cruz's character, Sophia, are extremely realistic and intimate (probably due to the fact that they soon became a real couple). <br /> <br /> The action of Vanilla Sky will confuse you in the last third of the movie, and you have little chance of guessing the end. However, the ends are tied towards the end, so you have a strange mix of feelings that consists of sadness, shock and empathy for David Aames. The movie is intellectual and you have to pay close attention to it. It's not that hard, because chances are good that you'll be completely drawn into the movie and not distract your eyes for a second from the screen. <br /> <br /> I usually leave cinemas and forget about any movie I'm watching. But Vanilla Sky is still in my mind for a long time after I saw it. I recommend it to anyone who wants to switch from simple, flat films.
