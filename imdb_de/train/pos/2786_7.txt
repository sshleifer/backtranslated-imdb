What surprised me most about this movie was the sheer audience. Similar films like Anita and I have never caused so much hype as this movie, though I think this is probably due to the mention of 'Beckham' in the title. If you're determined enough, you can do anything if you're determined enough are. Think about what's good news for anyone watching this movie. I think that's one of Keira Knightley's better films, and I think she's a brilliant actress and great for the role. Parminder Nagra was also brilliant. Unfortunately, I can not say that for Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, because I do not think he was such a good actor, and to be honest, his eyes were a bit scary. <br /> <br /> All in all a brilliant movie and a brilliant story
