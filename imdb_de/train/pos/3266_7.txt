Another downey must be seen! If you are an obsessed fan like me, you have to watch this movie! He plays Alex Finch, a 22-year-old Yale graduate who realizes that the life he's just come to is the life he left 26 years ago. Alex is the reincarnation of Louie Jeffries, a lawyer happily married to Corrine (Cybil Sheppard). Louie is killed on her one-year birthday when he is hit by a car. He calls back, only this time in the body of Alex Finch. Enter Robert Downey Jr., a lot of confusion and a lot of laughter. <br /> <br /> Although this film is 15 years old, one still wonders if there really is such a thing as a reincarnation. And if so, how often do you meet the same souls from life to life? I do not know the answer. But I know you have to watch this movie. It's a riot, and Downey looks so good in a tuxedo. This movie makes you believe in love, and true love never dies. It is only recycled.
