I saw this movie in a preview and was thrilled. It is not a typical romantic comedy. I can not remember laughing so hard at a movie and still being moved. The laughs are not gags here - they are observations, laughter of appreciation, little shocks of "oh my god, I thought I was the only one who felt that way!" I will not betray the plot, which is more than just "Guy falls in love with his brother's girlfriend." The whole family plays a role here. Probably the best mix of laughter and warmth since "While you slept". <br /> <br /> Steve Carell goes much deeper than before and for the first time I really liked him. The cast is amazing, a list of seasoned theater actors I've loved in other roles, but they merge into a compelling family. Dianne Wiest is adorable as a mother, Juliette Binoche is bright and witty (who knew she was funny?), And even the offended Dane Cook gives a warm, calm, touching performance. The soundtrack by Sondre Lerche is a wonderful addition, and I will buy the CD as it becomes available. <br /> <br /> Do not miss these.
