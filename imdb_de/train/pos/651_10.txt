** possible spoilers ** <br /> <br /> I like this movie and have no problem staying awake. It reminds me of 20 at 20, except that it's even better. As Veronica says, two chicks at the same time. It brings out the lust in me, the casual conversation, these two real chicks instead of hookers, who annoy us every step of the way. I'm also in the talks. Even if they are absolutely b.s. so what? Every chick I've ever talked to and put in the first place is usually centered on the same unreasonable, unfounded, selflessly centered b. Philosophy. It's just a bunch of nonsense and about as reasonable as this other bs. Philosophy chicks are often in: astrological cards. The only deal with this movie is that the man is almost as feminine as the woman, he is in the same bs. and moody. The brunette chick is actually the most manly person. <br /> <br /> I think it's weird that the brunette chick is so obviously excited by Veronica. She would like to pull the little blonde away from Alexander, but Veronica plays her all the way. She is brilliant. It makes the brunette think something is in between, and then she steals the boy / man, which is only appropriate because they seem to be from the same age group. The brunette knows she ended up meeting as she drops her face into her palms while Marlene Deitrich sings in the background that there are parabolically a million couples in Paris, but I only have that refrain /> <br / > But do they marry in the end, Alex and Veronica? Mmmm? I can only imagine a super turbulent relationship that ends in a separation before marriage. They are too selfish to be nothing to each other except stepping stones. <br /> <br /> I like the movie, however. It entertained me, it looks good and is sexy.
