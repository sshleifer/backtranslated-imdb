I found this movie exciting from the start - like a Spielberg movie - and found the story intriguing as I tried to figure out the real situation. <br /> <br /> Start - before the opening balance - the action begins and instantly brings tension. <br /> <br /> The two main characters are very personable. (I find it hard to like the Baldwins because of the unscheduled political activities of Alec, but William was not too bad in this movie.) There were some most unexpected twists that led to success. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, there were many places where the soundtrack had an annoying hue - about 19K Hz. I suspect the microphone has video monitors on the monitor.
