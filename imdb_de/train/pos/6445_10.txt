Beyond the excellent direction, production, acting and the predictable drama lies an essential message in the script: <br /> <br /> "Listening all the way" For the voice to flourish, listen to the voice, listen. To approach, listen. To discover the needs of a situation or another, listen. It seems that screenwriters convey a "life secret". Listening leads to a consciousness of your own self. It awakens the other senses, especially seeing and expands the horizon. The soul of Anne can also be discovered. The artistry of this film "As it is in heaven" miraculously showed the unfolding of life, not just its joy and sadness, but ultimately the hope of life. All this through the first instruction of the main character to the choir; <br /> <br /> "Just listen, it leads all the way"
