Fascinatingly exciting. Dramatically. Explosive complex. Epos. Words that only touch the tip of the iceberg, in relation to the great story LOST is told. <br /> <br /> From acting to the rare visual effects, LOST is the indispensable show for science fans on TV - fantasy, fantasy, action, adventure and many, many puzzles. <br /> <br /> Each performer is so well chosen and so good in his roles that you either love him or hate him or I wish you were dead. <br /> <br /> The visual effects, if you used (which is rare) are actually pretty good considering the usual production of shows. Be it the "smoke monster", for the polar bears, LOST is credible in terms of eye candy. <br /> <br /> As far as history is concerned, nothing compares to the enormous complexity of this show that these audiences like the onlookers. From start to finish, continuity is near-perfect, characters are being developed, and those are ever-evolving history slowly gives answers to their questions that so much dream of yearning. For dramatic / science-fiction television, what Arrested Development did for the comedy is what it did: it set the bar. <br /> <br /> I recommend LOST to all who are patient, intellectual and love every moment of the journey. No matter how long it takes to reach the end. <br /> <br /> See this show.
