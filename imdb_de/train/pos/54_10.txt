Home Room is about a Columbine-style high school shoot, but instead of outwitting the event itself, the film shows the consequences and what happened to the survivors, their trauma, guilt and denial. Shooting itself is treated as a foregone conclusion, with no action-action except for the reaction of an almost youthful SWAT commando after the high school assassin fired. The film has three protagonists; the detective who investigates the crime, whose culprits are not to blame, and two adolescent girls who survive the incident, is played by a very young Erika Christensen and Busy Philipps. The two girls had nothing in common The filming is therefore put together and the drama arises. <br /> <br /> Erika Christensen, although only 24 years old, is quite familiar with the movie audiences' solid and reliable acting style. The busy Philipps, three years older than Christensen and I totally unknown, have blown me away with their overwhelming dramatic power and screen presence. This girl was the part. <br /> <br /> It's a great movie and it connects you with its intimate focus on the fragile but growing relationship between the two traumatized girls. Although Gus van Sants Elephant (2003) is good, it seems almost superficial and ugly compared to Home Room when it comes to dramatic flair and acting. What I can see, this film has received very little time and exposure - much more a loss for an equally traumatized America. <br /> <br /> Ten out of ten
