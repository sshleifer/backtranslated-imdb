I'm a jerk for such movies. Movies that bring you back and let you experience your childhood. I am now an adult and have many adult responsibilities such as a mortgage, children, dogs, a wife and a lot of others. I enjoy my life, but it's not as innocent and carefree as it was when I was twelve. Mike Binder's Indian Summer knows this and explores it as if he were twelve years old. It takes you back to a time when life was easier and much more fun. It brings you back to a time when you were worried about your first kiss and wondered if you could finish the Camp Marathon. Indian Summer is a fantastic movie that should be seen at least once a year so you can sit back and laugh ... and remember it. <br /> <br /> Movie stars Kevin Pollak, Bill Paxton, Diane Lane and Matt Craven (to name just a few) as childhood friends recalled to Camp Tamakwa by their former camp leader, Uncle Lou , Uncle Lou is played perfectly by Alan Arkin. He is a guy who is the patriarch of the group. He knows everything and includes the true spirit of a father figure and someone who understands the simple things in life. He finds it difficult to deal with today's children who need a walkman who wobbles in their ears when they are in a place of immense beauty like Tamakwa. This is a camp where moose roam the camp, the colors God has given them, and water as far as the eye can see. Uncle Lou longs for the old days and asks his former campers back to the camp to see one of them take over the camp. While they are all together again we can see their difficulties and difficulties and maybe a new love could arise between them. <br /> <br /> When the adults return to the camp, it is not long before they behave like children again, as the typical tricks are played again and again. They take toilet paper from the stalls, put the toothpaste in sleeping bags and so on. All this happens weird and with actors like Pollak and Paxton it's all very funny. <br /> <br /> But aside from the amusement, we can explore some real adult emotions everyone can identify with. In one of my favorite scenes, Kevin Pollak and Elizabeth Perkins overlook a bay where they went canoeing as children. Pollak can not get over how small everything looks, and Perkins finally tells him that the bay has not gotten smaller, just bigger. It does not hammer the point home, but it does it in a subtle way. We all grow up, we move on and unfortunately we can not live as we did 20 years ago. The more things change, the more they stay the same. <br /> <br /> Indian Summer is a character-driven movie beautifully written by Mike Binder, who actually visited Camp Camp Tamakwa (like Sam Raimi, who played Stick in the movie) and it's his loving and vivid memories of his experiences fueling the film. There are many touching scenes and there are also many funny scenes. Both are perfect. <br /> <br /> I love this movie. I love everything about it and it's a true hidden gem. <br /> <br /> 10/10
