A true dark noir movie and a very graphic film, a nice story of a man striving for salvation, who may have left it too late. Visually, there are some really nice scenes that are artistically amazing, which is possible with a minimal budget. Gareth Maxwell Roberts and his team full marks, I look forward to the next project with new ideas, though hopefully more British actors would be great. Lisa Ray looked adorable, she had never seen her and hopes to see her again in the future. Theme all interesting sex, drugs and violence. Bring it on. I would definitely say rent this and check if you are in the mood for a semi-moody Noir.
