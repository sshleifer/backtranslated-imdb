This is a so-called "feel-good cinema", although it somehow saddened me. Why? Because I had the talent, but my parents did not let me study at the sports academy. Also, at the age of 12, I decided to give up football. <br /> <br /> And football is the red line in this movie. Together with the fight, the young people have the expectations of their parents. An English-Indian girl and her parents, with their traditions and strong family ties, and the English family with a daughter dressing like a boy and playing soccer ... a combination that worries her mother! This film also depicts the lives of ordinary people and the Indian community in England. It's about believing in your dreams and living your only life (where did we hear that before). Paraminder Nagra (a beautiful woman!) Plays Yasminda, a girl who is not interested in boys, new clothes, make-up and the typical 17-year-old girl. Unlike her sister Pinky, you complete the opposite of Yasminda. <br /> <br /> A real must see is a young pretty girl fighting with her parents' traditions and finally finding happiness. With great music by Blondie, Curtis Mayfield, Texas, Melanie C, and Indian hit songs. <br /> <br /> Nice to see, but if you've ever played football before and never made it great, then this movie makes you melancholy.
