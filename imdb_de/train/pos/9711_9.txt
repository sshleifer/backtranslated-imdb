Well, I just discovered that there is a show that is more disgusting and shocking than "Little Britain" and I like it! "The League of Gentlemen" is a sick British comedy about the worst, craziest and most disgusting town in Britain. This place makes Dibley and Craggy Island (from "The Vicar of Dibley" and "Father Ted") seem pretty normal !! The format of the show is very similar to that of LITTLE Britain, with the difference that everything revolves around the inhabitants of this one hellish city. Both shows show the same skits over and over again and some obviously inspired "Little Britain" (especially the jobseeker Klassensketch). But the show is different, because although it is as crude as "Little Britain" (not a show for kids), the show has a sick and sadistic quality that sets them apart from all those shows. In particular, animal cruelty and serial murder are recurring themes throughout the show. <br /> <br /> If you have not thought now, this is NOT a show for kids who are slightly offended or normal people, and that's probably why I liked it. However, you really need a very thick skin and a love for the terrible, to enjoy this maximum. Funny and incredibly disrespectful, incredible - you have to see it to believe it.
