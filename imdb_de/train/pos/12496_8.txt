For years, we've been watching every horror movie that comes out, from boring Hollywood retakes like Saw 2, to awesome indie releases that are completely unparalleled. "<br /> <br /> We've made it Seeing this film at Shriekfest 2005. The audience loved it and I think it won the award for the best movie. <br /> <br /> Even if it does not have the budget or the star power of studio movies , it's a scary in the scary atmosphere and the fear.The acting and the cinematography are top notch, but it's the direction this movie is worth.The story and the characters are developing at exactly the right tempo to provide fantastic fear. <br /> <br /> Also, the image editing and visual effects are first-rate, and while many horror films fail to use music to their advantage, the score for "Dark Remains" only adds to that No one was near me, so I can not wait to hear when it finally appears on DVD. Trust me, even if you are fed up with the latest horror movies, give it a try ... you will not regret it!
