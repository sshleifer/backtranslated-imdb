Maybe some people think this is a slow movie. However, it is precisely this "slow burning" that deeply affects the viewer. Like this wonderful first scene: First we can hear the voices; then we can see the characters; Finally, the camera slowly pans back and to one side, and we see another character, a young man who just sits there, apparently not even listening to the conversation, or at least not really interested. The fact that this young man will star in the film demonstrates the strategy of the film: to allow the character to develop and be determined by the environment surrounding it, without, however, mentioning the points more than necessary. People come and go, flow in and out of their lives. Although most of the film follows him (and most of the supporting characters can only be seen when he is close to him and defined according to the relationship with him), we believe that we are objective.
