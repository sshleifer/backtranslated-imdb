When I rented Domino, I was expected to be very stupid. I hate movies that really have eye-catching cuts and cinematography, and Domino has received very poor reviews. The only reason I've seen him is that I liked Keira Knightley, Mickey Rourke, Christopher Walken and Tony Scott on other occasions. I also enjoy it, based on factual adventure stories. Yeah, the cut and the cinematography were hectic, the story was weak and the acting was mediocre, but I still loved this movie for bizarre reasons. Domino was very entertaining and often very funny. It was terribly undervalued when it was released, I think, because everyone more wanted an emotional journey like Scott's last movie, Man on Fire, and instead got just wonderful entertainment. I actually understand why everyone hated Domino so much even though I loved and recommended it.
