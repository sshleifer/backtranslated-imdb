When I see the two brothers interacting and influencing each other throughout the film, I am personally happy to live in rural areas, much like in movies. I have seen this movie countless times and have the book right next to my Bible. After watching the movie, I agree that this is one of the few films that does justice to a book. I warmly recommend anyone who has the opportunity to go fishing in Montana or outdoors. It's amazing I can not imagine anyone else who could play the role better than Brad Pitt. Do justice and watch one of the better films of the modern film era. STRONGLY Recommend And as a guide to fishing trips in Montana and Wyoming, you should not learn how to fly fish from the scenes of the movie, because although he looks good on the movie, you have no idea how much practice and skill fishing is actually going on. Thanks for listening. Please watch this movie if you want a long, sad movie.
