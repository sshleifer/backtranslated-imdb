While I do not consider myself a big fan of fairy tale films, Stardust fascinated me because of the fact that I saw Michelle Pfeiffer as a villain in the trailers (mainly because I wanted to see her as the bossy Velma Von Tussle in Hairspray). Boy, is she so convincingly evil as a witch, especially with her ugly makeup at the beginning and end! Robert De Niro is also great as a pirate captain who has to "hide in the closet" to protect his "reputation"! Almost all actors like Claire Danes, Rupert Everett, Ricky Gervais, Peter O'Toole and many others do a good job here. While Danes and Pfeiffer are classic beauties, there are also stunning faces from Sienna Miller, Olivia Grant (as Girl Bernard) and Kate Magowan, especially when we meet them for the first time. Newcomer Charlie Cox is doing well as lead actor Tristan, and he looked so much like his father Dunstan as a young man that I thought he was in early scenes with Magowan (actually Ben Barnes). Many comments have compared this to the Princess Bride, and although I can see some similarities, the main difference was that PB always knew it was just an imaginary story told by an old man to his grandson. For the most part, Stardust makes you believe that what you see and hear might have happened with all the serenity that goes on all the time. In this sense, I strongly recommended Stardust.
