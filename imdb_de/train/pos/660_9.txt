9 / 10-30 minutes of pure holiday terror. Okay, it's not that scary. But it sure is fun. <br /> <br /> The Crypt Keeper (John Kassir) tells a story of Holiday FEAR, which gives us all the Christmas goose ... GosseBUMPS That's. Bwahahahahha You should be really careful what you are doing for Santa Claus. Have a scary Christmas and a happy new scare. Okay, I stop. <br /> <br /> Okay, in the story, a greedy woman (Best Screamer in the World, Mary Ellen Trainor) kills her husband (Marshall Bell, the trainer who gets beaten towels) in ANOES 2) for the money , BUT, their plan is ruined when a crazy killer in a santa suit (Larry "Dr. Giggles" Drake) approaches them. <br /> <br /> If you look it up on YouTube, you can watch it for free, but most of you have already seen it (my third visit). But if you have not seen it, I suggest.
