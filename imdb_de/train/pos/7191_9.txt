Reed Hadley makes a better double-fingerer Don Diego than a dashing and daring Zorro, but that's almost incidental, as this series contains the best title song of all series of all time - and the best version of Yakima Canutt's famous stagecoach tricks. There are other good stunts and lots of action and loads of outrageous Cliff Hanger chapter endings. However, if for any other reason you have to watch this movie to see the stagecoach stunt, then watch it again in slow motion. It's incredible, and despite the lower budget for this chapter game, Yak does the stunt better here than in the much more famous movie "Stagecoach." Indiana Jones, eat your heart out: this is the real deal!
