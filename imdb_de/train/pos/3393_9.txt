The only other movie besides Soylent Green that seems so hopeless is On the Beach. Both films deal with the consequences for the species and planet of man-made disasters. On the beach with nuclear war and Soylent Green with the environmental poisoning of the planet. <br /> <br /> Perhaps there is reason for optimism, because by 2007 we should not have achieved either of the worlds described in these films by now. There are still around 8 million people in New York City, not the 22 million at the turn of the millennium, as described in Soylent Green. Environmentalists always hail this film as the consequences of global warming. For me, it also shows the ethics of Right to Life. Of course there is no family planning in this world. <br /> <br /> Charlton Heston is a NYPD detective living with his roommate Edward G. Robinson, who is old enough to remember the earth before the disaster. A murder has been committed Joseph Cotten is a senior executive of Soylent Corporation, a multinational corporation that has developed a food product, a kind of waffle in many colors designed to feed the world's population. The latest product is Soylent Green. The investigation shows that Charlton Heston is catching his husband, but it also leads to some terrible truths about the Soylent Corporation and the future of humanity. While Heston cries out at the end that Soylent Green is made up of humans, that we have become a race of cannibals, the terrible thing is that there is no alternative. We have exhausted the planet and we must eat our dead to survive. <br /> <br /> This was the farewell performance of Edward G. Robinson, and in his memoirs Heston spoke movingly of Robinson, though they had different political views. A few weeks after Robinson had packed the last scene of his screen drop by consented euthanasia, he died in real life. Not many did, but Heston knew that Robinson was endless and did not matter in this last death scene. <br /> <br /> Even if the timetable is not right, that does not mean that the world is in the spotlight, Soylent Green can not come to fruition. Hopefully, not only will we have the intelligence, but also the sense of shared responsibility to prevent it.
