What a pleasant surprise: a Disney DTV (Direct to Video) episode, which is actually GOOD. "The Lion King 1 1/2" is a comedy affair involving all the favorite meerkats and warthogs, Timon and Pumbaa. It starts with watching the original film and making comments until Timon complains that "we are not here yet." After a dispute over the remote control, Timon and Pumbaa decide to tell the audience "their story". They start the new movie and the laughter starts. To be honest, I lost hope in Disney. Most of their direct video sessions were aggressively awful, and the storylines wanted to benefit from the original. "1 1/2" decides to try something different: It tells the original story from a new angle. Okay, it adds a few things about how Timon came here and how he and Pumbaa met, but it's an interesting concept. Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella perfectly recapture the bond and friendship that we loved in the first movie. There are also a couple of nice movie parodies (including a scene where 'Good, Bad and Ugly' and 'Cool Handluk') are faked at the same time, and the script contains funny, memorable lines. The cast includes Julie Kavner ("The Simpsons") as Timon's Worry War Mom and Jerry Stiller as Timon's slightly crazy Uncle Max. Matthew Broderick appears as Simba, and his "teenage" scene reminds me of Ferris Bueller. Everyone is doing well, especially Robert Guillame (how does one write that?) As Rafiki, who radiates more and more Yoda language in this film (Timon comments this several times). <br /> <br /> 'The Lion King 1 1/2' is the perfect alternative for those who are tired of the shrekification of animation. 10/10
