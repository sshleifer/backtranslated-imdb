I just bought the DVD and have to say (after loathing Brazil and Fear in Las Vegas), Terry does it again. Terry Gilliam's genius is a fan of the Monty Python movies, and asserts himself in this sci-fi thriller for which Bruce Willis plays a wonderful role as James Cole, and also Brad Pitt (perhaps my favorite character), who played mad Jefferey Goines. A must for sci-fi fans or film fans of any kind, as it includes suspense, drama, action and more. <br /> <br /> By no means the plot, In the future 1% of the world's population will survive a disease that is supposed to obliterate humanity, which in the past was triggered by the "Army of the Twelve Monkeys". James Cole (Bruce Willis) is sent back to 1996 (where the virus was released) to find out the disease so that scientists of his time can find a cure. Before I move on, James Cole lives in an underground society and the animals dominate the surface of the world because of the disease that will kill people. However, when he is sent back in time, he is actually sent back to the year 1990, where he is sent to a psychiatric ward for his stories about the virus. During his stay, he meets Jefferey Goins (Brad Pitt), who later became responsible for the extermination of humanity. He also meets his psychiatrist (Madelein Stowe), who eventually works with Bruce to save the world (seeing that he is right in his stories), is being sent back and forth from his time in the past, and finally Then he questions his own mind, but later moves on to reveal a thrilling ending to the film, later building himself up to the somewhat shocking climax where he tries to kill the man carrying the virus (not Brad Pitt), and instead gets shot by the police as the killer gets away.
