It was fun to watch, incredibly atmospheric and the effects were pretty good, considering they were in the middle of World War II. The story ended pretty quickly, as the villains had received their comeuppance. <br /> <br /> It was probably a good opportunity to observe the flea pit of the 1940s, when they had the greatest threat to their freedom from the Nazis - well done, with a rather serious message about the dangers of the third columnists for the UK. <br /> <br /> But Arthur Askey was so annoying and inglorious that you just wanted him to shut up! I suspect different tastes at different times, but choking around got boring. If he played an annoying little man as part of the script, he was successful. <br /> <br /> A good clock and just over 80 minutes rather short - a good background for older children too, so they have an idea of ​​how train travel was in severe times; uncomfortably slow, dirty trains, thrown away without reason, grumpy staff ....
