I saw this picture in 1940 for $ 11 and I would get a DVD in 2006. The film was the greatest adventure of the time and like all epics it is still a entertainment wonder (B & W and all). A really close friendship between the actors and the performances of Sam Jaffe & Eduardo Cianelli is outstanding (this could not be done today I especially liked the conclusion that the Colonel says the end of Kipling's poem about the corpse of Gunga Din "Untouchable" "You are a better man than me Gunga Din" You do not make a movie with this character today Actor who still lives today is Joan Fontaine
