I love old Burt Reynolds movies. They are funnier and better than any other movie together. You might as well have stopped making "Cannonball Run 2" movies, but I think, how could you know there are no other good ones? Man this movie is good. Burt Reynolds has to dress like a chicken and drive around a lot in a race car, and the lush Loni Anderson is on the hand and looks extremely hot in the 80s. Burt and Loni, those were the days! I had this magazine where Loni Anderson advertised for a vacuum cleaner. I certainly loved this ad! There's also this one part of the movie where the crowd on the racetrack is upset what Stroker Ace (Burty R.) is doing right now, and it shows a guy in the audience who bends over and puts his finger in his butt to show his disappointment! I laughed so much that I almost went into the night! If you can find this movie, rent it! And then never watch another movie because I'm just telling you: it makes no sense.
