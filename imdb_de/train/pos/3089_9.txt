That made me addicted, apparently ABC licensed this show to Pearl TV in Hong Kong. It was a surprise to me because it was a break from listening to Chinese. But I started to be complained because the cast and action are just NYC and thoughtful. Not too unbelievable, although I think it is very stereotypical to write Damien as a possible black man with a leaf !!!! That was the most disappointing aspect. The rest is great and I am sad to learn on IMDb that I can not look forward to the second season when I come back to the USA. I am as disappointed as the other commentators that this was promising and qualitative and tasty. But just as shows show that the characters are getting closer, it's probably harder for people to watch multiple episodes. This is obviously a bit too late for the zealous networks.
