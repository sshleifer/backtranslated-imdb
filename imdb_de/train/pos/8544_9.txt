This film has never received the attention it deserves, though this is one of the most beautiful pieces in the ensemble and one of the most realistic stories I've seen on screen. With a small budget in a real V.A. Hospital, the center of the story is Joel, played very well by Eric Stoltz. Joel is paralyzed in a motorcycle accident and comes to the hospital with other men with spinal injuries. Joel is in love with Anna, his married lover, played by Helen Hunt, who shows early signs of her later work, which was awarded an Oscar. <br /> <br /> Although the relationship between Joel and Anna is the main focus, there are many other well-developed characters on the station. Wesley Snipes does a great job as angry Raymond. Even more impressive is William Forsythe as a bitter and racist Bloss. I think Forsythe's two best scenes are when he gets frustrated and angry with the Square Dance dancers and later when he feels empathy for a young Korean shot in a liquor store. My favorite scene with Snipes is the round table discussion about the sexual possibilities after an injury. <br /> <br /> The chemistry between Stoltz and Hunt is very strong and they have two very intimate, but not unintentional sex scenes. The orgasm in the ward is both sexy and amusing. There is also another memorable scene in which Joel and Bloss and the Korean boy take the specially equipped van to the strip bar. It's really a comedy of errors as they make their weak attempts to get the van to see the "naked ladies." <br /> <br /> The story is paralyzed by the fact that the director, Neal Jimenez, is in real life. That's basically his story. This movie is real, not shiny or flashy. Having the amount of talent in a movie with such a low budget is amazing. I recommend this movie to anyone I see because it's one of those movies that gets even better at second glance. It is a shame that such a great work is overlooked, but through video she may perhaps get the attention she so richly deserves.
