This is one of the unusual cases where a movie and the novel based on it are great. Maybe this is because Gorris takes Nabokov's first ideas and gives them a different interpretation. The final consequence is a viewpoint on Luzhin who praises him more than Nabokov's. <br /> <br /> The only thing I do not like is the influence of Valentinov's influence on Luchin's fate. I can not imagine that Nabokov has created a person like Valentinov and is so strongly committed to the argumentation of the novel.
