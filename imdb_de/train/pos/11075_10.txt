Understandably, after reading the reviews for this film, I began to look at him with great doubt that he would be really good. However, this is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. The majority of the reviews I read said that the complicated conspiracy made it too difficult to follow. And while some parts leave you confused, the end ties up so many loose ends that you feel like you kick yourself because you've missed so much. It's not like "Lock, Stick ..." or "Snatch," in the sense that it's not so funny (in fact it's pretty dark) and it's a lot smarter, the way you see parts of scenes from different angles ( and in one of the best scenes of the film, Jason Statham spends five minutes in the elevator arguing with himself). Similar to the two films I've just mentioned, there are many memorable characters, notably Statham, who delivers a fantastic performance as a lead actor, and Ray Liotta, who spends most of the film in Speedos, still does a great job. If you have time and then have time to think about the movie and even look at it again, you really start to see all the imagery and cues that are included in the movie. I think it's awesome and Guy Ritchie is a director at the top of his game.
