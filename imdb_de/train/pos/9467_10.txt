DAN IN REAL LIFE attracted me due to the excellent reviews and thirst for a Dramedy that was well written - thanks Peter Hedges - and because Steve Carell stars in the movie, you know that an audience like LITTLE MISS is SUNSHINE, a performance that is very entertaining and rewarding. DAN IN REAL LIFE has kept that promise. <br /> <br /> The film is so real to many families around the world who have lost a member and yet went out and about with their lives in search of something that gives them back the magic of being with Steve Carell and the wondrous Juliette Binoche, her relationship was so well done and written that her scenes were so real for her characters and her travels. The cast, scenery and story made DAN IN REAL LIFE an unforgettable experience as we drove into the next holidays.
