I have to agree with everyone else who has posted. <br /> <br /> I have seen it some time ago, but I tell you, whenever I hear certain music from this anime, I am reminded of the beautiful story animation, the characters and the feeling I'm watching and that makes me cry (a happy but sad feeling). However, I've found that the love story in a hurry felt like a rush and they did not explain things properly, but it did not ruin any part of the audience experience. <br /> <br /> I was so busy with this anime after the end I just had to research (and watch the end a few more times) and I found all my answers and more. I love how they configured historical legends to fit in this anime, it was amazing and I just wanted to do a lot more research. (I have always been very interested in certain historical personalities associated with this anime). <br /> <I think it should have been a longer series, but if that was all they needed to work with, then they did well. I would recommend this to anyone who loves an emotional anime with an excellent story, well-built characters (some mysterious characters) and some fantasy action. <br /> <br /> Even though this is based on a H game it does not have any of that stuff and I actually prefer it (I have no problem with mature anime, in most cases I prefer it)
