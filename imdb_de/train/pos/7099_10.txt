Terry Gilliam's fantastic, twisted story about a virus that has but a handful of people destroyed all people all over the world and forced to go into hiding, and the man who was sent back in time to gather information about it is a fantastic, dizzying and highly stylized film that Bruce boasts of Willis' best performance ever. <br /> <br /> What 12 Monkeys apart from most sci-fi movies with time travel, the fact that the character of Bruce Willis actually deal with the psychological effects of time travel, that is, not knowing what is Reality is reality? The place from which the time traveler comes or goes. The film also recognizes that things that are in the past can not be changed and that the prevention of a catastrophic event, in this case the release of the virus, can not be stopped or changed. As Willis says, "It's already happening," while he is in a mental hospital, is the great dilemma in which the film is advised not trivial, exaggerated plot to save the world. Instead, it's Willis's inner struggle to simply survive. It's a fresh, innovative concept and works thanks to a tightly written script of Peoples and Gilliam's unique dementia brand. <br /> <br /> In addition, 12 Monkeys storytelling completely non-linear and distorted and turn the way in which the story is told cleverly, with a mixture of different time sequences: flashbacks, dreams, memories, present, Past, future and even a scene lifted from Hitchcock's Vertigo. All serve to surround the viewer with his disquieting cacophony of madness and futility. <br /> <br /> Gilliam is a master of the devastating rainstorm and shadow warfare that rivals Tim Burton in his strikingly desperate scenery and imagery. With cold, wide and immersive films, Gilliam immerses himself in the colorless surroundings and the darkness of his characters. The scenes are often bathed in a strangely antiseptic, dead white and serve as a contrast to the often intrusive characters. <br /> <br /> In terms of performance, Brad Pitt steals most of the scenes and fills them with a patented, unconventional performance that earned him an Oscar nomination. As mentioned above, Bruce Willis performs the best of his career. He does not fall back on his heroic stereotypes and his carton heroes and portrays Cole instead as a simple, poignant, tragic Jedermann. Equally good is Madeline Stowe as a Willis psychologist. She asserts herself and injects her character with wild energy and power, while collapsing under the weight of her seemingly false religion. <br /> <br /> Gilliam is an expert, overwhelming and complex What could be the case for a routine action / sci-fi film that makes 12 Monkeys to a fascinating vision of a nightmarish futuristic landscape. His rich, sophisticated, intricate plot with bravura performances of the entire cast and the dark, gloomy cinematography make it a masterpiece of madness. 12 Monkeys is one of my top ten ever and is a dark lavish spectacle of a movie that is filled with brilliance. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10
