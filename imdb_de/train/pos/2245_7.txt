Salva and his buddy Bigardo spent most of their lives on the edge of the law. We see them driving in a subway car, where their pitch is so lame for donations that nobody gives them anything! Salva, a hardened petty criminal, still has no redeeming qualities, that is, until he discovers on TV a reality show that gives him the idea of ​​what to do next. Religion and show business turn out to be a winning combination. Something Salva is counting on. <br /> <br /> He and Bigardo have been imprisoned following the accidental death of a priest who had criticized the duo. Salva shows that he is natural for the reality show. He transforms into a Christ-like figure, which has immediate success in the program. Espe, a non-nonsense woman who produces the show, can not escape the way Salva attracts her unusual attention. Ultimately, Salva is ultimately the victim of his own success. <br /> <br /> Jordi Molla, whose first directorial position is in this film, has had some success in the way the film satirizes the role of television. Spain, which was prone to this type of program, has experienced its share of the bizarre, which the director considered an attack on the audiences, and wanted to make his story from the point of view of the people who produce a movie Lucky from the naive public. <br /> <br /> The cast of the ensemble has some good moments in the film. Like any other actor who chooses his first role, Mr. Molla would have been more effectively focused on the image in front of the camera. Candela Pena, a good actress, is one of the best reasons to watch the movie. Juan Carlos Villedo, David Gimenez Cacho, Franco Francescoantonio, Florinda Chico and the rest responded well to the new director.
