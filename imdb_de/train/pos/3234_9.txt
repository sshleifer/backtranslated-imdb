I thought it was an extremely smart movie. I was very happy with it and really could not ask for more. Actually, I own the movie because I did not give it back to anyone. Also the fact that I do not own too many foreign films and this is a first. Well, personally I love Finnish things that have definitely contributed to my liking. But overall, it's worth a look. However, if you do not know Finnish or want to read subtitles, this movie is not for you.
