This movie is a fairly entertaining horror anthology film (after the model of Tales from the Crypt) by Robert Bloch (author of Psycho). It's great fun for horror fans and has a great cast. The film should also be viewed for Doctor Who fans as Jon Pertwee (the third Doctor) plays an amusing role as a rude and disgusting horror star!
