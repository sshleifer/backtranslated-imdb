I'm a kung fu fan but not a woo fan. I'm not interested in gangster movies filled with over-the-top guns. Now martial arts; *That's nice! And John Woo surprised me by producing a very entertaining kung-fu movie that's almost too much to fight, if that's possible! That is a good thing. <br /> <br /> Many of the fight scenes are very good (and some of them are less good), and the main characters are amusing and likeable. The bad guys are a bit too unbelievably evil, but still entertaining. You have to see the sleep assistant !! He can only fight when he sleeps - it's hysterical! <br /> <br /> However, looking at it several times, Last Hurray For Chivalry can be a bit boring and lengthy, also because many of the fight scenes are actually not that good. So I guess it's "only" a 7 out of 10. But it's really almost an "8". All in all, one of the better kung fu movies that was gossiped in the heart by Kung Fu Cinema Prime. All the really good kung fu movies are from the mid to late '70s, with some notable exceptions from the late' 60s and early '70s (and the early' 80s to be fair).
