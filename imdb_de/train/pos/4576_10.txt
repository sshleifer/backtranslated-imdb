I thought that this is an absolutely adorable movie that focuses on the lives of Mary-Kate and Ashley's characters Sam and Emma Stanton! They both try to make themselves and their parents happy, but; Unfortunately it is not easy for them to do it! I thought that this is a very charming and sweet movie and if you are a real fan of these wonderful young ladies then I'm sure you will agree with me here! If you have not seen this movie before, I say you really missed it. Great, and you should definitely take the time to see it now! This movie is a real winner! Sincerely, Rick Morris
