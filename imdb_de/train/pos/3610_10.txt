Girlfight is a story about a troubled teenager named Diana Guzman (Michelle Rodriguez). Diana is burdened by her mother's suicide and a sexist father living in a sexist community. A short temper and many things that have kindled a fire, she is thrown out of school to fight. Her brother Tiny (Ray Santiago) trains with Hector (Jaime Tirelli) in boxing. Diana is instructed by her father, Sandro (Paul Calderon), to pay for Tiny's training these weeks. While Diana walks through the gym, she realizes that she wants it. She wants to box. Diana asks her father for money to train, but he declines because she is a girl and should do more 'girlish' things. All Diana wants is to be treated like any other guy. Not looking down on her because she's a woman. She steals money from her father to start training. <br /> <br /> Great movie. Genius, pure Effing genius. Recommend to anyone who wants to see a good, clean movie without a monkey business.
