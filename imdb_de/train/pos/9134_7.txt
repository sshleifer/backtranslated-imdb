"Purple Rain" has never been a critics' favorite, but it's a cult classic - and deserves to be. If you're a Prince fan, this is for you. <br /> <br /> The main act is that Prince sees his abusive parents inside and falls in love with a girl. Believe it or not, this movie does not sing and dance. There are many intense scenes and it is heartwarming. Sometimes it feels weird, but if it works, it really works. Very random. <br /> <br /> Nobody really can play in the movie. Everyone is from one of Prince's side acts like "The Time" and "Vanity 6". Yet it adds charm to the movie. Whenever Prince is on the screen, he lights up and it's fun to see him at his commercial peak. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: If you love Prince like me, then look at this. If you are not a fan, you become one.
