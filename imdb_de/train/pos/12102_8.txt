This starts a bet between Edgar Allen Poe and a journalist ... Poe bets that the man can not spend a whole night in a spooky castle. Of course he can, but does he come out unscathed? Hard to say with all those strangers who are not supposed to wander there, including icy Barbara Steele. This is a pretty strange movie because the presentation is in French as well as in English and changes back and forth a few times. Maybe this happens because dialogues have been lost. It is also quite dark and claustrophobic, because you do not see much over a small circle of light that candles and the like produce. In addition, there is always a feeling of fear and imminent downfall. This version (on Synapse) is also uncensored, and I was wondering what could be censored in a 1964 movie to the Opless scene. Overall, this is pretty good and in gritty black and white colors. Barbara Steele definitely does the movie too. 8 out of 10.
