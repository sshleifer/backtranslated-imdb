I really enjoyed this movie. It has managed to do something that only a few films now do. it provided family values ​​and entertained me. Nancy Drew is a heroine for all generations and a role model for young girls. The little girls I was with enjoyed the movie throughout and talked about Nancy over and over as we left the theater. The film has relatively few problems for families and I do not think that parents get bored sitting in the theater. No, it will not win an Oscar and it did not show any great special effects or even created a terribly scary mystery, but it kept me entertained and it was true to the spirit of the books. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who has a young girl (she will love it!) Or any fan of the books. You will not be disappointed.
