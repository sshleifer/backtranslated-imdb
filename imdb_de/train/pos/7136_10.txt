I saw the movie before I read the Michelle Magorian book, and I enjoyed both. The movie, more than the book, made me come close to tears several times. This film touches the deepest points of the human soul and never lets go. I encourage so many people to see this masterpiece as often and as quickly as possible. I give ten stars.
