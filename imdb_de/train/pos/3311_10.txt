A common plot in movies is that the main characters leave the hustle and bustle of the city behind and find themselves in the tranquility of nature. In Power of Kangwon Province, we are shown two stories of individuals doing just that and trying to find their way to the popular Korean parks in the mountains of Kangwon Province. Instead of epiphany moments, however, we have two characters whose outing into nature was just another form of escape. <br /> <br /> The tempo of this movie is slow and contemplative. In the end, we find out what really brought everyone to Kangwon Province, and we learn how they relate to each other. For those who want Hollywood glamor and give a definitive answer for a movie, this movie will not satisfy. But for those who want a movie that makes them think, wonder and influence them for years to come, this movie will more than satisfy that longing.
