I liked this movie. When the man who was bankrupting $ 40 million in gold dies, his cellmate is used as a "bait" to lead them to the crazy high-tech partner (putting a monitor in his jaw without his knowledge implanted.)). It's an action, spy movie with enough weird scenes to keep it bright. It reminded me of Enemy Of The State. Well played and good enough plot.
