Of course it was well shot and done, shot and shot very well! But the story was so weak. And the portrayal of Lincoln was even weaker. Not that Henry Fonda was not good, but the character he played was just an idiot. Are you telling me that Lincoln was a smart ass with no respect for the law or the court? I mean, who the hell was he supposed to be? Cousin Vinnie? I mean, come on, "I'll just call you Jackass then" ???? I understand that Ford wanted a great funny hero, but I did not like this guy at all. He cheats on sport, talks like a really sweet fool and does not seem to know if he should sit in a courtroom. How should I take this seriously? <br /> <br /> The turn was even weaker. I mean, come on! That was just stupid. The whole story seemed like it had been conceived by a 5-year-old in his or her dreams. When I say that I like it enough, it was very entertaining and made me laugh several times, so I can not say it's a bad movie. In fact, I have to say that it is good enough. Nothing that entertains me and makes me laugh can be bad. BUT this vivid and stupid story was just so ridiculous that I can not understand how anyone would think it was great. <Br /> <br /> I have no idea how historically accurate this movie was, but if any of them were true, I'd really have to shake my head.
