They use the IMDb. <br /> <br /> You have given some of your favorite movies strong voices. <br /> <br /> It's something you like to do. <br /> <br /> And that's why. Fifty seconds One world ends, another begins. How can not a ten be given? I'm wondering about those who make this seven or eight ... how could the first movie ever made be better? For the record, the long-opening setting is a great show, a great innovation that perfectly matches the situation. And the dog on the bike is a nice touch. All within fifty seconds. <br /> <br /> The word genius is often overused. <br /> <br /> THIS is genius.
