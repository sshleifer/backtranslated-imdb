What a great Barbara Stanwyck movie I saw recently. "Jeopardy" was fantastic. It was made in 1953 and probably for double coupons, but it kept me on the seat edge. Barbara Stanwyck plays Helen, who drives a secluded fishing spot in Mexico for a vacation with her husband Doug (Barry Sullivan) and their son (Lee Aaker). The husband falls off the dock and he can only be rescued when Barbara drives back to a garage for a rope. There she meets a psychotic murderer (Ralph Meeker - one of My Favorites) and what follows is a cat-and-mouse game as Barbara does everything in her power to get Meeker to free her husband. <br /> <br /> The movie was so exciting and such a surprise - I did not expect such a great movie. But I think I should have noticed - is there something Barbara Stanwyck does that is anything but wonderful?
