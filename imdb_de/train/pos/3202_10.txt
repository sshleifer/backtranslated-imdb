I can not understand why many IMDb users do not like this movie. Why they think it's sooooo bad etc. It's not worse than everything else out there. Personally, I find "Soldier" a great movie, far better than most other films in the same genre. <br /> <br /> Reasons I liked "Soldier": Kurt Russel, Connie Nielsen, Jason Scott Lee, the script (David Webb Peoples), great visual effects, and directing (Paul Anderson). <br /> <br /> I even think that this is the best work I've seen from director Paul Anderson, who previously led the conversation "Mortal Kombat" and the not-so-fun "Event Horizon".
