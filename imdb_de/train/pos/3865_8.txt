"Stories of the Century" was a half-hour series and appeared in the first run during the television season '54 -'55. It was also the first Western TV series to win an Emmy Award. As a veteran of western actor Jim Davis as railroad detective Matt Clark, the series put Clark and his fellow railroad investigator partners (Mary Castle as Frankie Adams for the first half of the season and Kristine Miller as "Jonesy" for the second half) against Western legislators of various eras of Mid-1860s to early 1900s. The series was very satisfying, easy to see and quite realistic, mainly due to the casual charm of Jim Davis in the lead role. He looked like a western character. Another note. When Matt Clark arrived after a long ride in the city, he actually looked as if he had been on a long horse ride since it was covered in dust. <br /> <br /> A very good Western for adults.
