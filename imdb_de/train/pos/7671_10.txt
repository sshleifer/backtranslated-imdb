Dr. Mordrid, what can I say? Jeffrey Combs has done it again! <br /> <br /> Anton Mordrid has been on Earth for 100 years, waiting for Kabal, a wicked wizard, to come and kill him. Mordrid and Kabal used to train together as children, so Mordrid knows all the tricks of Kabal. <br /> <br /> The movie is a bit confusing at first, but you soon feel part of the action. I will not reveal the end, so look at Doctor Mordrid! <br /> <br /> I found the movie very enjoyable as it has neither violence nor sexual scenes. The film focused on the plot and I like that! I think the best movies are those where time flies by. That's because you are so immersed in the movie. Doctor Mordrid is a fantastic thrilling movie! I give him a 20 out of 10. Worth seeing! <br /> <br />
