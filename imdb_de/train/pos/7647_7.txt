Ok, it borrows a bit from "It's a Wonderful Life", but that was 44 years before this movie, so why not try again. Belushi celebrates a 35th birthday. He did not get his Wheaties and his coffee and lost his job. The capper is when his self-described "big blue piece of shit" collapses at the end of the day. He goes to an empty bar to call for a tow. While waiting, he is recognized by the bartender (Caine) as the boy who lost the city's baseball game 20 years ago. That makes him think about what life would have been like if he had won the game. He finds out that Caine unknowingly serves a potion in a jar that gives him a mansion, the Finishing Queen (Russo), as his wife, and makes him the president of the sporting goods company he canned. Caine later reveals himself as the one responsible for this change, but Belushi is not fully on board. He never completely adapts, and in an action that does not kill the film but is still strange, he tries to woo his wife (Hamilton) before his real life, which is now married to another woman. The good thing is that they do not spend too much time, since they are basically ripping off "ghost," with Belushi Hamilton constantly telling things that only she could know. It is also a dramatic element, as two of his lover in the shadow, the new woman Russo and his unbalanced lover Cox. But the key to the film is the somewhat lengthy beginning and the happy ending. Good work also from the large and recognizable cast, as Belushi is very sympathetic, very attractive ladies are chosen and Caine as a title person goes completely relaxed. Strangely enough, this was Belushi's second film from 1990, in which he received an alternative lifestyle of wealth found in "Taking Care of Business." Although both films are similar, they are provided at the same level of laughter. Take a look at this for a fun exploration of "What if?"
