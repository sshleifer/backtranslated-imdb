Butch the peacemaker? Obviously. After the violent start with Spike, Tom and Jerry rocking each other, Butch stops and wants to know why. That's a good question. <br /> <br /> "Cats can get along with dogs, right?" he asks Tom, who nods in agreement. "Mice can get along with cats, right?" Jerry nods "no" and then sees that's not the right answer. <br /> <br /> You go in and Butch creates a "peace treaty" (complete with professional artwork!). The rest and most of the cartoon are the three that are extremely nice to each other. What a refreshing change. It was fun to watch. I can do a million of these cartoons, where everyone beats their heads. Anyway, you knew that peace would not last. A big piece of steak meant the death of the "peace treaty" but on the way it was a nice change and still had some of the usual smart humor of Tom & Jerry.
