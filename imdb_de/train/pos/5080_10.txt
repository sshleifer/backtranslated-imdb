When a film is produced or staged by Mel Ferrer, you can bet that each of his images will be seen generation after generation. Only with Claudette Colbert (Ellen R. Ewing), "The Egg & I", 47, appearing in the movie and starring, it becomes even more a great classic movie. In this film, Ellen marries Ewing and then encounters all kinds of mental health problems and even murder. The mystery gets very involved and Robert Ryan (David McLean), "Battle of the Bulge" (65), comes to help Ellen and sometimes it's even surprising that David is on the upswing. As you look at this image, you are about to find out who the real crazy person is and suddenly you begin to change your mind about how the movie will end. Great spectacle by Claudette Colbert and Robert Ryan, who played a completely different role than he normally portrays on screen. I forgot to mention that Mel Ferrer was married to a great movie star, Audrey Hepburn. Great classic movie with great classic actors!
