In a word - excellent. This is the movie. Go and look at it. The director Ron Howard ... I mean, the director Ron Howard has done a fantastic job, as it does normally. An incredible attention to detail, vivid colors and decorations, a stunning Whoville atmosphere, amazing costumes. Wait, there is more to it than that - the story is also very good. There is clearly a message that can be extracted from the thoughtful viewers it. Jim Carrey is first class. He is probably the best Grinch possible. The girl, Taylor Momsen, is really good. I'm sure she has a great future. The dog is cool. All in all, it's a very high quality Christmas tale. If you like fairytales, it is for you. If you like Christmas, it is for you. <br /> <br /> Read some other reviews ... Get a life here. It hurts me every time to see people who had their hearts two sizes too small.
