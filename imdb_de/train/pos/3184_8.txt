This Hong Kong-filmed potboiler contains more melodrama than "The Young & The Restless" of the week. This is more a return to the original 'Emmanuelle' trilogy (especially 'Goodbye Emmanuelle') than a D'Amato Sleazefest. Chai Lee (Emy Wong) undergoes an amazing transformation from a nurse to a hot-to-trot streetwalker. Future Italian porn star and politician Illona Staller, later named Ciccolina (who had sex with an HIV-positive John Holmes), plays Emy's competition. Exotic locations and some decent softcore scenes complete the picture. Recommended for fans of the original 'Emmanuelle', of which I am one!
