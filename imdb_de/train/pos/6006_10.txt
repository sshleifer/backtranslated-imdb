When I saw this as a child, it answered all my questions and dispelled any fears or misunderstandings that I had. It's easy to see because it's animated, which makes it harmless. It has no moral prejudices or "preaching" aspects, so nobody should object. It is a pleasant film that conveys the facts of menstruation simply soothing and factual. I hope to show my daughter.
