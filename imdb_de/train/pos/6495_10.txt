10 out of 10, this brilliant, super documentary is a must, with movie clips from the war that people have not seen for years until it was shown in 1974. The film clips in this war documentary should not be missing. Something, some clips left me out of control. The entire series is over 20 episodes long and Sir Lawrence Olivier is the narrator and tells a breathtaking story of war. It's just still the best documentary of the war, and now the over 25-year-old can still take a big punch. You'll have to watch it at some point, even if it's a few episodes, even if you're still going to be amazed at the impact of this documentary on those who suffered and died on behalf of WAR in a WORLD AT WAR.
