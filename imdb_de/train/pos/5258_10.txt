The Ladies Man laughs loud, funny, with a great varied cast and some very stupid but excellent scenes (including the funniest love song ever written). Ferrell is his usual self-esteem Brilliant's supporting role. <br /> <br /> Tim Meadows plays surprisingly well an idiot and has written himself some of the funniest lines you'll find in any comedy. <br /> <br /> Definitely worth it A purchase that is viewed every 6 months or so will make you still laugh just as hard as the first time. <br /> <br /> I'm desperate to think at the time of writing that this has a meager 4.7 / 10 and I urge you to vote! <br /> <br /> And remember kids- "Theres more movement in the ocean"
