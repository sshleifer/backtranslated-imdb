The TV movie by The Spirit in 1986 was a pilot for a possible series. However, Spirit creator Will Eisner did not like the movie and therefore no series was produced. I found it a very entertaining movie and captured the spirit of the comic with a modern twist. I am sorry that no series has formed from this. Sam Jones was a perfect ghost. Nana Visitor was a nice Ellen Dolan and would later go to Star Trek: Deep Space later. Perhaps with the release of Frank Miller's large-format version of The Spirit, more people will be able to see this rare jewel of Spirit history. It seems that when Hollywood creates a movie from an already established character or idea, someone inevitably seeks out earlier versions of the property and publishes it as a video to earn a few dollars. When Antonio Banderas put on the mask of Zorro, we were able to get earlier versions of the masked hero on DVD, such as the great Alain Delon version of the 70s (though all the copies I've ever seen were badly edited). They hope someone will release The Spirit's TV adventure on DVD soon.
