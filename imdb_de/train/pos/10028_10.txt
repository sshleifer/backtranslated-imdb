When I saw this movie, I was stunned what a great movie it was. This is the only movie I think I would rate with 10 stars. I am sure that this film will always be in my top 5. <br /> <br /> The acting is outstanding. Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslett are at their best. I do not think anyone could have a better job than Kate. <br /> <br /> If it's a rainy day and you can not decide what to rent then this is the place. You will love all the acting, special effects and much more. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen this movie yet, go for rent or buy it now !!! You will not regret it. <br /> <br />
