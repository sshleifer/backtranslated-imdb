The erotic cinema of the 70s was tame compared to today's Triple X trumpets, which is good. Because there is a good story about the naked rituals and sex scenes. Of course, I wish they had some vampire effects they had at that time, and that the sex of the story was a bit in the way. Some accents were difficult to understand at times, but it's worth looking at the unedited version and then the edited version called THE DEVIL'S PLAYTHING. But if you are not interested in a lot of naked women dancing and having sex then this is not the movie for you. But I enjoyed it and I give it ... 7 STARS.
