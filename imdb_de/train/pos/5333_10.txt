I do not know how this movie became a cult movie. I think it was unfortunately overlooked as a truly ingenious comedy. <br /> <br /> "Runaway Car" tries to show itself as a frenzied thriller, but to take the quality of acting (good god, it is bad), the storyline, the practical aspects of the demonic possession of the car and the Baby's evacuation scene suggests that you can not do anything but laugh. And you'll laugh. Movies are made to entertain us, and the extent to which they do so can be an indication of the value of a movie. This movie is the highlight of the conversation, I laughed from start to finish. At one point I got short of breath and almost swallowed, in some places it is really funny. When the baby was carried out of the sun canopy by a helicopter with a robot pilot out of the sunroof, he managed to maintain a constant speed that was identical to the car and a perfectly flat flight level, which meant that the hook was the one to use Car roof could not tear to pieces I laughed hysterically. But when the baby started swinging in the air, nearly hit a bridge and almost got caught in a tree, tears ran down my face. <br /> <br /> I also remembered that the black policeman was the guy who played Jesus in Madonna's "Like A Prayer" video. He seems to be everywhere.
