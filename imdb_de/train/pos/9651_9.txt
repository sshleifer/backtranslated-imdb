What at first glance was just another introverted French film that offered nothing more than a disagreeable feeling became a really enlightening and satisfying presentation to me at the second sight. Spoiler follows. <br /> <br /> Bad Cedric; he did not seem to know what hit him. Poor audience; We were initially entangled in a truly beautiful and romantic story that could only be led into the dark reality of mismatch. These two types simply did not belong together from their first ambiguous encounter. As much as Mathieu and Cedric were sexually attracted, the intellectual being Mathieu, due to the lack of a deeper emotional bond, made it impossible to live in life with someone whose emotions were more attuned to carnival festivities and tromps at the feast. <br /> <br /> On a purely technical note, I loved the camera action in this movie. Subtitles were completely unnecessary, even though my French is "presque rien". I could look at it again without the annoying English translation and enjoy it even more. This was a polished, very professional film. Although many scenes appear superfluous, I estimate it nine out of ten.
