This movie is one of the few quality movies of the year 2000 and definitely one of my best. The scenario is based on the novel by Vladimir Nabokov and the transfer to the big screen is absolutely awesome. <br /> <br /> The photography of the film is excellent, as well as the acting of Turturro and Watson. Turturro definitely shows his best performance so far and proves that he is worth much more than we thought. Watson also plays brilliantly. <br /> <br /> The story is about a phenomenal chess player (Turturro), who is also extremely eccentric in his everyday life. The film is shown in a non-linear time with several flashbacks from Luthin's childhood. This describes the complex character of Luzhin. <br /> <br /> I have nothing to say but to propose this movie to everyone.
