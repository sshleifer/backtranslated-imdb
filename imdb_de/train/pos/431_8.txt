It starts slowly and shows the sad life of the two housewives who decide to rent a castle in Italy for the month of April, but they do not give up. It does not happen much, but time passes exquisitely, and there are many clever jokes (my favorite is the carriage ride by storm, which I find funny). The movie is wonderfully romantic in many ways, the scenery is beautiful (as is Polly Walker), and the resolutions in the movie are very satisfying. <br /> <br /> The film takes some liberties with book, the biggest is the business of Arbuthnot / Briggs / Dester, but I preferred the version of the movie (it may be more sentimental, but I feel like that it matches the tone of the story more, and yet I like sentiment if it's done well. <br/> <br/> An excellent movie, especially as a date movie in bad weather.
