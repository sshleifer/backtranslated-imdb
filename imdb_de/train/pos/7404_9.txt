Just watched the Australian premiere of Shower [Xizhao] at the Sydney Film Festival. The program notes said it was - a perfect pleasure - skillful, touching, amusing, dramatic and poignantly significant. I could not agree anymore. I just hope the rest of the festival films are in line with this entertainment standard and I look forward to seeing more Chinese films in Sydney in the coming months.
