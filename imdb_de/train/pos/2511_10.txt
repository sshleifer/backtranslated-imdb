I was looking for this movie in typical fan obsession. I just wanted to check it. I did not expect much from anything. After all, a musician, an actor and a scriptwriter? It is not possible for so many talents to be in one person. Law?? <br /> <br /> Wrong !! Obsession aside, it quickly became one of my favorites! The plot and the characters are not lost in the typical hyped Hollywood special effects. The story grabs your feelings and pulls you along. As the credits pass, you suddenly realize that you have stuck to the end. <br /> <br /> Sometimes acting is a little over the top. However, I believe that it happens with comic intent and very appropriate character. Otherwise I would not have expected how much acting has experienced. <br /> <br /> It's worth more than once to see. I laugh hysterically or unexpectedly grabbed something I either missed or forgot the first or second time. Feel free to go with your doubts, but I'm sure it will find a place on your shelf.
