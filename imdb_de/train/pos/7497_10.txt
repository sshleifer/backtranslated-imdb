I'll never forget when I saw this title in the video library when. I've always been a big fan of Weird Al and when I saw this video I rented and saw it. I was too young to appreciate all the subtle humor and satire of Al at the time, but I remember that much later, when I was old enough to understand what I saw. If you are an "Al" fan, especially from his previous work, you will enjoy this movie very much. It's done in the MTV-style "rockumentary" style and tells a true (but sometimes exaggerated) story of how Al could be where he was in 1985. his music.
