One of the best musicals, which is timeless and always worth seeing. Delicious! Acting, especially by Ron Moody as Fagin, is outstanding. Costumes are exquisite .... even the shabby. <br /> <br /> The two young guys who play Oliver and The Artful Dodger are wonderfully talented. Oliver Reed does a great job and shows Bill Sykes where there is no other way than to hope that he finds a terrible ending ... what he does. <br /> <br /> Dancing is cleverly choreographed and fascinating. Oliver can compete with My Fair Lady, The Sound of Music, Oklahoma and so on. A movie for the whole family.
