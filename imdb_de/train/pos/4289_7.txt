I have to be 100% honest with the other IMDb users. I just wanted to watch this movie for a long time because of the poster. Does not Charlotte Gainsbourg look very sexy and charming and smiles like that? I am in love with this woman! I got what I expected ... but only half. This film should meet expectations for those who enjoy all sorts of romantic comedies or stories that involve intelligent humor and light dramatic situations. <br /> <br /> While I disagree with another IMDb user who says the movie is overrated; I have to admit that "Pr√©te-moi ta main" has many shortcomings. <br /> <br /> My main problem with the movie is the lack of chemistry on the screen between the main characters. Before the climax, there is not a single scene that shows that the main characters share a moment of "romance," or even an indication that they are interested in each other. <br /> <br /> Actually, this is the case Only the scene in which they are sharing is extremely unpleasant (when both sit on the couch) and does not help the audience to understand a possible love interest. I did not buy the dinner sequence. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, the film delivers very funny moments and has strong dialogues that support such a brilliant premise. I'm talking cheekily that getting a 43-year-old man these days would be very difficult. <br /> <br /> I understand it's a movie and that's why I accept it as a funny thing. Besides, the humor is versatile. There are moments with S & M, funny lines with Chabat's best friend, some lesbian references, funny situations with family wives and much more. <br/> <br/> Charlotte Gaionsbourg's performance is first-rate and she's by far the reason to watch the movie. She is funny, sexy, looks very thin and fine and shows that she is a versatile and talented actress who can deliver a comedic and dramatic performance in sheer sheen. Alain Chabat is a good actor and gives a very decent performance. I think that the supporting actors do what they can. <br /> <br /> The film music, art direction and other technical aspects are really good and give the film a dynamic look. <br /> <br /> Enjoy this kind of cinema should be happy after the credits. It is a good example of good cinema.
