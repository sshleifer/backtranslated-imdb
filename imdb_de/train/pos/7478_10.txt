I am from Romania and will try to speak English. All I want to say about this movie is that it is and will be my number one. I have seen it at least 30 times and will see it for many years now. It has all the little things I like in a movie, it touches me a lot and makes me cry. Shows a lot of twisted love things and questions about love and reality and the real things that are important to different people. It happens that for me that is most important, the love, the soul of a man, he is the inner being and I see that in this movie. Maybe it's much more than a movie to me, it's a proof to me that it really could exist and that you can make the most of every moment you live with your soulmate. It's a long way from reality to science fiction, but ... what if. What if all capitalism had disappeared and the economy went down and would fall? We would all be worried about other issues and I think on your deathbed is the greatest thing you remember, not the wealth, not the adventure, not the countries you've visited, and the people who come to They remember. But the true friends and your true love and the hope that after your death, all goddamned will be perfect and the people would be good and caring more. SEE THIS FILM, and he'll probably take you through your life as he did to me :) Hail from Romania
