A May day in 1938, on which a large rally on Hitler's visit to Rome took place, serves as the setting for a love story between Antoniette (Sophia Loren), married to Faschist (John Vernon) and Gabriel (Marcello Mastroianni). She is a boring housewife with several sons and he is an unhappy, lonely homosexual fired from the radio and persecuted by the fascists. She is at home alone when her spouse has to attend the historic celebration. Then, despite their differences, they both develop a very pleasant relationship. The film plays at the historic meeting of Fuher Hitler and Duce Mussolini, along with other authorities such as Count Ciano and King Victor Manuel III. He describes the events by a radio voice in the off, which is sometimes irritating. <br /> <br /> It is a romantic drama performed with sense and sensuality. A relentlessly passionate romance between two conflicting characters. Excellent performances by two professionals make a worth watching movie. Of course, Ruggero Macarri and Ettore Scola's sensible script lead to always interesting, thoughtful and sentimental results. Colorful and atmospheric cinematography by Pascualino De Santis. Emotional music by Armando Trovajoly with a sensitive leitmotif. The film won Golden Globes in 1978 rightly as the best foreign film. The imagination of director Scola is sufficient to shed light on the limited scenarios in which the drama develops. As a rule, his films take place on some stages and are half-theatrical. For example: "Le Bal" (1982) uses a French ballroom to illustrate the changes in society that had escaped from the revolutionary Paris 3) The family (1987) takes place in the family's great old Roman dwelling; and of course 4) "Una Giornata Particulare" or "A Special Day" where Loren and Mastroianni enter into a wonderful relationship with their homes and the flat roof.
