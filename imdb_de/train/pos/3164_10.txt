I can not believe we do not have this 70's show anymore. I have all 8 seasons of this 70s show !! I absolutely love it !! I lie in bed every night and watch several episodes before I go to sleep. At the end of a long, busy day, you can sit back and laugh before you go to sleep. I was so sad that they aired the show ... at least we still have the reps !! I hope and pray that they will at least come back with a reunion ... As if Donna has finished college and we can finally see her and marry Eric !!!! Would not that be fantastic !!! It would be even better if they would continue for a few more years !!
