I know, sometimes it's really cheesy ... But acting is incredible and Melissa Joan Hart is as cute as a button. I really love this show, and it's almost embarrassing for me to do this show. because I'm really stupid, but I feel fine. My only problem is that sometimes it can be a pretty small budget - sometimes the actors change and you just have to worry about it ... As if Sabrina's dad were two different guys in the movie ... I mean, they could Do not just say he was an uncle or something? Still, I can not help but love this show. Harvey and Sabrina are a really sweet couple and Salem is absolutely funny. I definitely recommend it if you are looking for a light and fun conversation ... My favorite episode is "Pancake Madness" ... a HILARIOUS episode. The best season is probably 3 ... I'm not a fan of some of the seventh season twists ... Once you've reached college, Morgan joins the group and their dialogue is painful and very poorly played ... Plus they it's ugly, so jokes about surviving their good looks were lost to me ... but I think it was a really good eighth season, and I was really sad to have canceled one of my favorite shows!
