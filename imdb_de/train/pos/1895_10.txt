I've seen that over the Christmas season, I do not know why, but it reminds me of Christmas, so I saw it, so we're here. <br /> <br /> Arthur is a movie I watch through and through, with a stupid smile on my face and a mix of special performances, great funny music and a wit and charm cracking script. <br /> <br /> Dudley Moore makes a character who can easily be hated (spoiled, rich, lazy drunk who regrets himself), but makes him someone you love. Liza Minelli is great as Linda Morolla, a waitress who manages to strip the hard / soft woman for whom Arthur almost gives up his world. John Gielgud gets all the juicy lines and polishes them off with relish. <br /> <br /> I can see Arthur over and over again and I always feel good about it. If you need a lift, it's a nice movie.
