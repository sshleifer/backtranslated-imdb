I was too young to ever know much about Prince, but in recent years I have seen many Purple Rain Novelty T-shirts that I found cool, but I did not want to buy a shirt I did not know about. So it happened on a Saturday and I decided to look at it. I did not know what the movie would be about before I saw it, but it was great when I found out. In the movie, Prince was not known as a prince, but as "the child". All appearances were great for me, but my favorites were Purple Rain, Darling Nicki and I would die for you. All the songs were related to what was going on in the movie when his mother and father always fought the song as pigeons screamed and described what he felt. I also like how smart Prince was with the way he flirted with Apallonia. I liked it when Prince and Appallonia first met at the club and he stood behind her and then when she turned around he disappeared! great movie and now I can not even find any of these t-shirts :(
