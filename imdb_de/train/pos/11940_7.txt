As hard-nosed baseball, this movie contrasts with what I'd expect from a sports movie: authentic-looking sports action, believable characters, and an original storyline. While "Angels in the Outfield" fails miserably in the first category, it succeeds beautifully in the last two. "Angels" tells the story of Roger and J.P., two nursing home children from Anaheim who have fallen in love with baseball but are looking for a family to share with the Angels franchise from Woebegone. They fight to win fans and win games. Imbued with the promise of his unbeatable father that they would only be a family when the angels win the pennant, Roger asks for heavenly help and gets them in the form of diamond dwellers who want to reverse the downward spiral of the franchise. And when manager George Knox, portrayed by George Glover, believes in what Roger sees, the team suddenly has the hope of turning the season over - and Roger and JP find something to believe in. Especially Glover is nice performance, and Tony Danza, who plays a purging pitcher, is good too, although he clearly knew how to beat the wind!
