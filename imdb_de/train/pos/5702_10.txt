I did not expect Val Kilmer to convince John Holmes, but I forgot that it was not the porn legend. In fact, the entire cast was amazing achievements in this highly undervalued film. <br /> <br /> As some have already mentioned, look for the two-disc set and check out the "Wadd" documentation first. You'll get a lot of background on the story, which will be useful to appreciate the movie. <br /> <br /> Some people seem to be unhappy that the LAPD crime scene video is included on the DVD. There are a number of reasons why this could have been possible. One of them is that John Holmes' murder case was the first one in the United States where such material was used by the prosecution. If you do not want to see it, it's easy to avoid. It is clearly labeled as "LAPD Crime Scene Footage" on the menu!
