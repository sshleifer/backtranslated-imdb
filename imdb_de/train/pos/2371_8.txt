I suggested renting this movie to a friend, and he signed up, having already seen the movie, and said it was okay. I found the title a bit off-kilter, as the version in our store was called "The Fear: Halloween Night". I expected this movie to be some kind of Halloween rip-off with a wooden murderer. But it started with a good scene, and the killer immediately killed two victims and flashed twenty years later, when his son, who had seen him kill the two humans (including his mother), and he even witnessed how his father's suicide has gone to a secluded cabin is the forest with his friends and his girlfriend, where he tries to face his fears, until a wooden statue is brought to life with the mind of his father. Pretty good for a sequel and I have never seen the first one.
