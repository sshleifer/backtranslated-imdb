Yes, Keaton looks like he really enjoyed this movie. With a leap in his tailor-made pinstripe suits, he reminds you of Jimmy Cagney! Johnny (Keaton) is the young hood who only does it to pay his mother's high-priced medical bills and send his younger brother (Griffin Dunne) to the Jura. Nobody knows Johnny Kelly IS Johnny Dangerously until later in the movie. Joe Piscopo is Vermin and does not like Johnny a bit (and I do not like Vermin). Marilu Henner has a nice singing / dancing routine while Johnny enjoys it. I love the role when they are in the ever-changing getaway car! The cop calling all the cars is the skipper of Gilligan's Island! See this for 1930 Gangster laughs! The gags in this movie are hilarious, but you have to catch them or you'll miss them! Look into every scene in the background.
