As a fan of Paris Je'Taime I visited New York, I Love You, with very high expectations. I like being satisfied with all my expectations. It was funny, sweet, fast and entertaining. The film begins with two taxi drivers (Bradley Cooper & Justin Bartha) trying to get into the same area but arguing about which direction to go. That was funny and then the movie goes into the best skits I've ever seen. There were four amazing ones of all the good ones. I will talk about these four. Shia LaBeouf is seen as a bellhop in a hotel that finds love with an old lady. The next one introduces Orlando Bloom as a music producer doing business with a woman played by Christina Ricci. Anton Yelchin and Olivia Thirbly are two people who go to prom, but Thirbly's character is handicapped. Best of all, Eli Wallach and Cloris Leachman are an old couple. I would like to point out that Nataile Portman makes an impressive directorial debut and writes a sketch on a janitor. Ethan Hawke and Maggie Q are great flirting men and hookers. New York, I Love You is definitely as good, if not better than the 2006 Paris Je'Taime. The skits are well recorded and the movie shows how indie films really should be. However, the film does not have as many famous directors as Paris Je'Taime, so it was fantastic to do justice to its excellence. If you want to laugh, see some great dramatic effects, see an amazing amount of great performances, and just be entertained, be sure to visit New York, I Love You.
