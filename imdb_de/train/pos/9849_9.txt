When I saw the trailers, I just had to watch the movie. And when I had that, I somehow felt dissatisfied. It was a great movie, do not get me wrong, but I think the great parts were already in the trailers when you catch my drift. It went very fast and it rolled on, so I never got bored and I enjoyed seeing it. The humor was absolutely great. My first contact with a sloth (or something like that).
