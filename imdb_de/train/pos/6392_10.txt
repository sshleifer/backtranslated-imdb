This independent B & W and DV feature shocks, baffles and amuses with its ability to create the craziest situations and humor and interest in them. It's all funny and ridiculous, but as absurd as the movie may be, there's a heart and a reality here that keep the movie on the ground, keeping the whole thing from falling into utter craziness, and that's where the real thing lies Embassy. This movie is about how we all survive in a crazy world. That seems to be the heart of the movie. Because as crazy and from the wall as things come, Leon, the 30-year-old. old paperboy protagonist, always trying to keep it together. He is like a child constantly trying to catch the balloon that floats so that everything will turn out so everyone can get what they want. <br /> <br /> The acting in the film could have gone a long way over the top, but the extraordinary cast really holds the piece together. Van Meter is perhaps the best in the group with a performance that shines through its absurd diseased tics. Just like the characters in the movie, we overlook their sudden outbursts to see the real person underneath. <br /> <br /> Majkowski is a true genius here. He takes extremely ridiculous moves and keeps them real. It's his screenplay and actors that help keep things afloat. It is a true testament to the ability of Majkowski and all those involved that this film, with its moving action and characters, never once affects our nerves. Majkowski has made a film that could be abrasive and repulsive, somehow giving him heart and humor. This is a unique movie. Not to miss. <br /> <br />
