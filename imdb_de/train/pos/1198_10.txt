Like most other reviewers, I saw this movie for the first time (on TV, never on the big screen) when I was a teenager. My dad has always valued and recommended this film to me, and I have to say that he was not only right, but this film has been with me forever for more than two decades since I saw him for the first time. I have seen it two or three more times since then (a few days ago I gave one more watch), and it has lost none of its effect over time. It is still a great and worthwhile movie! Manr sees Peckinpah's RIDE THE HIGH COUNTRY as one of the first and best later westerns to have realistically considered life in the Old West, but the little-known LAST HUNT is definitely the better movie, and was even half a dozen years earlier. Actually, it was probably three decades ahead of time, or maybe it's still ... <br /> <br /> Although I think hard and have certainly seen 100's Western (I like this genre), I can not connect to any Western remind sombre and depressive like this. Two men were connected, partly out of hatred, partly because they seemed to have no choice, surrounded by the beautiful Mrs. Padget, a crippled old man and a young Inian who led the life of the buffalo killers, until fate was one of them reached. <br /> <br /> Nobody who has ever seen this movie will forget its end and the last frames of this gem. When the camera moves to and from Mr. Taylor, a white buffalo skin (on a tree) appears, and echoes from the past, when all the hate began, are back. Mr. Taylor got his buffalo, but in the end he got the buffalo. <br /> <br /> Apart from the excellence of everyone involved, the intelligent script and the great dialogue, it should also be mentioned that THE LAST HUNT is superbly photographed. I've rarely seen a western shoot well (apart from the directors of Anthony Mann, who were all superbly photographed), that all locations have been carefully selected, and even the soundtrack fits in well with the picture. <br /> <br /> And director BROOKS is really a great storyteller. Master craftsmanship! He has made a lot of really great movies and has been successful in almost every genre imaginable, but even in a career as successful as this, THE LAST HUNT still seems to be one of his best, if not the best. <br /> <br /> Definitely deserves a higher rating compared to the 7-something that RIDE THE HIGH COUNTRY enjoys.
