I saw this movie without knowing what it was all about ... I'm a fan of Branagh, more of his Shakespeare films, and in the beginning I just saw it ... and I ended up crying in my movie Eyes because of the great, great serenity, appreciation and valiant philosophy about the life of Helena's girl. Recommended for people who are bored with TV programs (at least in Spain).
