Perhaps the last film you would expect to come from Vittorio de Sica and Cesare Zavattini (who wrote the novel on which this movie is based). It's really a neorealistic fantasy, a kind of oxymoron. An old woman finds a baby in her cabbage bed and tucks it up as her own son. After a few years the baby is a little boy (called Toto) and the adoptive mother dies. He goes to an orphanage, and when he finally turns 18, he leaves. Immediately he realizes that he has no home. Toto, however, is optimistic and does not settle for anything. A man steals his suitcase, and instead of annoying himself, Toto becomes his friend and goes with him to a small barn. Toto takes initiative and organizes the many homeless people in the area who make up a better sanctuary. Soon the landowner is trying to sell this property and Shantytown citizens need to protect themselves. After many attempts, the owner uses a police to get rid of the homeless. At this point the movie becomes full of fantasy (previously it was a comedic / fantastic melodrama in the style of Charlie Chaplin). This stuff is so weird and shocking that it's probably best for others to see it for themselves. It's pretty amazing and very funny. Certainly there are objections to the conspiracy of Miracle in Milan. Fellini and Visconti were heavily criticized when they deviated from neorealism. I think I read that this was widely criticized at the time of its publication. At this point it is so nice - I loved it very much. It could be my favorite of Vittorio de Sica's films, though Umberto D and The Bicycle Thieves are very, very close. 10/10.
