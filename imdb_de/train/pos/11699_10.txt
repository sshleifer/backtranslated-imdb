I've seen this movie a dozen times and it's great. But the only thing to do with that was that in the beginning too much was talked about who went out with whom. I think it would be interesting to make a remake of it. But on the official side, they said they will not do a remake because so many people were saved when they saw it. What happened to Patty Dunning now? She is a pretty good actress. She made a few other films in the 70s and 80s, but we have not heard from her since. I'm sure Thom Rachford, who plays Jerry, works at RD Films for accounting. But on the whole, I have to say that the show itself is like an old Left Behind school.
