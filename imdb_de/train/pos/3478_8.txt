This was actually my favorite series by Scooby Doo when I was younger. I thought that each episode had an advantage and the villains had a lot of creative thought (and even very scary and believable). Some of the best episodes were "I left my neck in San Francisco", "Twenty Thousand Cries Under the Sea", "The Ghoul, the Bat and the Ugly" and "If You Want a Star Creature". If you have never seen these episodes, please do so. This series was a bit mixed, as there were other episodes that did not appear to have the same edge as "Rocky Mountain YIIII!" and "The Ransom Of Scooby Chief". Like the series before it was very well put together, interesting plot and brilliantly drawn. As everyone says, it would have been so much better without Scrappy Doo. The figure was annoying and annoying for the story that was told.
