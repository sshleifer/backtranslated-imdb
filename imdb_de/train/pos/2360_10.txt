I found it very balanced to show what Jehovah's Witnesses have done to protect American freedoms. It also showed the firm belief of two families who were witnesses of the first generation. I also appreciated how it showed how someone who has become a Jehovah's Witness influenced family members without witnesses and how difficult it is for them to accept the fact that they do not celebrate holidays. The sad part is that families without witnesses do not think about having their witness family for family meals / visits or giving them gifts at other times, except on holidays or birthdays. When it comes to the medical care the witnesses expect, they expect a high standard of medicine. However, what is forgotten is that blood transfusions allow sloppy medical care and operations, while bloodless treatments result in the medical team being highly skilled and educated about what you prefer to treat your loved ones? I highly recommend this video!
