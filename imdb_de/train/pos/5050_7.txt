We really enjoyed Gray Owl: a simple story well told in classic Attenborough fashion: a little over-romantic, with archetypes, humor, and a stress on dignity and values. This is the true story of Archie, a native Indian lived in Canada and fell into the trap. <br /> <br /> Solid performances by everyone make this movie with an easy-to-understand message. <br /> <br /> Two of the movie's stars are undoubtedly the cutest we've ever seen - and the message is good with their environmental awareness. It was great to meet or read Gray Owl in the thirties, a unique character, and this is a fitting homage movie.
