In his directing debut, Denzel Washington picks up on a true story, which also happens to be a very difficult story, and brings it to the screen with an honesty that we expect from Washington's acting efforts, but now we see this touch as a director. <br /> <br /> Recently we saw some of the devastating consequences of children falling through the cracks of public protection. This story tells of a nightmare existence that leaves terrible scars, but in the end suggests the triumph of the human spirit. <br /> <br /> We can see some problems of the first effort with too many close-ups and not the best to work on these scenes, but the simplicity of other scenes that project such a force can not be underestimated. <br /> <br /> If the Academy overlooks this movie, it will be travesty. This film does not hit hard and goes to the cold hard facts of the story with a purity that does not normally go from a novel to a screen. This is, of course, a tribute to the director. <br /> <br /> This is a dandy, so take a look and tell your friends that you want to see it too!
