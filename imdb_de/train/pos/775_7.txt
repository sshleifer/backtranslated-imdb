It's a strange but somehow impressive story about love. Personally, I have never gotten over such a daunting story in real life. But I can imagine that there is one. <br /> <br /> It's a story that promises to be "sick" by the title. But after I saw it, I did not get the feeling of "illness," which I certainly would have in relation to the rules of society. There is something beautiful about this film, something impressive, that I can not contradict by using moral or social rules. <br /> <br /> The film focuses mainly on the relationship between Kiki and Alex. You can see how this relationship begins, develops and finally ends. You feel the moment when that love blossoms, the first whisper, touches. You feel the connection. And not a moment, though I'm immoral. They even hope that it will not break in the end ... it can not break ... it's not right. You feel the pain of being crushed in the end ... <br /> <br /> But I also have to add a negative twist to this comment ... I do not know if the story is not somehow * showed * to to give the feeling that these relationships are only in form, not contentwise sick. They do not have the whole story, just fragments. At the beginning of the film, the relationship between Kiki and Sandu already existed. No indication of the nature of the relationship. They only feel a tension between them ... a struggle between the need for love and the desire to break that relationship. I think this line from Kiki to Sandu says everything: "I want to stop ... and if you love me, you will do what I ask you". <br /> <br /> This film will probably address some questions about what is love and what should be moral ... and where is the line between them. I do not know if the idea of ​​this film is "love conquers all ... even social and moral standards" or "love is beautiful ... no matter how and where". But in my opinion, this film is already a success, for a simple reason, because it makes you think ...
