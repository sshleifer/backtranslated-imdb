I've read the book, and I have to say that this movie keeps its shape. I think that's the beginning of psychological thrillers in the same genre of psycho. Cristina Raines gives an outstanding performance as a lead actor, and Burgess Meredith a superb supporting actor as a neighbor next door. I've seen this movie at least twice and I think I'll buy both the book and the movie for my collection. The tension continues to grow until the climatic end, the turn you will never see coming. If you like movies like Signs and The Village, the Sentinel will be a classic start. The actors in the movie are also interesting - you would not recognize them if you had not read the credits. The late Jerry Orbach is great as a commercial director and Jeff Goldblum is an excellent photographer. Beverly D'Angelo is also undervalued, but great.
