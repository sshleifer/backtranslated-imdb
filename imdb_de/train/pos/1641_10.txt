I saw this on PBS 25 years ago. It was very hard to see. So real. To see this little family fight in winter was a heartbeat. No time to advertise: Fate has thrown us together and we put our shoulders to the grindstone for it to work. This was based on the actual diary of the woman that I read many years later. She said in her journal that her parents died when she was little, and all her relatives and sisters had to work on the farm to feed themselves. She learned to mow what did not look like a lady. She feared that no charming prince would have a woman with sun-tanned, calloused hands, but this husband was so happy that his new wife knew how to mow and she was happy. Both were widowed and together they worked to build a new home. It was so sad when the baby died. If they had it today, I would be sure it would have been good. That just makes the tragedy very sad. I cried so much. Then they went out and successfully pulled out a new calf. Spring is on the way and life goes on. In her diary she had two more boys and they lived.
