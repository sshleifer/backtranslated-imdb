Morgan Freeman and Paz Vega are the mismatched couples who get in the car and run errands as needed. Morgan Freeman is superbly human and related to everyone, while Paz Vega is the modified cashier behind the "10 Items or Less" control line, which intimidates clients and gets bored out of their heads. Explore together, discover and learn from each other. Of course they need to be vulnerable, interested in change, and have a sense of humor that they both have. I wish this movie was realistic, I wish this kind of story would be more common, I wish we did not have to go to the cinema to see that we could actually connect, even if we came from very different backgrounds. The message of the film is based on the open heart and makes us wonder about the possibility of another world in which we meet from there, a world in which peace could be possible.
