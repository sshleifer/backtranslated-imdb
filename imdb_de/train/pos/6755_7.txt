Ah, noir. My favorite genre. Otto Preminger's successor to "Laura" is a film noir that takes place in post-war New York, where corruption and violence are rife. It plays Dana Andrews as a sergeant Mark Dixon, a detective whose brutal tactics have led him with his superiors in hot water. <br /> <br /> When he accidentally kills a murder suspect, Dixon tries to blame crime boss Tommy Scalese. Dixon is about to reach his goal, as he deals with the dead woman, the beautiful Morgan Taylor. In a typical noir manner, of course, things go downhill quickly. <br /> <br /> Although the film does not do anything interesting in terms of camera or narration, it has a constant tone of fear and gloom. Like most big noirs, it's also a wonderful pace and attracts viewers from the beginning. <br /> <br /> As with most Preminger films, it's nothing that I would look at again. Wilder's verbal joke, Hitchcock's visual flamboyance or Welles's spatial experiment are missing. As with Lang's later work, "Sidewalk" feels more like a "clone" of what a noir should be, rather than something truly artistically real. <br /> <br /> Thematically, the movie is nothing special. It's about a cop who's starting to get criminal. In one scene, Dixon explains that his father himself was a little time-tricker who flirts the movie with the term predestination, but that one scene is ready, as Otto says, or dares to grab his ideas. <br /> <br /> The camera work is also disappointing. There is no intelligence in Otto's camera. No effort is made to assign anything to the camera. It does not play with the space or the architecture or continues the gradual police action. There are only tripod constellations with occasional retraction and extension. Pointless, though most people are not interested in these things. <br /> <br /> However, there is a good attitude in which our hero is trapped in a car full of gangsters (noir cage) that drives itself into a vehicle lift (another cage) and is taken into the main gangster lair , Like Lynch's "Blue Velvet" Otto retopologizes the film, constantly comparing "above" to hell. This works fine, but the set design can not reinforce it. <br /> <br /> 7/10 - Otto seems content to follow the Hawksian form of Noir instead of playing with Noir's possibilities. Like "Detour", "Night in the City", "Scarlet Street", "In a Lonely Place", "Violence", "Bomberang" and "Johnny Eager", "Where the Sidewalk Ends" is one of those second-level Movie Noirs made. It is competent and captivating, but lacks that special magic.
