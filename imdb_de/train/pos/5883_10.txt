I watched fascinated and fascinated by vocal and physical action. The roles each character played were outstanding. The lyrics, the words, every gesture, the sunrise said everything. It has enlightened me to a different perception of a person who believes in humanity. Who believes in peace and gentle behavior. I was also held in disbelief by the victims and human dignity portrayed. Power without mercy is demeaning and without feelings. To want power at the expense of mankind is so incredible. This movie has so scared me of the people who are no longer in this world. And sad, I think of her. I like this movie for the conversations and facial expressions. May this movie be blessed.
