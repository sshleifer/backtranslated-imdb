This movie is the first time that several people in the cast are experiencing a movie experience. All are experienced actors and have appeared in several television series and plays. Sahan Gokbakar is a well-known comedian in Turkey. It's kind of weird to see him in a thriller while he's at the peak of his comedy career in Turkey. This film is Togan Gokbakar's first long shot and pretty much the first experience as a director. But everyone has done a good job. We are happy about such an enthusiastic young cast. They seem promising for the future of the Turkish film industry. Doga Rutkay is a longtime mistress of Sahan Gokbakar. She is also a talented actress known for her latest play "Number 27" and several TV series.
