I thought The Grinch Stole Christmas was a pretty good movie. It was neither terrible nor great, but it was a pleasure to see it. I had the feeling that sometimes Jim Carrey got a little annoying. They Made The Grinch Look Like a special educationist, all he had to be was evil and insidious, but he turned out to be backward. I thought the scenery would be nice if she was not in the Grinch Cave, and there were some places I laughed, but most of the time I thought it was just annoying. This movie could have been "SO" much better if it had changed the personality of the Grinch, and he had some more laugh scenes with him because the humor was mostly not funny. I still liked it the way Grinch stole Christmas, but it is nothing exciting to see.
