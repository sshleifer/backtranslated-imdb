There are very few performers these days who can fascinate me through their presence throughout the movie. One of those few is Judy Davis, who has built a successful career by creating characters that are stubborn but very vulnerable at heart. She takes on roles that most other melodramatists would treat, adding a fiery, deeply emotional intensity that distracts attention from anything else on the screen. <br /> <br /> Her talents are well recognized in "High Tide," a film she meets with director Gillian Armstrong a second time, who gave Davis her first major success with "My Brilliant Career." In this film, Davis played a young woman who was determined to make it in the world, despite the suffocation she felt about her community and upbringing. In "High Tide," Davis' character, Lillie, is about the opposite: she gave up any hope for her future when she was young, and after giving birth to a child, runs after her responsibilities and takes a life without Direction or sense. When she finally meets her daughter years later, the thought of taking care of her child is petrifying. She knows that this is her chance to atone for her failures, but how can she be honest with her daughter and still be respected? Gillian Armstrong's films usually tell stories about characters who desperately want to communicate with everyone else, but face obstacles created by their own personal habits and dependencies. For example, "Oscar and Lucinda" was a man and a woman who desperately needed each other's love but were always blind because they craved gambling through their gambling addiction. Here we dive into the world of a family that is being torn apart because the mother is unable to profess a solid life, and her efforts to save herself, though we are fully convinced that it is too is late to change for the better. This is not just a movie with a great performance in the center, but also a rare achievement: an absolutely compelling story of redemption.
