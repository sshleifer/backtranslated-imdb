In Holland, a gay writer Gerard (Jeroen Krabbe) gives a lecture. He stays with a beautiful woman Christine (Renee Soutendijk) and has sex with her (imagining she is a boy). He plans to go the next day, but looks at a photograph of Christine's hunky friend Herman (Thom Hoffman) and decides to stay and try it out. Then things get strange. <br /> <br /> In 1983, a large X-rated art house was built in the US. Why was it rated X? Let's see ... there is strangulation, full male and female nudity at the front, castration, mutilation, simulated sex, a scene in a church with a cross that will shock most people, a gay sex scene in a crypt ... and all that comedy !!!!! Paul Verhoeven did that after "Spetters". "Spetters" was attacked by the critics because of their extreme sexual sequences and referred to as garbage. Verhoeven filled this film with a very obvious symbolism in which he felt critics would think it was art and praised it. He was right! Critics thought it was good that the movie did not know that Verhoeven had a lot of fun with it. Still, it's a great movie. <br /> <br /> It has been beautifully taken by Jan de Bont (now a director himself) and there are so many symbols and obvious "hidden" levels in the dialogue that you will never get bored. Acting is awesome - Crab plays an absolutely despicable character, but (somehow) one has chosen it; Soutendijk is simply stunning and plays her part to perfection - the small smile she gives when Gerard is ready to stay with her is daunting; Hoffman is very handsome with a great body - he deserves credit for making the church sequence and walking in the tomb with Crab. <br /> <br /> This is not for people who are easily offended or heart failure, but if you like extreme movies that challenge you playfully (like me), this is for you! A 10 all the way.
