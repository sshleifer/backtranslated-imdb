"To: The Warriors of the Magic Mountain" was and is an impressive classic! One would never have thought that it was made in 1983. Tsui Harks special effects were very creative and imaginative. (He went on to do so in the Chinese Ghost Story trilogy and later productions.) Even now, it can compete with other films in the genre. "Legend of Zu" is associated with "To" Warriors of the Magic Mountain. "It's not necessary to have seen this movie to understand the conspiracy of this movie The plot is a little hard to follow It's always action and adventure I've always wondered what Tsui Hark would do if he did CGI would get his hands on it Now we know he made that movie Maybe it's too much sometimes but the overall result is so nice that I will not be critical It's so much on the screen that you just have to I think it's a shame that this film was not shown here in the Netherlands Film screams for movie screen length! This movie can easily beat Hollywood productions like "Superman Returns" or Xmen 3. The only thing I have to In most of Tsui Hark's films, he combines drama, fantasy, martial arts and humor, somehow lacks this movie, again I will not be picky But these little things. " Legend of Zu "delivers the most beautiful special effects you'll ever see in the action section. A true classic!
