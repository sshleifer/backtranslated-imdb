Many people consider it a fan service movie because many superstars in this film (Gackt, Hyde and Wang Lee Hom) are a very famous singer in Japan. But do not judge it, before you pay attention, I say. Gackt and co-workers are very serious when they made this movie, and they worked so hard. It's a good movie with a sensitive story. Some scenes can be so funny and others are so sad. They did it so well until I can not stop looking at it all over again. <br /> <br /> The story has written pretty well, but I admit that their act is not very disappointing. This is especially true for Hyde because his acting is inferior to the other and it is strange to hear the way when he speaks with a language other than his mother tongue (Japan). But it's understandable, because this is the first time they are performing in the movie. <br /> <br /> I think Gackt is trying to show us how someone can be so weak if he loses the most important person in his life. When Toshi was killed when Sho Kei asked to make Yi-Che a vampire like him because he did not let her die. When Sho's brother died, Kei Shoot Son died and the best and most beautiful scene is When Sho ~ ~ I even said that Hyde's skill is still strange, but I give him two kicks on the scene! the local mafia and the enemy of Sho because she's a good friend in the past and Son is also Sho's brother-in-law. <br /> <br /> Whatever, I love this movie ~ (a lot ^^). <br /> <br /> This is an action film with a touching story.
