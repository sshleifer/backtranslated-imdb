Jazz lovers will appreciate this classic short film featuring some of the best men in jazz doing their thing. It's like watching a no-frills music video today. <br /> <br /> The jazzmen give us an extra treat in the person of Marie Bryant, who sings a classic version of On the Sunny Side of the Road. I had never heard her sing before, Bryant sounded remarkably like Billie Holliday. That's a compliment, folks. <br /> <br /> Your instrumental work is also a top performance. Since the black cinema of his time has fed many white stereotypes, this film can be seen and appreciated. No big production values, just a lot of good music.
