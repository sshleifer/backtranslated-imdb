It is well known that Gene Roddenberry, when he played Star Trek for the first time on NBC, had rejected the original pilot episode The Cage as "too cerebral." When the series was given another chance, Roddenberry thought it would be fun to use the events of the rejected episode as a canon, and wrote The Menagerie, which has the unique distinction of being the continuation of the style at the time, an uncoupled episode. This time, instead of exploring a new planet, Kirk and his crew are on Starbase 11, visiting the former Commander of the Enterprise, Christopher Pike (Sean Kenney). now terribly disfigured and paralyzed because of an accident. Pike joins his successor to a spaceship that has an unpleasant surprise: Spock, who used to serve under Pike, effectively hijacked the ship and set the direction for Talos IV, a planet that has since known the limits (punishment) is death) Pike and Spock's last visit 13 years ago. As a logical creature, Spock introduces himself naturally and arranges a court-martial to justify his actions. <br /> <br /> There's no need to say more about the plot as the rest will unfold Part 2. What really impresses is the way Roddenberry's connecting The Cage with the rest of it Star Trek Universe, by developing a certain kind of flashback (to say more, would be too much) that allows everyone to be on screen and off. To see what Trek could have been NBC the original project was not rejected. It's especially funny to see Jeffrey Hunter (who could not return in the menagerie) play Pike as a more serious captain than Kirk is normally, and Nimoy's early days as Spock, whose personality was not yet fully established: this is the only time throughout the series, the favorite volcano spontaneously grins from everyone. <br /> <br /> In short, not just a great "mystery" episode, but also a treat for those who do not bother tracking down The Cage in its original form (it's part of the boxing experience). Sets for season 3 available).
