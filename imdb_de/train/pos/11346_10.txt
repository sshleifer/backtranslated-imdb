I grew up with H. Pufnstuff and the raging talented Jack Wild, and now my daughters also love fans of Jack Wild. This movie is exactly what movies should be: fun and entertaining. This movie is not limited to children. Much of the dialogue is for adults, and Witchiepoo's performance is something you do not want to miss. The music in this movie went very well with Jack Wild and Mama Cass. And as a fan of Jack Wild I would never miss the opportunity to see him dancing or to hear him sing. The knowledge of the hard life Jack has now makes this movie even more wonderful, especially if he sings the opening song "If I Could". It makes me in loving worship for him, because he gives me wonderful childhood memories, which I now pass on to my children. Let's all go to Living Island, where there is friendship and fun! And keep Jack Wild's memory alive by sharing Pufnstuff with others.
