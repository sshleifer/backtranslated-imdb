I remember this movie from many years ago. Certainly the best movie on the subject in my experience. The fact that I remember the movie so much after such a long time testifies to its effect. <br /> <br /> Due to the language barrier, it is difficult to comment on the level of performance. Nevertheless, they were very powerful. <br /> <br /> This topic has also fascinated us over the years. And it was treated most effectively here, with the right amount of historical perspective and skepticism. I wish it was shown on TV at least once. Or at least be available on tape or DVD. Or is it? Is an art film archive hiding a copy of it?
