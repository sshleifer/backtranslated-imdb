A simple movie in the beginning, a simple movie in the end. It has this infinite and fake clich√©, but most TV movies have it. <br /> <br /> Christopher Reeve does a good job as an ex-con / drifter. The marriage between her and the woman he works for is a bit weird, in my opinion, but for the time she's being used, I think she's believable anyway. <br /> <br /> Well I've seen the edited 'tv' version, although the movie was made and shown on 'tv' I find that a bit strange as well. But I feel that if I saw the entirety of the piece, I would probably give it more the same rating. <br /> <br /> J.T. Walsh does a nice job, not his best role, but still ... a good job. <br /> <br /> 7/10
