I love horses and admire the hand-drawn animations, so I could not wait for Dreamwork's new animated image "Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron". You could say I was a bit disappointed. They have a wonderful animation and initially a seemingly perfect story. A story about absolutely nothing but a horse in nature. The animals do not sing cute songs or even speak - a big advantage. Unfortunately, the film has a narration not mentioned by Matt Damon; a sappy soundtrack by Bryan Adams; and enough action scenes to compare it to a Jerry Bruckheimer production. If the filmmakers had simply stayed, we would have a masterpiece here. This is not a great movie, but it is a good entertainment for little kids. I would recommend this movie to families because he has his heart in the right place and the only thing out there right now that does not offend little kids. Not bad, but could have been much better. Very nice visuals.
