While the story of a restless child boxing for self-esteem and anger is barely a new thing, the story here takes a new turn when the protagonist is a girl instead of a boy. <br /> <br /> Diana has problems at school. She just can not stay away from fighting. At home, her father keeps putting her off. Her brother trains boxing in a gym and one day, when she picks him up, she decides that she wants to work out as well. <br /> <br /> It would be easy to call this movie "Rocky with Girls", I think. But that's not what it's all about. The story benefits from the fact that the main character is more of a girl than a boy. That way you can solve more problems all at once. First the problem that she is not accepted because she is not a girlie girl, and then when she goes to the boxing studio, because she is a girl at all. It's also a story about how a purpose can change a person's life. How positive can you grow? I do not want this to sound presumptuous because the movie does not feel overbearing, but what I say is true. <br /> <br /> Michelle Rodriguez is also very good in the lead role. It's really a shame that she's now stuck in the typography of the "tough girl", because that's really not what her part in "Girlfight" is about. Sure, she's a female boxer, but it's the more sensitive moments that really make her shine. <br /> <br /> Maybe this is your average underdog story with a twist, but Rodriguez puts it well above the crowd. Performance. I rate that at 7/10.
