Animation always seems to be an edge. This may not be the case in Japan, but in Europe and much more in the US, Animation has a big, fat "KIDS" tag. France is probably one of the more weird-liberal countries, home to classics like tin-tin, Asterix, Lucky Luke, Valereon, etc. (if you've never read it, it's not too late.) There's no upper age limit. ) She and she do not wear the nerd stigma of DC or Marvel.) It seems quite natural that a movie like this one appear in France. It fits in with my biased image of the French as art-loving, anti-US and talented filmmakers. Fortunately, there is also "A scanner darkly" to suppress this view - art seems to be quite international. <br /> <br /> Anyway, as you may have guessed, Renaissance is artistic and French. If you are a normal person, you will be scared. That is not necessary! Under the cool, slim, cell-shady appearance, there's a good thriller and a good movie overall. <br /> <br /> That was one of my fears for this movie. It's so easy to turn the spectacular animation into a gimmick, like Sony and C: o with their Pixar prints. I expected a confusing, sometimes boring and unappealing movie, but luckily I was wrong. <br /> <br /> I would have enjoyed it anyway for the neo-noir stuff, but it was good that it was worth the level as well. NOTE: I have seen the French dub that was okay so far. English could be more interesting with Craig and everything. <br /> <br /> One last praise for the animation. It was fantastic. Futuristic, well-made, beautiful camera work, intelligent solutions (eyes, for example, looked very good, which is hard to do) and so visually stunning that I felt, "That's so damn impressive!" On the other hand, I like animations a lot and I appreciate the effort the studio has made, so my judgment is a bit biased. <br /> <br /> Good movie anyway, definitely he lives beyond his "gimmick".
