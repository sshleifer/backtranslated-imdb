This movie shows the worst part of the surviving war, the memories. For many soldiers, men and women, returning home can be the beginning of real problems. I am reminded of my father and his brothers, who returned from the Second World War. For one of my uncle, the war was never over. He survived the D-Day invasion, much like the first 20 minutes of Saving Private Ryan. For him, the memories not only remained but tormented him. He became an alcoholic, as did some of my cousins, his sons. Jump 60 years forward and place the soldiers in another war, in another country, the result is the same. When I saw this at KC FilmFest, I was reminded that there are some things about war that never change. The idealistic young men and women will not be spared the emotional agony of Iraq, and especially if you oppose the war, you will be more sympathetic to the local soldiers trying to do what they think is right or wrong right. <br /> <br /> The tagline from the Vietnam war movie Platoon says it all. "The first casualty is innocence."
