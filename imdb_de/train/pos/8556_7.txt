This movie is just fun. I have nothing to do with the original America Pie, but it's fun to watch. <br /> <br /> Another try, but better than Band Camp and The Naked Mile, at least funnier. <Just after the first five minutes, I laughed out my ass, so I decided to call my friend, and we saw it together. We had some beer and had fun. <br /> <br /> You will not get a deep message in this film, but it's worth looking at. <br /> <br /> So, sit back and just enjoy it.
