I never met a single person (out of hundreds) who hated this movie. Bet that anyone who rejects it is a little saboteur or a victim of one. This movie has everything. Ask yourself, "Are you a fan of ...?" Then go to "Laputa". <br /> <br /> It's not my favorite movie, but my favorite movie is directed by the same person (Hayao Miyazaki). In any case, this is one of my top five. And I have seen many movies.
