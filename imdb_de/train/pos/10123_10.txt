Shinjuku Triad Society: It is unlikely that Chinese mafia wars will be spread outside the film festivals in the West. Why? Could your censors get in the way of a movie in which cops anal rape male and female suspects to make them talk (and the victims enjoy it) or an old lady gets his eye ripped? These are just a few of the shocks awaiting viewers of this ultraviolet tale of cops and gangsters. This makes Clockwork Orange, banned for years in the UK, look like a Disney cartoon. <br /> <br /> Should you watch this movie? YES It is fantastic and indispensable for fans of Asian cinema. The shocking moments show what's going on in the world of these characters. If you like this, make sure you catch Dead or Alive, which is very similar (apart from the insane ones that naturally end in DOA). Great for Japan, that they have a talent like Miike who works at the same time as Takeshi Kitano. The best chance to see this film outside of a Takashi Miike retrospective at a film festival is on DVD. If I do not want to scare you off, look for a Hong Kong version on the internet, as I'm sure she will appear in that country.
