Yes, it is a low budget. Yes, it's one of Candy's first films, but it's perhaps its funniest! John Candy was not far from his SCTV days in "Going Berserk" and that shows. If you do not hurry, if Candy tries to help a man with his food while being tied to a fledged cohort while having sex with his girlfriend and just separating the front door (or?)) Or the way How Euguene Levy (the creator of Kong Fu Yu) phoned his mother, or just the countless facial expressions that only Candy could give you to control your heart rate! If you like the John Candy of "Only the Lonely," this may not be a movie I'd recommend, but if you enjoy John Candy's SCTV days, this movie is a must!
