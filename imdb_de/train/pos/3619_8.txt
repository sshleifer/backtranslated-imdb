Despite Disney's best efforts, this is a pretty entertaining film about pursuing your dreams. I was surprised that it did not seem overly sentimental to me. This movie was fair. Dennis Quaid was very, very good in the role that says something for a sports movie. I can not remember how many sports movies had little quirks that bother me. everyone here looks the part. This movie is surprisingly good and I expect it will do some surprising business, as it's a G-rated movie where the viewer does not have to stop thinking. Ebert on the contrary, this film is a success.
