Another reason to watch this wonderful movie is Florence Rice. Florence who? That was my first reaction when the opening credits ran on the screen. I quickly found out who Florence Rice was. A real beauty, which takes place in a simply wonderful performance. Like all in this enthralling ensemble. It's a different time from 1939, but that's where the charm lies. It puts you in another world. It starts out as a light comedy, but then becomes very serious. Florence Rice ranges from Comedienne to the heroine. She is absolutely adorable, at the same time strong and vulnerable and develops from a girl to a woman. Watch her face at the end of the movie. She has made over forty films and I will search the other thirty-nine. Alan Marshal is in Flynn / Gable mode and fits perfectly with Florence. Buddy Ebsen and Una Merkel offer great comic moments, but the real star is Florence Rice. Fans of 30s / 40s movies, do not miss them!
