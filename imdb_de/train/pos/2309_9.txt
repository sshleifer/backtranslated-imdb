It changed life, it really was !!! The Man In The Moon is a breathtaking experience. The acting was amazing, the plot was great and this was a perfect start to Reese Witherspoon's career See how someone can not love this movie. Sure, it's not the best movie ever, even though it was close, but it was very amusing to watch, and I even had a blast at one of the jokes. Many other little laughs. Of course there were some heartfelt screams, but this movie was enlightening and it brightens up your day even though you occasionally need to be a bit depressed of the story. I can not believe that this movie did not win at least one award, and I can not believe that so few people saw it on this site. Watch this movie, if you have not done that, it's definitely touching.
