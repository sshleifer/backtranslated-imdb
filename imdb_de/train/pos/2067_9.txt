While it is generally acknowledged that Fearful Symmetry is heavily influenced by the Kolchak episode "They were, they are, they will", whether this is a rip off or a tribute, it is a controversial point. As a big fan of the two series, I subscribe to the latter belief, even though the lesser-profit organizations may not. James Whitmore was brave enough to take on the task of running such a difficult episode, invisible elephants and gorilla suits sound like a disaster recipe, but he does it in style, the teaser is an absolute gem. Lance Guest does a great job of making a credible character out of Kyle Lang, and Jack Rader looks threatening as Ed Meecham. Forget the dubious originality of the fearsome symmetry and simply enjoy it as a deeply satisfying X file.
