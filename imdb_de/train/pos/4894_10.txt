I grew up in the time when the music was popular in this movie. What a wonderful time for music and dancing! My only complaint was that I was a bit too young to go to the USO and nightclubs. It sounds like I live in the past (I have wonderful memories). What's wrong with it? !!? World War II was a terrible time, except when it came to music. Glenn Miller's death was a terrible sadness for us. This movie will be a favorite of mine. Clio Laine was excellent; what a voice! I do not know how I ever missed this movie. My main reason for commenting is to make the modern generation aware of an alternative to rap and new age music, which is an insult to me. Please watch this movie and give it a chance!
