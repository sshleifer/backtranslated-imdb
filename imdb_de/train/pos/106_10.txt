The first Trier movie I ever saw was to break the waves. Certainly a nice movie, but it is definitely in the shadow of Europe. Europe tells the story of a young German-American who wants to experience Germany shortly after World War II. He accepts a job that his uncle has organized as a Purser in a luxury train. Because of his job, he travels through the almost completely destroyed Germany, meets with the murder of traitors and searches for former Nazi Party members. The society suffers from corruption. His uncle has cut his consciousness by focusing on the work he has as a purser on the train. By accident, the main character of a group called "werewolves" in bombing and terrorism involved. They are putting pressure on him to put bombs on trains. The atmosphere is amazing. The viewer is led from scene to scene by a man trying to put the viewer under hypnosis and then count to wake you in a new scene. Only if you think you have seen a lot !!!!!!! Europe!!
