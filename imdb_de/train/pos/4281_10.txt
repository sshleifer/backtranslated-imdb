One of my favorite movies. I do not know if there is someone in our country who has not seen this movie yet! It's funny and in some moments sad ... I do not know how people around the world (have had the opportunity to watch the movie) have accepted the movie because they have some moments in our Serbian history and the character of the Serbs to get to know each other The first half of the 20th century, to understand it! But as I see here, there is someone from Canada who saw it ... and he liked it. <br /> <br /> I think I will try to put all the good quotes from the movie on this page, but first you'll find out how it works ... <br /> <br /> Cheers.
