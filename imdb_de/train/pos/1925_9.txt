This is one of the best comedies on TV right now. It takes the sweet idea of ​​a show that revolves around a close family and turns it into a fairly realistic but witty portrayal of a typical family of sibling and parent toys, roast brothers, fathers, and bimbo sisters. I'm almost surprised it's Disney. <br /> <br /> In his opinion, '8 Simple Rules' know that it's a comedy and does not try to be more. Too many shows (like 'Sister, Sister' and 'Lizzie McGuire') think that just because their protagonists are now teenagers, they should tackle social issues and, in the end, lose their sense of humor by beating them too hard. This is a trap that has avoided 8 simple rules; Although it treats some problems (for example, as an outsider of the school), but it is fun. In fact, it was the only time it was really serious, understandably, as it sensitively handled the tragic death of John Ritter and his character. <br /> <br /> And I think even though John Ritter is sadly missing because he was the cause The show made itself felt, "8 Simple Rules" can still work well if she remembers her humor and Cates Father does not turn into a second version of Paul Hennessy.
