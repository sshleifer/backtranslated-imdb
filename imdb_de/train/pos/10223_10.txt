* some spoilers * <br /> <br /> I was pleasantly surprised that the sharp reviews (acting, dated dialogue, unclear plot) were unfounded. Belafonte is great as a brandoesque, a menacing, swearing spirit who has to earn his wings but is realistically ill-equipped to do so. He learns too late how empty his hectic, materialistic life was without love. Mostel is as good as a desperate man with his dying wife Fanny. Despite his prayers for a miracle, his bitterness prevents him from accepting (or believing) one. The two social worlds that represent the characters collide and complement each other, the result is hilarious and touchingly sad. <br /> <br /> The startling ending is actually quite in tune with the rest of the movie. After searching everywhere for Belafonte, Mostel looks up to see a falling feather and desperately tries to pretend that he is finally ready to believe in angels and miracles. But Belafonte was not allowed to finish his miracle (either to restore Fanny's health or Mostel's beliefs), so he never got his wings. The feather hovers sarcastically from Mostel's grip, a metaphor for the lives of both men: it's too late and you have no second chance. Like "It's a wonderful life," this movie is magical, wonderful, funny, but terribly tragic.
