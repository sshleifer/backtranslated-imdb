Brilliant! My wife and I joined the sprawling series to see Holly at the Edinburgh Film Festival. After watching the movie, I can understand why there was such a long line. Holly is a touching story about an impossible connection between two people. She is a young girl, he is a beaten Westerner. The film seized every bone in our body. There are no graphic scenes or anything that's hard to see - it's the surrealism of normalcy that really gets you in the guts. The movie is beautifully shot. Among other things, we loved the scene in which Patrick teaches Holly to ride a small motorcycle. Thuy Ngoyen's rudeness (I can not believe this is her first acting job) and Ron Livingston's performance stayed with me for a few days. Highly recommended.
