I was also present at the premiere in Toronto. This movie was a kind of comfort when I thought I could not see my first choice. Well, I was totally excited. When I got to the theater, I could not remember anything but the basic plot of the movie (yes, I actually forgot who was there at all). Great performances of the entire cast. Carrie-Anne Moss was great in a true departure from her time as Trinity. As far as Billy Connolly is concerned, I do not think so, since Chaplin has played an actor so brilliantly without playing lines. The kids were great too. Be sure to check if you have the chance. <br /> <br /> And by the way, I saw my first choice anyway - and that was much better.
