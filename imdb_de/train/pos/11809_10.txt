Dick Tracy was not the best for many comic fans because they wanted something with blood like Batman. Dick Tracy plays the innocence of being just a comic book, with bad guys who have heavy appearances and are fun. Warren Beatty leads and plays the lead role fighting crime without using superpowers. I've liked Dick Tracy since childhood because of the weird atmosphere of the main colors: red, blue, orange, yellow, green and black. This is the perfect movie everyone can watch with their children. Al Pacino is like Jack Nicholson in Batman and plays Big Boy Caprice with zeal. Madonna as a baby, who is the second villain in this movie, does not play the same toy she represents. Like I said, no blood, obscenities, sexual references or anything that offends someone.
