The Perfect Son is a story of two brothers who are just over 30, one who seems to be "perfect" and the other, who is basically a ridicule and often lands in drug rehabilitation centers. After the death of her father, the two are brought together after a long absence and the usual sibling rivalries appear. Only when the "perfect" brother makes the startling discovery that he suffers from AIDS does the irresponsible younger brother finally take the step of putting his life in order and taking responsibility, a nice job to record the younger brother's "comeback" Even if it sometimes seems a bit far-fetched (to beat a drug addiction is never so easy). What makes the movie more delicate is the treatment of AIDS, a topic that has become a bit of a hit in the cinema for the last five to ten years. And the development of an almost sweet relationship between the two formerly hostile brothers is very credible and well done. The two leading actors were both very competent, if not terribly charismatic. <br /> <br /> A solid premiere of director and writer Leonard Farlinger, whose own brother died of AIDS. The end is well done too. <br /> <br />
