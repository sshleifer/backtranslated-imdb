So Fox pulled the plug right through a drama / puzzle ... <br /> <br /> How lame is that? Do you expect us to invest our time in their new shows when there is a realistic risk of never finding out what happens? Why were the remaining, already filmed episodes not aired in the US? They were aired elsewhere. <br /> <br /> Hey, Fox! Do you hear? This was a great show, but you let us down. If you want to introduce new dramas / mysteries, make at least one conclusion before ending the topic abruptly. Every time such a thing happens (and there seems to be a lot happening to you - H. Fox), there are more of those who "wait and see" before investing their time. This means that you are seeing an artificially low interest rate and are likely to finish the series sooner. See? It is a doom-loop. Do not let us down again ...
