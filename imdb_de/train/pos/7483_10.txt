Vanilla Sky is a remake of 2001 from the movie Abre Los Ojos (Open Your Eyes) from 1997. And in my opinion a much more human and emotional version. Tom Cruise plays David Aames, a selfish egomaniac who takes the feelings of others for granted and only thinks of himself. Jason Lee plays Brian Shelby, David's best and in many ways the only friend. Penelope Cruz plays Sofia Serrano, Brian's girlfriend, who accompanies him to David's birthday party. Cameron Diaz plays Julie Gianni, David's occasional buddy. Kurt Russell plays dr. Curtis McCabe, a psychologist who interviews David. All of their interactions and consequences make Vanilla Sky one of the most emotional and complex thrillers ever made. I will not explain the story anymore, because the less you know, the more convincing it is. Ignore all people who call this movie too confusing to follow. If you are careful, you will not be confused. The movie is very complex, but not confusing. And in my opinion one of the best movies ever.
