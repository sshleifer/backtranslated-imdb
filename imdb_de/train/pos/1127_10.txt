I have seen IPHIGENIA only once almost 30 years ago, but it has been haunting me ever since. <br /> <br /> A sequence is particularly remembered and could only have been designed by a great director, as Michael Cacoyanis undoubtedly is. <br /> <br /> The context: The weight of history and a powerful army and fleet lie on the shoulders of King Agamemnon. An act of sacrilege has calmed the seas and endangered his great expedition to Troy. He is told that he must sacrifice his daughter Iphigenia for Apollo to win the wind for the sails of the Thousand Ships. He initially resists, but comes to himself and outwits his wife Clytemenstra to bring their daughter to the Greek camp, to marry the greatest of all warriors, Achilles, sacrifices and rages the gods for protection and revenge. Meanwhile, the proud Achilles discovers that his name was used in this deceitful, dishonest way. He climbs a hill to tell Iphigenia that he will protect her. <br /> <br /> The setting: The camera circles the two teenagers without looking directly at each other. They lament their fate and the weakness of the people who deceive their loved ones and yearn for war. Suddenly they look at each other and for a moment we both feel their power and beauty as well as the unspoken - except through the camera - irony that in another time they might love and marry in another place. It is a sharp and sad epiphany that only lasts for a moment. <br /> <br /> Which direction! Which camera! What a storytelling!
