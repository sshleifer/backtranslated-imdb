What can I say about the first movie of all time? <br /> <br /> You can not rate this because it should not be entertaining. But if you need to rate it, you should give a 10. It is impressive to see moving pictures from 1895. I wonder what it was like to be one of the people who ever saw the first movie! <br /> <br />
