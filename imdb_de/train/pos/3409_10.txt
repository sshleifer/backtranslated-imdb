North Africa in the 1930s. In a small Arab town on the edge of the Sahara comes a beautiful woman, who is looking for a sense of her life, and a pretty Trappist monk, who flees from his religious crisis. They will meet and passions will be touched, but not even the Sand Diviner knows if they will find happiness or mourning here at THE GARDEN OF ALLAH. <br /> <br /> The plot is hokum pure, but the movie is still fun and beautiful to watch. Marlene Dietrich and Charles Boyer are a great movie couple. She is, to put it simply, great, and Boyer gives an extremely effective, unobtrusive performance by blaming his sensitive face for his acting. <br /> <br /> The minor cast is excellent: Basil Rathbone in a sympathetic role as a count who loves the desert; Joseph Schildkraut as a friendly, talkative leader (all "Arabs" he and others talk about in the film are pure gibberish); Lucile Watson as the gentle matron of the mother; Alan Marshal as honorable young French officer; Tilly Losch as a dangerous dancer; Henry Brandon as a comic book porter; John Carradine as the mysterious Sand Diviner; and the great Sir C. Aubrey Smith as a wise old priest. <br /> <br /> Film crew members will recognize Helen Jerome Eddy as a nun; Marcia Mae Jones & Bonita Granville (peering over the nun's shoulder) as a monastic girl; Stallion Nigel De Brulier as a lecturer in the monastery; and Ferdinand Gottschalk as a hotel employee, all uncredited. <br /> <br /> Color films from the 1930s are both rare and sexy, and this film is no exception - the cinematography is as colorful as the desert itself. THE GARDEN OF ALLAH was the first Technicolor film to feature was filmed on site. Yuma, Arizona, gave the filmmakers all the sand dunes they could wish for, but contaminated drinking water and 135 degrees of heat soon made the company rebellious. When the daily rushes showed that Boyer's face had burned a bright tomato red, producer David O. Selznick finally gave in. The rest of the movie was filmed on a Hollywood stage.
