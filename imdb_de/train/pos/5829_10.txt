This is one of my two or three favorite Stooges shorts, and undoubtedly the best performance of Christine McIntyre with the trio. She's good in a bunch of other shorts but here she is absolutely brilliant. Their singing is not funny at all, in fact it is downright beautiful, but the plot is constructed in such a way that the vocals reinforce the humor and do not distract from it. We hear McIntyre singing the entire Voice of Spring no less than three times, but she never grows old, partly because we do not tire her voice, partly because she blends so well with the Stooges' antics. The use of opera soprano in a comedy reminiscent of Kitty Carlisle's role in the Marx brothers "A Night At The Opera", but the vocals are much more part of the comedy than in "Opera" and McIntyre (maybe more) in other performances than here ) she showed a comedic talent that Carlisle never did. The antics of the Stooges, McIntyre's vocals and a well constructed storyline combine for 5 out of 5 stars.
