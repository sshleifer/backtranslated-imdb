My mother and I were on our way home from a trip to the northeast (mainly Massachusetts) when we decided to take a little detour to a Boston film festival. Well, I do not know much about film, so I thought that might be instructive. The first movie we saw was this movie, THE ROMEO DIVISION. Well, I do not know about you, but I thought that was great! I'm from Texas and where I come from, we do not see too many moving pictures, so this was a pleasant surprise. My mother insisted it was too violent, but said I did not know much about what she said, but this was a great picture. I was shocked by the fighting sequences that were great. I'm also a big fan when the good guys win, so I was thrilled when the Romeo ladies killed all the bad guys. That was true brilliance. I'm not sure when it will be posted on video, but if you get the chance, try it. I think you will be pleasantly surprised. A word to the wise, it is quite violent and there are many bad words, so you do not want to watch your children. It is more for adults.
