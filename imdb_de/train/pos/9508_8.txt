In a poor village in Mexico, the colonel (Fernando Luján) lives with his asthmatic wife Lola (Marisa Paredes) in an old house. Lola mourns the death of her son Augustin some time ago. The colonel has been waiting for his wrestling pension for almost twenty-seven years in a war against the Catholic Church. For political reasons, however, the current government wants to forget about this old struggle. Without possessions or money, but a valuable struggle for survival, they struggle for survival with the expectation of the recognition letter of the government, the recognition of the law and the payment of the delayed pension. This slow and touching film reflects the social and financial situation of most older retirees in Third World countries. In Brazil, most retirees have to survive at around $ 80 a month. The chief's debt in history was made to pay for a cemetery for his son, otherwise he would be buried as a needy. Outstanding performance of the cast, in a very sad story that is reality in poor countries. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): (`Não se Escreve et al. Coronel ') (Do not write to the Colonel) <br /> <br />
