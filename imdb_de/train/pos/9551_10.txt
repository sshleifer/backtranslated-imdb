I have to say, I was surprised with the quality of the film. It was much better than I expected. Scenario and drama is pretty good. The director also did a good job. Although some scenes look awkward, it's overall a decent movie. The idea was definitely awesome and the truth was only revealed at the end. The psychiatric atmosphere was pretty good. The plot was clear, consistent and well thought out. However, some people find it boring because the story is very focused and they take time for character and story development. Moral of the story, it's a decent movie for its genre and it's amazingly good.
