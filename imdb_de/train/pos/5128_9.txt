Let me first say I'm not from the South, but I'm American. I do not love country music, but I can stand it. I would never wear a cowboy hat, but I wear hats. I do not live in a caravan, but I eat tuna salad and own a house. What does this have to do with this comment? Much if you are one of those who say only "country people" love this movie. This film is loosely based on the premise "you loved and lost". James Bridges conducts an American love story as real as it gets. In an era of Jerry Springer and the attitude of "Let's be out there," this movie sounds more true than ever. <br /> <br /> Bud becomes "of age" and begins his own life with the help of his aunt and uncle, which is why he moves with them to the big city. Bud moves into the local hectic world, the only escape a worker can afford. He quickly meets Sissy, who comes from a similar background, and they both have a wild romanticism filled with painful ups and downs. <br /> <br /> (* This action takes so many moves that you only have to sit for a few minutes before they become addicted. "Marriage is a focus that is often overlooked." Early in the film, they marry and we see The film shows some of the modern struggles a woman has when marrying an old-fashioned man, and puts the male ego in perspective with women and competition.) <br /> <br /> Bud is challenged and excited when Micky's uses an electronic bull. Sissy also has the idea to enjoy it, but is quickly reminded that she is married and has to start behaving "like that". The emotions between the two characters are harsh and expressive, and the plot continues, especially when they split (NOTE THAT SOME STORYLINE GETS OFF) and Sissy falls in love with an ex-cheater with a penchant for abuse and cruelty , She soon realizes that the grass on the other side is not always greener. <br /> <br /> How to compare Bud with Vinnie Barbirino is shocking to me. John Travolta gave an exceptional performance that deserves recognition. He was believable and real. The scene where he shaves his beard, and you see him first in the bar ... still gives me goose bumps. I'm not a big fan of Travolta, but I can see why Sissy stepped out of her boots so early in the movie. Deb Winger was so real that you sympathized with her when she confronted Bud with a sense of emotion after she had sucked herself into his house during the breakup. <br /> <br /> The side occupation was incredible. Wes played by Scott Glenn gave a first-class performance that made her hate and curse him when he abused Sissy. Madolyn Smith-Osborne, when Bud's Mistress / girlfriend was so authentic that big girls with breasts everywhere in the US prayed to be woken flat to wear the clothes she wore in the movie. My biggest kudos go to Barry Corbin and Brooke Anderson as Bud's aunt and uncle. They seemed to be someone's aunt and uncle somewhere in Texas, and as small as they were, they made the movie so much bigger and more lifelike. Two memorable scenes were the Dolly Parton contest and the memorable scene in which Bud and his aunt stand outside after a death of the characters. The dialogue between them is touching. <br /> <br /> If you can see what it is, a true American love story. Then I recommend you take it for what it is ... a movie ahead of time that gave us voyeurism in a world different from our own, but really enough for our enjoyment and entertainment. If this world resembles yours, you will have so much more fun. The music is outdated, but will surely send you back if you are over 30 years old.
