Do not listen to the critics, this is a gem! The young rich Joan and her brother are destitute after the death of their father - and now they have to make a living! She becomes a reporter, of course, and of course, he is a driver for the mob! Through wild coincidences, her career meets thanks to gangster Clark Gable. In the meantime, there is a chance that a moonlight underwear will be swimming for some pretty young things, and Joan can do some risky dance numbers (with the grace of a steam shovel). <br /> <br /> But none of this should be taken seriously - it's all a lot of fun from those wonderful days before coding when Hollywood was really naughty. Joan looks great and shows much of the emotional range that would give her career such longevity (thank God she interrupted the dance!). Gable is notable as a slimy gangster - he was not a star yet and did not have to be the hero. Nice that he plays something else. And William Bakewell is excellent as the confused poor brother. And there are some great montages and tracking footage provided by director Harry Beaumont, who is bringing the piece along at breakneck speed - and occasionally winking at the audience! Have fun!
