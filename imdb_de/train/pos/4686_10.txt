This is by far my favorite movie of all time. This is mainly because there is no fear of exploring some very politically incorrect topics (such as spanking and female subservience) that are just too timid to other mainstream films. Nothing seems to be banned in this film as the director freely develops the story without possibly offending the viewer. However, I do not believe that nothing was done here to increase the level of shock or deliberately offend someone. Sean Young shows a great and courageous performance. Most established mainstream actresses would not have taken on this role or would have requested some major script changes before accepting them. The other actors also do a good job. <br /> <br /> Did you notice that this movie has not been on Pay Cable since a compulsory short run of one year after it hit the cinemas? Have you ever wondered why? The obvious reason is that it simply does not fit the current political atmosphere. It seems ironic to me that some premium channels now carry softcore porn (this is getting closer to hardcore porn), but not a mainstream movie like "love crimes". Although this film is only 11 years old, it unfortunately could not be shot today. <br /> <br />
