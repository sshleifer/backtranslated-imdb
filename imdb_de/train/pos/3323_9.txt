I received this movie about a month ago and am now a fan of Drew Barrymore. I love a happy ending and this movie gives a brilliant with the truths of Red Sox! It's about a math teacher who takes some promising kids on a math trip to a company where the successful Lindsey (Drew) shows them information. This then leads to the Ben (teacher) and Lindsey dating. But it is not easy when he confesses that he is a massive Red Sox fan. <br /> <br /> First of all, everything is fine, but then his baseball disturbs Lindsey's life. In the end everything is fine and it took a shot until Drew ran across the field !! I got it for two pounds in Blockbusters, so I was happy. If you like movies like this one, I suggest you watch more of Drew's work like Charlie's Angels and 50 first dates or even her new movie with Hugh Grant in Music and Lyrics.
