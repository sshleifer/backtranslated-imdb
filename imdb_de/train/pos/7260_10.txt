Hello everyone, my name is Larissa. I am 13 years old when I was about 4 years old. I look at curly complaints and it has hit my socks. I have seen this movie for a long time. I just made it about 30 minutes ago. Alisan Porter is a really good actor and I love this movie. It's so funny when she hands out the cards. Every time I watch this movie in the end, I cry. I know I'm only 13 years old, but it's such a touching story. It's really strange that Alisan is now 25 years old. Every time I see a movie someone is always young and the movie appears like a year after he made it, and if you look at it and find out how old the person in the movie really is, it's a wound, like they can go from one age to another Next. Like Harry Potter. This movie was great as well, but still Daniel was about 12 years old in the first movie and I was about 11 years old. How could he go from 12 to 16 years in four years and I'm only 13 years old. I'm not sure if he's I'm 16 now, I think he's almost 18, but that's weird if you look at a movie and the next one is about 4 years old when you were only 1 last year , I'm not sure if I have a big movie fantasy and I like to revile it. I'm a kind of computer person, but I also like a lot of kids things. I'm very smart like a curly lament in the movie, but one thing I do not like in the movie is when the guy calls the nursing home and makes curly complaints that I would kill the guy if he really did in real life , Well, I will stop writing. I know that sometimes I write a lot, but children have a lot in their minds who have to get out, and if they do not, children will never learn. <br /> <br /> Larissa
