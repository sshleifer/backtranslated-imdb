Steve Carrel Tried and tested in this wonderful, original, raw breath in the fresh air. I behaved myself how awesome it was. <br /> <br /> Basically, the title of the movie says it all: Andy Stitzer is a 40-year-old man who works in an electronics store. He's a bit of a nerd who loves video games and comics and has the biggest collection. His colleagues working with him in the shop find he's a virgin while he's filled with a pretty sexual dialogue, and then Andy has to go through a weirdly funny Odyessy of rude sexual revivals, but always screwed up, what happened to him does not lose his virginity, but in the end he becomes happy. <br /> <br /> Leave the little ones at home, but take the whole family with them to see this fantastic romance comedy. It will addict and break you from the beginning, and when it's over, you'll want to wear your extra thick absorbent underwear. The only thing I can say is that Steve Carrel was not recognized as Australian 20 years ago. He will definitely make the best breakthrough at MTV Movie Awards in the years to come. You can bet your hard-earned dollar, folks! <br /> <br /> I give this a perfect 10!
