The music of Albeniz permeates this movie. Every now and then it is played with original instruments (eg piano, but never full orchestra), but often it is reworked with various contemporary ensembles (eg guitars) and treatments (eg jazz pianos). Only occasionally the music is the only focus of the film: In the vast majority of music different dances are played, often flamenco, but not always. I would guess that it is 12 ?? There are 14 scenes that are not united by an action. Not all scenes reach the height for a single viewer. In my case, about half reached the top, although all others were very good in their own way. Those who worked for me moved me to goosebumping aesthetic pleasure; In fact, the last scene made me cry for joy. And in a very magical way, it brings you deeply into Spanish culture. If you do not like subtitles, do not worry. The film is virtually wordless, though each scene bears the title of an Albeniz piece. The look on this very beautiful film sharpens my complaint that virtually none of the films by Saura in the US are available on DVD. I'm thinking especially of his flamenco version of "Carmen", a spectacular piece of art that's available in Europe, but not here (European DVDs can not be played on American DVD players). That's a scandal.
