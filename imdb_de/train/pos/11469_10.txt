Everyone knows about this Zero Day event. I think that this movie did not do the elephant is that they let us see how those guys were. They showed their lives for about a year. We will like them throughout the movie and laugh with them, even though we know what they will do. And that gives me the goose bumps. Because I felt guilty for being fired on by her comments, and I just thought Cal was a sweet guy. Although I KNOW what happened, you know? Even at the end of the movie, when they were committing suicide, and I just decided to do it with 3 or 4, I thought it was funny, but still I was horrified to see how their heads were blown off. Of course I was. I have to like her. They may have been evil, but I felt like they were really normal guys and that they did not really understand. But I knew that they were. <br /> <br /> That is, IMO, the main force of this movie. It makes us realize that our friends or relatives or anyone else can plan something crazy and that we will not even notice it. This movie, good as it was, made me feel bad. And that's why I can not sleep now. There is still that little feeling in my stomach. butterflies
