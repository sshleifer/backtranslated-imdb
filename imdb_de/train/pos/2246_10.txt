A wonderful surprise of the Spanish cinema. I never thought that Jordi Molla could be such a great director, after all, his choice in movies really does not interest me. This movie was absolutely fantastic and unpredictable ... something I ALWAYS enjoy! It has not enjoyed much good press and I really do not think it will ever appear on the US market. We have to be content with the DVD or the VHS, even if that ... I do not want to say much about the story because I do not want to spoil it for you, but basically it's about a drunken homeless being the new Messiah for kicks and to make some money out of it (like sooooooooooo many), before he knows it, he dives into a life he did not expect.
