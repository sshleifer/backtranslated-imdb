This movie now appears on digital television at least once a month, I've seen it a dozen or more, and it keeps stopping to please me. If it was tomorrow, I would take a look again. This is the art that Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smith, two great magicians of the drama profession, can create, supported not least by the excellent trio Karl Malden, Bob Newhart and Robert Morley. Not to mention that others are in subordinate roles. <br /> <br /> It's a simple story that is simply told by an ex-cheater, a lovable embezzler, affection in the process. Even if it's a bit (striking), it's not plausible, even unbelievable, the characters are not. There is no violence, no sex, no bad language and best of all no terrible method that is so common today. A real lesson for modern filmmakers on how to make a great show out of virtually nothing ... except outstanding talents.
