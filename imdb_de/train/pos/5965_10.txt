I have awarded 10 out of 10 points. I love it so much. I am a child of the 80s and totally in Heavy Metal for many years. Those are the reasons why I like this movie so much. It's so cool to see these posters in the bedroom of this boy (Judas Priest, Lizzy Borden, Raven, Twisted sister ...) and his vinyl collection is my Megadeth shop). Even the soundtrack of FASTWAY is absolutely incredible and fits very well with the story. If you love metal, TRICK OR TREAT is your friend. Do not buy or buy this movie for OZZY or GENE SIMMONS because it is in the movie for a few seconds. Watch the movie because of the soundtrack and the story that will take you back to the 80s. You will not be the same person afterwards.
