Purple Rain is a great movie if you're a music lover who took part in Prince music in the '80s. History is a much-used formula: Rising musical talents have to overcome personal and professional hurdles to find their audience and self-esteem. Prince is a bad actor, but his performance, especially by Purple Rain / I Would Die 4 U, makes it worthwhile to sit through the movie. He is as powerful as Mick Jagger or Michael Jackson, like Thriller, on stage as a showman. Apollonia Kotero, a former Prince protégé, is beautiful and shows a talent for acting and chemistry with Prince, but her script does not go far. Morris Day and other supporting actors deliver comedic elements.
