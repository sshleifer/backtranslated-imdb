David Lynch's (1999) film about John Roach / Mary Sweeney's story takes place some time before the release of the film in Iowa and Wisconsin. <br /> <br /> We come late into the life of Alvin Straight (Richard Farnsworth) in life. His health is bad, his life is mostly behind him and he knows it. <br /> <br /> This makes what he decides to be all the more remarkable and endearing. He decides (and at any point in the movie his own name echoes through his actions) to clarify some things. Alvin is at this time in his life a man of great experience, but modestly thinks. His daughter Rose (Sissy Spacek) struggles with a language barrier that makes communication a huge effort for the audience. But it's worth it, because Rose's story can not help but come out in the course of the movie. <br /> <br /> This movie is the story of a journey. But like all journeys it is a journey in the geographical and in the human sense. At the beginning of the film, we begin to understand that this is an ambitious journey that no elderly gentleman of Alvin's age should reasonably undertake. But along the way, we slowly learn how Alvin has so many qualifications that equip him to reach his unlikely goal. His goal is very simple and straightforward. His brother is ill and is likely to die, and he wants to visit him. He had an altercation with him many years ago and they have not spoken for a long time. <br /> <br /> On the way Alvin meets a lot of people. The way he behaves towards them and the benefits they get from being acquainted is the essence of this film. We learn from Alvin Straight who Alvin Straight is. And at the end of the movie, we know who we are ... better.
