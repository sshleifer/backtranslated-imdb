I caught this movie on cable on the Sundance Channel in the late afternoon. You could say, "Who loves the sun?" Is a perfect pastime of a story, why not. You can meet up with the trio: Lukas Haas is Will (who returns after leaving everyone abruptly years ago), Molly Parker is Maggie (we learn she's a big part of the Bloom family) and Adam Scott is Daniel ( he is a friend or fianc√©) on picturesque Falcon Lake, Manitoba, Canada, captured in graphic compositions juxtaposed in vibrant summer colors against sunshine and shadows. And the trio supports two other family members in the revealing mix: Wendy Crewson is mother Mary Bloom and R.H. Thomson is Dad Arthur Bloom. Author and director Matt Bissonnette has delivered an ingenious unfolding of the storyline and the various tentacle links - do not worry, Haas has a "listless" face, but the humor will come when Parker and Scott rejoin the circle of friends break and knowing joys stir. Dialogues may be scarce or even impossible, but we get the taste of what's being cooked, confused or puzzled. Yes, "Who Loves the Sun" can be described as a sleeping bead. The chemistry between all five directors provides for gels and "burns", resulting in an overall energetic performance. After all, everything is in the family and the film does not take itself too seriously. <br /> <br /> Looks like the official site is still available on "wholovesthesun.com", and there's information about the soundtrack of Mac McCaughan (Portastatic with guitar tunes and strings) where score excerpts are played, and behind the production notes, interview with the author-director-producer Bissonnette, how film and concept were created, the casting and more. I have always valued Molly Parker since Lynne Stopkewich's "Kissed" made her stunning, yet mesmerizing performance in 1996. She is married to Bissonnette, who wrote "The Maggie Part for Molly."
