There are people who claim that this is another "violent crime" of Mexican film. You're right, but more than this movie is a call to raise awareness of what we've become. The terrible truth hurts, or boring, if you have already accepted the paradigm of living the Third World as the only possible goal. One of the most important things of "Cero y van cuatro" is the open invitation to a profound reflection of our present identity. Are we all? Is that all we want to be? I am abroad and I realized how spoiled the Mexican society is when the Tlahuac incident came to light. I still can not understand viewers who are witnessing a mass murder. I almost puked when I saw some pictures. It was not Iraq or Rwanda, just a tiny village near Mexico City, that was raging with media and government enjoyment. The replica of a similar situation in this film shocked me deeply. The other stories were good for portraying other situations of corruption, dishonesty, betrayal and violence, but I think "Tamales de Chivo" is the best. <br /> <br /> The movie is deeper than any "Cabr√≥n" and "Pendejo". Shouting. This is meaningless compared to the actions of the people. With few exceptions, they are all perfect examples of human garbage. Just as in real life, honesty is increasingly becoming an exception to the rule in our country. In addition, honesty is rewarded only in a miraculous way.
