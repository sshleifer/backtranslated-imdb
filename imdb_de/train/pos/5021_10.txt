I rented this movie and viewed it 20 times before returning it to the store. Bill Paxton hired world-class talents to make a good thriller with interesting twists and turns. The story is original and well written. Powers Booth and Paxton both perform well. The story is told in an interesting way with both flashbacks 20 years ago. This type of storytelling makes for a good thriller that can not get boring. Bill Paxton, please make more horror movies, you have the talent for it!
