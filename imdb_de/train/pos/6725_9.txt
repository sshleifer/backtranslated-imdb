Noll's comfortable way of publishing blunt comments, often intent on describing things that he knows more about than most, is refreshing. There is another character in the film who is constantly trying to verbalize complicated topics by using more speech than necessary. This guy should never have had a thesaurus. Cut to Noll and you know you are doing something good! <br /> <br /> The way the pioneers of big wave surfing are presented reminds of a "lost era". Apart from the fact that nobody knows how these men make a living, let alone take care of medical matters. The use of old movie clips has been masterfully done.
