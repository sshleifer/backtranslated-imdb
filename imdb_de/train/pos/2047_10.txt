This movie came home for me. At the age of 29, I remember the 80s and my father who worked in a factory. I figured if I worked hard, if I had pride and never gave up, I could have the American Dream, the house, a few kids and a car to call my own. However, I've found that you can not achieve anything without a degree in something (unlike my ninth-grade father) and a sense of greed and laziness. <br /> <br /> I would like to know if someone has this movie on DVD or VHS. It's done for television and I saw it an hour ago. I can not find it anywhere! I would like to show my friends, my pseudo-friends, family members and other relatives, they would see what they think and they should be reminded that the Americans would once WANT to feel honor and we would be proud of that were what we were done !! I think the feeling is still there, but in a serious downward spiral, where so many things are being done overseas ...
