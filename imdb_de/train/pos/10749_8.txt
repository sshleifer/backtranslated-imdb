I rented it for my son, who is recently interested in 9/11. At that time he was kindergartener and had no idea what was going on there. I liked the way it was narrated as a "documentary." If there was a movie that I would recommend for 9/11, this would be the movie! Usually you see a movie that has well-known actors. Nobody knew this movie. You will also see a film about September 11th. They hear that one or two firefighters have lost their lives to save people. I did not feel it had any of that! I only hired this movie and would definitely include it in my collection! Very well done! My heart goes to the survivors and families of the victims of 9/11!
