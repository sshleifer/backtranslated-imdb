After racism, the rural exodus - also known as migration from the land side - is another sociopolitical theme of the 1960s. West Side Story had dealt with racism through a love festival from an artistic point of view. Meanwhile, Midnight Cowboy handles the rural exodus through a friendship tragedy from a psychological perspective. It is a deeply painful end that we witness one of the two companions of destiny. John Schlesinger, director John Schlesinger, skilfully brings us the deepest secret thoughts, dreams, fantasies, fears, and reviews of two New York City scum. While the handsome Joe Buck (Voight) dreams of all the beautiful women in the world, making him a wild Asking love fantasy, the poor Ratso Rizzo (Hoffman) dreams of a better and healthier life in clean and sunny Florida. Accordingly, Joe becomes a hustler to make his fantasies come true; and Ratso becomes a hijacker to raise enough money to move to Florida. In addition, Ratso Joe helps to find his way, what he can. They start to share everything in life. They share the food, they share the medicine, they share an uninhabited home, they share their income and share a destiny. Regrettably, over the course of history, Joe realizes that it's not the only thing that all pretty women implore him to have fun; and besides, Ratso can not see Florida because his heart did not beat his illness while he was on the bus that took him there. <br /> <br /> The power is always right, and the weakness does not have the right in daylight. Therefore, "Midnight" gives the actual sight. Despite the tragedy, there is no melodrama in Midnight Cowboy. Every aspect of every character is the reality of the poor who carry their inevitable destiny. Therefore, Midnight Cowboy is a provocative view of a socio-political issue, the rural exodus.
