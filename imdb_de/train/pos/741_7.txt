I was just a little bit young for this, but I had to see it. There is some great music that many people have mentioned, but nobody seems to notice a very rare performance of "Angel", a mostly ignored but rather popular music outfit. They wear their typical white outfits and grind their way through "20th Century Foxes," and obviously everyone is trying to plug themselves into the field of view of the camera. Keyboarder Gregg Giuffria remains the highlight of the band and has apparently never got a haircut! Cherie Currie (former Runaways singer) starts a short but notable acting career and is quite memorable alongside Jodie Foster and the rest. (Their topless 3-D scenes in "Parasite" and their UFO view in "Wavelength" let us all watch for a while). <br /> <br /> It's not a masterpiece, but it retains some of its time for anyone to look out for and wonder.
