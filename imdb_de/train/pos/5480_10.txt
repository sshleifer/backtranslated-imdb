This is a great movie that shows what our government will do to other countries if we do not like their government. This is not as bad as what Reagan and Bush did at number one in South America, but the US still has no business with other countries like this one. These films also prove that American media spit out government propaganda. That's what they did in Haiti with Aristide. The reason for this coup against Chavez was not that Chavez was elected with over 90% of the vote. <br /> <br /> This film is not just a political documentary, it would still be a great movie A drama, it's amazing that this is real. <br /> <br /> The other reviewer is lying when he says, "Chavez is conquering the air," the private media are constantly running anti-Chavez propaganda.
