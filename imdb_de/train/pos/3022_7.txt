I never thought that Charles Boyer (Luis Denard) appeared together with Lauren Bacall (Rose Cullen) in a movie and enjoyed their great acting together. Even Peter Lorre (Contreras) had a role in this movie and had a bad misfortune in his bathroom that made him faint. This story is about a Republican courier, Luis Denard, who visits England during the Spanish Civil War and tries to break a coal mining treaty that will do great harm to other nations. Lauren Bacall, (Rose Cullen), helps Luis Denard by picking him up and falling in love with him, and then helps him escape an angry crowd of English miners who threaten his life. The real villain in this movie is Victor Francen (Licata), "Five-fingered beast," who delivers an outstanding performance. Great Classic 1945 movie without Humphrey Bogart.
