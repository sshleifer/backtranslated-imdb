I just saw this episode tonight at a recent presentation by one of our local independent channels, which now presents two episodes every weekday. <br /> <br /> As the gentleman in the other said, the previous comment here, I agree that this may not have been one of the best programs in the series, but I still find it entertaining. My dad was a friend of one of the principals (in my hometown of Cincinnati) Young Rod Serling had worked in the media there - and I remember Dad telling me how talented and creative he was there. Overall, "Twilight Zone" is certainly one of the true classics on television and, due to its production during the Cold War, not only offers a glimpse of this era of the country, but also a nostalgic image of production techniques, creative attitudes and the actors of this era several decades ago. <br /> <br /> * Minor "spoiler". * <br /> <br /> This special story, like other presentations in this series and elsewhere, shows a story where the locale ends as a "surprise". Sometimes the characters are from elsewhere on earth, while the story initially implies that at least one is an "earthling". These usually contained (as here) the news of a situation in which the buttons of the end of the world in this Cold War period were eventually pushed by the superpowers at this secular position 4-5 decades ago, and still provide food for thought. - like in this episode. <br /> <br /> Although the dialogue may not have stretched the considerable talents of the leads, it still offers a simple, important message and a rewarding 20-minute conversation and interest.
