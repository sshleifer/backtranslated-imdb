This movie is funny and suitable for all ages. It's definitely family entertainment. The performers do a good job of playing people in the Midwestern city of Big Bean, Illinois. Where we have to assume that nothing ever happens, since the excitement (pre-invasion) of the decade is the new (and only) exit of the interstate. The situation seems boring and absolutely unlikely for the invasion of Mars by Earth. But these Martians are totally unsuitable, though they are endowed with an arsenal of appropriately grisly and deadly weapons. The Martians wave their lines and set just the right accents to get viewers and locals to help them ... to leave the earth. J.J. Anderson, who plays the very young Halloween raptor, just has great lines. Watch this movie for loud and entertainment; It is not thought-provoking. But it is subtle and pleasant.
