Ahh, Talespin! What can I say, what has not been said about this great show yet? Nothing! This is undoubtedly one of the best-written shows I've ever seen, live action or animation. The newer stuff is way too much for my taste and some of the "mature" stuff that I need to scare kids out of the room is dumbed down. But not Talespin. <br /> <br /> The stories are captivating and very plausible. Some of them could even be stretched to an hour or two for a movie. Episodes like Stormy Weather and Her Dream to Dream are very dramatic and enjoyable for children and adults alike. Then there are the pure comedy episodes like the Bluest of the Baloo Bloods and Stuck on you, where the emphasis is on serenity. I can cry to tears in a few selected wines. <br /> <br /> The drama aspect is very poor in most shows today (at least in those that are not specifically geared to it), especially in cartoons. For example, in the episode of Stormy Weather, Kit Cloudkicker decides he'll join an air circus, but Baloo believes it's too dangerous. In the biggest fight of the episode, Baloo Kit screams to stay away from Daring Dan. Kit yells "NO, you can not tell me what to do! YOUR IS * NOT * * MY * * DAD *!" and buries his face in his pillow. The next day he goes to the air circus. This kind of drama is a rarity in a cartoon and would be very welcome in the urgencies created today. <br /> <br /> The characters have a lot of depth. Baloo is pretty much in the jungle book, plus or less laziness. Rebecca is a smart businesswoman whose ideas of how to make money, although theoretically good, are rarely good in practice. Molly is a sweet little girl, but that must not fool you. It can be a real hell sometimes. Kit Cloudkicker is a darker character than the rest. He does not trust adults much if they do not speak to him, and he tends to break ties. Look at his expression in Plunder and Lightning as he grabs the hook: he looks like he's ready to give it to a pirate. <br /> <br /> In the end it's the drama, combined with the very real chemistry between the two of the characters that make this show # 1 in my book. The relationship between Baloo and Kit is very real, almost father and son. This is well proven in Alls Whale Ended Whale when Baloo Kit's word for Seymour abusing the animals in his aquarium rather than getting used to the other adults. The relationship between Baloo and Becky is also realistic, as Baloo's motivation for the job is to buy back the old Sea Duck, and not necessarily the desire to help Rebecca. But something tells me that if he got the duck back he would still be working for Rebecca. The Sea Duck, not to mention the other aircraft in the series, is quite realistic in design. The functions of the aircraft do not change once throughout the series (continuity is also hard to come by), and unlike most other "super-planes" in other cartoons, they do not have a single weapon on board (unless They count.) Mangos!), And instead relies on the great skill of the crafty pilot to avoid trouble. You can hardly imagine a hero vehicle that does not have any weapons tower, laser cannon, or handgun anywhere on board. And the fact that they use their heads to avoid annoyance is so hard to find in a cartoon these days. Plus, it's just such a damn cool design! <br /> <br /> This is definitely the best cartoon. Ever. Period. Definitely worth all ten stars!
