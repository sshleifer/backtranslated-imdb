Simple, meaningful and delivers an emotional impact. I regularly watch through boring shorts and it's always nice to encounter something that has a simple and enlightened message, plays without pretension or self-rule, and gets the most important lesson of his life, only to find out if he does, if not enough Copies are present, with the school bully must be shared. <br /> <br /> Unlike most short films with children or actors, these kids hold their own and it is believable. The soundtrack complements the emotion of the piece and the punchline of the movie works well.
