I am a lover of Jane Eyre and a purist, and this version contains almost all the important details of the book. The characters are presented as I imagined them. Jane Eyre is a complex story of great wealth and can not be delivered properly in a feature-length format. Therefore, a TV mini-series is required. Timothy Dalton's Rochester is probably the best there has ever been. There was a lot of discussion about how attractive he is and how old he is. In the book, Jane (the narrator) describes him as "about 35" and not young, but not middle-aged. I think Timothy Dalton was about 38 when he did that, so that's about right. Besides, we only have the opinion of Jane if Rochester looks good. She has just met him and he asks her openly what she thinks. As an inexperienced and humble girl, I can not imagine her saying she thought he was pretty. The actor who plays Rochester has to show us the character of the man, and that's perfect. I love the relationship between the two leads, which is the key to this story, and the humor of their encounters. Other versions blew it up, but that's true. The 2006 version with Toby Stephens (37 years old) is on BBC1 and is really good so I'll decide if this is my favorite when it's done. <br /> <br /> After watching the 2006 version, I decided that this version with Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clark is the best! The dialogue of Charlotte Bronte is maintained and this is important for the power of history. Modernization simply does not work - it's a Victorian story and an archaic poetic speech fits the characters. This version has a great cast - Zelah Clark is tiny and the difference in height between her and Rochester is important; Timothy Dalton has real presence and is an amazing actor. There are no extra scenes that can distract you from the plot, and the script contains all the essential scenes, but omits unnecessary details to get to the point and make it thrilling. I recommend it to all true Jane Eyre fans.
