Yesterday I saw "The Grudge" and wow ... I was really scared, a good thing. I love horror movies and I really liked them. There were so many surprise scenes (what is the English word?) That made you jump to your seat. Too many screams from the audience made it difficult not to laugh. I think the scariest scene was ... in the bus, when the face passes the window or when Yoko runs without a chin. The make-up is also very good. Sometimes you could really see it was there, but it still made the scene look crazy. The boy was indeed very good, so sweet without make-up and so scary that he was there. Next time I hear a crackling sound, I'll probably feel pretty scared ...
