The 74th Academy Awards were very good. Whoopi's work as EmCee was very funny and easy. Personally, I loved their last appearance, which got rough reviews and brutal jokes, but that's fine. The audience seemed to like it. Halle Berry, Denzel Washington, Ron Howard, Woody Allen and Sidney Poitier made this an Oscar show to be remembered for. <br /> <br />
