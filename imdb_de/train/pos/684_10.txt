I grew up with this series. I was about seven to eight years old when it started. I remember the first episode called "The New House". It scared everything! I can almost hear this statue still laughing. And the end, oh my god! The child spirit comes into the room for the child: Yikes! This was a classic television and it was a unique series. I found a DVD collection on the internet: 2 actually. My question to all readers: Has anyone bought this set? It is a bootleg. Both sellers claim to have a very good copy. I have a sketchy and poor DVD of The New House, and a few other episodes that are a little better. However, if someone knows if they are clearer, it's worth buying and sharing with them. Kids A great show, clever, weird and daring supernatural. Thanks in advance to all fans who are at the bottom of it all. In fact, I would like to talk about it. Chris Walker
