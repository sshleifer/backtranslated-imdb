This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. I feel very touched by the theme that the film should convey. One sentence that keeps coming to my mind is that "history repeats itself." Life is what the film shows: when people are young, they do not seem to understand their parents and spouses. People have every excuse to share their favorite time not too late with their children. People always have to work hard to support the whole family, but they only neglect the subtle feeling of their partners. People change their perspectives in different phases of life; People can always be forgiven if their hearts are full of love for their beloved; Nothing is more important than the kinship that people in this world share, and it is never too late to talk to their people about what they feel from the bottom of their hearts to achieve a better understanding between themselves, so that At the end of a day, people should not apologize or repent because they have kept their words and there is always hope - a new life. The actors and actresses are fantastic. You fully understood the intention of the director. The charm of the film for me is to bring the audience a skillful and splendid mix of cheers and tears.
