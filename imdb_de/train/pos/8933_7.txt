Claire Denis has repeatedly shown that the film does not have to tell a story, that it is enough to create an experience that allows the viewer to take the ingredients and turn them into what they want. <br /> <br /> In the context of a mostly non-linear film, the older man, who lives on the Franco-Swiss border, is a man who devotes himself to his dogs, who still have a lover whose heart status is increasingly his life threatened. He has a son with a small family who seldom meets him. When he discovers that he needs a heart transplant, he prefers to travel to Tahiti via Japan to get a black-market heart transplant and rekindle a long-lost relationship. He had a son with a Tahitian woman years ago. <br /> <br /> What Denis does with this outline of a story is the use of the camera to explore the loneliness of the soul, the vastness of nature and human interaction with humans vs. animals, etc. Film does not make any sense, but we try too hard to connect all the points ahead in beautiful pictures. Life is so similar: we see, see, observe, integrate, process, and make what we want. <br /> <br /> With this form of filmmaking (as she did in the strangely beautiful) 'Beau Travail') Claire Denis has developed a signature technique. Whether the viewer considers the finished product worthwhile has much to do with our individual methods of processing visual and conceptual information. This is an interesting and visually intriguing film, but many viewers will find a too long discourse about very little. Maybe watching changes again. Grady harp
