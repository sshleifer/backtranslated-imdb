Pialat films people in extremely emotional situations, usually with multiple violent scenes. In La Gueule ouverte, he deals with the devastating effects on the husband and son of a woman who die of cancer. In A nos amours, teenage sexual experimentation leads to violent confrontations with her family. Here's a pretty spoiled young woman leaving her husband to deal with a sexy ex-cheater. Their motivation is a bit murky as Loulou is unable to read or discuss something more difficult than TV shows. On the other hand, he has a fabulous body (I wonder why Depardieu never did a sports movie to flaunt that body - he would have been great as a rugby player). <br /> <br /> The casting is impressive. Isabelle Huppert may not give a blank, expressionless performance (she has given many); Depardieu plays Loulou with all the dynamics and charm one could wish for - see the scene in the bar where he stabbed himself in the stomach, run away and seek treatment, and then he starts with Nelly , Guy Marchand beautifully plays Nelly's husband with those coal-black eyes and desperate look; It's a nice repeat of the pairing in Coup de Foudre.
