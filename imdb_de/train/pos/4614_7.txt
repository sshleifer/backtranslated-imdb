This movie is ridiculous! That's what I like about this piece "Guilty Pleasure". It is easy to condemn this film because it did not include Pat Priest and Butch Patrick, the original Marilyn and Eddie. But look at the year and calculate. Pat Priest and Butch Patrick had outgrown their parts long ago! Time does that for young stars. Yvonne De Carlo, who revalued her role as Lili, sat down for the big 6-0 (although she still looked good and was still the perfect "Lili") De Carlo won no major role. Still, it was nice to see Fred Gwynne and Al Lewis in the roles that made them so famous! During the two seasons in which THE MUNSTERS was prime time, it was Gwynne / Lewis chemistry that made the series a success. The rest of the cast supported the performers, not to say they were not needed. You are! The TV series would not have survived long if she could do without her. Given the choice between Butch Patrick or Happy Derman (the original "Eddie"), the choice was too easy. Yvonne De Carlo was also the better choice than Joan Marshall. <br /> <br /> Although this film is not up to the original TV series, it is still good to measure and is one of the better "bye" specials in the late '70s / early' 80s plaguing the liquor tube. <br /> <br /> '
