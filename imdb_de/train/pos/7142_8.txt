Holes, originally a novel by Louis Sachar, was successfully transformed into an entertaining and well-made film. With Sigourney Weaver as guardian, Shia Labeouf as Stanley, and Khleo Thomas as Zero, the roles were well staffed, and the actors performed well. <br /> <br /> The film had interwoven storylines to the end. The main story is about Stanley Yelnats and his sentence of one and a half years at Camp Greenlake. The second story is about Sam and Kate Barlow. This plot deals with racism and is the deeper plot of the film. The third is about Elya Yelnats and Madame Zeroni, which explains the 100-year curse on the Yelnats family. In my opinion, these storylines were very well interwoven. <br /> <br /> Contrary to many people's beliefs, I believe you did not have to read the book to understand the movie. The movie is pretty easy to understand. <br /> <br /> The acting in the film was well done, in particular Shia Labeouf (Stanley), Khleo Thomas (Zero), Sigourney Weaver (the Overseer) and Jon Voight (Mr. The other members of D-Tent, Jake Smith (Squid), Max Kash (Zick-Zag), Miguel Castro (magnet), Byron Cotton (armpit) and Brenden Jefferson (X-Ray), supported the comic relief of the film. However, the best parts were with Zero and Stanley, who together formed a great team. <br /> <br /> Although Holes is a Disney movie, he deals with some serious issues like racism, shootings and violence. The dramatization of the film has succeeded in some places very well. <br /> <br /> I would suggest this movie to people of all ages, whether they read the book or not. You should not miss it.
