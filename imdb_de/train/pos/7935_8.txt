Hood of the Living Dead had much to offer even before the opening balance. Firstly, every game about "... the living dead" proclaims His Holiness, Mr. Romero, and immediately sets a high standard that many films can not afford. And secondly, my film companion doubted that any urban horror movie would surpass the groundbreaking Leprechaun In the Hood. Skeptically, we sat down to watch. <br /> <br /> We were rewarded with a surprisingly sincere and good-natured zombie movie. Of course, the budget is low, and of course the directors' friends populate the actors, but Hood of Living Dead loves zombie cinema. Cheap? Yes. But if it is so cheap, you can clearly see where LOVE holds it together. <br /> <br /> Ricky works in a lab during the day and as a replacement for his younger brother in the evenings. He dreams of leaving Oakland. However, before his planned escape, his brother is shot dead in a pass. Ricky's keen scientific wisdom offers one of the CPR or 911 superior options: injections of his laboratory's experimental regenerative formula. Unfortunately, the little brother wakes up in an ambulance as a bloody Oakland zombie! Chaos and chaos! I think it's more economical to eat your enemies than to take revenge on a drive-by, but on the other hand, I'm a bad judge of the complexity of urban life. (Like a poor judge?) In response to a bloody scene involving four men, I thought, "Ah-ha, white T-shirts at all, so the blood shows up." Economically, I have the same technique in mine Jordan replied, "No, this is a gang dress. White shirts were banned in the bars of New Orleans for a time." Oh.) <br /> <br /> Much of the movie is in someone's living room so there's a lot of hanging around waiting for the zombies. But the characters are personable and the film is sincere - it exceeds its budget in spirit. <br /> <br /> Zombie Explanation: When man plays god, zombies arise! Or maybe: Follow the FDA approved test rules before experimenting on humans! <br /> <br /> Contribution to the Zombie Canon: This is the first zombie movie I saw with a drive-by shoot. As for the actual zombies, the infection is spread as usual with a bite, but very unusual headshots do not work - they are heartbeats that kill. Zombies have impulses whose absence proves true death. And those zombies make pretty cool Jaguar growls. <br /> <br /> Indispensable zombie movie joke: A mercenary named Romero. Moan. <br /> <br /> Favorite zombie: Jaguar Noise little brother zombie course!
