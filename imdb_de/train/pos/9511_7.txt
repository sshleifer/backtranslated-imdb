A bloody gangster story playing in the years of the Great Depression. It tells us about another notorious batsman, Michael (Mike) Salliwan. Somehow the story turns the other way around this time: Mike struggles to save his life and his only remaining son because the rest of his family was killed due to a dirty game by his own boss. He succeeds in his revenge and secures his son an honorable future, but is killed in the end. Such stories have no happy ending. <br /> <br /> The role of Mike Salliwan Senior was wonderfully played by Tom Hanks, and the role of Mr. Rooney (the Mafia boss) was played by Paul Newman. The film makes a good impression and we hear the familiar phrase "We rob banks". This movie is still worth seeing, although you could expect something of Sam Mendes's American beauty.
