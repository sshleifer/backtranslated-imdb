This film answers the question of how a relationship survives when your girlfriend is coy, clinging, needy, jealous ... and far beyond the capabilities of mortal women. <br /> <br /> Without spoiling the movie I can assure you that this is not the case, but there is a lot of fun to be had. Uma Thurman is perfect as a survival art superhero, an over-the-top, mysterious G-Girl who, unlike most of her sisterhood, is not always dedicated to truth, justice and the American way. <br /> <br /> Thurman also thinks of herself as a thoroughly stupid but somehow inviting curator, Jenny. When emptied for a less talented, but emotionally safer and well-adjusted rival, G-Girl goes ballistic and the following is not pretty. It's funny, but it's not pretty. <br /> <br /> It's a delightful premise, hell has no fury, like a super heroine who is spurned, and those involved do not carry it all in all, but it does have its moments. and I think I will get the DVD. <br /> <br /> I liked this movie.
