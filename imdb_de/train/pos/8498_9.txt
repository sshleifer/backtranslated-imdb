This is a wonderful movie with a funny, clever story and the dynamics of cultural differences. The theme, which is important in life, makes the film a very underrated film. Do not let the cynics of the world stop you from seeing this. Keaton has wonderful moments and I wonder about the fact that comedy is never appreciated because actors like Keaton make switching from humor to serious pieces incredibly easy. All in all a great movie!
