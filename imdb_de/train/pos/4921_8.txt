Like a streetcar called Desire (also directed by Gadg on stage as well as on screen), Panic In The Streets shows a New Orleans in which its main claim to fame - the birthplace of jazz - is not even mentioned. It was the seventh film by Richard Widmark, and it was probably a long way to establish him as the good actor he really was, not just a psychotic killer. Gadg himself appears in an unreducated role as a morgue attendant, but the film is rich in talent, starting with Jack Palance (who is still billed as Walter Jack Palance). Emile Meyer, Tommy Rettig and the absolutely reliable Paul Douglas as a policeman who appears from the perspective of Widmark. It's a very rewarding movie, especially if you're not seen much. Catch it if you can.
