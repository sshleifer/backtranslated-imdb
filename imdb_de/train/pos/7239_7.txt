What a jewel of a movie, so good that they made a sequel. <br /> <br /> The movie starts off really well with an awkward monster eating a few people and a party where the two main characters face each other for the first time <br /> <br /> Bendan Hughes plays the eccentric Vlad, who knows who this character is, who moved to the city and uses the services of a certain estate agent to find a home. <br /> <br /> We saw all the vampire movies, we know the format. <br /> <br /> The movie can be viewed, but the actors' performances are very wooden and they look like they do not want to be in this movie, but maybe that's all part of the decadent ambience. <br /> <br /> Did not like the end, but there is a sequel, it has to find out. <br /> <br /> When I saw the movie, I thought Brendan Hughes did not really fit. Later, I could not stop thinking of him, he somehow exudes an eerie sensuality, so maybe he was right for the role. <br /> <br /> BRENDAN HUGHES Last seen in 'Hitler - The Rise of Evil' as Lieutenant Guffman. <br /> <br /> Where is he now?
