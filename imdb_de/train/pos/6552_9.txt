Normally I do not like Emma Roberts so much, but after seeing Nancy Drew, I changed my mind. The actors in the movies made the whole thing exciting and funny. If you watch a mystery movie, you can usually solve it before the show, but in this movie, you're actually like that. The clues must all fit together until you finally understand the entire crime. I'm still amazed how she found out. The whole movie was really smart and the people who saw it with me loved it too. The clothes were my favorite part of the movie, it was so cute. I do not think there will be another movie until the sequel comes out. I give a nine, because the popular girls did not seem to have the role really right, but they still make me laugh. It was a really great movie and a big mystery. I definitely recommend watching it.
