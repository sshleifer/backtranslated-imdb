This gem, the 1936 Invisible Ray, can not be enjoyed often. But no, forget it. The story is elegant. Karloff, stern and bitter in his retreat to the Carpathians, is Janos Rukh, an ingenious scientist who reads ancient rays of light to detect events in the great geological past - especially the crash of a powerful radioactive meteorite in Africa. He is joined by the always elegant Lugosi (as a rare hero), who studies "Astro-chemistry". Frances Drake is the pretty, unused young woman. Frank Lawton's romantic temptation; and the Divine Violet Kemble Cooper is Mother Rukh in a performance worthy of Maria Ospenskya. <br /> <br /> The story moves fast in bold episodes with special effects that are still beautiful. It also contains some wonderful lines. A Rukh restores his mother's vision and asks, "Mother, can you see, can you see?" "Yes, I can see more clearly than ever, and what I see scares me." Even better, when Mother Rukh says, "He broke the first law of science." I am not alone in my acquaintance that for many years I have confused what exactly this first law of science is. <br /> <br /> This movie is definitely desert island material.
