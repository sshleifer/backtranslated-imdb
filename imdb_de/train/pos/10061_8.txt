One of the most heartwarming foreign films I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> The young girl is an amazing talent. Stellar performances of her (Doggie), the old man (the king of the masks) and Liang (the Living Boddhisatva). <br /> <br /> (SPOILER) The deplorable treatment of children, especially women, is disturbing /> <br /> Loved the music. The original Chinese dialogue intensifies the emotional intensity of the performances and the story. <br /> <br /> This is a MUST SEE - a pleasant family movie, though not for very young children. Had the DVD release rated even higher, if the soundtrack would have been better transferred to the DVD and the transmission had included the widescreen version.
