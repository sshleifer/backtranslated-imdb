This is the first Michael Vartan movie I've seen - I did not see Alias ​​- and I was curious if the guy could normally act in more body and action roles, so I found her very good and adorable in this one another "sweet" role of a school teacher. Some of the negative comments I've read are true, the movie is full of clichés and the story does not sound true screen chemistry there. However, I liked this movie. The venues are nice, the characters are nice and nice and the supporting actors are pretty good. If you expect great romance, this is not the case. However, if you want to see a nice innocent good looking movie with sympathetic characters, this is very good.
