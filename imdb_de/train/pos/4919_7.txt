Kazan's early film Noir won an Oscar. Some of the reviews here are extremely detailed and lengthy about the film and its symbolism and rate it very high. I can almost see where they come from. However, I prefer to approach a long-forgotten film, which was apparently filmed almost without budget and quasi-documentary, somewhat weakened. Pneumonia is looming in the streets of New Orleans, and it is up to a military doctor (Widmark) and a city detective (Douglas) to arrest the main carrier (Palance). The film is moody, shot in strong black and white and uses locations very well. Widmark is wonderful as always. Forget the symbolism (crime equals illness and disease equals crime) and just enjoy the hunt. It is not always easy to see a movie like this now because we are well in this new century as it is of a particular style that was very short lived (after the Second World War until the early 1950s) and for The casual player unlikely is movie guard. For those who will see this for the first time, sit at the end of the big chase. It's different, and honestly, I do not know how they filmed it. I can say that it probably took so long for the finale to be filmed like the first 90 percent of the movie.
