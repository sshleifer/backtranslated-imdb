I love the recent episodes with CJ and Grandad - I also liked the plot Kate deals with the client. I want to find out what will happen next with Rory and Kerry, Bridget and the family. I think CJ is very funny and I love his scenes with Grandad. I have always loved James Garner in everything he does, and it is thanks to his acting that I never regard him in this series as James Garner or Rockford and absolutely believe in him as Kate's father. This family is so real and funny. It was terribly sad when John Ritter / Paul Hennessey died. But in real life these things happen and the way she was written and treated in the series was both funny and sad and always extremely sensitive and lovingly treated. But in general a very funny show with a lot of laughter and fun.
