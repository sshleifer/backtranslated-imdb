Most of the comments were positive, but I would add that viewers should also focus on the sets. The set designer used many beautiful art deco treatments along with beautiful buildings, stairs, doors, furniture and so on. It pays to pay attention. The film is characterized by characterization and symbolism, which is very rich. All the gangster actors were busy - it was like seeing old friends and it was a treat. The dialogue was sometimes amusing, but sometimes stilted, and I suppose it should be so. This is a movie fan. It was made by humans, for people who love the medium. Do not miss this.
