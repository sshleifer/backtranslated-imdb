"The first war was 100% outsourced." Dan Ackroyd's line says it all. This is a hard-to-describe film; Comedy, satire, action, screwball. It reminded me once or twice. Strangelove, especially in the scenes with Ben Kingsley (who has done a remarkable job in my opinion). I had no particular expectations of this movie, even though I'm a big John Cusack fan, so I just let myself be distracted from the movie. And as a result, I was pretty entertained. The political satire is painfully accurate and damages the US military-business complex. The negotiations were reasonably predictable, but the final entanglement of storylines made them all worthwhile. I can understand why this movie was not so popular in the US, but for the rest of the world this is a contemporary story.
