This movie was shown in a very early episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000, but when I watch this movie, I do not think about this wonderful television series. I think this was a surprisingly good horror movie from the early 40s, with a surprisingly good sound and image for a 67 year old public domain horror movie. I've really enjoyed watching Bela Lugosi and his bizarre staff, including his wife, the fluid from the glands of young wannabe brides, an old witch and her two bizarre sons, a huge idiot, and a weird dwarf (Angelo Rossitto), needed from 1932 freaks). I also enjoyed the happy young reporter, who is a stereotype, but still fun. My only problem with this otherwise decent movie is its plot, even for ridiculous and unbelievable for a movie. I do not want to spoil this movie, so borrow it or buy it for a few bucks.
