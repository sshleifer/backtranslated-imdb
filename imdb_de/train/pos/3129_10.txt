This is one of the best reunion specials where Adam West and Burt Ward parody and have fun. It's amazing how much effort went into detail, particularly the '60s feel, the Batcave set, Wayne Manor, the costumes, and the actors chosen for the later versions of West, Ward, Burgess Meredith, and Cesar Romero and Frank Gorshin! These 90 minutes are worth your time and are a pleasure for all fans of the classic television series "Batman" from the 1960s. I find that "Batman" clips come from the movie and not from the series itself, probably due to legal restrictions. Let's hope the three seasons show on DVD.
