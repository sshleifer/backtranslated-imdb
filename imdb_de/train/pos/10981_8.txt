You, TheatreX, found this when he rummaged through videos on the flea market in near-mint condition and found out when reading the back of the box that it was a "cult hit". <br /> <br /> What a funny movie. The aunt and cousin of former First Lady Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis live in this dilapidated 28-room house on Long Island (Suffolk Co.) and share the house with raccoons, cats, fleas (and anything else). Suffolk Co. was in them sometime because she lived in the dirt, and old Jackie herself came by to get things right. Anyway, this is a weird couple, Big Edie and Little Edie ... Edie (the daughter) always wears something over her head and dances, sings and gives the camera little side effects that rarely make much sense. Apparently, Big Edie (the 79-year-old mother) likes to run around naked, and while we get some clues as to what that might look like, fortunately this is done so that we are mercifully spared. These women talk and talk and talk, mostly about the past, and it makes no sense except to them. They live in absolute filth, cats do their business everywhere ("Look, this cat is going to the toilet behind my portrait!"), And a bedroom seems to be their operations center. If I close my eyes and listen to Big Edie's voice, it reminds me a lot of my own aunt, who came from that part of the country and had that Lawn Guyland accent. In one scene, Little Edie put on flea control, irritating, you can see all the cats scratching constantly, so the place must have been infested. The box refers to these two women as "eccentric," and I have to say, in this case, it's just a euphemism for "getting ripped off their pumpkins," but this movie is not without moments when you really feel something. This is equally scary, sad and disgusting, but I could not stop watching as I started. This is not my "normal" type of strip, but I found it a bit intriguing. However, it is not intended for everyone, guaranteed.
