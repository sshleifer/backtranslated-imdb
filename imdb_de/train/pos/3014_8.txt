This fantastic Whodunit is an early prototype of a soon to be very popular movie genre. I was glad that William Powell acted a detective story with charisma and charm and without the stupid attitude of his Nick Charles character (from the "Thin Man" series). Although the story is good on its own, I think it's really fun to watch this film is Michael Curtiz's fantastically inventive direction. From a visual point of view, this is a richly structured film, with Curtiz showing an incredible mastery of the medium; Curtis shows he was one of the best Hollywood directors - from split-screen images to crazy camera angles and imaginative flashbacks. Highly recommended if you are a fan of this movie.
