I think this movie is a lot of fun and horror. I love Elvira and I like this movie. It is a pity that the second part of this wonderful movie was not successful because, like a first part, it is very funny. I also regret that apart from this film, I have not seen Cassandra Peterson in other films. I think she is an amazing actress with great ... potential. I hope to see her in the third part of Elvira's adventures in the future. Cassandra Peterson is one of my favorite comedy actresses. Cassandra, as you read this, you know that you are the best and that my heart will be with you. You can rely on me. What else can I add? This is a cool and classic movie!
