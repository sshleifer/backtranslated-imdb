Police Story is one of Jackie Chan's classic films that helped shape Hong Kong cinema. It's a masterpiece that every action movie fan should not miss. It's obvious from the beginning that Jackie Chan's stunt team has literally risked their lives to shoot this movie. Both the action and the stunts are extremely realistic and innovative. To date, no film has outperformed the history of police in dangerous stunts. Many people were hospitalized in Police Story, including Jackie Chan. The bouts are not as uncommonly extraordinary as the stunts, but the battles in the film helped transform Jackie Chan's use of props. Throughout the film, Chan uses a strange object to stop attackers and constantly casts attackers through thick glass. The action feels real because the stuntmen give the film everything they have to give and Jackie Chan's coordination is outstanding. <br /> <br /> The other aspects of the movie are not without flaws, but they do not disappoint any action fan. Not only does Chan play a plausible risk of taking a cop, but he also shows the tremendous changes his character undergoes as he escalates into despair. The plot is powerful, but a modern viewer can sometimes find it boring. While the comedy offers a good number of laughter, it does not always distract the audience from the lack of action. For the period in which it was produced, however, the driving aspects of the plot are entertaining. There are also a number of interesting and well-played characters throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> Overall, the police are one of the best action movies ever made. And even in Hollywood, the influences of this one film should not be ignored.
