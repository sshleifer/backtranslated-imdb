Mr. Blandings builds his dream house possibly the best movie of Frank Capra / Preston Sturges, which neither of them ever did! If you love Bringing Up Baby, The History of Philadelphia, The Thin Man, I Was Loving A Male Warbrother, Or A Wonderful Life - movies that were made with joke, taste, and the occasional tongue stuck in the cheek, you should look here. The life after World War II is simple and idyllic. <br /> <br /> Grant is at the very top of his game and plays the city mouse, who ventures into the life of a squire. Loy is as adorable as his wife before NOW. The cast of the minor characters is similar to "You Can not Take It" and contains an early piece of the future Tarzan Lex Barker. Art direction and editing are well above average. <br /> <br /> The film never bends with the cheap slapstick after the number of the later version The Money Pit.
