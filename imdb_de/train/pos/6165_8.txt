Yes, some actions are a bit hard to follow, and The Bill tends to get violent, but it's actually a captivating show I do not want to miss. The vast majority of the episodes are very exciting and quite tense, and the drama is pretty good, though I miss Roberta Taylor as Inspector Gina Gold and Todd Carty as Gabriel Kent. I admit, I prefer the older episodes to the newer episodes, and it's a pity the program is now behind the watershed, as I found it easier to watch it at 8:00 am. Still, I like The Bill that way because it's not only captivating, but the cliffhangers at the end make the next episode inevitable. While it is true that it is more melodramatic than it was, I really like this program as a program that does not take itself too seriously. Bethany Cox
