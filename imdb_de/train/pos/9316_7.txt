Walter Pidgeon is Braley Mason, a civil prosecutor, who was prosecuted in 1951 in a movie called "The Unknown Man," featuring Ann Harding, Barry Sullivan, Keefe Braselle, and Richard Anderson. A great belief in justice. Pidgeon accepts a pro-bono case in which a young man, Rudi Walchek (Braselle), charged with murder, is defended and released. Shortly after, he realizes that the man is guilty and extorted protection money from his victim and other shopkeepers in the neighborhood. He is recommended by the prosecutor's office (Sullivan) that Rudi is a small change. To get rid of organized crime, you have to find the top man. Mason finds the top man and faces a dilemma. <br /> <br /> "The Unknown Man" is a small black and white film that manages to arouse the interest of the viewer through his various plot changes is something invented. It's really the story of a good man who seeks his God, justice, and what he wants to achieve. And that's the most invented part of all. I suppose there was a time before O.J., the Menendez brothers, etc., etc., when people believed in justice and the integrity of lawyers. These times are long gone for this viewer anyway. Walter Pidgeon does an excellent job - his handsome, elegant nature and declamatory voice shows us a successful, self-confident, but also deeply caring man. Pidgeon had a great career that spanned over 60 years, but never really became a superstar. He was a solid actor who could and did play almost everything. Maybe by the time he got leads, he was well in his thirties and missed being a matin√©e idol; or it could be that he lacked that certain something; or that he was typed early as a second lead for a big female star like Greer Garson. Hard to say. He gives an honest and touching performance here. Very good movie with good performances.
