This is hard to see - as a previous reviewer says. This is astonishing given the terrible films that were made right after the Second World War - especially the "liberation" of Dachau. It is clear that at the time of the war we knew exactly what happened to the Jews. The sequence showing a "transport" is lively, almost as if it were based on a recent newsreel (the Nazis wanted to record their atrocities). Knox as a Nazi is brilliant. He records the course of a Nazi career. This charting is particularly instructive when compared to the reactions of other Germans, first laughing at Hitler, then disbelieving and finally helpless. This contrast, however, allows us to believe in the "conversion" of a young Nazi officer to an anti-Nazi stance. This happened as a witness of the various attacks against Hitler, especially the Staffenberg conspiracy, when this movie came out. A powerful film that uses flashbacks to effectively predict the Nuremberg tracks and others that would appear after the war.
