An overlong but convincing retelling of the friendship between civil rights activist Steve Biko and Donald Woods. The first half of the film is the strongest, where we see the connection between the two men and how they help each other, but the second half is not as strong as the Biko character falls away. Still, it's a compelling movie with great performances by Kline and Washington, who puts the latter on the map. Washington was nominated for Best Supporting Actor for the first time. All in all, a well made movie that could have shut down a bit. 7/10 .____________________________________
