I liked the movie, especially because it told an interesting story, but the story, as told in the movie, felt like it had been condensed out of a much longer story. Since the book has over 400 pages, this makes sense. In a fictional South American country, the period stretches from the 1920s to the 1970s. It also fits a lot in the time available. I think that as a six-hour miniseries it would have been much better than a 140-minute movie turned out. <br /> <br /> Even though it's rushed, history does not skip so much being confusing. What is told is told pretty well. One flaw is that Clara's supernatural powers seem inconsistent. Either they should have appeared more even in the course of the film or should have been left out. Two more mistakes (possibly spoilers): Esteban's ultimate return comes too suddenly, and Ferula's curse seems to be on the decline, though the tone of the story suggests it should last forever. <br /> <br /> The acting is excellent. Outstanding is Glenn Close as a tortured spinner Ferula. Jeremy Irons is also brilliant as a brutal, self-made rich man. Meryl Streep as the main character Clara is great, although she is often even better than in this movie. There were also many well played minor roles. The biggest mistake is that there did not seem to be a dialect coach in the movie. Each actor seemed to speak with a different accent.
