In Season 2, he definitely needed a bit of work, like the virus between Max and Logan and Ames White along with his age old super cult. During the second season, the only thing I'd seen was to see if Max and Logan would ever get rid of the evil virus that infects Max. Very good drama in the second season. But as with all television programs, if something is wrong, the broadcaster takes it out of the air. I seriously hoped for a third and final season. Season 2 hangs you, if you have not read Max Allan Collins books then you know what's going on. <br /> <br /> Dark Angel should re-air for another season, though this could cost a lot just to get all the original actors back. as Jessica Alba Carrier Sky shot up after the show. If that were the case, there should be a movie to complete it. Just like the show Firefly, which of course FOX also canceled.
