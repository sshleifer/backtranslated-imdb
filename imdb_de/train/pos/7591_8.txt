It's a jumble of genres, but it's mostly based on Stephen Chow's genre mash-ups. There's magical kung-fu, college romance, sports, gangster action and a vile melodrama as a topping. The production is excellent and the pace is fast, making it easy to overcome the many shortcomings in this film. <br /> <br /> A baby is being suspended next to a basketball court. A homeless man takes him to a Shaolin Monastery, which is located in the middle of a city, along with a special kung fu manual that the homeless man has in a way but can not read. The old monk teaches the boy, but expires when he tries to master the specific technique in the manual. The school is taken over by a false kung fu master, who is supported by four crazy monks. The new master gets angry at the now over 20-year-old boy, who does not pretend to be hurt by the Master's weak blows and throws him out for the night. The boy is thrown into a basket at an incredible distance from a man who takes him to a gangster club to play darts. This leads to a big fight, the exclusion of the boy from the monastery and the man's decision to turn the boy into a college basketball feeling the first 10 minutes. Apart from the extremely short storytelling, the first problem is how little we the Getting to know the main character until getting into the movie. The man who uses the boy is more clearly defined by the end of the first third. The storyline does not follow a new reason beyond the insane action climax of the movie. I'm sure you can easily imagine how the crazy monks will turn up towards the end. The effects, photography and stunts are first-rate and compensate for the uninspired action. <br /> <br /> Stephen Chow has a much better command of plot and comedy writing and this movie will live in its shadow, but that's no good reason to ignore it. It's pretty entertaining, even when the scattering finishes. Recommended.
