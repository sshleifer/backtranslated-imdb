I picked up this movie in my local library. After meeting the director at a film festival late last year, I was curious to "check" his work. I was pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br /> The film takes a fresh look at familiar themes, love, infidelity, friendships, jealousy. It can be a bit "talkative" sometimes, but never to completely submerge the movie. I've enjoyed watching a love story with characters that belong together in CLEARLY, and seeing them make conscious choices rather than arbitrarily "falling" into something as important as love. The contrast between this movie and the average low-budget shoot-em 'up black movie is quite different. Listen. If you are lucky, your copy will be accompanied by a copy of the soundtrack, as with me. Good stuff!
