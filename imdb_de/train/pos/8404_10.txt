Simple, but good-natured drive-in movie about a simple but good-natured high school graduate who dreams of owning the coolest custom van in the world to serve as a "ballroom". <br /> <br /> Bobby, our hero, spends all his savings on acquiring the vehicle of his dreams. Sharing and confessing quickly start with girls Bobby has picked up at the local pizza salon, but he finds out that responsibility, danger and heartbreak come from being the owner of such a mechanical miracle. The Van is a guilty pleasure from me. It captures the relaxed mood of the mid-70s and has enough inadvertent humor to bring it into the category "that's bad."
