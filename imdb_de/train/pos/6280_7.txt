If you like cars, you will love this movie! <br /> <br /> There are some great actors in this film, especially Vinnie Jones, with his typical, nonsensical attitude and hardcase appearance. The others are not bad either ... <br /> <br /> There are only two small flaws in this movie. First, the bad action, but people do not look at this movie for the plot. Second, the glorification of Grand Theft Auto (car crime). If people really believe that they can steal a Ferrari and get away with it, then you look good and hope you have a good time in prison! <br /> <br /> When I first read that Nicolas Cage was to star in the role, I thought at first "... Sweeet", but then I thought "... Naaaa you're sucking!" But finally, after watching the movie, I realized, "Yeah, he's shit!". Just a joke, he plays the role very well. <br /> <br /> I end this unusual review with the sentence: "If premature demise." The criminal has, in a sense, educated the general cinema about the grim finish under the shiny bricks of criminal life and encouraged him to change his behavior, then This death brings with it an inherent nobility and a glorious glory should all be so happy. One can say: "poor criminals". I say, "Poor us." ps - Angelina Jolie Voight looks very nice!
