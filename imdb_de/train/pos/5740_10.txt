The emotional powers and characters of Dominick and Eugene are the things Hollywood does not do anymore. This is one of the most emotional, sensitive and heartfelt movies I have ever seen! Roy Liotta, Tom Hulce and supporting actress Jamie Lee Curtis deliver Oscar winner performances! There are not enough words to express how great this movie is. Sure, people who are not interested in sentimental movies do not like Dominick and Eugene as much as the rest of us, but for the rest of us, this movie goes straight to the heart and the bottom of compassion and humanity. You will never forget this movie! <br /> <br /> ***** SPOILERS BELOW ***** <br /> <br /> The simple yet eloquent story is masterfully narrated. Eugene is a med-school intern who faces long hours in the hospital and a heavy workload. His brotherly twin brother Dominick (born 12 minutes ago) is a bit slow and awkward because he is the victim of abuse by his father due to brain damage. (A heartbreaking moment, when found out in the movie that will make you cry!) Eugene (aka K. A "Geno") faces a painful dilemma. He has to decide if he wants to complete his medical studies, which means that he has to take up residence in another city and leave Dominick (aka "Nicky") or give up the rest of his education to look after him , Nicky helps pay for his brother's school fees by working as a garbage collector. <br /> <br /> The questions of ethics, morals and responsibilities are masterfully blended in this milestone movie. Just when Gino thinks Nicky might be on his way to independence, Dominick turns around and does things, such as helping a drug dealer or using a broken cable he finds in the dump of an electrical device Larry is "The Character" and Nicky's partner on his garbage route who fills the gullible Dominick in Atlantic City with stories like Geno and Jennifer (his girlfriend he teaches in clinical pharmacology) and gambling makes all her money. But deep inside you can see that Larry takes care of him. On her rounds, Nicky also befriends a little boy who tells us that his father beat him, too. An end result is also tragic and the pain you see on Nicky's face when it happens speaks volumes. <br /> <br /> The sensitivity shared by the two brothers can not be enough. Everything Nicky wants is to be loved and to seek acceptance wherever he can. (ie he goes to church, loves Hulk Hogan) Geno loves Nicky more than anything else in the world. But can his brother become so independent that Geno can pursue his dream of the doctor? A brilliant movie that should have received more recognition than it deserved, but unfortunately it came out at about the same time as Rain Man, who was dealing with a similar problem. However, I like Dominick and Eugene better because it has a much stronger emotional component. Be warned that this movie is aimed directly at the tear ducts, so have Kleenex at hand! What a movie !!!!
