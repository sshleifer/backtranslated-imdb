Stylish, moody, innovative bloodbath for revenge. Of course also cheesy and sporadically very cheesy. It reminded me very much of The Big Heat, because the revenge plot was triggered by the same event and the girl is on the side of the good man because of the same bad behavior of evil. It is sad that there is no Gloria Grahame, but so fantastic that it is Alain Delon and not Glenn Ford. Could there be someone as beautiful as Alain in a cashmere pullover and trench coat? Nevertheless, he is totally hard and freezing cold. No one can touch him today - though someone like Jude Law might try, I think. Hard for any girl to look good with him. The music was funky and perfect, and there were several excellent car chases (and these are generally not my thing) - especially one that likes to be in the forest. People met in a creative and bloody way, for example in a junkyard cruncher. But outside the cheese, the overall atmosphere had an effect and was expertly carried out. More creativity, excitement and freshness in this "forgotten" movie than most I've seen recently.
