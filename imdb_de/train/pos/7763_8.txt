A thing about Hollywood, someone has a success and it is always copied. Another thing is that the players show some of their best performance outside of their home studio. <br /> <br /> Rock Hudson received such awards for his performance in Texas film Giant, which Universal executives have thought must have taken him to another modern Texas setting. <br /> <br /> Similarly, Robert Stack received great reviews for The High and the Mighty when the pilot, who cracked under the impact of a damaged aircraft, found it natural to give him another crack up-roll , <br /> <br /> Both goals were achieved in Written on the Wind. Before Hudson was the great ranch owner, he is now the son of a hunting companion of Robert Stack's father, who took Hudson under his wing. In other words, the James Dean part without Giant's James Dean racism. <br /> <br /> Lauren Bacall is the executive secretary of an ad agency using Stack's Hadley Oil Company. Hudson likes her, but she's staggered by Stack's millions, and when he courtes a girl, he has the means to really campaign. She marries Stack. <br /> <br /> And last but not least, we have Dorothy Malone, Stack's amoral sister, who has a yen for rock, but Rock will not get tangled up with this wild kid. <br /> <br /> Dorothy Malone spent over 10 years in a series of colorless movie heroine roles before she reached this gem. For her role as Marilee Hadley, she received an award for Best Supporting Actress, and this film was well-deserved. <br /> <br /> If you like sparkling Technicolor Fifties soap operas, this is the movie for you.
