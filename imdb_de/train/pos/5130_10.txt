... may seem like an exaggeration, but it is not. <br /> <br /> What's so hard to understand - why did not they make more musical shorts? Was not beauty completely obvious to everyone involved? I do not think so. So many short films were made for commercial reasons only, and with a bit of luck, there may be some artistic value. This is an exception - the only one? - where it seemed as if the director had a vision and could clearly appreciate the music as art. Why did nobody ever think about shooting Lester or Charlie Parker on a live date? Crazy, man. <br /> <br /> Too bad that there were no sequels. If you have seen something of similar quality, please share it!
