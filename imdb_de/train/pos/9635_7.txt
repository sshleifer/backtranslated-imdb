The romance of the film, which is also the main theme, is presented well and beautifully. The environment of the love story is too lyrical, graphic and unrealistic. Worse still, the main character's psychology, just like the end of the movie, is funny and incomprehensible. Do not hesitate to watch this movie if you have aroused your interest, but do not expect too much.
