This movie is half a documentary ... and it's pretty interesting ... <br /> <br /> This is a good movie ... based on the true story of how a bunch of Norwegian sabotage stopped producing heavy stuff Water in Rukjan, Norway, and the supply of the remaining heavy water to Germany. <br /> <br /> This movie is not perfect and could have been a little better ... the best part of The Movie is that some of the sabotage is played by itself. <br /> <br /> If you are interested in the history of the Second World War and the movie, this is a movie worth a look !!
