I always thought that was a long and boring talk-heads movie full of static indoor shots, Dude, I was wrong. "Election" is a highly intriguing and thoroughly compelling thriller drama that takes a deep and realistic look at the origins of Triad rituals. Characters are always on the move, and although you're always an outsider as a spectator, it's still possible to feel the tension that comes from specific characters' choices and ambitions. In addition, through meticulously composed lighting and atmospheric light-shadow contrasts, Johnnie To manages to create some truly opulent images. Although there is little to do, the ending is still shocking in its brutal depiction of brutality. A cool movie that deserves more attention, and I found the minimalist acoustic guitar score pretty good.
