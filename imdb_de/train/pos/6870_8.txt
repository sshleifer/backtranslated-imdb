From the beginning to the end, I really laughed throughout the movie. It's amazing that "The Groove Tube" may be the most grandiose yet daring of all comedy sketches. In this way, I like to watch television without being bored with tilting channels, just to suffer from insomnia! For 73 minutes the comic, funny humor never stops! Just think how this silly laugh can help you enjoy life more easily! It's a lot better than Comedy Central or any primetime show! Do yourself a favor and throw all those soft, lame romantic comedy movies in the bin! Better yet, tell your Box Office Manager that you want to have "The Groove Tube" back on the big screen!
