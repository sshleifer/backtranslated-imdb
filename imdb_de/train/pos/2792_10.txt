I love this movie. It's a great film that combines English and Indian cultures with feminist themes, such as girls who want to do sports that were previously reserved for men. It shows the struggles of both an Indian person who wants to break out of their cultural barriers and women who want to break out of the gender-specific restrictions of sport, especially in England. I believe that the cultural struggles are more emphasized than the other issues. <br /> <br /> Unlike the other comments, I do not think this movie is something like Dirty Dancing or any other such female movie. This step is loved by many people, men and women, young and old alike.
