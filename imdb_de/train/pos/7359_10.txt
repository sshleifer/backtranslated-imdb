where would you start a review of the movie Snitch'd? James Cahill, god rest his soul, made one of the wildest insights into the human psyche since Encino Man. His beautiful story tells of a drug-gendarme McClure, a name that stands for a Simpsons character who also happens to be an actor! The cop dives deep into the underworld of high school drug use, and discovers a group war that can pick up on Police Academy 1, and I mean the one in which Jones is racially denigrated by his new partner, but it manages to come out with some of them The funniest sounds you'll ever hear. <br /> <br /> Cahill's effects, both visual and acoustic, are electrifying. The slight pause between the actions on screen and from the speakers adds to the drama that gets choppy like a subterranean thriller. Kudos to his brilliant use of make-up, such as the highly compelling brand marks a gang member suffers in his showdown with an indoor grill! YUCK! I think the world of the film is less of James' Passion, his memory will continue and be reborn with every passing mention of his flagship production, Snitch'd. His insightful director's comment brought a coke hit to any discerning moviegoer, who is genuinely adept with the harsh reality that is life on the road, and captured by the beauty of a shaggy-haired punks banging over a trash can knocks. <br /> but I ask you, why did the Big Bosses swimming pool look so cheap? I'll tell you why, because that's life in Santa Ana, baby, it's not all over and hastily building offices, oh no. There are people who need to penetrate LA's soft, tattooed abdomen to engage in movements that are not inappropriate in a Double Dragon: The Play School For Special children's production. <br /> <The only downside I have with this movie is that there was never a sequel. Come on, Steven Spielberg, come on, George Lucas, come on, a guy who took revenge on Nerds 1 to 23, how hard it could be to go one step further and pay tribute to this great man, James Cahill pay. <br /> <He discovered Eva Longoria, you know. Oh yes, he did. <br /> <br /> Jonah
