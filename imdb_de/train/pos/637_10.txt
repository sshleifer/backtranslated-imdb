Okay, this show is nothing but great! It has a great story and plot and great actors and actresses. Jeremy Sumpter is so hot and he is perfect for the role! He is tall in Hollywood. He has a bright future ahead of him! This show lasts a long time because I really love this show and I hope it has a lot of success! That's so interesting. I was waiting for it to come out about 6 or 7 months and it's finally here and it's great! I take it too. I can watch it anytime! Too bad, it's only once a week. I wish it was at least twice a week, because now I wish it was Tuesday every day! I hope you all like this show! <br /> <br /> ~ Ashley ~
