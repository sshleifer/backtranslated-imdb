In 1958, Clarksberg was a famous city for speed traps. Many revenues have been made by the Sheriff's Department catching speed launches. Those who tried to overtake the sheriff? Well, that gave the sheriff a chance to push him off the Clarksberg turn with his Plymouth cruiser. For example, at the beginning of the film, some military who attempted to return to the base on vacation will be forced to death, if I recall correctly. Then one day a stranger drove into the city. Perhaps the coolest hot rodder in the world. Michael McCord Even his name is a car name, as in McCord Seals. In possibly the ultimate hot rod. A black flamed Ford coupe '34. The colors of death, evil and hellfire. He is purposely picked up by the sheriff for speeding. He checks the situation of the country. He is the brother of one of the sheriff's victims. He knows how his brother died. The Clarksberg government is all for the sheriff. There's only one way to get justice for killing his brother and fixing things so that "no one will ever happen again": set the hunt back on and set the battle for death in the hot Rodder style , He goes to the curve and practices. The sheriff knows McCord knows. The race begins ... This is a movie that anyone who has tried to master maneuvering on a particular track can remember.
