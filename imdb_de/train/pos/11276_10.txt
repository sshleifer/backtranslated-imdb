Hard to believe, but this film was denounced by more pulpits than immoral than any other movie produced before the blues-free Hayes code was introduced. Yes, indeed, priests have told their herds that anyone who has seen this movie would commit a mortal sin. <br /> <br /> I do not think so. They had several reasons: <br /> <br /> Subject: Jane likes sex. She and Tarzan are awakened one morning in their treetops home. She stretches herself sensually and says with a coquettish look, "Tarzan, you were a bad boy!" So they not only had sex, they also had perverted sex! A few years later, under the Hays code, people (especially women) should not be portrayed as sex. <br /> <br /> Item: Jane prefers a guiltless, though wise and resourceful savage (Tarzan) to a civilized, respectable nine to five (Holt) man. When Holt first wows her with a pretty dress from London, she wavers a bit. When Holt tries to kill Tarzan, and Holt and Jane both believe he is dead, she wavers a lot. But when she realizes that her husband is very much alive, the attractions of civilization disappear for her. And why not? Tarzan and Jane's relationship is egalitarian: he lacks the "civilized" insecurity that would force him to assert himself as the "head of his wife." He also lacks much more "civilized" Hangups, such as jealousy. When Holt and his buddy arrive, Tarzan greets them both and knows exactly that Holt is Jane's old flame. When Holt throws her in a London dress and slowly dances with her to a portable phonograph, Tarzan drops a tree and pulls out his knife. Jealous? Nope. He is only cautious of the strange music machine, as he has never seen one. Once it's explained, he's cool. <br /> <br /> Item: Civilized Holt is dirty. The wild Tarzan is innocently sexy. As Jane slips into Holt's lamplit tent, Holt looks at her silhouette as she changes into the costume. In contrast, after Tarzan pulled off the dress playfully, stepping into the swimming hole and immersed behind her, follows the tastiest erotic nude scene in all cinemas: the couple spends five minutes in a beautiful water ballet (The scene was filmed in three versions - dressed, topless and nude - the scene was cut before the release of the film, but the nude version is restored in the video now available Jane makes it clear that her irritation is only caused by the proximity of "civilized" men and their hangups. universal madness "so dear to the seminarians, nowhere is that where." Another reason why putting the film down was sin. <br /> <br /> Subject: The notion that man is the crown of creation and that Animals are only for the use and comfort of humans, requires heavy blows Holt and his buddy want to "elephant cemetery" be guided so that they can pick up the ivory and take home. They want Tarzan to lead them to the cemetery. You, reader, think "big chance!" and you are right. He is shocked He calls "elephant sleep!" what explains everything to him. Jane explains Tarzan's feelings, which the two "gentlemen" find ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Item: Jane, the ex-civilized woman, is far more resourceful than the two civilized men she accompanies. Holt and buddy blow it and are besieged by hostile tribes and wildlife. It's Jane who keeps her cool. As the boys panic, they take control, barking orders, and handing out their rifles. <br /> <br /> Subject: Jane's costume is a kind of poncho with nothing underneath. (The original idea was that she is topless and the foliage artistically blocks her nipples, which is actually the case in a short scene.) Finally, several men complained of the cloth because the film was "Tarzan and his comrade" and not Called "Tarzan and his wife". No comment! <br /> <br /> Of course, Tarzan, who has been well looked after by his monkey friends, comes to help the white hunters and causes the pack elephants and African bearers to return the ivory they stole to the holy place from where it came. The end. <br /> <br /> So you have it. An absolutely subversive movie. Like all other films about complex and interesting women (see, for example, Possessed with Rita Hayworth and Raymond Massey), which represented such a fluid genre in the early 1930s and was brought to such an abrupt end by the adoption of the Hays Code. <br /> <br /> The joie de vivre of this film is best expressed in Jane's soprano version of the famous Tarzan-Yell. A nice gesture that unfortunately was abandoned in future productions. <br /> <br /> Let's hear it for artistic freedom, feminist Jane and sex.
