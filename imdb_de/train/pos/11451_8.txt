A very appealing documentary about Scottish artist Andy Goldsworthy, whose works are mostly short-lived sculptures made from elements of nature. His work consists of rocks, leaves, grass, ice, etc., which fly away when the tide arrives at the beach or the wind blows on the field. Therefore, most of Goldsworthy's works are not really permanent except as photos or films of what they were. It can be argued that Goldsworthy's works are a reflection of mortality or words, but it is no easier to say that what he does is simply beautiful art. At a time when the stereotype of artists is that they are mostly bitter, overbearing, often mentally unstable people living in run-down urban environments, Goldsworthy seems to be the opposite: a stable, unpretentious, family-oriented person who is the one and only Nature loves and lives in a small village in Scotland (of course I'm sure these are the same reasons why he was shunned by some art world people who felt his work was fluffy or superficial).
