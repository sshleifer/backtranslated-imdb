I managed to play this from my satellite, but I would like to get an original version in a format that we can use here in the US. Eddie is truly glorious in this performance from San Francisco. I can not remember laughing so hard at a stand-up routine. My wife and I enjoyed this band and its work on Glorious. I just wish I could buy a copy and help financially support Eddie with my purchase. We need more of his shows available.
