"The second beginning," as the title explains, shows us the beginning of the end of humanity. Long before the Matrix existed, this short anime anime written by Wachowski shows the world that could be in the not-too-distant future set at the turn of the 21st century, and the second Renaissance deals with human behavior; Greed, power, control, vanity, etc. <br /> <br /> The use of robots or artificial intelligence as slaves or servants is common in science fiction / fantasy stories. The second renaissance is no exception to this concept, but instead of a simple man-to-machine layout, this story explains the struggle machines are taking on the fight for acceptance in a human-dominated world. Where the matrix films show us the human perspective, these short animations tell both sides of the story. <br /> <br /> The second Renaissance Phase 1 + 2 answers many questions of the original Matrix movie, such as: For example, how the war broke out, how the sky was black, which led to people being used as batteries, and he also took us to Machine City 01, which could be relevant to the upcoming Matrix Revolution movie. <br /> <br /> I will not reveal too much of the story as I do not want to ruin the experience for perspective viewers. However, I will recommend it to anyone who is interested in the world of the Matrix, or just anyone who is interested in Japanese animation (anime)). <br /> <br /> 9/10.
