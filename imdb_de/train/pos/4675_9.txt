I saw "Brother's Shadow" at the Tribeca Film Festival and still had to think about it two days later. The story of a lost son (Scott Cohen), who returned to his family's furniture store after a jail term, has all the necessary qualities of a solid drama - memorable characters; sharp, attentive dialogue; Sensitive use of the camera by a filmmaker who thinks visually. <br /> <br /> But more than that, it's something that is all too rare in multiplexing today: the uncompromising vision of mature sensibility. The talent of director-screenwriter Todd S. Yellin seems to be evolving, but we feel he (like his protagonist) has paid his dues. He knows how real people fight in this world, and he knows how we strive to see success - or at least experience it as a proxy. Nevertheless, Yellin respects his audience too much to blow merry smoke into our hind ends. In the end, we see that Jake's triumph is not in commissions or even in the esteem of his family, but in "work" he could not give up if he tried. <br /> <br /> It is an essential issue in a world (and especially a film industry) that can not rise above "the end result". This movie deserves a wide audience.
