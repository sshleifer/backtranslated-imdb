Despite reading the "first comments" from someone who curiously disliked the film - (WHY IS THE ONLY NEGATIVE COMMENTARY VERY FIRST ON THE LIST?), It was very nice to see that almost everyone else loved him! Obviously, the church wanted to highlight certain points and positively portray the Prophet Joseph Smith - that's the whole idea. And indeed, these points were extremely effective. We already know that Joseph Smith was a human being ... but despite all the terrible negative attempts of the adversary, it showed how he could accomplish a remarkable work given by God. I would recommend it to everyone!
