In War, Inc. we find the logical extension of the current outsourcing of all war related activities that we currently operate in Afghanistan and Iraq. If you're familiar with the antics of Halliburton, Kellogg, Brown & Root and Blackwater overseas, you're already halfway to fully appreciate the satire of Cusack's latest play. Cusack plays a drummer named Brand Hauser, who is in Turiquistan organizing a mass in the newly liberated country as he waits to access his current destination. There he finds himself fascinated by the anti-establishment reporter, who is played by Marisa Tomei, and follows by the over-sex pop star, who is played by Hilary Duff. We are introduced to the past of Hauser, which includes a tragedy that has haunted him ever since, and the company's assistant, Marsha Dillon, who actually runs the entire operation for him (and was hilariously played by Joan Cusack). While some moments are played suitably over the top, they are not always the moments you expect, and the little touches will often surprise you. All principals show solid performances. Duff's accent comes and goes, but otherwise she does a very good job and does a lot to dispel her Disney image. Tomei is funny, but unobtrusive, while the Cusacks own almost every scene they are in. To be fair, they receive good material. The authors write a good script with enough twists and turns and visual gags to make you giggle all the way to the predictable outcome. In fact, the predictability of the end is the only thing that keeps me from rating them higher, as the story turns and makes its way to the expected end probably not enough to interest the entire movie. On the other hand, if you like smart comedy and broad satire, this is for you.
