I've thought for years that this knockabout service comedy is a product of John Ford, especially with Victor McLaglen as one of the lead roles. It certainly has the same rough house humor Ford puts together with his films. <br /> <br /> To my surprise, I learned that it was actually George Stevens who was in charge of the direction. I still refuse to believe that this film was not offered to John Ford, but he was probably in Monument Valley and did Stagecoach. Victor McLaglen and Cary Grant and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. play three Sergeants of the Indian Army who have a nice camaraderie / comradeship. But the old gang breaks up because Fairbanks is engaged to Joan Fontaine. Not if his two friends can help him, supported and supported by regimental beastie Gunga Din, played by Sam Jaffe. The Rudyard Kipling poem inspired this RKO film about barracks in British Raj. The comic Leads game is so good that it overshadows the film's incredibly racist message. Not that the makers were racist, but this was the assumption of the British at that time, including our leads, and Gunga Din shows this most effectively. <br /> <br /> The British gradually adopted India, doing business here and doing business there with local rulers under a weak Mughal emperor, which was abolished in the mid-19th century. They governed very little about India, that would have been impossible. Their rule depended on the native troops that you see here. Note that the soldiers can not rise above the rank of corporal, and Gunga Din has a much lower status than that. <br /> <br /> Note that the rebels are indeed Hindu and not Muslim. There are as many tribes of this religion as there are Christian sects, and this choking cult was quite real. Of course those affected do not have the same view of them as liberators. But until India organized its independence movement, until the founding of the Congress Party, these people were the voice of a free India. <br /> <br /> But no matter how you cut it, the strangulation of people is not a nice thing and the British have their point of view. When I look at Gunga Din, I think of Star Trek and the reason the Supreme Directive came into being. Cary Grant was allowed to play his real Cockney-self here instead of the urban Cary we're used to. Fairbanks and McLaglen are very good with roles that are tailored to their personality. <br /> <br /> However, the best actor in the film is Eduard Ciannelli as guru, the head of the choking cult. Notice the fire and the passion in his performance. He blows everyone else off the screen when it's on. <br/> <br /> The favorite scene in Gunga Din is that Ciannelli admonishes his troops in their mountain temple. Notice how Stevens darkens the background around Ciannelli until you see only eyes and teeth like a spooky Halloween mask. Spooky, frightening and very effective. <br /> <br /> After the action of this film in the late 19th century, more and more British citizens began to question the underlying assumptions that justified the Raj. But that's the topic of Gandhi. <br /> <br /> Gunga Din is still a great movie, entertaining and fun. It should be shown with A Passage to India and Gandhi and you can show how the Indian independence movement has developed.
