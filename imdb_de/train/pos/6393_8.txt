This is a must for independent movie fans, but it also holds up well against mainstream movies. I think we have the stuff for the next Woody Allen or Trentino Tarrentino here. <br /> <br /> The budget is painfully low. No special effects, and they seemed to use ambient light (recorded in digital video). And yet this film reaches for you and will not let you go. The script is a bit bizarre, but the actors and the director show it with absolute realism. It has humor, it has intrigue and it has pathos and it all works together. <br /> <br /> It does not make sense to describe the details. If you want to see an independent <br /> <br /> masterpiece, a virtual lesson on how to make a low budget movie that really works, you will see it. <br /> <br /> -Oh yes, that's really entertaining. <br /> <br />
