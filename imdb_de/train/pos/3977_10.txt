I personally looked at it to see the recordings of the 60s and 70s. It was fascinating to see how the drug movement essentially began and became a pop culture and ultimately an uncompromising force in life. The interviews of the classic rock stars are sparkling and humorous. You feel like you're in a secret and nodding your head at the same time ... because it feels so good and familiar. I loved it, all segments from 60 to today. I recommend it for all aspects, including rock music, hip movement, politics and good story. I put a check in the box that it contains a spoiler just because I have no idea what some people think is a spoiler in this context, as I've discussed what's in all 4 segments, so I just wanted be sure.
