Like the characters on this show, I was a teenager in the 1970s. The producers have really nailed all the zeitgeist to stand outside the city as a teenager in the 70s. The 70s fashion, cars, home furnishings, food and fashions are all very authentic in this show. <br /> <br /> The show has a very talented ensemble that works very well in front of the camera. I like the unique, psychedelic movie sequences. No other show makes such camera tricks. These cutting-edge movie clips really help to convey the plump hips that shaped the 70s. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is a very funny sitcom. The only thing that bothers me about this show is the excessive reliance on cruel humor to make laughter. That way, I think this show is too much like Married With Children. Although Married with Children is a great sitcom, the creators of That 70s keep showing that they're trying to imitate them. <br /> <br /> I recommend That 70s Show, mainly because of its nostalgia factor. However, it could be an even better show if the authors rely more on witty dialogues than shabby, tasteless jokes and pranks.
