This movie has a constant, haunting tempo, backed up with great acting (one of Chamberlain's best performances) and a story revealed to us over time. In addition, the music sets the mood and the mood is in full swing helping to get a restless, cautious and sombre tone. <br /> <br /> Weir's story is enhanced by the use of Native Americans, their stories and their tensions with the dominant white population to deliver an ominous fantasy story. <br /> <br /> Although they are unrelated in both history and genre, the same feeling was preserved in me as in Ursula Le Guin's "Lathe of Heaven" (1980). <br /> <br /> "The Last Wave" is a dramatic thriller with some shocking moments. Keep in mind that Hitchhiking does not turn a movie into a horror movie; it is the psychological element of fear and anxiety that rests in all of us.
