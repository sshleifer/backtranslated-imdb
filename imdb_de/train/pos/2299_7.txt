Who said that horror is not an educational film genre? Thanks to this wonderful Hammer short film, I NEVER know to offer wine and a slice of bread with salt to a stranger in my own house because he may be just a hypnotist and this combination gives him the power to control my mind and mind forever ! Thanks, great! The tenth episode in the House of Horror series is another one I was looking forward to, mainly because Don Sharp was the guy in the director's chair; one of Britain's best filmmakers, but still sadly underestimated. Sharp was responsible for some very cool hit movies like "Kiss of the Vampire" and "Rasputin: The Mad Monk", as well as for some overlooked independent productions like "Dark Places" and "Psychomania". His contribution to House of Horror is undoubtedly one of the best in the series, with a complex but intriguing storyline and engaging occult themes. At the heart of the plot are two antique dealers who encounter a strange object that resembles a mirror. It is indeed an ancient device that can be used to summon Choronzhon. the demonic guardian of the abyss. The mirror is in great demand of a satanic cult, as he needs it for his ceremonies, but Michael only wants to sell it before he realizes the true value of the device. As he picks up a clearly petrified girl who runs in front of the cult, not to become a victim, Michael is drawn even deeper into an occult conspiracy. Satanic cults and the carnal sacrifice of young women are typical British horror themes, but the script by David Fischer is never boring and offers plenty of neat action, including a very imaginative climax. There is also a lot of excitement to admire, the dialogue is funny and the acting is great (especially John Carson as leader of the cult is really scary). Recommended!
