I have no idea what people complain about. I saw this movie yesterday and I really liked it. Once again, Stone provided a great character. She was as good as in the first Basic Instinct. She still has these clever but tricky answers. Although Sharon may be 48 years old ... she looks amazing! I do not care if she's as wrong as a Barbie. She looks good and that's it. Basic Instinct 2 gives you everything you want from the beginning. Sex, violence and a great ending where you will think and talk about it for hours! Half of the people who comment on this movie did not even see him. So do not listen to her.
