I have to admit that this movie totally shocked me. First of all, on a whim, I expected it to be a bit mediocre, but the most shocking thing was that it was in a Populist American cinema. This is a British comedy at its finest - dark, quirky and funny in a way that American movies just are not. But I have to stop short of recommending this to everyone wholeheartedly. I have seen it with several people, some Englishmen, some Europeans and some Americans. And although some of us (mostly from the first two groups) loved it, some hated it and found it worthless. If you think you're in that kind of stuff then go. If not, do not do it. 10/10.
