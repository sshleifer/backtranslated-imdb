The film version of Alice Walker's highly moving and influential novel from 1983 (mostly written as letters to the central character Celie to God) was a huge Oscar hit, and rightly so. In the role of the Abused and aroused Celie, Whoopi Goldberg showed her best screen performance after miles. Not far behind her was Oprah Winfrey as Sofia, the fiery woman tamed by fate. Others in the lineup spelled out the characters Walker had so clearly pictured on the page - Danny Glover as Albert, Celie's abusive husband; Margaret Avery as a Shug, a force of change for the good; Willard Pugh and Rae Dawn Chong as Harpo and Squeak; Susan Beaubian as Corrine, the preacher's wife; and the much-missed Carl Anderson (otherwise known as Judas in the 1973 Judas film by Jesus Christ Superstar) as Preacher Samuel. <br /> <br /> Nicely camouflaged and perceptively written: "The Color Purple" does justice to its source while opening the story to include viewers of a full-length drama.
