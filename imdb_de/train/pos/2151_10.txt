Funny. Sad. Charming These are all words that went through my mind as I watched this beautiful, simple movie. <br /> <br /> It's rare that a movie really moves me, but "Should we dance?" did it with mercy to save. Soft humor mixed with occasionally subtle agony easily made this one of the best experiences in my film history. It left a calm feeling of jubilation, but with a hint of sadness mixed in. <br /> <br /> And the dancing, oh yes, the dancing. Even if you are not an art lover or can not put one foot in front of another, the steps shown here will take your breath away and you want to sign up for the lesson as soon as possible. It was absolutely adorable. Even the parts that showed Sugiyama's steps (movingly described by Koji Yakusho) when he learned to dance for the first time were charming in a humorous, childlike way. And yet this film was not just about dancing, but about the intricacies of human behavior and emotion. We experience a timid man who has learned to express his suppressed feelings through dance, a beautiful dance teacher who rediscovers her love of the arts and the personal growth of each member of the wonderful minor cast. <br /> <br /> Beauty. Pain. Emotion. All the love and the little torments of life are shown here in the fine feeling of a fine Japanese watercolor painting, combined with the emotional power and grace of the culture. <br /> <br />
