[No Corruptors] <br /> <br /> As a David Lynch movie, you might get the idea that this enigmatic mind is portrayed by him as it is in most of his feature films. But it's a very straightforward story, as the title suggests. Unless you are trapped in the usual Lynchian invisibility that normally occurs after viewing, eg. B. Lost Highway. It's a simple movie, but it's actually a great movie. This is both innovative and entertaining. It's innovative because it's not Lynch. But maybe that's Lynch. He likes to tweak our thoughts and therefore puts together a movie that seems very mainstream and far away from Lynch himself. Being a very avant-garde director, maybe he just shoots a movie just to tease his regular audience because he knows what he's expecting, but he does not give it to them. That would be smart. <br /> <br /> The tempo of the movie is slow. I'd almost say lawnmower speed ... Do not expect an action orgy, but the movie is really entertaining for those who go with the flow of the movie. Pay close attention to the little details that Lynch draws throughout our movie for our entertainment. Look for the great camera that brings this movie to life. And listen to Badalamenti's score and the main theme that regularly animates the landscapes of Iowa and Wisconsin. <br /> <br /> Farnsworth shows one of his best performances in this film, making him one of the most likeable old men ever portrayed in the film. He does not have to say anything to express his feelings and thoughts. His cheerfulness only shines through him and his acting earned him an Oscar nomination. Do I have to say that his weak health has not acted in this movie? He was diagnosed with cancer and shot himself immediately after completing the film. This knowledge simply puts more emphasis on the movie, because it rather becomes a tribute to Farnsworth. <br /> <br /> All the above things make a very nice movie suitable for all kinds of people who like a movie the way it should. One might ask for not so obvious and a bit naive sermons, but that does not ruin the overall picture, as it is a memorable movie. 10.9.
