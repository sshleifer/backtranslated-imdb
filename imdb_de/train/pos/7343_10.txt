Why this movie has almost disappeared is an absolute crime. "Conan" is perhaps the only sword and magic movie that is better. The brutal violence, cool character designs and good pace make this one of the best fantasies there is. It's certainly the biggest animated movie that's aimed at an adult audience I've ever seen. This is not similar to the usual frenetic style of Bakshi. For Bakshi that is quite a departure, and in my opinion his best work. I hope this movie gets the recognition it deserves.
