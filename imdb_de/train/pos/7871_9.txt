Madhur Bhandarkar takes up all taboo topics and gives the most realistic picture of modern society. One has the impression of the director also from his earlier films such as Satta and Chandni Bar. The topics that were hinted at in the last film are examined and illuminated here in their entirety. The casting is amazing and you can see the judgments in each scene from different angles. Most of the time the film leaves a lot of facts. When you start guessing things, you're usually close, but many scenes are missing the mark. It leaves a lasting impression. <br /> <br /> There are actors like Konkana Sen Sharma, Boman Irani and Atul Kulkarni. The dialogues are well written, and you feel like you've lived with some of these people. There are still some scenes in which you can think of more depths. The songs are in the background and save time, and Lata's voice in a very meaningful song "Kitne Ajeeb" makes you feel left alone in modern society!
