Kolchak is pure entertainment. Great stories and a great cast. Darren McGavin gives an energetic performance that captivates the audience. Simon Oakland, Jack Grinnage and Ruth McDevitt provide McGavin with the solid support most starring stars can only dream of. Some excellent guest stars add color and vibrancy to episodes - Erik Estrada in Legacy of Terror, Phil Silvers in Horror in the Heights, Antonio Fargas in The Zombie. It's easy to see a boy watching Kolchak, who made Chris Carter create The X Files. Darren - RIP. Simon - RIP. Ruth - RIP.
