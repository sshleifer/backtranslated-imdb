I'm a big fan of Jet Li! He is THE best HK action movie star alive ... and consequently - this movie has rocked! I've seen it in the video store and since it was in the mainstream area of ​​this mainstream video store, I did not register its presence at first and had to look twice. I knew immediately what I would rent. My only criticism (I suppose I expected it) is that it was dubbed (AAARGh) and not subtitles. The original / weird / cool action of the movie and its full action made it one of the better films of Jet Li ... even if they all fall into this category ...
