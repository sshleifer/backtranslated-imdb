While I was at the video store, I rummaged through the one-dollar rental and came across this little gem. I do not know what it was about, but I only had one true Instic, and I've always been right. <br /> <br /> The story revolves around two girls who have just survived a school. One of the girls is Alicia, a teenage rebel who is the only one to witness the full attack, and another is Deanna, another survivor who miraculously survived a bullet in the head. Thrown together by fate, they slowly begin a painful and beautiful account of healing and progress. <br /> <br /> I just hate when amazing movies fall through the cracks. Wow, what a performance by Busy Phillips and Erkia Christensen, not to mention the rest of the cast! My only complaint is that the DVD lacked special features painfully. Oh, and some of the jump cuts in the movie were kind of exciting. But all in all, an excellent movie.
