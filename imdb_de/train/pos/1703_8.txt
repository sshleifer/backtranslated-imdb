Being myself from a small town in Illinois, I can immediately refer to this movie. Given the era in which it was made, the citizens look like many people I grew up with. Yes, the story is so-so. And yes, Acting will not be nominated for an Oscar so soon. but that is not the point. It's about exposing reality and just having fun. And this movie is a lot of fun. From the greedy, thoughtless banker to the well-meaning but weak deputy, this movie was made to enjoy the sci-fi genre and small-town life. Who can not smile at the sight of the Enforcer Drone or the Vern Droid? and I loved the FarmZoid. I wish I had one when I grew up. All in all, considering the technology available at the time, this is a pleasant time for childhood when one could sit back with popcorn on a Saturday afternoon and laugh at the weaknesses of small-town life. This is a movie I would watch over and over again just making fun of myself and out of my little town.
