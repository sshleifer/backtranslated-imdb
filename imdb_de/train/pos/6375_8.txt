While I have great respect for Disney animated films, they have not really been what I would call "must-see" lately. Atlantis looked fascinating from the first movie poster and trailer and thankfully fulfilled my expectations. <br /> <br /> Atlantis is a "more mature" Disney movie in the sense that it lacks songs (a very unusual feature for a movie) Disney movie in fact) and focuses more on action and discovery than any other offer from Disney. The world of Atlantis, which is hidden beneath the Earth's core, is fantastic, presented as devastated caves with ruins and is slowly evolving into ecosystems that, though usually reminiscent of hardness, are becoming more and more fascinating until the tropical paradise itself is reached. The presentation of the landscape and the surroundings of Atlantis, without a lavish happy song, gave the kingdom a much nicer and more intriguing appearance. The inclusion of an Atlantic language, as well as attempts to integrate it into the mythology of the real civilizations of antiquity, contributes to this and works quite well. <br /> <br /> Even with the exception of some scenes where moles occur Practical jokes, it did not seem to be much of a "childish" element that I usually associate with Disney movies. Instead, the main elements were the fight for Atlantis and the constant discovery in Atlantis. Milos, the outsider, could learn everything he needed to know about the place by helping the Atlanteans discover parts of their own history. They knew nothing about it. This includes the Atlantic "weapon", which is used in a very action-packed climax, which is quite exciting for lack of a better word. <br /> <br /> Granted, not the whole story is full of meaning and the movie does not offer any amazing new computer-generated visual effects, but apart from the Toy Story movies, this is the most entertaining Disney movie I've seen in years ,
