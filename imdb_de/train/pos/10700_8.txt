This is a comedy that is undoubtedly based on national stereotypes. If you go away and pretend that you know what Communism is all about, and what real Russians or Britons are, if you accept and are not violated by the conventions, you can have fun with this film. Nicole Kidman is at her best, sexy, moving and funny. Ben Chaplin manages to be completely overshadowed by Nicole, and the rest of the cast also does a good job. Of course, the finale is moving and logical. Worth seeing if you accept the rules of the game.
