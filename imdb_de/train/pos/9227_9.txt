Post-feminist portrayal of cruelty and sadism. <br /> <br /> Spoiler alarm! <br /> <br /> This underrated gem of a movie tells the story of Flavia, a fifteenth-century girl immured in a convent after defining his father and all medieval Christian society with a fallen Islamic warrior as a human figure and not as a demonic figure. <br /> <br /> The monastery's patriarchal rule (which can not be accepted in a scene where the bishop is flanked by soldiers and monks flanking him), Flavia begins explicitly in which society she finds herself and brings, by bumping into a whole system of subjugation, oppression, and violence, inevitably a tragic end to itself, but also to those around them far from the truth. This is a film that describes the consequences of violence, the effects of patriarchal domination, the nature of rebellion and the corruption of the human mind. I have described it as "post-feminist" in the title of this piece, and in the end Flavia triumphs must always be corrupted, compromised and perverted by men. Even Flavia's cruel end is committed by men for men (the women turn away and only the monks watch without horror). Concerning the much-discussed violence: This is an account of the effects of violence and the violence horror of one driven by religious excesses World: Shunning the violence would have limited the film's impact, cheapened the film, and allowed it to enter the patriarchal discourse it revealed. He is also a realistic portrait of medieval society. Beautifully filmed, brilliantly played (especially by Florinda Bolkin and Maria Casares), contains a wonderful score of piovani and is still challenging after all these years. Flavia is a classic of European cinema.
