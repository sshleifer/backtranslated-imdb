I have just come back from the first show of Basic Instinct 2. I was already thinking that it would be shitty because of the review critics, and I was pleasantly surprised! If you liked the original Basic Instinct, you'll enjoy # 2 as much, if not more. Great story that keeps you asking and thinking. The music is excellent and the theme of the original is reinterpreted. Do not expect Oscar material, look at it to enjoy it and have fun. That's what films are for - escapism. I can not think of a better escape option than fleeing with Sharon Stone, who is as sexy as she ever was. I'm thinking of seeing it again this weekend. Look at it!
