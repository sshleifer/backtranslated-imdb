The scenery and the actors make this TV movie the best representation of Dickens' classic history. George C. Scott is as credible as the rest of the cast. His Scrooge is stuck with malice until the end of the movie. Then his character changes to one who is truly repentant. The 19th-century English city, chosen for the setting, creates an ambience that matches Dickens and enhances the plausibility of this film. It's a movie I see every Christmas, along with the real Grinch and It's A Wonderful Life.
