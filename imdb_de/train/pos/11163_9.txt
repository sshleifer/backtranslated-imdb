I love this Freekin movie! Walsh is a true master of cinematic form, and I think his film was sometimes overlooked. However, this film is a favorite of mine because it really gives you the feeling at the time the movie was filmed. All the wonderful characters that existed, the lifestyle, the style of clothing and the way you talked, OK, they might be overkill, but it's good to know that there were occasions when two men tried to get involved insane insane stunts waddled by many people and appreciated because of this fact. <br /> <br /> Can I get it on DVD somewhere? I only saw it on TV. But for anyone who wants a piece of life film over that time span, this is the perfect movie.
