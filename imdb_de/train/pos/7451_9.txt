Here is one that the whole family will enjoy ... even for those who consider fairytales too old. Shelley Duvall outdid himself with this unique, imaginative interpretation of almost all popular childhood tales. The scripts provide new twists to the ancient fables we grew up in, and there are a handful of stars in each episode. "Cinderella" is no exception to Duvall's standard, and I think it's one of the first five in the series, highlighted by Jennifer Beals (remember her on "Flashdance" - and she's still in Hollywood doing things here and there a movie) the title role, Jean Stapleton as the good fairy with southern accent and Eve Arden as the embodiment of the evil stepmother. Edie McClurg ("Ferris Bueller's Day Off") and Jane Alden are step-sisters for a funny duo. Matthew Broderick is a friendly Prince Henry. They will come again and again!
