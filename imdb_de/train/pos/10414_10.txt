I discovered Alexander Korda's (1940) fantasy, THE THIEF OF BAGDAD, in the early fifties for the first time in a new edition, called "The Wonder Show of the Century!" Both Korda Technicolor films, THE THIEF OF BAGDAD and JUNGLE BOOK were shown in a program that should never be forgotten. The music by Miklos Rozsa supported both films. The technicolor in each one was amazingly beautiful! THE THIEF OF BAGDAD has remained on my list as the best fantasy film of all time. Over the years, it has become harder to enjoy the color of the film in the way it was originally presented. True Technicolor stepped in the mid-fifties to give way to an Eastman color process. Both Kino and Samuel Goldwyn have reissued the film both theatrically and on video. But the Eastman color prints were more pastel-colored and dampened the vibrancy of the original Technicolor. The laser disc version of this title also has the pastel look - nice, but not as it should be. NOW comes the M-G-M DVD (December 3, 2002). THE THIEF OF BAGDAD once again has the wonderful Technicolor look on a DVD that is just STUNNING !!! It was so exciting to see it again so that I looked at it a second time after watching the DVD for the first time. The only "extras" are a Spanish version with subtitles, subtitles in English and Spanish as well as a beautiful original theater trailer. Many thanks to M-G-M for this extraordinary DVD release. Now one can only hope that Korda's FOUR FEATHERS and a restored version of Korda's JUNGLE BOOK (to replace bad publicity in circulation) will soon be released on DVD.
