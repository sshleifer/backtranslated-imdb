I can only praise the other reviews here. It's a delightful movie with a feel-good effect that he achieves without breaking the line in stuffy sentimentality. Of course, sweet - without added sugar. <br /> <br /> One small point: I think the mild objections to Ustinov's character Pendelton, who is able to enter and defeat the system, ignore the fact that Pendelton is clearly a genius / savant at something like that. Yes, the film was pretty computer illiterate, but Pendelton showed in his apartment 'studying computers', and I believe the implication was that his gifts allowed him to flood the whole topic virtually overnight. <br /> <br /> There were a few strange moments when Gnatpole tried in some scenes to test Pendelton's knowledge and call his bluff. I'm not sure if we should think Pendelton made sense of these situations, or if he was really good enough to pass the tests - it was a bit unclear to know enough to set up the dummy accounts , Presumably, Wallach and Ustinov have relied on their own rather misty idea of ​​how computers worked at the time. To understand exactly what they are aiming at, it is necessary to know exactly what their concept is. They knew that 'procedure' meant something that was important. They felt that the "intelligent light" could actually control safety rather than just indicate its condition. They felt that the functions of the (stupid) user terminal would greatly affect the impact on the mainframe itself - even though I do not see myself apart from the graphics capabilities. <br /> <br /> Mostly I think you tried to avoid the subject of the actual computer process as much as possible, and they did quite well. If I gave them a bit of artistic license, I do not think their efforts had any notable flaws. <br /> <br /> CD
