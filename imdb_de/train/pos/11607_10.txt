Picture Bride has a great insight into Hawaii's past and the people who lived there during that time. The time, the money earned, and the hours these people have invested in their lives to survive and live have a whole new meaning for blood, sweat and tears, which we do today across the web. Only that is more of snail mail. Very slow snail mail. <br /> <br /> Singing the songs of the plantation from the workers reminds me of the songs of the southern plantation workers at their demise and their future goals. <br /> <br /> The film shows the harshness as well as gentle romantic scenes that Hawaii can bring. Like the silence of a coming storm and the sudden chaos of the rain and then the silence.
