I got it a few weeks ago and I love it! It's modern, light, but full of true complexity of life. It asks and answers, just like other Eytan Fox movies. This is my favorite, along with Jossi & Jagger. These pictures are much more universal than just the bubbles we can live in. You do not have to be Jewish or gay to enjoy it - I'm not, but the movie goes right into my top ten films. At first it seems to be pure entertainment, but you have to keep thinking. Relationships we have to live with are superficial, meaningful, deep, deadly, as you call it. You do not know what's coming, and you definitely do not know where this story is going when you first see it. It is worth seeing several times. Fox films include great bonus material - here's a great music video and "The Making of" (including the explanation of the title, an interview with Lior Ashknenazi, who plays himself in the movie, and Arabs with doubts about Israeli lifestyles).
