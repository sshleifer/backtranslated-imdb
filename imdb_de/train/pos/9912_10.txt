Absolutely wonderful drama and Ros is top notch ... I highly recommend this movie. In my opinion, their performance was Oscar material! The only real sad fact here is that Universal did not realize that this movie was ever available in any video format, be it on tape or on DVD. They ignore a VERY good movie. But Universal has little regard for his library on DVD, which is sad. If you have the chance to see this somewhere (not sure why it rarely goes on cable), then see it! I will not go into the story because I believe that most people would rather have an opinion on the film and write too many "reviewers" for hours on the story, which is available everywhere. <br /> <br /> 10!
