The plot of this entertaining MGM musical is unconventional and occasionally amusing and deals with espionage and romance. The focus of the film, however, is on the melodic interludes that feature the enormously talented and athletic tap dance Eleanor Powell supported by Tommy Dorsey and his orchestra with Ziggy Elman, Buddy Rich and Frank Sinatra. Red Skelton shares the payoff with Powell, and he and his buddy Bert Lahr receive most of the comedic records, though Skelton is more effective in believing that he appears as Powell's love interest, with Virginia O'Brien actually being the best of humor Films as a companion of the dancer. The technical brilliance of Powell shows in an incredible scene in which Buddy Rich brings his drum skills and must be viewed several times, so that the breath can catch up with their precision. Director Edward Buzzell uses his large cast well to advance the action well despite the rather incoherent script he has to deal with, and allows Powells Cotangen's impossibilities to govern the matter as appropriate.
