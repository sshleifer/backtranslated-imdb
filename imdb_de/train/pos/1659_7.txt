"Artemisia", one of the first female painters to have a historical reputation, tells the true story of a passionate aspiration of the young Italian for artistic expression and the vicissitudes she encounters. The film features costly costumes and sets as well as good cast and acting. However, he is confused in his attempt to depict the esotericism of art and time, and is not uninspired in his portrayal of the artist's passion, as painted on canvas and explored through her entanglements with men. A good movie for anyone interested in Renaissance paintings or historical films.
