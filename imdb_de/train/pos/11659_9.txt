This animated film (a co-production between Ireland, Belgium and France) deals with one of the strangest topics ever made for a film: the emergence of a famous illuminated manuscript, the Book of Kells, in the 9th century. In this fantastic retelling of this story, a prepubescent boy named Brendan, who lives in a monastery governed by his uncle, a stern abbot anxious to prepare the defense of the abbey from the imminent attack of the dreaded Vikings, must enter the vile Surrounding Forest to find the materials a master lighting device called Aidan needs to finish the book. To accomplish this task, he unexpectedly finds the help of a friendly fairy named Aisling in the forest. The hand is hand-drawn (there are some computer animations in some key passages) that resembles both the medieval and the traditional Celtic style of art, and with a very creative use of color and all sorts of geometric shapes, this film is relentlessly alien, but a good stranger, not from the repulsive variety, but from the way the eye opens. If you made nitpick - beyond some anachronisms, like an African monk in 9th-century Ireland? It must be said that the blending of Catholic mysticism with Celtic paganism never really goes together in this film. And the comic relief is sometimes too broad. That's why I can not give them the highest rank. However, these are minor issues with an otherwise sexy and imaginative movie.
