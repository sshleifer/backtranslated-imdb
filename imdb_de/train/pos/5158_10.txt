There is something appealing and strangely believable about this episode. From the beginning, the knowledge that a particular planet will explode within a few hours creates an atmosphere of tension. Kirk, Spock and McCoy have beamed to evacuate the residents, all of whom have apparently already been abandoned, except for one senior librarian who sank a crisis in which all three members of the Enterprise crew unexpectedly entered different epochs of the planet's past toss. Kirk is in an era reminiscent of seventeenth-century England, while Spock and McCoy are stranded in a desolate, frozen garbage. <br /> <br /> The incidents between the two stories and the various dangerous situations in which the men are located are handled excellently. The return to the present is an unknown coincidence while the minutes count to the planet's explosion. <br /> <br /> Imaginative writing and good acting characterize this episode. Mariette Hartley banished to the Ice Age as a touching woman and Ian Wolfe is the urban librarian. Reminiscent of the classic City On The Edge of Forever episode, this time travel story is a rich and compelling finale to the series, completed one episode later. This is one of the best of the entire series, especially notable given the generally lower overall quality of the third season.
