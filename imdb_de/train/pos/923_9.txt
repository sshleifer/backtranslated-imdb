I never saw it on TV, but borrowed the DVD through Netflix as soon as I found out it was available. I had high expectations and was not disappointed. It's funny and the animation is excellent. I would have expected this quality only from feature films, so I'm surprised by the bad comments. Maybe the DVD release has improved the animation? A bonus of the DVD is that it was fun to see both versions of the pilot. I am a grown-up and I really appreciate that it is for adults. Not only children like cute animated characters. It's not nearly "slippery", as some have claimed, but I can see where some parents do not want to see their little kids. I am very disappointed that it was canceled. I wish they would produce more episodes. Or maybe a movie.
