In his first attempt as a Hollywood director, Henry Brommell whips up a gripping yarn that depended on pervasive, related marital problems with melancholy authenticity and beats with an equally compelling subplot of a father-son hit-man company. The film is shrewd and consists of a beautifully composed cast and a brisk, family-friendly screenplay (also by Brommell) that brings life to an otherwise tired genre. As a bonus, "Panic" offers subtle, tart humor - an unexpected, undeniably charming and very welcome surprise - through its awkward, insecure, restrained star whose especially cool state is especially enticing. The ever-great William H. Macy recaptures our hearts once again Alex, an unfortunate, torn-up husband and middle-aged father who finds solace in the most dubious of people: a young, attractive, 23-year-old woman named Sarah (Neve Campbell), whom he meets in the waiting room of a psychologist's office where he lives to the therapy of Dr. med. Josh Parks is discussing his growing willingness to withdraw from the family business founded by his father (Donald Sutherland). Alex, whose desire to lead a new life is hampered by the fear of disappointing his dictating father, is unwise to Sarah, which ultimately causes him to be the nature and irrefutable responsibility of his wife's husband and, more importantly he understood, a good father of his six-year-old son Sammy (enthusiastically played by the lovely David Dorfman). Henry Brommell's ingenious "Panic" is a rarity rarely seen in Hollywood (with the 2002 exception "Road to Perdition" (2002), which emerged since its conception in 2000, interweaves two conflicting genres (organized crime, family drama) a fascinating, warm piece of film watching that is equally strong in both directions. It is one that will retain its extraordinary, rare caliber and brilliant sincerity for the years to come.
