I thought racism and prejudice against Carl Brashear were over-dramatized for the Hollywood effect. I do not think the US Navy was ever so openly racist. I can not imagine that a full captain, the commanding officer, has ever ordered his boss to intentionally meet someone. Certainly not at the risk of his life. And there has never been a chief petty officer who serves as an unconfessed prejudice to all except WASP as DeNiro's character. No chief, as sloppy and drunk as he was played, would have come to Master Chief in the first place. Cuba Gooding has saved an otherwise badly made movie.
