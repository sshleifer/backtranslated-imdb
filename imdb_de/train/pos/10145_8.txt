This is a really old fashion-glamorous movie. The venues are great and the situation is one of those Preston films of old. If you want to see a movie that does not require much more than sit back and relax, that's it. Acting is good and I really liked Michael Rispoli. He was also in Rounders. And while you were sleeping. The rest of the cast is fun. It's exactly what happens when two people who are about to marry meet those who really love them over the weekend when planning their own weddings. I know ... sounds crazy ... but it is. And that makes it fun to see. It will make your friend hug you or leave you, but at least you'll know.
