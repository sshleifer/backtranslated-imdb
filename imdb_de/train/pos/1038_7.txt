Loved the movie. I even liked most of the actors in it. But for me, the very bad accent attempt of Mrs. Davis and her stiff acting is really hard to see an otherwise captivating movie. Seriously, if any other modern actor played the same role with the same style as Ms. Davis, they would be laughed at by the screen. <br /> <br /> I really think she called this one. If Myrna Loy or Ingrid Bergman played the role of the woman, I would have enjoyed it much more. <br /> <br /> I think I just do not understand Bette Davis. I've always thought of her as an actor who "plays herself" no matter what role she plays. The possible exception is Now Voyager. <br /> <br /> I am sure that many of the other reviewers will explain this in detail (and I hope politely) in detail how I am completely mistaken. But I keep watching the movies she's in because I like the stories / writing / supporting casts, but I'll always remember that, to different actresses who could have done a better job.
