If you can see this movie, you will see it. It's quite shocking at times and really makes you think about so many important questions, but it's not didactic. In my opinion, it's a work of art ... beautifully filmed, fine music of many styles, the typically impressive stage of drama expected of the BBC drama. Nathalie Press (charged as 'Natalie' press) convinces in her role as a depressed teenager exploited by a male classmate. Celia Imrie has that wonderfully soothing quality that gives the sometimes disturbing action stability and gives the viewer the certainty that someone out there is actually "normal". The real star, however, is always Timothy Spall - certainly one of the greatest actors of our time!
