This show will be successful because it appeals to all adults no matter where they are in their relationship. As a man who has been married for 26 years, I have a feeling for Patrick Warburton's character: he loves his wife, but he assumes that she knows that. I also enjoy his monotonous delivery; never gets too excited or too low. A nice ensemble of characters. This will be a good addition to the Monday night series. <br /> <br /> I do not know how David Spade will play in his role. It is best enjoyed in small doses. He also seems to be a bit old, still trolling for women. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed the pilot and look forward to seeing how the series evolves.
