Such a wonderful movie! Very heartwarming. One can not help but fall in love with the character of Gigi. He is adorable as a child and develops into a sensitive artist. The whole movie revolves around him. He lives in a wonderful world? Do all life live? Curiosity, desire and anticipation. There is an older brother who tries to steal his glory, but really stays in the shade all his life. The father is very stereotypical Italian and the mother too. I wanted the father to be reunited with the mother in the last scene? and they cry and laugh. I also wish that there was at least something redeeming about the older brother. His personality seems to be completely devastated. Passion and enthusiasm? That's the key to life. And look through the camera? focus on small details and enjoy the fine details of life.
