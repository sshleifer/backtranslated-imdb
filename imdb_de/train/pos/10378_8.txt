This movie is about an hour of good conversation and has some really funny moments. I loved the character of Matt and also Tiny. They seemed to be the most engaging and funniest characters and certainly the most interesting. Matt is very good (as well as his bad cousin), and the policewoman and the blonde biker make a welcome eye candy. I have to say, I've seen striking similarities between Matt and another Australian actor, Eric Bana. My personal favorite part was the brothel scene. Overall, I liked the movie and it will get about 8 points. The punishment, however, I was disappointed. It was a side foot curl instead of hitting the corresponding laces. <br /> <br /> I'm joking, of course. :)
