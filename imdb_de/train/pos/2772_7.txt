I've always believed that David and Bathsheba were a movie originally intended for Tyrone Power at 20th Century Fox, though Gregory Peck describes himself as King David, the Monarch with a wandering eye. <br /> <br /> This film covers many biblical themes, adultery, salvation, sin, punishment, and generally what God expects from His followers. <br /> <br /> If you are a king, the king is even biblically prophesying Kingdom You certainly have a lot of perogatives that are not open to the rest of us. King David has many wives, including a truly vicious woman in Jayne Meadows, the daughter of Saul's father, David's predecessor. But one day he sees Bathsheba in her garden. It turned out that she is as unhappily married to Uriah the Hittite as David is to some women. Uriah is one of the captains of David's army. David sends for Bathsheba and he is the king. She runs away because she keeps an eye on him. What happens, an affair, a pregnancy and a carefully arranged death for Uriah in a battle. But an all-seeing and knowing deity has captured all this and punishes not only David and Bathsheba, but the entire kingdom of Israel is being punished with drought, disease and plague. The Sexist Law of The Day challenges Bathsheba to a stony death. David shows weakness in his previous actions, but here he steps on the plate and asks him to lay the whole thing on him. He even puts his hand on the Ark of the Covenant, which was an instant death, as seen in the movie. <br /> <br /> My interpretation of this is that God admires courage, even if you're wrong and he gives up on David and forgives them both. Bathsheba becomes the mother of Solomon and she and David are the ancestors of several successors in the divided kingdoms of Israel and Judah, until both are conquered. Susan Hayward is an abandoned Bathsheba trapped in a loveless marriage with Uriah played by Kieron Moore. The only thing that excites Moore is a good fight. I liked the performance of Kieron Moore as a brave and stupid horse. <br /> <br /> Nobody can lay the law down like Raymond Massey. His Nathan, the Prophet, agrees with the John Brown character, whom he played with equal intensity in two films. <br /> <br /> If his own law called for death, why did God spare Bathsheba and keep David on the throne? Maybe it was the fact that he did not want to train a third man for the job. He had already replaced Saul with David. <br /> <br /> But I think the Christian interpretation could be that this was an indication of the upcoming New Testament, that one could sin and feel mercy if asked to do so. I leave it up to biblical scholars to present interpretations. <br /> <br /> Take a look at the movie and you might develop a whole new theory.
