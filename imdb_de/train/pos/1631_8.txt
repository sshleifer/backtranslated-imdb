This movie has everything. See gags, subtle jokes, play with words and verses. It is a group of boys from different ethnic and social backgrounds who come together to defeat a common enemy. If you look at it more than once, you'll find that you're quoting Animal House (and yes, I love Animal House too). I have been in the top 15 most fun movies. The major at a Boys' Military Academy is paranoid that every kid is bad and wants to make trouble (in this movie he's right). He is sadistic, callous, cruel and must be defeated. The group of boys who do not get along at first work together in the end, letting go of the major with a crazy plan that only Mad Magazine could write. A must - you will love it!
