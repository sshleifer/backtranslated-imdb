It's interesting how much more realistic Brosnan is compared to the Bond films. He is neurotic, paranoid, an alcoholic and a womanizer. This is a perfect break for him, even to laugh at the Bond symbol. "I'm a mess, a parody of me," he says. It is not better. I just read Dr. No and that's how Ian Fleming portrayed James Bond. Personally, I never liked Brosnan as a Bond because he was too close to the symbol. Compared to Roger Moore or Sean Connery he could not personalize the character. It's great to see how Brosnan is carried off the wall in a realistic and extravagant way. A shallow character who tries to understand deeper emotional and psychological issues for which he has no background. It's an impressive performance, and when it's founded by Greg Kinear, it's just poetic. This movie reminds me a little of the dynamics established between the main characters in "My Blue Heaven," but is more real in their coping mechanisms.
