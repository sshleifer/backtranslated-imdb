Australia's first mainstream Slasher movie appears with a bang on the screen. And a stitch. And a disc. And a scream or two. And lots of blood, horror, red herrings and lots of laughter. <br /> <br /> In fact, there's a lot of cut - it's Dave Warner's first script to be produced, though he has several options or is under negotiation; It's the first big movie by director and former hoodoo guru Kimble Rendall. And it's also the first movie for producer Martin Fabinyi. And for a group of guys who dip their toes into this genre for the first time, they know their stuff. <br /> <br /> Cut tells the story of a group of Australian film students who heard of a Slasher movie Hot Blooded, that was never over because his director Hilary (Kylie Minogue) was the actor who starred in the movie played, was killed. Despite her doctor (who died at night as an assistant director, Hilary died) they warn that if someone tries again to produce Hot Blooded, someone dies, director Raffy (Jessica Napier) and producer Hester (Sarah Kants) decide to film complete. They team up a crew and manage to get the original star, Vanessa Turnbill (Molly Ringwood), to return to Australia - actually to the original location - to complete Hot Blooded. Shut down 14 years after the shoot. Of course this is a Slasher movie, a lot of bloodshed follows ?? long with a lot of laughter, a few good frights and a rocky Aussie soundtrack. Cut shows that Australia can produce a good mass-market horror movie as well as Hollywood. <br /> <br /> It's a finely honed feature with superb special effects, a tight action and a killer - Scarman - that's a welcome addition to Michael, Jason and Freddy.
