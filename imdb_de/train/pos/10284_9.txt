"The United States of Kiss My Ass" <br /> <br /> House of Games is the directorial debut of playwright David Mamet and is an effective and at times surprising psychological thriller. It shows Lindsay Crouse as best-selling psychiatrist Margaret Ford, who decides to confront the player who has made one of her patients think about suicide. In this way she leaves behind the safety and comfort of her ordinary life and travels to the city center to visit the lowlife area House of Games. <br /> <br /> The player Mike (played by Joe Mantegna) turns out to be a bit sharp and dismissive. He offers Crouse's character a deal. If she's willing to sit with him at a game, a big gambling game in the back room, he'll cancel the debts of the patients. The card game follows, and soon the psychiatrist and the player see each other in a familiar job (gaining the trust of others) and a fascinating relationship begins. What makes House of Games interesting and indispensable to all movie fans is the constant guessing of who's in control, whether it's the psychiatrist or the cheater, or is it the well-known man of the great bluffs of David Mamet. <Br /> <br /> In House of Games, the direction is boring and mostly flat and uninspired. In any film by David Mamet, however, the story, which is central to the whole process, is not the direction. In the House of Games this seems partly due to the excellent performances of the two main characters (conspicuous and distracting), but mostly, as with many of Mamet's works, it is the dialogue that grabs you and slowly draws you into the movie. No one in the House of Games says what they mean, and conversations turn into battlefields and wordplay. All bluff and double bluffs, reminiscent of a natural order of poker games. This is an ongoing theme throughout the movie and is used effectively at the right moments to create tremendous tensions. House of Games can also be considered a "class war" division movie. With Lindsay Crouse, we have the middle-class psychiatrist of the middle class, and Joe Mantegna is the complete opposite. America's working class earns its living by an "honest" crime. <br /> <br /> The film seduces The viewer, like Crouse, is seduced by Mantegna, and the end result is ultimately a very satisfying piece of American cinema. And the finale of the movie is definitely something for everyone to see and see, it's awesome. <br /> <br /> An extremely enjoyable movie experience worth repeating. 9.10
