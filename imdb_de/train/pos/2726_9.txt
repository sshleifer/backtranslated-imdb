This movie is there with the classics of all time. The music, the camera shots and the drama are excellent. The presentation of the film in black and white gave him a much better appearance and complemented the music perfectly, just like psycho. It's surprising how few people commented on this movie. I suspect it's a hard-to-find movie. I gave the movie a 9. Watch the movie and you know what I'm talking about.
