This movie is a must for all people who love football as art. The first thing that strikes this movie about a football World Cup is the way it is filmed. In addition to the game like a TV show, there is rich material that follows the individual players. This brings out the emotions and situations that these men experience as they try to achieve fame. Today's TV transmission style, which is different from that of 1986, is still inferior in quality compared to this film. <br /> <br /> The players are not the only stars. The audience, the referees, the journalists for the games and the environment itself play a central role in the development of today's history. In this movie you can see how all these factors interact explicitly. In this respect, today's television broadcasting style has not yet reached this level of quality, although it is now much closer than before. There are several prominent players: Maradona (Argentina), Elkjaer and Laudrup (Denmark)), Francescoli (Uruguay), Platini (France), Lineker (England), Rummenigge (Germany), Butrague (Spain), Socrates (Brazil) and Sanchez (Mexico). <br /> <br /> This film is not a collection of the best football moves in Mexico in 1986, although most of them are well covered. Throughout the film, it is very stressful to present various aspects of the game and the competition itself, based on the progress of these players and teams, even at the cost of skipping relevant games of the games. This makes the movie so interesting and unique. <br /> <br /> Due to the events that took place in Mexico in 1986 by the referees, many comments on this film and the World Cup are extremely prejudiced. Many of these comments do not take account of the fact that there is one referee and two linesmen, that they are as human as the players, and that all the above mistakes are one way or the other. The football rules do not allow umpires to use television-based replays to make decisions. Therefore, the referees usually have to decide what they perceive. As a result, referees play an active role in the development of a game. Their influence can be seen in several parts of this film. <br /> <br /> The sequel to the 1990 World Cup is just a source of bitter disappointment compared to this film. Much comes from the fact that it was too much involved in the game, while this film tells things from a more distant, unbiased perspective.
