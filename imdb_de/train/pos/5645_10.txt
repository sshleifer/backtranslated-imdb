I bought the DVD set on the recommendation of Amazon.com because of my other interests. With this they hit the nail on the head. I remember watching the show on TV, but I've always wondered what happened to it. Ten years later, it's like seeing everything for the first time again. Lucas Black as Caleb Temple and Gary Cole as Sheriff Lucas Buck are great, even if they are a certain rival. Almost Good (Caleb) and Evil (Sherriff Lucas Buck). I've never really understood exactly what Lucas should be, but suffice to say he has some special powers that I do not think were granted by anything sacred. He can make phones ring, letters appear, or even change a person's emotions. Nevertheless, there are some episodes in which, despite everything, he is actually the good guy. All in all, this is an excellent series that, like so many others I can think of (Pl Pleasant, Threshold, Nowhere Man and SeaQuest DSV, to name but a few) have been canceled long before their time. Steven King's The Dead Zone (Sunday USA Network) seems to be the only one in the genre that seems to make it. There is simply nothing more to see on TV. This is because everything that has to do with Christianity and Satan is considered insulting and must be pulled out of television immediately. In the meantime, I just keep buying DVD equipment and watching shows that are still on TV but booted by religious zealots, so we have "quality" shows like Family Guy, American Dad, and The Simpsons (which is a bunch of crap, he is).
