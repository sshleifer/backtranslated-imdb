This movie is not as bad as I've heard. It was enjoyable, funny and I love that it's Christmas time. It's totally in my mood to go shopping at Christmas and listen to holiday music. When this movie is released on DVD, it will take the place of the Christmas holidays in my collection. After Thanksgiving, there will be a movie every year to get me in the mood for the best time of the year. I heard that Ben's character was a bit crazy, but I think that's just part of the movie and why it's so serious all the time. Take it for what it is, a Christmas comedy with a love story. I enjoyed it. No, it is not Titanic and will not make your heart beat with anticipation, but it will bring a laugh or two. So laugh and have fun :)
