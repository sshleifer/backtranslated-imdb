Not sure why it does not seem to play in Peoria, but this is a very funny, clever British comedy. It is located at the end of the Swinging Sixties. Peter Sellars is as fantastic as the rich womanizer of forty years. The perfectly delicious Goldie Hawn, who plays a 19-year-old American in London, is initially Sellar's "Catch of the Day". But the urban TV food critic can not help but fall in love with the dizzying American. > It's a great movie and the best gag is the last line. <br /> <br /> Try it, you will like it.
