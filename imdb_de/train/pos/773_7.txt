I expected something different: more passion, drama ... Yet another failed attempt at originality. I am sorry to say that the film gets into the old clich√© of "cheese dairy" Not very convincing and the lines are common, it lacks any joke. Nevertheless, the soundtrack was well and well adapted. I can not say that this movie is a total flop because people see it, but it does not meet the expectations of the public. It's sunken in mediocrity. At the end, the production keeps you watching TV for almost an hour and a half, which is a remarkable thing. Therefore, it is probably worth a visit if you are not annoyed
