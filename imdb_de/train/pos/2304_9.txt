I found this movie very well done. In the middle of the fifties everything was right for me. It was well staffed and believable. Usually I do not really care about this kind of movie because they just are not profound, but I felt that this movie focused on the characters and you felt how they felt, you really needed to know them and take care of them , It brought me back to my youth, reminding me of an innocent time. This movie can be enjoyed by both men and women and of all ages. After the movie was over, I wished there would be a second part. I wanted to know what happened to Dani and her family. This movie is a classic. If you have not seen it, try to catch it on TV or borrow it ...
