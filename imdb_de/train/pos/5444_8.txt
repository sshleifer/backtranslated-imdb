Class Reunion is a very underrated comedy. It is 1982 and the class of Lizzie Borden from 1972. High return for the 10 year reunion, including the usual stereotypes, the guy, the baby, the fat guy and the nerd etc, but the former students have a bumpy Night, one of her classmates is Walter Baloer, the class kid to whom the rest of the class had comedy-hit on the closing night and has since been in a madhouse. Walter escapes and now plans to avenge his humiliation. > <br /> Despite the dark premise, this is really just an excuse for many very funny gags and set pieces. Too much more to say would spoil the movie, but if you like the Naked Gun & Airplane movies, will you love that, and what other movie features a Chuck Berry music cameo? A great comedy that deserves a wider audience.
