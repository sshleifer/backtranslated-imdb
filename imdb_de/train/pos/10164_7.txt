This is a great movie. <br /> <br /> I agreed to watch a chicken movie and tell you how it happened. I had never heard of it or anyone (apart from Mike from Friends). <br /> <br /> But it's great! Eva, Lake and Paul are doing amazing things. The humor is always dry and funny. <br /> <br /> Paul Rudd plays pretty much the microphone figure of Friends (which works great). The other characters are stereotypes and the plot is worded (I mean, we're not talking about 'Apocalypse Now'). But the characters are sympathetic, the story is captivating, the soundtrack, the production and the direction work well. <br /> <br In a great feel-good movie that really deserves more credit than it gets. <br /> <br /> Everyone has their own taste, but I really do not understand the 1 star rating for that.
