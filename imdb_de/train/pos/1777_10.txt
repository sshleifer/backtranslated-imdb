When I saw the Romeo Division for the first time last spring, my first reaction was BRILLIANT! On future visits, however, I was offered more than just masterful filming. This image has a unique voice that will be reflected throughout the history of film history. <br /> <br /> The inaugural assembly offers a great palette for Helmer JP Sarro to establish his art on this entertainment screen. <br /> <br /> Sarro really uses the camera as a brush, as he takes us on a ride that wraps the audience into a massive action movie that goes beyond the traditional format we've become accustomed to and dives deep in dark themes of betrayal and revenge and the importance of camaraderie. This movie is the dream of every director. <br /> <br /> However, Sarro was not alone in this epic business. The writing the scribe Tim Sheridan had provided was just as breathtaking. <br /> <br /> The dialogue was so precise and direct that it gives the actors such presence and charisma on the screen. More specifically, the final scene (WARNING: SPOILERS !!! SPOILERS !!!), in which Vanessa shows herself as one of the coalitions and as a villain, is written in such a dark tone that she is one of the most frightful endings that I have ever seen. Sheridan is the next Robert Towne. <br /> <br /> In a final note it is obvious that this production was no small matter. <br /> <br /> That's why producer Scott Shipley has to receive a lot of praise, who seems to have the creativity and genius in addition to Jerry Bruckheimer. I've never seen such a grandiose production with so much attention to every detail. A producer's job is one of the hardest in any movie, and Shipley makes it easy. <br /> <br /> All in all, this film combines creative writing, stunning production and masterful direction. This is the art of the film at its best. When the end of the movie arrives, the only thing you want is more. <br /> <br /> The Romeo Division is groundbreaking, a masterpiece and above all the Romeo Division is art.
