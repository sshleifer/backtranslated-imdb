I see the film writing this. . . If the following comments "prove that I do not have any development as reality, filmmaker", so be it. . . <br /> <br /> But. . . I thought (I still think I'm watching) this movie. . . to put them calmly, they are the most commonly used. Again, too much. <br /> <br /> It looks like a real film that a person possesses without limit. . . and who did not give much attention to details. <br /> <br /> I do not want to go forward and talk about the different ways I find that the movie is missing, but. . . well. . . I do not understand (remembrance, admit that maybe ME is a fantasy here - not a movie maker - because of not finding "a permanent piece"). . . I borrowed this noise because it was very appealing. . .sheesh. <br /> <br /> Sheesh. . .
