I can not believe I'm very angry after reading this and writing to my first IMDb. Disney article is nothing but the Rehashed Planet Earth. Now I know I'm going to announce it "from the people who brought you the Planet Earth," but I did not know he would use the same designs as a few handwriting notes. I just got $ 8.75 to see something I got on DVD. Shame on Disney's warning nobody here (except James Earl Jones mau-over and 90 seconds of fish that I do not believe was in the Planet Earth) <br /> <br /> But the greatest judgment of all is that when Earth's Earth uses polar breast cancer history as evidence of killing this planet as a catalyst for environmental change, Disney took the matter and made it a family party. After a father's bear, he shows his big children one year, shoots some of his destructive memories, and places the world's most beautiful. There is no mention of older children getting closer to death because of the same hardships for their patient fathers, no warning of problems for future generations if we do not agree, no. The only damage we've ever seen in the entire movie (and often, if you're one of the billions of Planet Earths) I have never left the embarrassment and humiliation in my life.
