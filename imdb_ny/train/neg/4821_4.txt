The fiction film (based on the article even though it has "sophisticated" and "debt") scientists in northern Canada to try to get Bigfoot (one download and download device). Most of his eyes in science museum jumbo are included in the unhealthy film of a group of people wandering in the desert, and there are attempts to be damaged by terrors, but being perfectly honest there is nothing worth seeing outside of the wild material, this is a good definition of the use of the film, which promises you so much, looking at Bigfoot, but really it gives a little bit and is advised only for insomniacs
