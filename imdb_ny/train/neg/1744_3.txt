I watched the "Boeing Boeing" Malayalam film created in 1985 (which must have been inspired by an English movie called the same name) in the background. The main issue of garam masala is the same - but it was said in a horrible way, the jokes that are based on the content of the Hindi movie (maybe the director did according to the taste of the Indian audience) ... <br /> <br /> I did not see the English version. But he was very pleased with the Malayalam film (made by Priyadarshan owner) which was part of the comedy, then. In fact, the activities of Mohanlal, Mukesh and Sukumari (cooking work) were both natural and well-known. <br /> <br /> Of course, I have been caught in a Malayalam movie that I would not even tolerate the minor weaknesses of India. But I still think Akshay Kumar and John Abraham have won. Paresh Rawal has done a good job - but is not getting anywhere near the Workshop <br /> <br /> But all of this is fine, if someone is likening it to some of the new movies in India.
