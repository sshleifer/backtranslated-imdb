The dangers of women threaten the burial of her alive. A teenage boy wants to be killed and choose to use a phobia by sticking to a box and leaving him in the basement. However, B-horror filmmaker Brinke Stevens is changing only the fact that this is why many people do not have to deal with Michael Berryman in the smallest sexual activity with Delia Sheppard. And the last two minutes of Brinke's blood transfusions are fun so much. A heady head is very dangerous. Watching the "Scalps" or "Alien Dead" cups again. I do not hope I'm looking forward to special entertainment from Fred Olen Ray, but "Risk" is easy to enjoy.
