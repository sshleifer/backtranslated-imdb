Anyone who wrote "Redline" as a major car film must be paid by Daniel Sadek to encourage a burning eagle, an eagle shot. There is no doubt a movie of bad cars or any movie that has been made. This makes Showgirl look like the Citizen Kane. <br /> <br /> Take a list of the 80s, take a look at the scary results and alphabet and you have the evidence that Daniel Sadek should not only write movies and movies but should be in business. <br /> <br /> This is a deformed movie with such a plot and the most damaging effects. What frustrates me is not that the film makers are magic but they see that the film is being made difficult to fall as a result of this.
