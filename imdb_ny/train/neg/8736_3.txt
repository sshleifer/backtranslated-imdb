The films had a good idea, but there would be no murder. <br /> <br /> What is this idea? Well, story story, with "Dirty Harry" is facing "M". A murderer son has begun to threaten the city. Leaders (Dennis Hopper and Frederic Forest) have never been involved with ordinary murderers. Leader and Police Commander, in desperation, secretly utilizing a group of people to speed up things ... to go to a place and do things that the police could not eliminate conflicts immediately. . <br /> <br /> Being fair, the movie has some good things that can give. <br /> <br /> In addition to the idea, I often look at the killer's secret. Norman Bates is under his control. The boy has a good store. In some form, light flies on the water and causes damage to the walls; Oftentimes this makes these pictures fun and challenging. <br /> <br /> The actions were good. Dennis Hopper is one of the players who grow up well with aging. <br /> <br /> When you pass through, yet more-or-less goes down. <br /> <br /> The film is moving the fastest way. A real search from these two groups is more expulsive than it can be hard and fun. This can be set up in two ways: either make the film longer or cut off some of the extra features. Some of these would allow employees to spend more time in the real secret. <br /> <br /> To find out what a bad example, one of the most important things that helps them to have the right attitude: At one point in his life, a skeptics went to a pet store ... That's right ... very difficult here. It's like they went to A (first identification) to tell Z (doubting) and jumped on all the "inside". <br /> <br /> Then there are letters. The only thing I liked was two bags that you encounter about half the film. Given that they are few, I'm calling for a bad sign. <br /> <br /> Finally, there are tiny groups. This is what it gives me because that's why I raised $ 3 to buy a DVD first. I mean, what dung! There has been a lot of murderer killer 10-15 years ago. The decision was an eagle that would have been a helper to be above all others, but it did not. <br /> <br /> I thought that social processes would be painful, but fun and fun at one time; such as a movie film or something ... maybe they can even throw into some modern movie shows. We're talking about criminals, after all. In fact, we have been assigned to some critics who perform surgery. Police policemen. What is the group doing? They ask questions and kill them. They are not like the witnesses are really bad even though. I felt that the wrongdoers were more loved than the killer who was hunting for them. <br /> <br /> Unless I've mentioned enough to get your interest, I would say you give it again. Maybe someday, they will use the same story and do this. I hope so. I hate to see such a good idea.
