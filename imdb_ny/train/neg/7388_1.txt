drss1942 took the word out of my mouth. I liked the first films of Segal and felt like she was still the one loyal to her. I just saw the film (yes, I was about 90% across, so I did not see the end). When I woke up and seen I was on the DVD list, I was thankful I did not conquer myself for that movie and did not want to know what happened at the end. There was something strange about Segal's voice and others. Kinda reminded me about Mad Max who had been standing up, but in the same language (Australlian and English, right?) Even so, if I had a body of ten smaller, all of them would say about Segal justice.
