Looking back on the film I just go through with my experience as a Military soldier who attended my studies in July, August, and September 1971 in the field of Fort Polk, Louisiana. Take Up High was not the same as what I remember for higher education. <br /> <br /> But one should remember when it was written to Korea that ended up, but it was a strange war as we knew. It was not Vietnam, a war in the forest that we continued to pour into pieces in the pocket. The policy was at that time unhappy, but it was still permitted to achieve the protection of the country. <br /> <br /> Richard Widmark and a Korean soldier have now given part of the country to train soldiers to go out. The film is one of his lessons with the men of the platoon who need to teach. These are the routes you can find near every war film since the last decade. <br /> <br /> One thing I will praise Take the winning idea because the GMM knew that our troops were now joining the presence of William Hazard as a black platoon writer. It was consistent with the spirit of the time that had changed. <br /> <br /> But I say that a worker like Russ Tamblyn would have been cured from his mouth since one day. Richard Widmark could not risk death or be a witness to give Jerome Courtland confidence and weapon. And there was no way to worry about Robert Arthur's loss. He just left the police to work with him. <br /> <br /> By shot and around Fort Bliss and El Paso, Texas has given the highest price to be true. But see if the movie is open to the soldiers and you can understand why the government has made a great deal of cooperation that same day. <br /> <br /> I remember the policemen who have their disputes that you may begin without worrying about them to reach your case for something that was 95% of the time. But there is no way Karl Malden would appeal to Widmark outside during the training before several witnesses amongst the employers. Both would realize that it would be weakening the rule, something that the soldiers would not allow to happen. <br /> <br /> I wish I would say good about Take The High Ground because I like to win it, Richard Brooks, the head of a specialist, and the head of Dimitri Tiomkin and Ned Washington, from Oscar in the first year of High Noon . The film was selected for the Oscar for Best Screenplay and the story of Millard Kaufman. It must have been the thinking of Kaufman.
