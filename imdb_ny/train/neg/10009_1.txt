This film is one of the biggest assets. Paul Schrader has suddenly lost his bad appearance. And his explanation seems to be as flexible as it may be without being sleepy at this time. Even worse is Woody Harrelson, the one I love most when he's being dropped well. "Traveler" games, an adulterous man at D.C. who is playing with friends of Washington elite fighters. He could not be one side if he was cut off from the magazine and was beaten in front of the camera on a popsicle stick. "Her words in the south" are "from the design" that range from the beginning to the end of each line, such as heat and humidity in the south eliminates all the energy she possesses. It's unpleasant. But, that's not what's the most difficult in the movie. His "boyfriend," sportsman and Moritz Bleibtreau, is trying to stumble some of the Mid East villages that are too difficult to explain. She can not even shake her even though in real life she is German, and she speaks a number of languages ​​- one of them in Italian! Is that a good reason to throw someone into thinking? <br /> <br /> From this article, to the art, design, video cameras, showcase and leadership, this movie is bad from beginning to end. The only time in this film was featured in three movie films: Lily Tomlin, Lauren Bacall, and Kristin Scott Thomas. Only three of them managed through the movie with their respect carefully. In fact, all three are good, no matter how close they are to the movie. Fortunately, no one can be perfect enough to redeem these countless complications. If you like these three movies, look at other things. Movies are not worth your time.
