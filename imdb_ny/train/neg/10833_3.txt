I wanted to love Magnolia. The plot reminded me of the Grand Canyon (my favorite). 4 lives / stories that meet together at the end but Magnolia quickly turned into the middle of the movie and lost it. I was about to get rid of there but I think I had to stay there until the end, I did not know it would be more than 1/2 hours. Thank you god I borrowed instead of seeing the game. I was about to cry out two hours later. The huge closure of the trousers was a frog showcase. My DVD maker would not forgive me and do not blame me. It was a special movie, but a bad, fun movie is worthless.
