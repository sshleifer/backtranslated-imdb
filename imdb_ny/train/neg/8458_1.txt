I bought this film this week last week in my Movie Gallery. It was buying 2 to take 2 free and I missed one so I chose this. It's a terrible mistake. The box is reading as it would be a great movie. Well, it starts as though it would be a big movie. For about five minutes, that's it. The film is near a girl, Laila, who is killed to try her best, Jack, from the herd. Laila's father, Cordobes, is the worst people in the community are afraid of. He guess Jack killed Laila because he thought he was afraid of this cow, and he was going to look for him. This was the first 5 minutes that was good. The following after this is just adding three times. Anyone who wrote a script, in my opinion, had to have some kind of acid travel or something because there was nothing else that made it clear. Jack runs and gets DJ's traveling radio named Mary. I think Mary is supposed to be a virgin Mary to behave. You know, Jesus' mother. But, who knows, I can not make his own headings or dimensions. As they run ... we come to see bad people, visions of magic, occultism, shooting, etc. And all these things happen in the way your brain hurts in trying to see what's going on. No doubt to say, I took the movie and returned it to something. It's dangerous to tell you, dangers. And, there is absolutely no war on the male in the movie. Except you read the first minute of the movie. I hope I helped some people not to spend their time on the video.
