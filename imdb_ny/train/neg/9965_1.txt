Warning! QUESTIONS FOR HELP! <br /> <br /> I can not find anything good to say about this movie. It's so bad that any quality is caricature, but it seems to be self-centered. They are well thrown, especially Ralph Macchio (all-face-to-face, 5-foot-nothing). All kinds of motives are covered by black and white, and all the events are just as fast as possible. <br /> <br /> The most exciting (KEY MEMORIAL REMINDERS) are the futile and worthless events in the film's very short history. Someone might think of the filmmakers, "We need JoBeth to eat it up ... hmmm ... I have! ... at the beginning of the film, let's give Nick some nude stories about self-defense. JoBeth can use that line individually and then I'm putting myself on the road ... yes, it's a ticket! <br /> <br /> I will give manufacturers a developmental support for a great study in 1984, one of which has become a very rich in the late 1990s and events such as the Columbine. The film must have been a comedy of darkness in the "Heathers" cloud, a political system such as "Network" or a bigger experiment such as "Brubaker", but he tries to become all of these - and he can not be one of these.
