I've tried this video 1 because the plot is easy to believe. Judge yourself. Warning, the following will not only offer the plot, but will interfere with your movie appetite. <br /> <br /> The compact virus, which is composed of a stimulating rib, sends a system through TV shows and computers. When the code - in the form of light - penetrates it can find the 'electric' of your body. The reaction is to force the body cells into calcium tract. Just a few minutes from the pain of the patient, he begins to see the vision, and his skin will be white and calcium, and then he will fall and his arm will be broken into chalk. <br /> <br /> The pathogens are very smart. When you find that a modern computer technician is trying to disrupt the code with a braille device - hand-operated - the device is put to the top, which causes great wounds on a masterpiece's head. The problem is also heard of violence against remote travel and ATM machines. Fortunately it can be stopped by losing a desktop pcd on the road and using the electrocuting nerd and its back on broken computer and its feet in some lost water. <br /> <br /> O dear ...
