Even after you've passed the idea that such people would see any important moment in the 1960s (ok, so Katie did not join them in Manson Family, and no one died in Altamont), this movie was not very fun. I have the idea that "authors" closed themselves in the room and looked for "Forrest Gump," "The Wonder Years," and Oliver Stone movies (60s) over and over again. Canadian film critic called the end of the first time "heading". He was right.
