I did not know the film was before I saw it because Tashan alone had teaser game when it was promoted. So I asked my friends if they knew anything and said "It's the first of Vijay Krishna Acharya who wrote Dhoom 1 & 2 paintings and the son of Saif Ali Khan Ibrahim to make a film as a little as a kid in his flashback." <br /> <br /> Looking at, I understood why they were not a suitable trailer because there was nothing in the movie, but it was a difficult task and even a 10-year-old boy could come up with a good line, no matter what the camera was shaking on each side and it was difficult to figure out. killing one Another thing was daft & real impossible eg a man with a handgun killed about 100 people with a gun. <br /> <br /> When I was looking at Tashan reminded me of 3 movies: <br /> <br /> Sin City: During Koyla's Opening: Anil Kapoor's English Angleter as Amrish Puri in Coyla <br /> <br /> Jhoom Barabar Jhoom: The Amazing Jewelry s that's fun. I've heard the budget with 40 crores that are similar to Dhoom 2 and I do not know where all the money is gone. Maybe you do not like Dhoom 2, there is no chance you want Tashan. The competition was steamed in iron and has a million times. <br /> <br /> Only two songs with Dil Haara & Challiya and both songs shoot in Greece at a good location but how is the porn movie used? Even the worst English language of Anil Kapoor could not save this confusion.
