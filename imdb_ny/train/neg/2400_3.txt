No, this was not one of the ten bad films in the 1980's, but certainly wearing 100 fish under somewhere. The film seems to be put on a shelf for two or three years and released in 1981. How can you explain something special before reaching "An American Werewolf in London"? The 40th president of the United States? While we're on it, let's not ignore the 1970s in the 1950's and the 60's. I've seen more here than "Fun" & "Laverne & Shirley" together. <br /> <br /> One woman who is raising the film in the "bad, good" section, great Elizabeth Hartman, is just a bit. Biff admits that Miss Montgomery, a primary schoolteacher who is engaged in sexual immorality, has been committed to death and is disgusted with Hollywood today, but even though "hot chickens" keep her morals. Her call for help is evidence of this. They also look like Miss Wimp. "Seven in a decorative place, shooting in hell." He did not murmur. <br /> <br /> This does not mean that there are no good points somewhere else, they are few and few, and I'm not saying this because I love Hartman. Obviously, "Wolf Wolf" was far better than this. "Wolf Wolf" was better than this, and it was not very good <br /> <br />
