With this showcase it comes to Nickelodeon and Nick Jr. and to ilk, my son was selling us to see. Between the DVD and theater, I have seen some of the incredible features of the Incredibles, Shrek as well as the Wall (E, Brother Bear). But this was the easiest film I've ever seen, kids or children without. Was it "when this fool would end?" events? Well, its purpose is small (or it's better to - I disregard anybody else's wisdom than 3), but I've never seen anything wonderful, repetitive, and unstable. As soon as you finish eating but when you realize that the movie is over, there's something wonderful at the end of which you think it's a joke, but no - it's hard, although it's hard to say that they're trying to get it done. 3-D results ... yeah, if you have never seen the protest is a big thing, maybe not (if you look at the window without glasses, it seems to be the same). Even my son was disturbed by the end. My wife and I looked at each other and said "wow" at the end. Evil on every side.
