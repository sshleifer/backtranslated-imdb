What can I say? Kamal Hassan's movie is scary. He does very well, but it's a horrible story, along with fearful advice. In my sympathetic opinion, the lead Gautham Menon should stop leading. There are many challenges in the movie. Otherwise, one can not believe that the facts are true. There was no video activity. Gautham is just missing news. But Kamal Hassan and Jytikka do well. The sinful people seem unpleasant, even though their work was not bad. I do not think this is a video on Sunday afternoon as a papier that you can see with the family. You can not sleep to see the movie !! However, Harris Jayaraj did a bigger job, so I gave her the film at 10 times. 10. Her song 'Break Modail Nallae' is fun and fun. Except, visual images. All over, this is a bad movie, bad. Kamal Hassan, I guess, I have to deny this movie.
