When I was 11, 2 oils were sweet. It was worthless, humiliating, true, and even more damaging. My sister and I were watching, reuniting, and rehearsing again and again until we had passed or were so disturbed and hated. So, if you are 11 years old, and you are viewing the movie as "wonderful" or "fun" or "winning with the first oil," you have newborn teenagers and you are sure that this is not known. Preparation and damage will pass. <br /> <br /> If you were not a girl, you have no valid reason to explain that fat 2 is not embarrassed, unpopular, confused by all who have been involved in making, publishing, and / or drinking. <br /> <br /> To criticize, and respect the film now I explain why it's firing? <br /> <br /> 1. In well-beaten songs, the songs should enhance the story or have the alphabet. In 2 oils, it's a little different, that the music is careless. Many songs seem to fit in with the gimped frequency of sexual intercourse in more and more ways ("Night Night," "Do Our Country," and "Prowlin") without mentioning any of the images or movies. Additionally, all of the music is stupid and nobody else causes it to play or dance. <br /> <br /> 2. T-birds should be bad, and if they are not popular, but instead each of them is frustrating. Finally, when Johnny Nogerelli gave Michael a white T-shirt and brought him into a gang, Michael had to push him down, hurt him, and pull out a duck on the whole side of his body that was affected. But of course, they admit that it is gold-though, though it is a quake, there is no greater honor than having T. birds. Since Michael is beautiful, clever, kind, industrious, and more All in all (although they can not sing), Stephanie may meet her as she discloses herself as a man. However, Stephanie is gentle, quick-jawed, red, red, dressed, filthy and opposed. So, because of being attractive (they think), they do not have good qualities, so the audience is not given any evidence because of Michael's interest. <br /> <br /> I could go forward, but he did not want to mention his humility for those who had been initiated since there are many others who seem to think that their similarity is unjust. I will also say this, to you who think you want to go back with this confusion for the past: Winter 2 is a practice for you to kiss again. You are 32 now kissing a 13-year-old boy who has acne and pimples. Power is over and you're still struggling with dirty and confused. Believe me.
