It is true that some fans of Peter Sellers are used by this, ultimately. But of course every advertiser of Sellers will enjoy all his films, because of his great talent. and The Fiendish Plot of Dr. Fu Manchu is not the same. Fortunately this would be the final film sales, (it was released after his death), but it is good to see how the man managed to keep his talent indefinitely until he was lost immediately. And we do not just buy one Sellers, but we get closer, for sellers do not only take responsibility but also their 168-year-old X-ray hunter Nayir Smith. This is a futile issue as we follow Fu's antitics in order to make a difference in his years as well as in Nayland and his group of friends trying to stop him. Like most of the Sellers movies, the film has a wonderful work, as well as many well known women, David Tomlinson, Sid Caesar, John Le Mesurier, Clive Dunn and Helen Mirren. few. It is good to see the Panther of the Pink Panther Burt Kwouk (Cato) delighted by Comeo and Sellers - despite playing the same part, but still sweet. The story is amazing, as many people are interested in, who make the film boldly under the power of Goon. And, although it does not reach Goon's beauty, there are many unpleasant jokes that seem to look good. The film failed to sell for the first time released for the whole country crying after the death of the seller (the film was released within three weeks) and you always have the sadness you are thinking behind behind your mind when you see that these are the latest movie producers. It's far from a lot of movies - it's usually slow, stupid, and sometimes jokes can not be done - but it's fun - if it's the result of Peter Sellers.
