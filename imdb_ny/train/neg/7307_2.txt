This is one of the worst films I have ever had. Its contents are simply worthless and worthless. The fact that there is a disorder and illness can be reduced to the SO SORRY digestion problem. It explains that if the virus is broken in the newspaper because it seems to be different parts of the mixture. e.g Kevin, who has a karate romantic fantasy, performs a miracle alone, has a very mysterious and disturbing policeman, then he is addicted to drugs, he is opposed to an unchanging young man who needs help. then it's suddenly a great deal and sex with his closest friends because they are saying the folly of the birds. then ultimately the next kind of rabbit is used for Kevin's karate baby. The most spectacular way to use prejudice in the film. There is no reason for anyone to enjoy the film unless you love Eli Roth, even if that did not make me a movie. Hating strong words but seeing that it's the only one that is allowed to use should work. BOYCOTT CABIN FEVER 2 !!!!!
