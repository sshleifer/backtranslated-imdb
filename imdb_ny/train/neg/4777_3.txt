The idea of ​​this film was good. Evil is not written properly. Casting Sidney Poitier as a FBI supplier was a good idea, and he did a good job. But Tom Berenger, he knows only about his many films, anger. Kirstie's alley culture would have been bigger, and he showed another chance, but the secretary throws us down to help him become an assistant woman. This was very disagreement with the self-centered behavior they should have. I do not care that Alley is still doing it. The film must have lasted about fifteen minutes more than it did. The leader covered the cows before taking action. I will keep this list as an example of Poitier's events.
