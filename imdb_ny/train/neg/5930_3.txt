Well, <br /> <br /> If you make a document about Leonard Cohen and try Leonard Cohen! This is only Leonard who can get angry with the watchman who will be left behind because he listens to all the other singers (some of them are uncertainty) talking about themselves. Pulezeze .... looks like managing their notes in a high ranking - who cares for you, how about Leonard? Think about what people, like "doing something" maybe someone can make a document about you. I found especially neglecting U2 organs as if it could add the film's confidence - NOT. Leonard does not want Bono or Edge to talk about his spirituality. What would be fun would have been for film makers to know his spiritual part through the film. Gee, what a thought! I will give money to Rufus Wainwright and Jarvis Cocker because of cohen tunes - all of these events were extra and some were odd. <br /> <br /> Cohen fans, do not say I did not warn you!
