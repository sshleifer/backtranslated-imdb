Yes. I agree. I believed everything that is relevant to this work, related to the trials and problems of 6 people, living in Mexico City about their sexual life. And so, I really hope to finish the Mexican film (many years) which was popular and exciting to look. Unfortunately the movie was very frustrating. This article gives us two couples, all with clear family problems. When the third person comes into the life of each family, their problems are very tough. Or unwise. The scheme becomes a war of men and women. The ideas that each group has (yes, themselves, girls and girls and boys and boys) are both stupid and young (they think fun should be). And all of this goes worse. The vision comes from the best (Miss Zavaleta) until the middle (Mr Bichir), and Serrano are performing a great welcome on his prima opera. However, a combination of aggressive, identical, very poor (if not stupid) recognizes how sexual intercourse affects one's marriage, making the film a failure. Sadly. SPYL has had it (interesting) to get a good look at the box office. Believe your problems at risk.
