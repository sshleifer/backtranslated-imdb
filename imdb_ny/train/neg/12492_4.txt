This is one of the films that have an incredible box but has connected the camra and unseen work that they are talking about. What's as dark as murder is happening you can not see, including the film is hard to understand. The only star is WCW's Vanessa Sanchez (Tygres in WCW before design) and he is a sportsman. I like a cheap movie that has a bad idea because it's fun to watch but easy it can not be one of the films. The movies are ready to see if you like voodoo with left headlines but these are not refreshing but if you want something new to look at then renting Separate.
