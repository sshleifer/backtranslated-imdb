I had Cinderella 2 and Jungle Book 2, but this could be the worst thing ever. First, I do not like the drawing, Saturday-morning-cartoon, the worst in some cases. I liked some of the people, the Thunderstorm and the Patch, but another look, like Cruella was in the middle. Cruella was truly honorable at the beginning, but she lost her quality. What he said had nothing to write at home about it and his drawings were dirty. And his friend Lars was a joke to be honest with you, and Roger seems to have stopped smoking all night. The advice of the word was very good, especially Barry Bostwick, as Thunder, except Jodi Benson, was hurt by me. There were times when it was good, but the whole tool looked like it was stored for me, and it was very clear at TV. All of this, the most frustrating memory of Disney's 60 and Jungle Book films. Sorry, I can only give this 3/10, it was not my tea cup. Bethany Cox
