Nothing could keep this film, even Superman. <br /> <br /> Ten years ago real results would be wonderful. Good governance may have had some sense of feeling and good outside of the actors. But nothing but feeding a script for the dragon would have made it right. So, bad, progressive rows, come back forever of the same weapons of the CGI dragon that are shaking through places ... <br /> <br /> Avoid all this. <br /> <br />
