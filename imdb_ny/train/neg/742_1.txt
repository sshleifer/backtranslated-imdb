If this movie has a budget of 20 million, I want to know where the money went. The cow can make good results of CGI that has been damaged for three hours on this terrible piece, although I have to accept machines and martians that would really look, cool in the early games, and PC games from the early 90s when the game was prepared. How do I wonder about the money? Pendragon films could have produced a good film and movie recordings with George Lucas computers in 1975-83, and photographers who seem to be caring for 20 million people. This is probably the worst movie EVER making! It's good to stay under 24 hours of watching Ishtar than watching the movie again. I hated it all! I'm changing. I say This is a TRUE STUDY movie Because, in contrast with the scenes of Plan 9 or Killer Tomato, or Santa Claus Conquer Martians, these are the worst films that have special features in your heart, you love them. There is no love on this movie and there is no room for my DVD library. I sold to a boy for a dollar. I spend money for the movie to be alcohol and other bad for the workers. Shame on you Pendragon movies! I want my money!
