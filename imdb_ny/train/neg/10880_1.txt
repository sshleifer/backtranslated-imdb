These are the worst films I've ever seen, and I want the bad movies (are good). Possible (live) experiments have been experimenting with the type of teen play if you've always been a tongue-and-jaw - until the ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW, which was very fun. Other movies, such as PLAN NINE FROM OUTER SPACE, try to laugh when (obviously) try to be difficult. When it comes to action, it seems that they have initiated young people who have brain and have asked them to make everything. Compared with them, Tom Cruise looks like Alec Guinness. There was one correct definition - it's a bigger bigger ride on a motorcycle.
