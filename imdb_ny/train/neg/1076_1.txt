This was one of the worst films I ever had. Branaugh seemed to have a serious problem remembering his words so that he could not translate his line. The decision was not proper for John Grisham's name. No wonder it did not come out like a book or a release to a game. I did not even look at the whole thing. I thought I did not care who did, then I realized that there was no "nobody" to care for!
