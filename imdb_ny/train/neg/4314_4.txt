I believe that Oscar's most recent career was in 2003 for two reasons: <br /> <br /> 1) The lover of Steve Martin was very reliable: "I saw the team assist Michael Moore into his trunk" and " It is important not to mention sexually immoral sex if I wake up with my bed on my bed "<br /> <br /> 2) The overwhelming winners: Nobody had Adrien Brody on the floor to do so well. shoot) or Roman Polanski for the chief executive (real boss and boos) but defeated <br /> <br /> Last year's event was not bad but there was no wonderful way and I was happy to see RETURN FOR THE KING RIGHTING THE RIGHT although it was not so good at the fridge (FELLOWSHIP was good) but that caused the BBC to be destroyed by Jonathan Ross following a few who had their boyfriends and pretending to be ridiculers when they had anything but. So when I heard Sky is making a comment on the British TV I expect Barry Norman and Mark Kermode to be joining, but instead we ended up with Jamie Theakston and Sharon Osbourne! Receivers of British TV are not looking for films against their films (obviously they are) I know both Bob The Moo and Theo Robertson will be glad to run to LA to give their opinion on the winners and losers <br /> <br /> Chris Rock was not so bad , but not Martin Martin when the place looks like a set of stadiums and chairs! Not many interesting games in my mind. The biggest problem I had was the event with the "few" Oscars presented to winners sitting on their seats! Oscar as a "little" Oscar and because of the Best Animated Short or Best Costume Design, they are eligible for Best Art or Bestseller. All conquers should be allowed to walk on the cross. What group of haughty people contributes to the Academy's cooperation and I strongly agree with the comment that this form is shy and if not surprising it would have been the worst event in history. About the Reward Only <br /> <br /> A Relief Assistant - Cate Blanchett. No wonder a team of competitors <br /> <br /> The Best Practice Doctor - Morgan Freeman. There is no real complaint from Freeman is one of the most famous Americans <br /> <br /> Actor Best - Jamie Foxx. The most unexpected reward of the night. Yawn <br /> <br /> Movie Maker - Hilary Swank. The great wonder that everyone thought Annette Benning would succeed was politics but Swank had to do so and spoke good at night. <br /> <br /> Good Leader - Clint Eastwood. Surprisingly, everyone thought Scorsese wanted to earn a reward because he could not succeed. I'm happy with this because if he is not eligible for the TAXI DRIVER, RAGING BULL or GOODFELLAS should not have done so for OUTERS <br /> <br /> Success films - MILLION BABY BABY. Another amazing thing because everyone thinks that the school will share the prize with the great leader and the best picture that I think the Hollywood AVIATOR exhibition would have been a Best Picture picture when the MDB's issue would be a lot of lost voting away <br /> <br /> What the rewards show is that this year voters have chosen to ignore Oscar politics and reward for those who are supposed to do what they have not already done, meaning the BEAUTIFUL CARE OF BEAUTIFUL CHALLENGE OF LOVE! And a long time the school will choose with their heads instead of their hearts
