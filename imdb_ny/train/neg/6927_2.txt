Although I voted for this movie 2 because of failing to work hard to try to record the most violent film was 10 unacceptable payout. I could not tell what was happening in the movie or the people who were but I did not care because I knew that everything would make me laugh and laugh. Communication is limited to the film but I believe it's because they have photographed without photography. The fact is that there is no way to show that the film will be very rewarding. No matter if you sit down and watch the movie from the beginning to the end or if you keep track of it, you will be confused with entertainment. I like the place where prisoners are wandering out and fussing with sticks. I hope the doctor points out this as a help. Genius!
