It reminds me very much when someone watches a movie that I think is one of the most difficult movies out there. This was not very difficult out there, but it's not a good movie, but not so bad. Go and see something like the Nurse of Death or the Sea of ​​Water and come back to me to tell you if you think that night brings Charlie the worst thing. This movie has a good camera camera and repair system, which is more than I can say on most popular films. <br /> <br /> The film does not free from dead deaths, there is one death In view of the shortage of the pruning of the neck, but all other deaths are not fun. But lack of film shows does not mean that this is not a damaged, bad movie <br /> <br /> The film was obviously worth it. The film came at the end of the second session, so it was a highlight of modern technology, which took place in the cheek technique. For example, after killing, Charlie goes to the city's "signal" and shows the number of people. This is something that can laugh. <br /> <br /> If you have movies, give them a watch clock. It's quite different from your usual film that has two people, but not much. Playing the film is a great way to tell the audience to be happy and not to take the film so that God can eat too much. You can forget the movie, you can remember. I will remember because I love the name.
