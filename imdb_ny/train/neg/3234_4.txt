Well, how do you try movie like this? Is this really a cinematic price? It's a film that tries to be close to the movie as much as possible. Actually the entire film is a group of boys persecuting a girl. Not very appealing and above the same was not real. <br /> <br /> It's clear that the film was tried to be real and awe-inspiring if possible. However, the film is extremely damaged to fit in with the goal. Bullying and stinging are easy and wrong, and sound. Often they just climb up, rather than reach a girl, obviously. And how the girl deals with all suffering is good. I mean if this was real, of course he could scream it. There's more pain than breaking in it even <br /> <br /> Movies seem to be cheaper and try to achieve something wonderful with reality and cause, with less resources. Do not assume that the movie was a source of great interest despite the release of the film, although it was likely to have been successful, since six cells were released later. <br /> <br /> Fans of shock and Gore can be frustrated by this movie, though there are some young people out there who can be caught in the movie. <br /> <br /> 4/10
