Why are you looking for this? There is only one reason and that is because of the size of John Saxon. I like his actions. My favorite romance is in the Nightmare At Elm Street 1.3, and 7 as Nancy's police officer, Black Christmas as police, and from Dusk until Dawn again as police. When I first described modern movies I saw the Zombie Death House movie and started to shake but did not move, but I realized that John Saxon was not the filmmaker but the first time I heard about the director. This affected me (also cheaper $ 9.00) and I and I had to have. When I returned home, I discovered that the film did not agree with Saxon's work, even though it was a job that might be harassed by some of the challenges. But he was not the only one who had been drinking. It seemed like all of them were removed from damaging damages and told now what boys you should do. This film is featured with 80 pornographic content. I can not promote the movie, but if you really love people in their 80's who have not listened to a culture that came from that time by late birth, or to the movies, than these. And if you are digging John Saxon as I do.
