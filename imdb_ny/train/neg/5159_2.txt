Movie watching is like eating a fantasy banquet but meringue. At first they look pretty but finally give content NO-no. <br /> <br /> The scheme is a disturbing confusion about the use of the power plant. So, how could it be a big deal with Robin Williams that the video is so great ?! It's because the picture looks like nothing - like the terrible Pope picture William made at the beginning of his movie. The movie must have paid a lot of money but maybe there was not enough money left to record high school graduates. <br /> The movie with one unusual jokes that are still going on and on. I was not sure why they were originally made - they were not designed to make any fun.
