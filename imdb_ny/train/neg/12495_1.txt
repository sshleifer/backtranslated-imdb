Well, I love bad things. I am so excited and amazed at the fact that I am despising. Demonicus, or House of the Dead - they were bad enough to laugh. Disorders were not. <br /> <br /> What was the worst <br /> <br /> (owononga - cautious?) <br /> <br /> My friend and I stayed in the entire movie, and I have a few comments, all of which are set out and what it's happening. <br /> <br /> Program (color) - There is a man in this city (which may be Seattle, see comments below) who run and cut headphones. She has been doing this for one year (I do not go back to find the real number - thank you very much), maybe two or three years. One chapter per week. And the police are currently calling "a specialist" (which the ONCE thinks itself crazy, but it does not come back) <br /> <br /> Just right! Prices are later, why, are it consistent three times? After the Youth Teaching Questions We will be under the control of the brain! <br /> <br /> However, this "specialist" is looking at the voodoo son whom the police ignore all the time, and two of them come to the end with the Baron Saturday, the voodoo spirit, who shakes his head to get enough strength to make himself body (it's possible to take the world - or maybe go to Disneyland). <br /> <br /> Setup - where is this happening? Well, if you're not from Seattle, you probably do not realize that on a bar / rave (with up to 10 people who use movies and family members), there is a post on television, entertainment, the "Pulp Fiction" esqe dialog ( if IF) between two policemen (yes, who have cut their head about 15 minutes). They talk to the "new train" that would be difficult when the film was made <br /> <br /> From Seattle, I apologize to the film and throw my head down. Well, here's how hard it is - to be a scary film (uninstall, do not start searching for my name in the IMDb), and search. Much research. And in contrast with the film writers, I know that Baron Saturday - with Voudon Loa (spirit) who protects the grave and is often associated with (various oppressive Christians) and "satan" - is a "locker" as deceiving god. <br /> <br /> In other words, he does not cut the head. <br /> <br /> Also, the main part of Vudoun's religion is that the Baron Saturday can have a body whenever it pleases. Their religious festivities are near the various facets of the church and loa. <br /> <br /> Without mentioning, if already already someone else, how to make a new body? <br /> <br /> Also, if the Baron Saturday had a body, he would not have to go around his head, he would get good rum and cigarettes with TAY !!! <br /> <br /> Simply put, the only thing they did (miracles) is that in Tarot's non-indispensable Tarot letter (used for voodoo chick and spooky) they have not damaged the definition of cards that most movies do. Also, I have searched. (Everyone remembers the late-night-style tarot business - "Lovers - you will soon fall without love ..." is all that's worthless?) <br /> <br /> If you do this, I highly appreciate you. And I apologize again. I'm very sorry if you feel the need to watch the film for me, please do not.
