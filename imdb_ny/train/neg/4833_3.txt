Yes, this movie is a real thief. Did it take over extra Oscars from Avatar because politics needed a war-tune movie to get started (help?) U.S. wars. are fighting today. I do not want to go here in politics, but come, this looks better than the sky. A stumbling block does not end anything, no real plot. I hear myself in the 50's of Hungary when the banquet told people what they should love and what they do not like. The same films were announced at that time, except that they were black and white. Even if we think that this theme is "American wars" cool, you certainly have the best movies you can choose.
