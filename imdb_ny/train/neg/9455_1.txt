I guess I know the answer to this question. For Money! We have been so disturbed by Cat In The Hat's business and sales we almost believe there might be something good about the movie. Accepting, I think these trips seem bad, but I need to give them a chance. Well, I would have to go with my culture. That was a complete tool for Hollywood tool. Repeating again that the ordinary person can be prepared to believe anything that he claims to be good, should be good. In addition to ridicule that the film is about 80 minutes away, apparently the origin of the motto is the moth that consumes the script. It affects damaged damages for unhealthy laughter, with the worst of pastel paintings. It's jumping around the world without any destination or way. These are included by, ............................ yes, I tell you, BAD DO! I can not help but feel like I'm looking for "Talking" on SNL every time Mike Myers opens his mouth. Did the cats want to be an elderly Jewish woman? Spencer Breslin and Dakota Fanning were not worthwhile, but Mr. Myers must throw down the rock somewhere ready to make another movie of Austin Powers. F-, no stars, 0 at the level of 1-10. Save your money!
