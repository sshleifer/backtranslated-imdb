I do not believe he made this movie. That's impossible. The first film was good. But there was no need for the next, no doubt not after the TVs that were already part of the first movie. The film is like sound opera soap. This is very bad, it's simple. Jokes do not shake, the action is smooth, shooting like soap, there is no way. The first film was very good later. Each character had a very small moment. It was easy but it worked out and I saw the importance of the film. But this time around, there is no news line. The authors are unhealthy and no fun is happening. One good thing: A Brazilian boy playing Axel Daeseleire's son has been shot well. This was their real time in the film. I feel he can shoot a second TV series as part of Team Spirit 2 but please ask God, do not let him make a third part ...
