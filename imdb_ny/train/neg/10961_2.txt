Although the movie may be "real" in the Lewis book (since script was actually word-word, one word), it failed to accept its size that would have been associated with such a magic issue. Magical organisms (unicorns, centrals, griffins, ghouls, spirits) are taken in, and as we have seen, the greenhouse was difficult to swallow. I was about to laugh when I saw humanoid fish and their big suits and buck teeth; I was about to weep when I heard the sound of the jackals "the loud man" shouting loudly and boldly as much as possible. <br /> <br /> All of this is very complicated, especially for little Lucy Penvensie ... I would only get angry, frustrated, and buck teeth in (what looked like) fourteen hours watching the movie. An actor who plays with Witch White, throughout his history, seems to be at the entrance of the site, where strong words, spreading hands, and hard work on Shakespearian something can be acceptable. <br /> <br /> The sets sound like claustrophobic, whether the photos are in or out. In addition, it is as if the BBC could spend $ 100 in planning, and it is very small, and all these people gather together. The White Witch House is a fast, corrupt English-speaking site full of Stopfoam and illuminated images. When Penvensia's children are walking around trees - in particular, * every place in the forest - they feel like wandering around. <br /> <br /> The only thing that looks good in the film is Aslan, but you can run that the BBC may even broadcast the entire movie with the clock. It looks good while they are standing before they start talking, but when you start moving, you can not grieve the poor one who is supposed to be at the end of a lion's lions. Yes, if you're a movie of Narnia, you may want to see this book, because it keeps all the lyrics Lewis-but Lewis is not a movie shower, and most communication is easy and difficult when it appears. At a place where children are at Beavers' and are planning to escape the wolves, Mrs. Beaver, who does not live forever, "Oh, just one thing, deceives, and then we'll be ready to go," the same cry and sighing and fun "NO, Mrs. Beaver , PLEASE! " - a showcase of entertainment, confusion (they should be WANTLY from a nearby accident, not surprising to be carrying a skeletal machine or not), leaving the scene where the site may be. In fact, the entire film is directing the wrong recordings like this. <br /> <br /> I'd like to see you see a new Narnia (Disney 2005). New movies, new editions, computers, extensive timing, and scenarios-stealing the white magician (which contributes to its role as a whole of the opposition politician's opposition, unlike the banshee). about the beauty and beauty of the country of Narnia without interfering with seeing Lewis's vision (thinking). Lucy has a lot of stuff (no buck's teeth, YAY!), As well as beavers (are important to grow), and aggressive BBC Edmund has nothing to do with God, Acne-Acceptance-Insecure-and Angsting-and -n-Inferiority- Complex Edmund for new Disney programs to win. <br /> <br /> Unless you are famous who enjoy spending time with fun movie games, I can not appreciate the film for everyone.
