I have nothing against denominational films. Religious people need something to watch on Saturday night, thinking. But what really affects me is when writing on a DVD box does not show this to the observer. Removing religious messages like entertainment is not clear, bro. <br /> <br /> And even though I'm a religious man, I have to admit with many paintings here, this movie was a mess. He was misinterpreted, wasted nothing, was not properly modified, and soundtrack testing was hiding. The damage was dangerous, the letters were damaged, and the continuation was out. The only reason we lived through the degradation of the time was that it was too late to watch another movie instead. Just have to be asleep <br /> <br /> Absolutely you do not have any redemptive behavior on this film, unless you are religious who will soon allow anything to spread your beliefs to unbelievers, even as a garbage collection. If not, avoid all this. Do not be deceived by the box-up box.
