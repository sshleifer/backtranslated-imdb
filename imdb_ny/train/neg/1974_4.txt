Some people have restrained the film against the film because they criticize the worst people in Old West, the Old West people, or the women with a gun in Old West. Use and read the book. There were many Asian people, there were few (freedoms) and everyone outside the pagan party was ready to get a gun; That's the second change you know. And with regard to the use of modern language, no one in the West has ever been skeptical and has been used for a language that is consistent with the weather. The Americans had different words, varied, spoke differently and used many words and words that they can not recognize today. Do not assume an unacceptable reputation because you have not stopped. Be honest. Maybe you will not be disappointed with what you see.
