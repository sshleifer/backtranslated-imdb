I saw mothers ^ well, did not kiss Santa's order; she's got her hand on her thigh with a wrong mind mind. <br /> <br /> This was enough to look at the young boy who wanted to believe. He grew up to be a painful person who was disappointed with the nature of the game made, and the lack of Christmas spirit <br /> <br /> I hoped to shoot real, I was disappointed that at least a few people die, and there was no violence at all. It's bombs. <br /> <br /> I wanted this to happen, but it was less and it was not good. I was not expecting to do good, but I certainly wanted something else. There was no one.
