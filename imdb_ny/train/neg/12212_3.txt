The worst beginning of the beginning, the beginning of the episode II appeared in the US's heart at the time of liberation between the 80s, with a reaganism of refinement and a controversial redistribution of ideas, even though Michail Gorbachev came out of the heart of the 'Evil Empire' 'in Moscow soon will change this type of movie more; even Reagan himself confirmed that this was a concern. <br /> <br /> In this way, we can be very grateful to Gorby, not because of its US counterpart, or its 'glasnost' policy, or even its democratic support to the rest of the country. Europe behind the Soviet Union. the shortage of stupidity, jingoistic, winter cooling, such as the first film was imperfect, though it was easy to read and to do with events and the worst story. For this reason, even any farther away belief is just driven to fraud, Rambo's self-sacrificing experience causes many Vietnamese and Russian troops to escape POW years ago after the war, along with the United States on the lost side. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the reason why the film was a huge box of boxes and offices was allowing many Americans to enter into the mind, perhaps having lost a war, but there was no reliable job, and interested parties for diabetes like diabetes kill almost every Red eye in sight, and many devices as much as possible, achieved a very complex idea. <br /> <br /> This can be fun at SUPERMAN / SPIDERMAN level, but all sadness plays straight. not to say there's no excitement in the film; Sadly, it's the kind of careless thing. Effective photographs, although even more supplementary, have never been deceptive or deceptive, because they are always awesome Miracles that are hard to believe, which is, our power Rambo is always unconstitutional (except for small and harmful wounds) and even tons of bombs, pipes, guns, and so on. <br /> <br /> Amongst the content, the contents of the script contain dullest clich√©s and banned.Sallone, the author-script script by James Cameron (long journey from the exciting REQUIREMENT made last year), deliberately appears giving Rambo a custom it's a little lower for the English language to be clear, and it just borrows with a tool that has the idea, as though he made the only patois clear. What his friend Cameron was thinking about The Terminator again with short-term leadership skills! In this way Rambo looks like at least one person than Terminator did! All of this would not be good with the best photographers, such as Charles Napier and Richard Crenna, who are doing the best with the negotiations, and Steven Berkoff is being re-elected by the KGB / Red Army. Berkoff's view of her is modest but not too disturbed. How did Sly survive Berkoff's survival to kill many Red Commie scumbags? Well, trust is not a good idea for the film. This is a miracle work similar to WIZARD OF OZ. Little that things were miraculous, and this was not unusual. disappointment, and disappointment, kind. And to say Sly's speech ..., instead of fraud after killing all people, eh? By the way, in the same year, made ROCKY IV .......... <br /> <br /> RATING: 3 out of 10.
