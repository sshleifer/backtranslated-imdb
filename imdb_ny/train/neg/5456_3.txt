This is one of the scary movies you find on Lifestyle TV that reflects the worst behavior of one of the most disgusting women. In addition to some bad movies such as "Hot Bed," "Enough," or "Exhibition," the film takes a bad influence and tries to show the audience why it is not even bad. Give us rest! My question for film makers: If LeTourneau was a man, and Vili was a 12-year-old girl, could you make a picture and sad about this person? Answer: Hell no. <br /> <br /> The idea is changing the men in the movie, and you will see why I and others here see that this will be worthless. When the men are changed, there will be no attempt to understand the criminal. Instead, we could have been deprived of the obscene and filthy person carrying a girl, her immoral lifestyle, and the depressed brain with the Stockholm Syndrome. The only reason LeTourneau does not receive the same treatment in this film is because of his sexuality. <br /> <br /> Let's call it just to go. LeTourneau is slowly moving. Grass is easy. No, it's more or more important. He is a criminal who is in jail, and he needs to laugh at us and to disgrace him, but certainly he does not feel compassion or mercy.
