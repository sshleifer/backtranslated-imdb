THE CHALLENGE is one of the worst films I've seen over the last decade! This is a bad film about a stable boy whose two parents love him, but they get into trouble later. Junior can drive a grandmother's car. He can intimidate people with a bear. He can put a room in the fire! It's a bad movie like BATTLEFIELD EARTH. The result is very bad. Buy CHICKEN RUN instead <br /> * 1/2 from **** Offer.
