This should have been one of the five most serious films made. The plot looked like astonishing as of Track 57. But this final film was very successful. The scheme has been used in a very difficult way. Just a few times in this film, the Air Force assistant standing at the open door of 747 flying and trying to close the door without sinking 250 miles per hour (250 km) an hour? Afterward, aircraft from several miles from 8,000, it can not even be reached for 747 pilot hours with thousands of hours. While on the street (perfectly straight) he is being trained to pull on bribes, HUH !! At the door to speed up, while you are on the street you use an electrical machine and give you more power! I can go on and over the bigger and bigger mistakes in the movie, but then my answer would be the size of the English dictionary. This is a movie you want to miss, take my words!
