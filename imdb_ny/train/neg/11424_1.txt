I realized that "Fire" was on a rope one night and I started looking because I could not remember anything else but I remember it was a horrible movie when I saw it in '85. Twenty years later the movie is still dangerous. In addition to the synthesizer, saxophone was the most widely used instrument in pop music in the 1980s, as is reflected in the theme music. Listening to that song also made me want to wipe out the truth in my ears to solve the problems they are facing. And to sing Rob Lowe's songs with a saxophone, and there was one place that he enjoyed singing only when he was Charlie Parker, listening to him only and playing the game with monkey playing. All of these were very difficult, even though I had to say that he had done a huge job of photographers who disagree with them. I thought that Mare Winham was a happy one, and at first I was sorry for her behavior because she was wearing wonderful clothes, but about the end of the movie she thought she was going to have sex with the character of Rob Lowe who could be taken differently of sexually transmitted infections as such items.
