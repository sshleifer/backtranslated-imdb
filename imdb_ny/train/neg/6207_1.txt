Movies do what I would have been raped on for the truth. The films say they are very scared among opposers in Cannes, but for me the last event was just the attempt of a newbie leader to get to know him. There is no longer a discussion about violence, drug abuse or the disruption of young people (or any other problem). <br /> <br /> How great adult behavior is flowing out, but a boy who is being harassed by a violent offender is no need, when the rape (being a shaking picture, the attraction of a "clockwork orange" rape) can not stand and I refuse comment on what's going on. There are some things that photographers do not have to do to achieve their goals. What I think. <br /> <br /> Wrap: violent, rebellious, and timeless. See also the "Clock Clock" or "The Pianist" instead.
