Enough enough ... Sometimes they just stop making movies using a long-term idea. The first presumptuous films were good. The second was foolish. The third was despising. TV shows have become so disturbed. And the film just produces a lot of money. <br /> <br /> For additional reason for computer results and dolls, we now have a list that lives in the Wild West in the 18th century, and is fighting against the sculptures. As the first restoration, they should learn how to deliver them over and over again. I enjoy lovingly thinking. Alternatively, directly-to-the-art release, such as heating 2 and 3, goes far away. O and I still wonder how there's no record of these events happening ... can they just forget to write this unusual event? I think something like this could make a reputation, so our wounds in the first movie would not be ready. <br /> <br /> The like films that destroy the original make me crazy. Avoid waste.
