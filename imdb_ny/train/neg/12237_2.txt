Original Rudolph: Good. Frosty's original drawing: You need a little bit of work, but it may be bad. But Frosty and Rudolph together on the fourth of July? That's it! Give me BREAK !!! This was one film that could not have been created. It was bad. It did not go overtime, except on July 4. This made the worst ever since Frosty and Rudolph often complied with the Christmas season. And every movie can be damaged by a lot of music. Many songs often made the movie longer than ever. The film attempted to mix two Christmasstones that are known by American culture (which seems to be "bombing" in America), a lot of worthless music, and a bad plot. Next? Bad movie that can not be watched every year. I tell you to quit the film even if you love Frosty and Rudolph.
