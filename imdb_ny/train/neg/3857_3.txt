I hoped that the film would be interesting, like some kind of color. Still, I was disabled and did not find myself laughing at it. Watch it on the HBO, maybe, or if you have the right to borrow to ruin and want the movie through that time. But I do not urge you to pay for it. <br /> <br /> The scheme is simple and straightforward, and it would be fun, maybe, if the text is good. Jason Lee can be deceiver, and he gets a little laughing over and over, but the movie falls. Do not go see this. Management is a lack, but for what it is, improvement is not necessary. I guess that from its very beginning and that it's not just laughing. See something else, do not miss your time here.
