I had a great deal of hope in this film because I really enjoyed the first. It looks like Disney, however, is trying to create a unique talent for upright sequels. They had to razzie. Most, really. I thought that the idea was right, but the music was so difficult and the story was not so good. What happened to the great disney songs that they used to have in their movies. Mary Poppins, Aladdin, Beauty and Beast, King Lion ... even Hercules and the Hunchback of Our Lady. They have made so many films in the saddest years that they have come to make unnecessary writing or even put them in the office. <br /> <br /> I hope this movie is not a preview of what comes to the Walt Disney Corporation.
