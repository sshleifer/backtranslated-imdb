I just get up and watch the film, especially because I liked and tried another Singleton job as "Boyz n Hood". However, I should say that this was a great disappointment and I hate all the more, clich√©d, so-called "movies". <br /> <br /> The experience is poor, (pop movies and samples do not make good movies), the problem just adds, (the punishment for rape only becomes friends only ... please!), but the most difficult one is to stimulate all the miracles that you can think. At the second half of the film has become a dramatic recording, it will keep you from being lost because of the sadness you've had on the players. <br /> <br /> There is not one legitimate one that is made up of the causes of prejudice and culture, immorality and ignorance. The results just end up showing the results of these problems. The message is contradictory, and confused and disagreeable. Until the last film, I discovered that it was amazing, embarrassing, obscene, and frustrating. In the film "Higher Learning" I have to say everything I have learned and avoid watching this. <br /> <br /> If you want to explain the truth on one of the topics that the movie can not describe and then go to "American History X" ... unless you just look at Tyra Banks then go shopping.
