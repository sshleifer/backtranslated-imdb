The movie was very dangerous almost almost ... almost. We like music, but not this. Despite the harsh behavior, filmless films, and many musicians who can not sing or dance, Anthony Rapp was able to perform a good job (especially the end). Marjorie's condition, a drunkard, was a pleasure to see, too. <br /> <br /> The scheme is not expected and would be fun without loud singing and cheezy piano songs. Admittadly, some songs are wonderful (but not good) <br /> <br /> A free home is a damaged film because it's dangerous! We think it's probably a good act of music (with the best artist).
