Do we really need some debris against Baby Boomer's baby? In the meantime, I am a Boomer, even when all the "teenagers' goals of the 60s read Marx, burn their letters, and often produce a war that killed tens of thousands of people; I was still in high school. But I do well remember them, and 9 out of 10 are just stupid, who can believe anything damaging. <br /> <br /> This is a clear indication of the presumptuousness of children who are not really raised.
