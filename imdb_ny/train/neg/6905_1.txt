Polychea men drink, fight and make a river related to sex, foolish and empty words. The real life of Polynesias is more fun than these, with cardboard cards. A girl named Samoa did not see or even do Samoa, she looked like a white woman who had sex with anyone. It's as weak as a matter of water you can not say nothing action - even the most popular can not do anything with the script. Sadly, Polynesian players admit playing with non-film movies with only one film, and only two or three 'jokes'. What contributed to the Kiwi finance, which lost the opportunity to create a good film for the people who live with. It's best not to make movies if they are bad and unwise.
