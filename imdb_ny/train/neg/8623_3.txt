The film near Ching Wan Lau is trying to catch a clever thief (Ekin Cheng) who hates an insurance company led by Kelly Lin. In fact, everything that the police try to fly in a certain way already knows them. These films, presented by beautiful photographers, beautiful photographers and filmmakers in Hong Kong, have little effect. All of this is cold, and the light just gets worse. I lost all one third of the way to the movie, and there is no repetitive behavior afterwards, except for movies that look good. Just think of watching this movie if you can do this for free. Also, consider watching this movie for 20 minutes in the video because it's the same to the end: TO DO. 6/10
