In an effort to restore the boy's race that was taken by spoofs like Scary Movie and Shriek if you know what I did last Friday on 13, Valentine fails. Why did people like Halloween? Because it was original, new and more than anything else ever happened. Why do they like Scream? Because it might be logical. Valentine is just a fool-flick who does not have a year ago. The plot is similar to the Halloween and the Urban Legend. And when the killer comes in the window, you know who he is, and the sssssssssssooooooooooooo are not reliable. This type of youth is DEAD Find! <br /> <br /> 0 out of 10
