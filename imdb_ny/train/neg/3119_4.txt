Robin Williams gave a good job to The Night Listener as he worked for other members. However, movies appear to run and they leave a lot of end to appear "fit to see." I think this is happening because there is not enough relationship between the caller and Gabriel Noon (I had to explain it this way, because IMDb needs to correct correctly in the appropriate "No"). The film lasts more than 1:30 minutes and within 15 minutes, or it seems, at midday the search for Pete Logande, a boy calling. <br /> <br /> This happens after speaking with an amazing caller about 3 or 4 times. Discussion is not so definitely what you are ... I'm in the hospital ... why did the dating come from ... and so on. In this book, the child becomes less reluctant with Nova Calculator and the reader understands why he goes to look for the boy, once he finds that the child can be found and thinks he can be a critic. <br /> <br /> In the film, Noon just wants to find the Logande, but why are the audience left to ask themselves why? Since there is no real solid bond between Noon and the caller, why are you suffering? Who cares whether the singer is not? <br /> <br /> I know there is a difference between the book and the movie, but the call with that fellowship was very important to set up the window, because it creates the basis for the entire movie. Otherwise, the film falls. <br /> <br /> This is not surprising because of another Maupin job, city news. When made up of a small list, it worked well.
