This film was a photograph as part of the 2007 Sydney Film Festival for the 2007 Mardi Gras. I was not waiting for the film as one had chosen for me. <br /> <br /> I like movies that take time to create, movies that allow them to comment and edit the story. Stay healthy. But the film was very short. <br /> <br /> The debt must go to the two photographers. There was a difference between them as two distinct, wrong, united people together. There were painful and sad moments when we learned more about them. <br /> <br /> I also liked the site and how it shot. It was claustrophobic and monochrome and it added to the dating film and affects the misunderstandings of the characters. <br /> <br /> I do not understand the end. What was it all about?
