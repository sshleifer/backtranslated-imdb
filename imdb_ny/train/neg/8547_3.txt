This was a very exciting movie; I have found this song to be a part of this work. Photographs Mario took from the village were also careless. However, I had three problems with this movie. First of all, the light was so dark that it was sometimes difficult to talk about, but this could be mys. Secondly, the same source has not been properly explained and I do not know what's going on there. The third problem is that I did not understand the end, but obviously some people do. Of course, there are problems that people do in foolish things, and the leader is 70 years of age. All of this, but not in the light of their preferences.
