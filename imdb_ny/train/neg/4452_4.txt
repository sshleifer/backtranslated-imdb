Let's just say that I have to stop my unbelief from Spiderman than I did for A Hooligans. This means, I have some problem and believe that Toby McGuire can build a house than what Elijah Wood throws in Manchester. I can not write it, for I do not want to write a spoiler, but the opinion of adults, scholars, British men are approaching death almost every weekend, well ... funny. And the film is not. War, the idea of ​​fighting, is taken deeper. The power of pugilism, the respect for which the story is cured is irritating, because it does not establish or resolve conflict. It looks like the plot, with large holes enough to drive Guiness car further, whipped together with the head of "fish" in the water so that they can see Woods' eyes as they learn how to become an e. to fight with other boys who oppose the ball with unrealities and escape as fast as they can. Authors are photographers, especially Americans in Harvard. Cultural development is a list of stories and telegraphed for the observer. Unfortunately, the neglect of the film does not reach its border until the end, which at that time has been about two hours of your life you will not return. Select "The Football Factory" or "Submit the Club" instead of corny, and you're upset. It does not waste the timeless and timeless music, the worst "Yankee at the King Aurthur Court," or the long-term scenarios. They are holy, dark, and fun; how violence should be.
