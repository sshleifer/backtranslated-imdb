It's like this ... you put it in DVD with the most beautiful item you see at the next ninety minutes is the brand of a publisher company. And right now, you know you're just traveling around. <br /> <br /> Most people rely fully that if anything is set on DVD, it will be enough - at a very small number of financiers if they do not lie. But this sadness is not so. The companies offering great entertainment to download movies for amateur movies and to send them to stores waiting for an unexpected buyer who is attracted to a well-designed DVD cover. The project's contribution is the privilege of becoming a famous pioneer pilot Kevin J Lindenmuth, whose name can be known amongst his films as he has the role of filmmaking - "Rage of Werewolf", "Werewolf Tales" and so on. <br /> <br /> "The Blood of Werewolf" is made up of three unusual miraculous stories that do not have any real coherence but that relate to their trips. The first part, "Blood Transfusion", is the most beautiful expression of the whole thing ... a person returns to his town to look at a girl who breaks down, to realize that her oppressive grandmother refuses to allow her to have relationships with men, and for the same reasons related to the secret of the dark family. This district is not well-managed, it is not well managed, and it really does not matter what you can do with yourself with a couple of friends and a modern movie at home. <br /> <br /> The second article, "Old Blood", is probably the strongest of three and is led by Lindenmuth himself. He tells us the story of a man and his wife, who have a shapeshifter and someone wants to be given this power. His desire was given, but he did not become a creature he thought of. The game shows that Lindemuth has a lot of talent and more producers, but it is not enough to raise the top of the amateur movie level. <br /> <br /> And finally we have the "Manast", when an army runs in the woods as it is followed by two more. He intends to kill him as he was bitten by the beast and believes it is dangerous, but it does not all seem to be as obvious. One has an interesting idea, but it is stretched out to be too long, and if you do not think "twist" is ten minutes then it may not be too bright. The most beautiful designs include this problem with the whole DVD ... a little good idea is not enough to spend money on such issues. After all, can you give a picture that you can make for yourself?
