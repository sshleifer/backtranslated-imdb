* HELP FOR MANY WHY * The movie was a serious one. I'm a big football player so I decided to look at it, and I was very disappointed. It started well. When I saw DeNiro had a bad influence, she had her little baby, hoping she would be a good man in movies or something. Whatever, at the beginning it looked like DeNiro was supposed to be a protagonist. He was the only one who believed Bobby, and had his dear son losing his office, which gave me the basis for obedience. He wanted to help Bobby speak to Primo, where he never beaten Primo to kill ... Without mentioning the music song "I want **** !!!" sometimes unknown. <br /> <br /> Later, when DeNiro had saved Bobby's son from ignorance, I hoped that the film would redeem himself. He could forgive himself for killing Primo as he saved Bobby's son. But of course this is far away from the movie, because all of them listen and find CREDIT for murder, and they do this because Bobby's son, car, and dog are in charge - Bobby has to build a house and announce DeNiro as "a real critic" when he shows The picture of a fighter <br /> <br /> Now we come to a very unusual event at the end ... He pours out like hell and we are hoping to believe that the games are not invited. So DeNiro somehow magic at the bottom of a suit suit and calls Bobby out, removes his knife and begins to kill anyone running in the field. It seems that there is no police in the field (but the police are on the way), so DeNiro travels and gets ready to give a knife to Bobby's death. But do not worry, this fun and exciting movie has a wonderful end, because Bobby gets her baby. <br /> <br /> IT IS NOT a movie show. NOT A READER. As far as I know, fans do not hurt the psychopaths that threaten, steal, and throw their knives. This may be the most difficult movie I watch in my life. The plot was unstable, the sound of the song sank, the film had no purpose. I am warning you not to waste your time on the filming film.
