I remember watching this movie for a long time on TV. I remember that the movie is near a group of hotel staff being criticized by the ants. What I did not remember was THE GREAT EVENTS! <br /> <br /> I just bought this movie on television late at night. I'm sure it's a mistake because films like these are usually available and will never be found! Suzanne Somers (who is at the center of his career playing Chrissy on 'Three Company') plays at Lakewood Manor. Workers put a swimming pool outside and destroys ants' confusion. Or I must say, * DOES THAT MOTORS ARE THAT THAT MAKE PEOPLE TO HELP PEOPLE? One of the workers begins to attack ants. One minute he takes his clothes one by one, the next minute he's covered in them. The following shows bones in the soil. <br /> <br /> If you thought it was all right, you should see Myrna Loy climbing the wheel that leaves the Manor River via helicopters! I can see him think they are running away from the movie! <br /> <br /> The last photos show Suzanne, Robert Foxworth and the third boy sitting under the hotel and behind each other, shooting through the ants. <br /> <br /> That's exactly the film. There is no attraction for "disaster" or "big star" movie capture. Wanted to be the most popular on the TV at the time. Now, they have the opportunity if they are lost at 4:00 am while going to your TV. <br /> <br /> If you want to catch Suzanne Somers for its good, then watch Company's Three piece. If you want to see Myrna Loy doing everything to make a cake at the table and pay her a debt, then watch the movie. <br /> <br /> 0/10
