The most disagreement is the worst film that has been made. Joanna Pakula's character seems to have I.Q. 3 which is less than the author and director. The game would not have passed through a high school classroom; "jokes" with children; doctrine corny. Those who did this apparently needed employment. I sat down to see if it could grow. It did. Life is too short for you to play any part of this movie.
