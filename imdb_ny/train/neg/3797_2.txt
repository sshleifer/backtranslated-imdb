Many years ago Alex Rain (playing with Olivier Gruner in the first film) was disappointed at a terrible plot that involved human and machine but since then war between cybergs and humans has been lost and lost, now the greatest of the species Olivier Gruner's personality (He also receives half of his limited workforce) which I think the films are too small, yet when he has made his appearance hiding in 1980 when the future bomb threatens him, he disturbs sci-fi. Nemesis was defeated, to see why people liked even though I did not like the movie. Nemesis tried so hard to bring a different idea, to create a beautiful and productive look, almost a job. Nemesis 2 does not even have that desire, and the cheapest of The Terminator and the gay woman who is the very least of the actions she makes Olivier Gruner appear to be an iron leader and the following trends are not the most tragic events in the sales industry. I admit I was not fanatic at the beginning but I have to follow better than this. Formerly included Tim Thomerson, Cary Hiroyuki Tagawa, Thom Mathews, Brion James, Thomas Jane and yes Jackie Earle Haley, have one of the most popular presentations in this movie. In fact, after seeing this, it was inspired to add a half of the stars to the beginning. <br /> <br /> * from 4- (Bad)
