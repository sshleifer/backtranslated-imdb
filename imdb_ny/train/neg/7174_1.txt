I wanted to read some comments before I commented and many rule: The movies are scary! From events to invisible realities to many errors. I was hoping that the bulbs could spread with ideas (they could not add bribes without the engine). Use tools will not be possible unless you have the power supply. The little tiny cloth that went up was not enough for anyone to stretch its height. One thing I thought was amazing when they arrived, the wheels behind the floor and then the nose stopped, thus stopping the plane with high tires in the sky. How did the captain use left and right bundles to avoid tires that did not affect the soil? Did they forget the ruins? Message to the facilitator: Check out * all your options on the plane without experimenting with the "flight". Sorry for today's technology, but I'm giving you this 1/10 movie.
