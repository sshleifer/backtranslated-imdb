I guess I was attracted to the film because of the sound of this story with a popular leader, so I gave a chance, from the chief Gregor Jordan (Buffalo Soldiers). In fact, Ned Kelly (Heath Ledger) is set up by the police, especially Superintendent Francis Hare (Geoffrey Rush), being forced to run a terrorist party and criticize her to identify her and her family. That's all I can say about the matter, since I was not too careful to be honest. Olivia Bloom, such as Joseph Byrne, Naomi Watts, Julia Cook, Laurence Kinlan, Dan Kelly, Philip Barantini, Steve Hart, Joel Edgerton, Aaron Sherritt, Kiri Paramore, Constable Fitzpatrick, Kerry Condon, Kate Kelly, Emily Browning, Grace Kelly and Rachel Griffiths like Susan Scott. Ledger does very well, what is right, and the film has a time of damaging, especially with a gunfire to the end, but I can not say I enjoyed it as I did not look at it all. All right!
