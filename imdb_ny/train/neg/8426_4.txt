"Wife? All this is a permanent ...!" <br /> <br /> No, do not translate properly; not at all! This left behind the "Dad's Army" last year, no need for a little, a little fantasy television movie, and does not play a role in a big drama ... you can say that the movie is well represented by Britain's downward, and especially More than that, the British * industry * enterprises. And that's just a thought, is not it? To be a stupid stupid example ... <br /> <br /> All that remains after TV secrets have been discontinued, Cliff Owen, Galton and Simpson are: unlimited, musical, inactive, from Ron Grain the story ... to have one idea (which looks less, lost-lost ... how Steptoe's movie appears again) the increase in the crop - and the authors and authors appear to be totally isolated - something like 'unfaithful monstrosity' (real on the website) since 1973, "The Mutations". The most remarkable noise, the wording of Harold is a place where he is physically assaulted and hated by the hater (right now, if a friend tells me, meets TV ...), but this seems to be the original, and the sign of controversy just adds to the boil in Britain in 1972 ... However, there is a prostitute who has a 'heart-of-gold' that moves -traitor 'pon poor must' Arold - and beyond-caricature 'class' element; without mentioning, the odd wonders they did from a rare redoubtable lead. Brambell and Corbett mix with a script, and they fail to heal the ham. What would Anthony Aloysius Hancock do ...? I'll just think that fewer working hours - especially the G & S can handle and the most effective B & C veins - are also unknown. <br /> <br /> But, oh, how hard it is to say these things: difficult, troublesome, all that are deliberately preserved and what made TV good, and who are joining the lazy,, misogynist 'activists, will do ...' really more information was allowed through many movies in Britain at that time.
