Well, this film was very bloodstream. It's so bad that although I did not pay for it, I wanted to get my money back. <br /> <br /> The movie has nothing to look good. That's what is made of sci fi fi cliche that has been well done by many skilled filmmakers. This vision, especially by the leader, was above the top of Ed Wood's most favorable way. Talking about Ed Wood, he may be bragging about the person's discussion. It's just a lot of fun and fun. Above that, that is not logical, or plot, or missing. The appearance is good, but it is not enough to go "oh wow, cool" and just seem to be "cold" rather than a good piece of fabric. <br /> <br /> Voicetrack was a mishmash of some of the things that are never hopeless. In addition, it seems that the director is just singing a movie in the film to become "cool" <br /> <br /> That brings me to my end. Perhaps if the elder complains about the plot, the topic and the discussion rather than trying to be "cool", could not create a dorky cliche 'of a short film. <br /> <br />
