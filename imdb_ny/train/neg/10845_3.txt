THIS had a plot! ;) I've seen a movie without a plot (I do not want to mention Asian movies but ...). I thought that the camera could not have been so bad on a cheap movie like this, but also in the air was not bad. There is no real cause for many things people do and how they deal with what happens. Even though I think of many movies, it's just so dangerous now, of course. <br /> <br /> Rated SO films just for drawing. The actions were bad but I saw the worst. The films were bad but I noticed the difficulties. Watching the movie is a reality between the sounds of grace, laughter involves, death, desires, confusion, humor, and humor. <br /> <br /> So if you like gory and stupid films make this with the best movie for you. <br /> <br /> I gave 3/10, because it would be fun if you did not expect to watch a good movie and have a good idea.
