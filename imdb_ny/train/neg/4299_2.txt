This is one of B-bad films, which could not play anywhere near the game. Women are roamed in "bunny" clothes, a very rich woman with a lot of ridiculous jokes, and they all work at an elderly man's poster, with a funny baby Jim Jimanks (Tom's brother Tom), whom the man wants to "put." Hanks is really a good color, but the movie goes everywhere and it does not matter. Should anyone wonder why he was rebuilt? However, because of Hank's work and fun times (but no more), he received 2 "stellar" out of 10. I think I was good, yet.
