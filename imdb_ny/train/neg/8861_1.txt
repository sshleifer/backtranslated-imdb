Dangerous threats to "The Howling". This includes Karen White's death (killed at the end of the first film). Stefan Crosscoe (Christopher Lee sadly) arrives there and tells Karen Ben's brother (Reb Brown) that Karen was a plot. He is going to Transylvania to strike Striba (Sybil Danning) a presumptuous head. Ben and Karens friend (Annie McEnroe) joined him. <br /> <br /> Malicious scriptures, bad practices, insufficient changes and tragic events are the same with Brown and McEnroe covering. Tragic consequences are stored in the dark - good reason! It's dangerous when you see them. Forecasting the extra results - although I HAVE been like a fiery flame from Danning fingers. There is also an eagle tribe that is very foolish and Danning removes at least three times in the last time! <br /> <br /> There are a number of good things - I found a thrilling city of Transylvania - seems to have come from all the dangers of the 1930s! There are camera cameras between visual editions; Brown and McEnroe have good bodies and Lee and Danning are good in these - but they can not save themselves. Yes - WHY did he do this? Where do they suffer money? This is one of the films that are far lower than IMDb. They alone have to tell you something. Said Danning was scared when he saw the film - and I could understand why! Must need.
