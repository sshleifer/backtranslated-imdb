This movie is amazing. It's all right, it's "freakin" weird. "I can summarize you, or research theology, but see that I waste your time. Anyone who needs to know about this movie is just two young sisters, one union, killer, shade, and real frustration At the end of the film you feel like you're going to have a bath to keep yourself clean, but not as a "Pulp Fiction" or "Fight Club." It's like you're a young person (or a high school that I'm a teenager) and just made something A: I wish you have not done, and B: hope for the good Lord of heaven and earth that your parents never know about, and no one likes it, my advice is that instead of defiling your mind and watching a piece of cinematic disgust, just spend your time on something something so bad and look at "kaamam" (yes, it's good to look at "jaza am "than" Murderous Maids ", read what you want).
