It was nice to see some of the stars that I liked 30 years ago, including John Ritter, Ben Gazarra and Audrey Hepburn. They looked so happy. But that was so. They were not given any kind or good working rows. I did not understand or care what the people were doing. <br /> <br /> Some of the young women's titles were good, Patty Henson and Colleen Camp were deserving and believing in their small part. They show another talent and it's sad that they did not start staring in many movies and better. Sadly, I did not think Dorothy Stratten was privileged to participate in this important film. <br /> <br /> The movie seems to have some pictures, and I had an open mind when I started looking. I'm the great celebrity of Peter Bogdanovich and I enjoyed his last movie, "Cat's Meow" and all the original from the "Goals" at "Nickleodeon". So, I was so surprised that I could not stay awake to look at it. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, the film is near a pilot board where police and condoms love each other. Five years later, Cybil Shepherd, a friend of Bogdanovich, had films entitled "The New Moon" quoting from Bogdanovich. Of course, there was a big difference in the list that the list depends on tons of spiritual communication, while trying to make a few shorts of screwball shoes. <br /> <br /> Bottom: Not a "Pope Month" and is just a "Highway, Doc" option.
