I've never watched the Tarzan movie before I got it on the phone I thought I'd give it. Unfortunately I have to say that I was disappointed. Tarzan was over 40 years of age and was very wealthy. Not the way I think Tarzan can look. And, unless I missed myself by making a cup of tea, Tarzan did not give up his habit. The killing was Tarzan flying over the trees - jumping from the vine to the vine. <br /> <br /> Well, there's more. However, Jane was there - The Cheeta boy was there. There was some guy with a guitar there. There were bad people and good boys and boyfriends ... all worthless and well-known. There's nothing wrong, you understand, but there's nothing good. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's not a great movie to show Tarzan: 4/10
