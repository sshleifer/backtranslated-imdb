Ok, first, I'm the biggest of the zombie movie fan. I liked everything about Romero and was very happy with the revision of Dawn of the Dead. So when I heard anyone criticizing this movie I had no hope. I mean that, critics hate Resident Evil, and it would not be a great movie at the moment, but I was happy if it was not just a matter of humor. However, this is good. Great communication, men's plot, and video games are featured in the film. Those in their right mind think that that was a good idea. The only thing about this film (I use the free expression) I enjoyed was Jurgen Prochnow as Captain Kirk (Ugh). Although his name throws out the window, you can see how he uses it to know that he is in a bad movie of God and can benefit greatly. All people act like Shakespeare. And so bad I can add. That's the only reason anyone else should see this if it's.) It's a zombie buff buff and it's got to see all the zombie flick made or b.) Just play MST3K, home games. See it with your friends and prepare tons of unusual laughing <br /> <br />
