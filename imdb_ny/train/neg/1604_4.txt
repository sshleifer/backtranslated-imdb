Remember a movie that you look enjoyable in the past that does not meet the same idea as an adult? This happened to me when I returned to school .. The National Lampoon Class Reunion. This movie has the opportunity to laugh, but it's amazing that pilgrims are just watching as we see a well-known group of people like a woman who sold her soul to satan and could produce fire from her mouth, a person who looks like a vampire, and a sophisticated manslayer like a woman and carrying bags on her head. You have a classmate who believes it's the best thing to do with the circumcised bread (but as we see in the film, is scared and jokes), smokers who do not know that they are alone, and a man named Gary, who knew was there (and nobody could ever remember his name ... this is what's playing the jokes I like). There is a twister who wants to marry women in the wrong place, a deaf woman and a blind person with a cough when she calls her dog, cooking (you know her from "goonies" and "throw a mother out of the train") who likes to have a meal on a platter about the people with his hands! The newspaper has a nutcase that is (or is trying) to retaliate for classmates because of the gag they are attracting (they are planning to have sex with her sister!). The film is following the image when it is investigating destructive rainfall, going to a high school. They were told about the murderer and his psychologist who seem to be unknown. The film has a few active components (fastest), but the film is slowly growing. The problem is that they do not know where to go. The movie has only jokes because it has uncertain advice ... if it has any guidelines. The casts are quite happy, but only interesting articles are worth the effort. It is a curio for fans of eighty (80) premiums that are forgotten (these are suitable).
