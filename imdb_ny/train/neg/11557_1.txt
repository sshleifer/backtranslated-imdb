* SOILER * It's a lie! The whole thing is hypocrisy! There are no spirits or jamps, Alan and the Lord and his cousin or his brother or his brother or something like this require the building as his office. So it promotes an unnecessary unnecessary way of thinking. SCOOBY-DOO drives Alan to suicide. Most of the film is taking him and fighting it. He does not even kill them. She falls asleep and the girl is over and she thinks she is put to another place. Looking at the so-called spirit of Evelyn, he could say that he was wearing gloves! My God is giving up time. Do not worry to look at it, borrow and if you buy it and you still do not look, sell it. Quickly! Take your own grace and stay away from the night of EVELYN. I'm offering this stinker to CRAP-O-LANTERN.
