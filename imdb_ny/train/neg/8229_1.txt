- They have landowners - <br /> <br /> I've seen a number of interesting Indie movies such as The Hamiltons, The Boys Love Mandy Lane and Fever Fever; Unfortunately I heard five passing by not falling into this organization. From the beginning to the end of the movie is being struggling with exercise from a very poor script, the only god knows why the authors think of such a conversation as "No, do not come out: you: if you find you kill you and if the killer dies" is the highest in the film. <br /> <br /> This film shows little human development and honesty can not take care of just a few of the pain and suffering given to them if they are a group of college students who do not show that they have no redemption. All they do is cry and accept in the whole movie and if girls do not cry and quarrel; when they are discussing this topic in a very unusual manner: dating to boys or how one man behaves shortly (good news when being followed by a psychotic killer) <br /> <br /> Voicetrack and Corny techno music at the first and last time (even hearing musical instruments that the end is approaching it looks like the sky) <br /> <br /> The dwarf work is scary and sometimes shows the film. Given the possibility of having a small or unlimited budget, the lead had one camera camera that lives in the almost every movie girl. I think these were trying to listen to the audience as far as possible: feeling and understanding what girls are experiencing. But because of the cameras picture, it is very graphic and very close to what might be difficult to describe in the scene and it is a traumatic experience. It's one thing to make the film legally acceptable but it's one that has to take action on the windows that audiences can not record for poor showers. <br /> <br /> I understand that five eyes are less budgetary indie film but this does not contradict the very poor quality. There are no redemptions for this movie: bad, easy text, camera operation and informal. After all this, I decided to give one of the ten out of 10 films that took me away. I want a meteor to knock down and bring a good rest. In 94 minutes the stupid students are crying, arguing, running unlimited and having unfamiliar discussions. However, how often do you find that girls are loosing their hands and throwing them into the window of the driving force.
