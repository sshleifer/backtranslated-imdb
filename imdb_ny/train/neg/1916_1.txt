This movie is all detestable. Some unscrupulous people are self-sufficient by doing all they can to realize that they are the greatest of all in the workforce. There is nothing more than a piece of self-indulgence catharsis. It is disgusting <br /> <br /> If this type of video is set in the US, you certainly have a sense of humor. And simply because it comes from 'the other side', it creates itself the masterpiece, the most fun of the brain and / or the development of brain cells (George W. maybe maybe :). The war of the war of the winter, even the jokes. <br /> <br /> If, as ... as shown in the film - that's what the Soviet intellectuals thought of all these years, then maybe they had to face all the hardships that they claim to pass. BUT NO! because as many others, I read and look at the real-life manufacturer of well-known Soviet experts. For example, the most important thing is the dog, "White Bim Black Ear" - Gabriel Troyepolsky's book by Stanislav Rostotsky - is a real-life story. Real life, real, real sadness, real pride and honor, one of the best things in the Soviet world.
