Maybe the worst Dolph movie is always. There is nothing you want or wait here. Do not waste your time. Dolph is a painful and challenging game with no profitable life. Her brother is killed and the dolph is trying to figure out things. These are foolish and unnecessary stumbling blocks. It's worthless.
