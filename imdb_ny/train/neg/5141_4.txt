1914 was a wonderful year for Charlie Chaplin. It was his first year in films and was featured in over 30 films! Although many movies were not good, he gave him a chance to make progress. However, using the film, "Little Tramp" information was growing. Sure Charlie looked at the session, but her behavior did not have the taste and character she had made. Instead, Chaplin often beat, push or do something detestable to people because they seem to have no reason. <br /> <br /> For this movie, it's fun to watch. Although not today, Chaplin stars and Mabel Normand, Chester Conklin and Mack Swain - all the most famous stars and Keystone Films. The film's problem is that although they have only a few pictures, the plot seems to be unseen and improper. Chester and Mabel entered the fastest route (the most common thing in Keystone) - may have been near the race. Charlie and Mack appear and come in. Mack is chased by the police for doing this while Charlie is assaulting Chester around her boyfriend. Finally, because there is no valid reason, the police take Chester and Mack away - from Charlie and Mabel (who, oddly, are not visible by Charlie's character) <br /> <br /> Unless you become a great movie star or movie recorder, This is a memorable film that is the most important part of Chaplin's change. What he and his friends do on the stage, which is not uncommon for the Keystone film, is not really fun at seeing today.
