I liked the original. It was great and it will always be. Amazingly, I look forward to restoring. I often disagree because there's so much about them, but this makes me happy. I was excited at first. Caine has a tendency, normally, and Judah Law is oversight of her own. It was so smart as it was modern and it worked. What prevents this from being the best one is the last seven minutes. It goes completely out of the first, until now that's just become smart and disappointing. The end of the original was exciting! Such a fight was rebuilt and it was useless! This? It does not grow in confusion but sadly when it seems that they have decided to form Caine's homosexual behavior. It was like trying out to be different. And then ... BANG! The Law is dead. Additional Additions. The film is only a watchman for a show, but the last seven minutes invites you. What a shame ....
