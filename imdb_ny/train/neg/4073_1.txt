There is no shortage. <br /> <br /> I like scary movies, but this should be a very trying experiment. Call it "film" and spread it out. These "destructive-destructive-destructive-and-a-scary-trial-awesome-demonstration-uncompromising together together" are not worth watching. This is a fun look like some homework photography, and it has the kind of quality you can expect when you send your 10-year-old son to your new vid-cam, and tell him to make a movie. <br /> <br /> Dangerous.
