When most people say that they are "the worst film I've ever seen", they like to talk about almost every movie that they do not like. However, about 700 movies remember to see this one of the two that I left by feeling myself angry. This is what I'm watching for the first movie, by the way, and I'm enrolled with the IMDb just to enjoy the bad of the film. I went to see where he was in the shelter (I and my two friends were three out of five people), and 15 years later I do not remember much, but my opinion of leaving the show is still clear. <br /> <br /> --- Snap --- <br /> <br /> Oh, I'm starting to. The lost oils leave the altar, go to camp camp a week, meet the bombs they love, take him home to meet his family, all of them are one and that's the main way, trying their race and running away from a brother's friend, are always happy. Puke. At first, magags were so bad that it took me a moment to feel that they were trying to be FUNNY, and that's COMEDY. Benefits, with limited resources, seem to be 15 years later. The greatest disappearance was hokey and did not take action that it was unstable to look (he destroys the whole cannibal family and sleeping akes in the grass, which stands up Tom and Jerry style while driving). I'm sure there's more, more, but I do not want to see them again for refreshment.
