There's nothing new here. All romance-comedy pictures, even until the taxi is going to the airport to prevent a woman from flying. The only thing that can save this is the actions of Alison Eastwood and the rest of the kids (blink and miss Gabrielle Anwar), which was apparently a laughingstock. <br /> <br /> Turn it off when the couple are in happiness, and you will never have to go through the unknown pain.
