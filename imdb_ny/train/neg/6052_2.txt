Although it was wrong, I was enjoying "Cigarette Burns", the season of John Carpenter's Season One at Masters of Horror. Of course, the matter seemed to be cheaper in the middle of the ACM and 8MM, but it was very good for the budget and sometimes to be eliminated. With "Pro-Life", however, fewer budgets are difficult times the most obvious than anything else. There are strong guidelines as usual from the carpenter but there is also the quality of writing and making it completely that makes sense feel faster and fully complete. The script is smooth, the consistent message, and this article is full of holes that you look back on. Maybe the Carpenter wrote a post, it could have been a useful part. Rather, it is a disgrace that only carpenter carpenters help them to gain a little bit of entertainment. Of course, the worst carpenter has done it. 2/10
