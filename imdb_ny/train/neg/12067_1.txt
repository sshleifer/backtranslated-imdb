You know that the film will not be better when John Carradine describes (e.g. script & plot synopsis) on his / her funeral list, just five minutes in the film. This is his final character. It says that his property was divided between his four children and his employees. The children will divide $ 136 million in the same way, but if someone dies, this is the part of the remainder. If all children are to die then they are divided between employees. To qualify, they should stay in the family for a week. It sounds like a real show showdown. <br /> <br /> There is little about the Dean type. They are a strong and difficult family, but the real problem begins with the dog's suck. From the introductory voice by John Carradine hoping that this movie will lead them to the Machiavellian cat and mouse at the end. <br /> <br /> That trip is light and worthless. We spend a few minutes watching people living around, playing at home, throwing shoes, misuse "fishing," big shooting among silk dresses, constant arguments, wrong songs, amazing miracles that faux-remembering the world. events, the fascinating fears of the fourth group are a milestones of great success. All of this is guided by the end and the expectation. You will be happy to stay alive, but the pain can be too big for you to carry yourself. Divide children, share them. <br /> <br /> - There's also a Rehab
