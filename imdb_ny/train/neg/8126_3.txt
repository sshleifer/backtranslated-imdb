I did not think this was as dangerous as other people appear. It passes like one of the movies that spoil movies that can interfere with midnight when you can not sleep, though it is not a good quality. It's a matter of no success - I thought Marianne McAndrew as Cathy Beck, for example, found herself to be less concerned - but the worst thing was that several aspects of the plot did not make sense to me. The Becks is on a journey described by John (Stewart Moss) as a part of the work and part of a wedding that never existed (now it's love!) The workplace has to do with moving, unusual, swinging swords (being a part of a team of travelers through a joint venture but it is uncommon for us to find that it is a doctor who is looking for a medical (huh) relationship that lost me.) A thief, he begins to change and think I must be hybrid (although at last we see him look like a different person) and kill someone starts. Here is another problem. The first killer is a medical nurse. At first, everyone feels that his death is a danger. The second killer is for a little girl, who is described to be tearing her throat. Is the leader (Michael Pataki) telling us that his death was like a nurse (which means the neck is rising? - How can one think it's a danger?) And has a sheriff? She looks so beautiful until she appears at Cathy's hotel room when she gets drunk and then gets hurt, and then all things seem to be coming back. I have an end that left almost everything unchanged, and it's one of the most dangerous songs I ever heard in the movie. Even for all of this, there was something here that made me look. Occasionally dry thirst can make you an hour and a half. Beautiful, yes - but not as scary as some people say.
