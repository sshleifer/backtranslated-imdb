I'm the most popular of Lucio Fulci, but I have to say "Zombies 3" (1982), made up of two other princes, Bruno Mattei and Claudi Fragasso, were very sad. After comparing with what has already been mentioned, Fulci is "Zombies 2" ("Zombie Felsh Eaters"). In the year 1979, this is very frustrating. Of course, less than 4.5 is definitely not a good movie, but it comes from non-Italian Zombie, as well as the Italian cinematic films and few movie-based films, I love many movies that have benefited from very few . Additionally, most of my Italian friends scary seem to think of the film as a shaking, sad thing I would not agree with. Not that the movie was a whole accident. He has some redemptive features, above all that Fulci hates, which is always fun to display at Horror / Gore. The main theme of the film is not dead (although it originally originated) and I used to show the military violence. Sadly, this is the case. Although "Zombies 2" were very difficult, but more and more, this is not dangerous or dangerous, and a dangerous and dangerous time is the only reason to look at "Zombies 3". Sometimes the film becomes fun to look, but only, and if computers are not forced. Given that it was actually the year from Fulci, it was a relief relief from Mattei and Fragasso, who had once been part of a pornography (such as the "Porno Holocaust"), and the second of them was one of the most influential movies The most commonly formed, the most powerful "Troll 2" god. Damaged, this seems to be visible, but, from all the films in Fulcic that I've ever seen, this is a real challenge, and I've seen many of the filmmakers. I'm Fulk's fan, and I'll always be, but this is not exactly what he is magic. It would be fun for a year, but I would like to see some of this Fulci movie before!
