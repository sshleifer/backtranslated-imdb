When I get on the IMDb papers, I'm always fed when I see a "bad movie" always. When I saw the film *, I think I'm going to make my post! Opening names: adult, some kind of oily gas oven (yeah, look at fire = bullets = bigger movie enhancements!) <br /> Athletes: I think Ice T is a singer beautiful, even well-loved (sometimes, I criticize, "sometimes") but steven seagal like police who play with ... through words. All of this is ... I do not know where these people have hired but jeez !! I use my dog ​​to be better than they !! <br /> <br /> Craft: Running snake is not <br /> <br /> Following: The first picture of the film is explosion. I told myself, well, good !! There will be a good noise. I've died wrong. What's displayed on this film will be filled with low shots that are removed from the Air Force ... <br /> <br /> My dialogs are complex, music is white, the end is so happy (I mean I was happy at the end because the film data !! !) <br /> <br /> My cousin who was watching the film was happy (I'm 22, and 42 ... well). was about to take the film and burn it. Maybe the next time I'm looking at it ... (who ever said ???)
