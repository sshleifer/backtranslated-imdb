This is the second British Rank movie to convert Sommerset Maugham's stories to the film. Everything but a single quartet story does not go well in a timely fashion; and the game "was removed", such as the British pre-1950s. In 'Trio' looks like a tough and more aggressive movie than the first films. <br /> <br /> One of the problems in which the two films can not be overcome is that their books were written 25-30 years before the film. Hence, by the 1950's, Maughm's (who had not yet fought) said that "little behavior" seemed to be unfruitful, if it did not.
