As some have featured a film and tricky stuff for the ignorant or the masochists. <br /> <br /> We all know when we see trainspotting and an Asian house that Scotland is one of the most painful places in the first world. But unlike trainspotting and a home of acid without the amount of entertainment or real-life movies such as these do not work. And more important than the best movie can not work and nothing new, stimulating or frustrating about the film script. <br /> <br /> The fact that the film overcame several Bafta's depicts how bad Britain's movie is at this time. I thought that the Aussies industry was beautiful at this time, but unfortunately Britain's companies are very bad. <br /> <br /> Movies are so bad that I can not borrow from the weekend. </ B> <br /> Create yourself a grace and give you a movie this movie.
