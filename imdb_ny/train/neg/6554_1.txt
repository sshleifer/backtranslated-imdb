I can not give this movie the procedure, it is not appropriate. I just watched because I'm Copper. I love him and I look at everything he has made. Even in this case, he never stumbled. All the events with him in there, shows the visioner watching ... waiting ... for something to happen but nothing happened. It had good lines of news but it ended as soon as it started. Some of these things had consequences but nothing was made. <br /> <br /> Pfieffer was 29 when he made the film a very good one. The clothes and clothes were wonderful. <br /> <br /> I can watch a lot of movies and movie movies that I can not find anything else, but this was dud. I do not understand. <br /> <br /> The worst thing on all of this, had a big hanger at the end. It had the last picture that raised you up and said wow, this film finally goes to another place, then the roll. It's very sad. <br /> <br /> I agree with the comment that was said .99 can buy 3 cans of cats and my look at my cats can be very fun. Well said. In fact, that comment was more enjoyable than the film because it is a good one. I too have lost 99 cents on dud.dud.dud.
