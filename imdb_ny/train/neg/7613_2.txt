Diablo's small California town is experiencing a tragic death after Robert Lopez is well-acquainted with the ancient boxes. Legend claims that the Mexican Demonstration Army, Able FBI, Gil Vega, he is sent to investigate murder and harmonize with the sheriff's daughters, Dominique and Mary, to fight against evil spirits and bloodshed. "The Legend of Diablo" is all detestable. This film is not a scary thing that it does, it's sexually immoral and it's bad. film I liked. I'm a great critic of fear, for example, I like Torched, Live Feed, "Diseases" or "True", unfortunately "The Legend of Diablo".
