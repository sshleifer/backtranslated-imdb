Watching the Hulu (so much sale!) So it broke through driving but still, it was like looking at the worst movie of the 60ties. Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis where both sides play with Jerry Lewis. If I had been an Indian, I would have criticized the show of all men as animals and women as a tip. They seduced music videos in the west trade and used many western colors for men to touch. I really enjoy Indian movies, but this is very disappointing, especially on the Indian film. This article did not happen in India (uncle talks about Mac when he returns to India) but I can not find where it's supposed to happen.
