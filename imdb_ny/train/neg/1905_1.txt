I'm one of the great dancers of the same dance and maybe you read most of the Keaton Movies for IMDb than any other person. All the film that he has made since the beginning of his career until the 30th century has two distinct scenarios, so you can know that I'm very popular. That's why I've found that the story is painful and difficult to look at. I liked this person's movie and kept thinking "Buster, how can you do it!". Well, now I think of that, and I think I can see why Buster Keaton has taken part in the terrible events of TWILIGHT ZONE god. He lost his wealth after an unrestricted divorce in the early 1930's and his film as a guideman lasted a long time. Now, in the 1960's, Keaton wanted the money and liked his restoration and became self-centered to anyone who wished to pay - appearing in the Beach movies and this contributed to a series of major events. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem in the event is that it's a dangerous record and Buster is very important. The show should be fun but not for the worship of peaceful and painful movie shows - especially Keaton to put a stupid fool on a regular basis and for all painful pain. Create your own grace, LOVE ONE - that's the cold model of Keaton's work!
