When this movie was released, it launched a number of modern capsule reviews: Sphinx Stinks. It does, but in a sense of way. Casting is foolish, from the top: Frank Langella and Sir John Gielgud like the Egyptians? Not sufficient enough for Cairo for it, at least when the movie is being made. But instead of just watching them trying. The game runs from the stomach (painful, clear, clear) to the top, with the lowest interval. Lesley-Anne culture seems to have been unable to find Egypt on a map, with little explanation on her artificial treasure. This is fitting because of some of the wrong writings, one of the curses that will go on seeing every movie. It is my opinion that movies that define a curse or that come from a very short story, such as Egyptology, have begun to be worthless, extra. It does not hurt, and the conversion proves twice. The plot contains cars that cause many problems: How can this be achieved? The answer is, usually, YES. The scenes are beautiful, and the designs are very good, the only reminders that are not the least. The fact is that there are many familiar faces that apply to the non-quicker. Low cost, no; cheesy, yes.
