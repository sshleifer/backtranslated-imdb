Drew Barrymore has a young man named Holly Gooding, who comes in with the famous sportsman Patrick Highsmith (George Newbern) and confuses his life as "doppelganger," or bad twins, to kill him and his family. <br /> <br /> This scary film is hard to imagine, even though the filmmakers and photographers seem to be very dead. "Doppelganger" is confused, and it has an unpleasant language. <br /> <br /> Some people find that the name of Drew comes from the work of Audrey Hepburn in the "Tiffany Meal Food", and Newbern's name is a dramatic name by the famous historian Patricia Highsmith (he is trying to create " "tomorrow" as a scary film, believe or not!) <br /> <br /> I guess they deserve to be praised because it's not really your scary movie - I mean, the Avi Nesher leader / director appears to really care for his people, and gives his extra film than they can handle. <br /> <br /> After a stupid man-expressing everything-feeling arguments, the movie continues to have a terrible earthquake, which seems to be believed. The movie is not going on anymore. <br /> <br /> But no! Drew grants her mother into this. No, I do not laugh. Jaid Barrymore appears near the beginning to be brutally executed. <br /> <br /> Drew is always self-styled, and she becomes an adulteress. Newbern is like a lovely, "sweet" person. But a large piece of film should be with Sally Kellerman, a very good old man who is a specialist as an old man who created the phone sex (!!!!!!). <br /> <br /> The movie is really worthless but it's just a little funny. <br /> <br /> 4/10
