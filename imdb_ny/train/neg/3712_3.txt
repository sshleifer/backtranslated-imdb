When I first heard about "Down to Earth," I was so happy. I'm the most famous of Chris Rock, he was very fond of Dogma. But the film was very frustrating. Chris Rock did not work well as he did in the past, and the film is well-known. <br /> <br /> First, Chris Rock. They play the entire film as a time for computer displays. Obviously, this works well in the game where they should be standing, but throughout the movie, they do not. Even when speaking with a certain character, they seem to think they are trying to make many people laugh. They have few miraculous moments, but they actually come in exercise (no wonder they chose to make their culture more enjoyable). But the rest of them throwed, they're so beautiful to give another Rock to talk to, no one of them looks. <br /> <br /> Also, the film was not well spoken. The film has one jokes: an old man is acting as a black-colored teenager. Although I liked movies with a lot of humor, this would have worked, and it has been very fun. The problem was, we saw a very great Rock and was not enough for an old white man. It's supposed to be immoral because this saint is telling Chris Rock's jokes, but often, we just see Chris Rock, so it's not just fun. The countless pictures that they choose to show the white person speak as Rock, that's the one. If they were broadcast, the movie would have been a lot. All of this, sometimes laugh can not be effective, and not advised. This was very disappointing <br /> <br /> Measurement: 4/10
