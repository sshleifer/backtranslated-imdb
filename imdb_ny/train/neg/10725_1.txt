More information I do not like to say 'too' to answer some comments - it's true that the first 30 minutes of the movie is empty and 90-year-old singing. <br /> <br /> Restricted somewhere does not make the film look intently. Because it's not like the Hollywood device does not make it real. <br /> <br /> Very bad, including an unknown plot (except for many restaurants in Russia and many people, even older women, drink a lot of vodka) several shows are very detestable and go to my second Rolaids package. <br /> <br /> For oils - well, the film does not have any rows I could not write one if I tried it. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time or money, and do not interfere with this beautiful movie of Russia.
