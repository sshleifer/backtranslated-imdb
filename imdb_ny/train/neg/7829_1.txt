The 90th anniversary produced "quirky" and "off-beat" films, which are known for themselves, which are wild-law films. Other are "Wild In Heart", "From the Dusk Til Dawn", and up to "Natural Born Killers". Fine films such as "Highway 666", "Destiny Turn On The Radio," and this is a great challenge to "Under the Hula Moon". It's a game that gives light, it gets, but goes on to the point of disappointment. As moving around the desert and pushing Chris Penn with a good idea, the film is not polluted or enough to be a movie without violence, and it will not fit in the actual laughter being cassettes. I will not shoot the end, but let's just say it's bad. The film is really the bad effects of cancer cancer. These are the indie-mania drops.
