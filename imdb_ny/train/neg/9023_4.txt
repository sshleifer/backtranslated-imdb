I've looked for a song but I'm not fan fan die; and I do not read manga. I'm saying this because many who seem to be talking about this movie seem to have a reputation. I saw "St. John's Wort Wort," and although it was not discussed with any ideas, it made me get "Shinobi," especially because everyone seems to be interested. Well, I looked this afternoon, and I fought hard to look. Of course, it's very beautiful - drawings of water absorption, winter leaves on prices, even CGI looking eyes - magnitude. I loved rabbits, clothes, even weapons of war, but all of them were as hard as dirt. <br /> <br /> It seemed like someone took "Romeo and Juliet" - its interpretation also called astrologers - and they posted some "X-Men" at a good rate. Two of them divide the powers of Wolverine - a man wearing bear clothes had his pieces and a hairdresser had the power to heal himself. Then you have a girl who kisses - and Ivy Poison (from Batman). Why does she give these women the strength? A girl is showing her leg and kissing you to die. The man, it's a great force for you. And some girl, can make a worm out of this yellow dust that she's pushing on her hands. Another woman, one of the astrologers who passed the stars, has the power to think. Wow. <br /> <br /> I made the end of the film, running it fast, and I saw more trouble than I expected. Some people liken it to "Flying Daggers" and "Hero." Do not make that mistake. They can share the same end, but that's where the dating ends. "Shinobi" is made up of some games - some movies are made up of filmmakers. <br /> <br /> If I was 12 to 18 years of age, I would have to give up the film.
