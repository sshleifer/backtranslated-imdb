The first word "For All Mozart" is an IMDb shortage. The explanation is simple because there is no story, drawing, plot or anything that can remember at least one movie. Jean-Luc Godard is one of the most influential cinematographers and movie-makers, and the unwillingness of this movie is among his most spectacular films. I believe that even though he himself did not understand the matter; but there are some intelligent ones who go aside to comment or to express a negative movie, and it's fun to read their comments. My result is one. <br /> <br /> Head (Brazil): "No Semper Mozart" ("Mozart Osatha")
