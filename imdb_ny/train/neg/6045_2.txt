This is a wonderful idea gone wrong. The hidden definition in the drawings is left as signs of ordinary killer sounds strange, but executed in "Anamphony" slowly and without interest. There is no other way to explain the movie except the movie. The symptom of death is the only part of "Anamorph". Anything to unite is a problem. Willem Dafoe offers a reliable job as an investigator, but he has nothing to do with a script that has been expanded to the limit. Many assistant donors, including Peter Stormare, scholar James Rebhorn as police chief Paul Lazar as a medical researcher, and especially Deborah Harry, who are behind the DVD, still have two rows to speak through a broken door. Organized. - MERK
