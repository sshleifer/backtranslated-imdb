It was thrown out. <br /> <br /> This is one of the most frustrating movies I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> Usually Roger Ebert does not stop, but I feel like watching this movie. <br /> <br /> The only excitement is watching Elizabeth's banks in bra. This is a sad statement about the movie. It had a lot of promise, but it was like a humping transvestite dry. <br /> <br /> These are the only ones that are designed. <br /> <br /> I can not fully express my anger by being on the floor, waiting and warning you about the same disappointments.
