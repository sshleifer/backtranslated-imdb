I read the comments about this and did not wait for Ryan's favorite and waiting for a movie of something else. <br /> <br /> The film originates an extra part of history and how the bit started to develop. But then it's 1944 and you do not know where anyone is. Some of the texts are very poor when the Hawaiian / Asian American party is speaking, but everyone speaks to the poor to take Harvard English to imitate a Japanese man. <br /> <br /> I gave 3 to 10 movies as 10 minutes after I did not look at anything else. The authors were 1 part and although they were very concerned about real people I was not involved, and this left me neglected. It's a very poor TV movie program that will be displayed between midnight on rope rope. I would have to give up and look good to get better. <br /> <br /> This is a good news but it was worth it. You have the decision the elder saw a group of brothers and thought that it was enough to sell his movie. My advice, avoid and see a group of brothers, Tuskegee airmen, Glory or any other film if the trumpet ends ...
