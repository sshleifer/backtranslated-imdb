I think these are the films made repeatedly. Benicio Del Toro does not have to work for movie production, he has to explain in detail what he is doing and that is. Steven Soderbergh missed the whole point of view of the change, desires, and most important aspects of Che Guevara's life and so forth. Camera is horrible, like a person with 2 working days and shooting with them, music and ... I do not know .. is there any music in the movie ???? I do not recommend this to anyone else. I'm just thinking about 4 hours in front of the TV or anything .... I do not know how one can respond to this film than three stars. YOUNG PEOPLE ... DO NOT .... LOVE .... EASTERN Do not look for fertility. Save from this sadness of "movie"
