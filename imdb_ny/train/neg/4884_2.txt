The Criminally Insane 2 case is included on the new DVD of the Black Black / Criminally Insane, and it's a good thing, because when I see a film knowing something (especially something that is just as simple as this) I'm always interested. I now have a great deal of satisfaction and will never see this again. Facts about C2 are not true but CI's "cracks", and Ethel's pictures are asleep, remembering memory memory, and thinking. Prepared for the Preparation 13 is he released from the Napa State (surprisingly if he saw the The Cramps playing right there?) And he was sent to a small house with an elderly woman whom Ethel quickly picks up as a "ghost". All of this is displayed by a camera camera so the image and noise are unpleasant, and it is over even with several "rolls". Ethel does her thing, which is sending everyone between her and her food, especially the boy who testifies to his or her experience and salts it. In addition, you should be surprised by any murderer's house with a large table full of kitchen knives and a poisonous poison under the kitchen. Imagine that all of this is "wrong" trust. If you liked or do not like Criminally Insane, no way is there to have a good reason to view this except for interest. Someone wonders why these makers suffer. 2 out of 10.
