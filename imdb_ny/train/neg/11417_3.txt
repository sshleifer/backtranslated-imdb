The "El Elmo's Fire" youth who graduated from college at school seem to be able to deal with them at high school for at least four years at every popular university. Oftentimes, these children are unthankful, selfish, greedy and stupid, yet their writers and forerunner Joel Schumacher seem to be influencing them as modern-day stones. With a modern system that is similar to "Terms Of Endearment", and the writing that makes this line on us, "Fire" is very hot, one that is very embarrassing as the years pass. * 1/2 from ****
