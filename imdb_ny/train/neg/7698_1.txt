Can I give these benefits? No? Let me say that this is the worst film I've tried to look for. It was Worm. Boringus Maximus. A plot (?) Secured in several nebulisity categories. I borrowed the film with my friend and, about 30 years ago, it would be nice, we decided to "just walk" a little closer to see if things could be better. It will not be all right. The movie about some people who can be abducted by the two girls looks very appealing, but, of course, is less. There is no wonder even the only thing that ever happens. If you have the opportunity to view this, try it yourself, try "RESPONSIBLE FROM THEREFORE" instead.
