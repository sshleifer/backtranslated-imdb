Once I used Wesley Snipes's name as an overview and looking at the new movie, which did not disappear. So now, for the first time, my Snipes movie program has failed. For information. I should come here to see these comments. <br /> <br /> Snipes should be embarrassed to allow themselves to be destroyed. One of my most horrible fears is coming to a hard work, I was afraid that some movies, unchanged, untruths, "unnamed", would be guided and controlled (first I watched by Paul Greengrass, which was led as "Sunday Blood" ") could feature some films, the worst Greengass genre was deeply disturbed in the last two Bourne trilogy films, my fears had passed, my mind was made wrong with damaging, fragile, damaging mistakes to" help you. "But" Bourne Franchise, "as Greengrass lovingly refers to her cow, apparently believes some in Hollywood to lose weight, bigger ones. <br /> <br /> Read my lips, you Hollywood models. The work should be well illustrated and displayed. , not just damaged by the poor and lazy ways. <br /> <br /> And "The Manufacturer" goes on to get rid of it The "Bourne Ultimatum" method of infinite bite, hoping that their young ones (who are obviously) fail to recognize them. For example, if I hear the sound of the "Yankee-Romeo" radio one time, I just hear. Privilege and good will no longer be heard: I will never see "Uniform" <br /> <br /> I advise you to whom you have never seen "Workman": just be satisfied with the peace you need for your life. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10; I'm tempted to go down to 1.
