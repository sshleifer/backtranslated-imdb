The Revolt of the Zombies is not the worst film ever seen, but it's far away from the list. While travels to Cambodia to find out how to display the tournament after World War I, one of the members chose to use information on its bad desires. And they succeed, first. Three times it changes the matter. <br /> <br /> This was actually a tough film, which made it difficult to identify both who were both and who were not. The story was very good and the plot was impossible (not part of zombie but aspects related to "love"). And even though I'm not a student or filmmaker, the job of a dwarf does not really help the film. <br /> <br /> When I've seen some of the worst films, this is impossible to please everyone. That's bad, and not in that awful-that-good way.
