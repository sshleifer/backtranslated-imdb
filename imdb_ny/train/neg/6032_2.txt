I am a Christian who often believes in the theology taught at Left Behind. What's said, I think Left is one of the worst films I ever had. <br /> <br /> To have a good movie, you need to have the best movies. Left to the bottom left on this. One reason, it makes a very distinction from the book. Sometimes it is possible to write a 400-page book for two-hour films, but in this movie I've seen a consistent change. <br /> <br /> Another factor, there is a development of zero character. When the authors are saved (I can not say who), this book is obviously a long-term, life-seeking process. In the movie is quick and creative. The book was fully written where people like Rayford Steele, Buck Williams and Hattie Durham seem to be real, but in the event of the movie they are constantly given help without any delay. In some places where one behavior is irritated for abandonment ((I can not say who it is), it looks like worthless. <br /> <br /> I realize as a Christian I'm not sure I do not like this movie, but I can not have a brand new movie that I feel awful. Maybe it would be best to make the first book in 2-3 films, and in any way, Christians need to realize that to be a movie artist, we have to start recording the film in a good way, and realize that a lot of effort went into the Left Behind, but that's what I'm looking for.
