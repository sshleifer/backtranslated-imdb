Not surprisingly, why do people in the Pacific Islands think that they are a laughing people in Black America? regardless of their race? Well, this film will not give any answer to the question that is considered - but it will give a very good lesson. From the start of this film is like the "Old School" of the Pacific Island New Zealanders, which promptly raises the question as to what is important for this work. Am I suggesting the miraculous improvement of the Pacific Island New Zealanders? or is it intended to use this market? The matter is weak, humorous and unhappy, and the end awaits. The film did not take action in the New Zealand cinema, because it's just to love comedy love that has no reason.
