Please, even if you have a lot of trouble, do not show this. <br /> <br /> I do not think anything was good with the movie. At the representation of a friend I just looked and I really changed 1h and 48 minutes of my life under special circumstances. Poor people are doing, foolish advice, weakline storyline and part of sad thing - and when you successfully this together you get "Double Impact". Even the expectations have not yet happened. <br /> <br /> I guess I learned one thing - Do not look at Van Damme's thing. It's time to spend time!
