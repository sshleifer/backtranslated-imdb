I do not see how anyone who likes Van Damne would like this movie <br /> <br /> Movie really starts with a promise. I would say that the paintings at the beginning of the movie are very good. Events and family ward trying to save twins are a big start and they lead to a major issue. However, the film is a whole mountain from the bottom. <br /> <br /> It would be nice if the leader had a original start. These are the brothers who are born in different parts of the world and learn different skills. Another brother is supposed to have skills in the Martial Arts, but another brother needs to have a weapon skills. It is easy for a brother to miss a rifle, and a brother who has not been trained for this game suddenly suddenly disappears and rises. / plot <br /> plot, action, and so on are easy. My favorite cartoons? What about Van Damne's encounter with the AK-47 warrior? The soldier is about 100 feet [100 m] high. Instead of wanting and shooting at Van Damne crying for a shout if he is using a battlefield and runs for it. Van Damne picks up a bison from a fallen soldier and throws him, ... while he is still about 75 to 80 feet [75 to 80 m] away. <br /> <br /> The movie has a very sad end. Bolo Yeung is a professional expertise. However, instead of choreographing a good war. Bolo and throw a Van Damne store as Donkey Kong. The most foolish films that had a great deal. If your Van Damne is charging you, save your time and see more or more of the difficulties in one of his first movies.
