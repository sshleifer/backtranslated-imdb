Usually, they voted in China's most famous movie, Chinese-speaking Chinese filmmakers, originally, and, of course, do not find it. What I saw was one of the most remarkable melodramas that could be used, they are led repeatedly and responsibly, with the real power of the protagonist. Wei Wei (laughter) and cautious, married couple who have been harassed by her murderous husband (Yu Shi) for a few years ago. With WWII post, and they are living with a young man (Hongmei Zhang) in a confused home with no money (he was rich when he married). Among them will come my closest friend (Wei Li), who also loved to be his friend when he was young. She thinks she is leaving her husband and her husband, where a beautiful man remains confident, thinking he can go with her younger sister. That's the establishment, and it does not go anywhere you do not expect. I have been reviewing this policy, led by Blue Kite Zhuangzhuang Tian leader. It's about half an hour away, and it really is unhappy, and, but it was beautiful. This says it's very difficult.
