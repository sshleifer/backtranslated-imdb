I do not give more evidence to AIDS for the process but it is also interesting that people are demonstrating the events. At the beginning of the AIDS epidemic, the depression and the lack of fear and death make it extremely difficult. This was especially true in damaged politics and in San Francisco. The city, renowned for its beauty, did not appear to be even worse than the film. Darkness and damage are commonplace. <br /> <br /> When a plot and plot can not be said that the films are very different from culture and darker worry it is probably another part that saves the film completely. In fact, I found a fascinating job as an Irit Levi as a more common, Jewish policeman (?). It's fun, though it's not just visible. <br /> <br /> The main points: using this horrible Turandot film are spectacular and there is also a romantic rhythm, Ron Athey.
