Sadly, I know that Fa√übinder is still one of the German government officials after the war and many movies as "pieces," but when I see "Lili Marleen" in 2004, I wonder what everyone is far away from video! This is a horrible task - Hanna Schygulla sounds like a snap! - The change between the Nazis and the beauty and stupidity of the film seems to be made within two days of the upper room. Maybe that was exactly that way and many people seem to take it to "real talent," but for me this movie is bad and cheap. Compare this with the Viscontis "Cassuta degli Dei" and tell me "Lili Marleen" is a good movie ...
