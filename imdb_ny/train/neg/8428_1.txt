Although positive comments are a great deal, this is a scary movie. Very scary, I feel I have to warn you how bad it is. <br /> <br /> Movies are marked by the last time of Raj, during the time of Indian independence. The result in the plot is just filling with unbelief. What people do and how they do things do not make me feel that way. <br /> <br /> For example, should a young Hindu girl marry a girlfriend with her Englishman Master, knowing well that the seizures can mean to disturb culture and shame if it is not a death penalty? It's impossible, but maybe. However, does this same Hindu boy, who is in the India's downturn of that time, seem to be as long as Britney Spears gets burned up, having sex outside the day when it can be found at any time? This is not just blood transfusions, it's a forbidden scheme. <br /> <br /> These films including poor people are driving me away from the movie one hour in the movie, so I did not watch the second half of the movie. One can simply expect the end to be more intelligent than what I saw in the first half.
