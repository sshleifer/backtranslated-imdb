How sad it is - the very best, but the matter is weak, the plot runs and the result is solitary. There are so many errors that are still going on that are very contradictory with the early films, and Darth Vader is so shaking that what would be a modern-day movie now is a challenge to what will be scorned for many years. I will not complain about the issues that make it difficult, because this is Star Wars ... the first three films featured style, religious feeling and fighting stories, as well as a strange scenario. The results were too deep to make a lot of money, and the lack of love clearly shows. It's very sad.
