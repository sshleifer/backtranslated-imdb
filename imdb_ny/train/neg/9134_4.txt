I tried to love the app; I did really. I bought this first VHS movie and later on DVD. However, I did not enter this article because the two people are: "David" (Bruce Willis) and "Maddie" (Cybill Shepherd) seem to be loving each other, for one reason. I admit that it was a good communication platform, which was an important part of the TV program, and I appreciated more discussion. <br /> <br /> In short, this was like the '30s' and '40s' screwball movies with men and women. In controversy, criticism, shouting and shouting. Many people like such conflicts, but I hate them, so I did not even associate with the stars. <br /> <br /> With Allyce Beasley alone who acts as "Agnes," fun. It's so bad that she had such a little time. The pastor was beautiful and I think women would speak the same thing to Willis, but the argument between the couple took me away.
