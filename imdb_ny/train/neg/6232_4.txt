"Raw Force" is like a destructive system, with more Kung Fu weapons, monarchs with fraudulent weapons, white merchants, zombies, and more mature systems. No wonder the film was included in the "Free Box 20". They are used for damages that are browsing, incorporated into unseen and invisible articles. Morals are very poor and modern technology is a challenge, but the amount of violence and sex can not be explained. The film is open in the hottest so-called Warriors Island, where a criticism of a monastery group raises the dead for some reason but turns them into Kung Fu. They also buy beautiful slaves that look like women who look like women, because the mother's body gives extra energy to the zombie. The pilot, between their three men, LA LA police and all the nuclear forces, but the women who are not used, are shaken by Hitler's troops as they are preparing for the Warriors Island. Their boats clean up the island, and the monks criticize the survivors to test their war with their zombies. Well, how does it sound so that it does not break midnight midnight? I can not afford, because "Raw Force" has a piranhas, an eagle's boat, Cameron Mitchell has a humiliating position and leader of Camille Keaton's 70 columns ("Spitting on your grave"). There are many destructive things, including murder and violence, hammy jokes and bad romance. The video price of this video lets you be speechless. The worst monastery of the monks remains, naturally, unconditionally and is not punished even for their unexpected entertainment. Perhaps that's why the video leaves "Continuous", instead of "Ending". As far as it came, unless the IMD is too large it is impossible to write.
