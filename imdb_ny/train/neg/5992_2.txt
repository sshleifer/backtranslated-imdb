The most embarrassing time in this film is when Brady Corbet is called 'Sprout', near the end of the film. I died. I do not know exactly why the gamers put the line in it. Did they have to make love? Because that made me sick. All these were bad. <br /> <br /> I did not like the first Thunderbirds, but the Thunderbirds film had the opportunity to do more. Video is stealing. If it did not have a great drawing of the Thunderbirds sign, it'd be directly attached to the TV, or canned in a progressive project. Maybe even before. <br /> <br /> As I said, the best thing in the film is when the guides are climbing and playing Busted 'Thunderbirds' going on. I can not believe I've spent $ 7 and look at it through the salary.
