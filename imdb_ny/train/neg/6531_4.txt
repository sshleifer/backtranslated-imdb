First, I want to say that only a commentary left me with tears in front of me and laughing. One comment that the bad films of SF are is the best and best films. MST3000 made it possible for them to live on it. <br /> <br /> If you look at REDGRANET MAP like a malaria diabetes dream since 1959, you will have the problem on sucker. All things are: the doctrine of pseudoscience, sometimes clear, often hidden. The boy has sexually oriented ideas, and the "guitar" captain (well-ordered, boys!) Looks on the "buxom" science and red hair and wonders that it does not eliminate the rules of fire. Mars's deceptive behavior is the simplest world that everything is red, yet another wild beast has a mouse, and an eyewitness visitor has an ever-changing eye as a baby's toy. Enjoyable entertainment, a very wealthy student (!) Who seems to have not completed the 8th school in Brooklyn and has a mental disorder on his rifle. And of course, the only stranger is a bad evil. If the people met E.T., they would shoot him in two seconds being crushed! "OW" of course! <br /> <br /> Do not hurt me. I played the movie down. However, it can not be painful (except when scientists try to explain anything - just make it all very clear), and you should agree, in your little child, it makes you jump several times. Well, then do not admit. I think you were not ten.
