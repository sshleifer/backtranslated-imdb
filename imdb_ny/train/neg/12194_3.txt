The movie starts with a voice to tell the audience where they are, and who are the ones they are. And that's the time I started playing the movie. It's all free of charge on any of the films, and it is a simple and cheap way to express this situation in terms of everything. I believe that one word is displayed on the film form. I hate hearing from the word to see where we are, what a day we are, especially what the statements hear and think. I hope that the facilitator should find a way to express the ideas and ideas of the people mentioned to the audience. <br /> <br /> But after a bad start, the dramatic movie starts and goes over time. The lives of the middle family and all members are individually displayed properly. I think the leader has the ability to find real life. For example, a man who is supposed to call himself to the bathroom may seem unprecedented at first, but the same life leads to something that may seem strange and unusual. I think the facilitator is the most direct guide to real life <br /> <br /> But that's the case. After a while, the truth in films begins to offer sacrifices. I felt like I had a big heading because of not stopping talking. It's as though the actors and movies give them the story and they are allowed to change the conversation. It's real, but the authors always ask "real, and so forth" and so forth for each other, or the authors say "no" or "you listen to me," ten times I tell them just once makes me feel hurt. <br /> <br /> I also think playing and playing games are very important. I understand that games and books in the film have a profound effect on the plot, but I think that the facilitator does not have the idea of ​​refusing to display these pictures.
