It's a poor movie, but I have to give it to the director .... Francine Forbes. She seemed to be doing little and I thought she was pretty. Dangerous, she just appears in one movie in the database. In addition, the film has many years of disappointment and destructive events. People are bombed and shoot about 2 liters of blood! But, if you want to watch the disadvantaged movies, I'm doing it so much.
