Kirstie Alley, looking a little slowly, but a little bit, is in this mess with a man who is MacGuyver looking, white hair and all. The purpose of the movie is for an adult (50 !!!) who can not destroy her video because of prejudice for many years so she sends her little boy to act as a writer. Not the original idea but not the best film to have lousy doing, it's just talking about plot schemes. There is another plot against a writer who criticizes or disappoints Kirstie's character and therefore is included in the secret. A photographer who shows Kirstie's brother of precious value was tortured to care for his appearance. What would you say about this movie? Avoid that.
