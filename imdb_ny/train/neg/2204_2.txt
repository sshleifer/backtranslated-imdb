I like the shark. I'm changing. And the bombs. Fantasy, psychological, HAMMERHEAD: Shark Frenzy must have been a very successful film. <br /> <br /> No. <br /> <br /> The beast looks like a person from Power Rangers, and has almost one type of rubber movement. This would be good if the manufacturers were not happy with the design as they appear. This means that a boy who is in a bigger job / scifi / fear suit that can benefit from the secret, shark takes a very clear time. Of course, it is often difficult and unusual. I guess you should think it's too dangerous for even a camera to go. <br /> <br /> Camera goes to a person to eat, the camera goes to the shark. The camera goes back to someone to eat, but now it's screaming and not. And so on. Growing up is bad, decisive and poor, and special results are small, but writing is the worst thing. Sudden things happen so many people may eat, or something can burst. WHY I NEED, the filmmakers certainly entered into many bribes = to think better. People shoot cars and there is a big explosion. Shooting for modern aircraft, there is a big explosion. Pipes, rocks, trees, QUICKLY, all blossom, so much that the shark moves even in the end. <br /> <br /> Talking about what I do not care about how crazy a person is, I find it hard to believe that anyone might try to create a half-crab-shark sex with a woman to make freaky shark children with a good idea. This is, THIS man is a scientist in the film. <br /> <br /> The bad thing is, the movie is unusual (and sometimes, fun) that even its negative effects can not be long-lasting. It would be good for ST3K and your friends, but through that, if you caught this bad boy, make yourself and change the road.
