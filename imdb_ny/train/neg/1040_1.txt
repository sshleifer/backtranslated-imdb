I can not believe that the film was able to get a maximum of 6! We are very clear and extremely enjoyable, of course one of the worst films I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> In a non-budgeted way, it reminded me of Star Wars Episodes I and II that looks like you are seeing the damage to a damaged ship. <br /> <br /> This film must be provided for all reasons. It is one of the films that make people think they are "different", so they are good. <br /> <br /> Creating bad movies is not "different", and is making bad movies.
