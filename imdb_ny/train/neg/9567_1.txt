In the event of Assault on Prescient 13 in 2005, it happened with Lost Boys in 2008 and now with a few others from the 80's Wargames ... :( Why, oh, how about Hollywood can not learn? ... ... You can not fix ...! .... We all hate ...! <br /> <br /> Those who did not see the original 1983 and Matthew Broderick & Ally Sheedy, go sell / buy now .... !! The hardware may seem, the act the special ones are not new for a thousand years but are still holding on these hands .... <br /> For us who were in the 80's when shooting was easy, the internet was amazing and your disks came as 8 "floppy varieties, well we are now It's wise to avoid the film like Thermonuclear War! Before you've had a "chess game" as a good way ....
