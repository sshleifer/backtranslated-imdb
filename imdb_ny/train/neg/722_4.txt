One event reflects well on the "Woman Terminator" attitude: Karen Sheperd and a woman trying to escape from their camp. Karen runs near a protective soldier, who is chasing a gun, but after a few seconds, she gets rid of her and is bothering her for fighting. Karen is pushing her into balls, picking up the rifle and running! That's the second time, when a film is directed by a warrior and a writer / made by another relative, you know that you should not expect more. Karen Sheperd and Jerry Trimble face devastating disasters, and the film would be a great deal if they had to rely on their romantic love. But after 20 minutes it is separated, and the film reduces crawling, and even when it comes to certain events, it is unpleasant. The latter has begun to fight Qissi inside the cave and Sheperd to go to the wrestling against Ashley Hayden's beautiful locker window, but the controversy is in the middle of a path that breaks its outskirts and diminishes its value. For good reason, the area in the loose department gives Karen the opportunity to show disruption in the film! (* 1/2)
