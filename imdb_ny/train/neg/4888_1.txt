Nick Millard, Nick Phillips, must have left himself alone when he made a "Criminally Insane" 10 years before he produced a very degraded god of time and effort. The original "Criminally Insane" was less than an hour in length should let him know that he or she had burned this article in all that he wanted to get out of. But instead he could use TONS drawings from this beginning, even to restart the first debt! Unfortunately, the restoration of old age Priscilla Alden did not save this. The smallest of the first slides on this look like it looks like it's packed with a handy! If the movie cost more than $ 100 for a revival and wonder if it could make anything about that money! Avoid this and watch the original instead!
