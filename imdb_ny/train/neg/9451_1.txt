I've seen some bad things in my day. The half-half cow is trying to get out of the upper hips; head by hit between two cars; Thousands of horribles on the kitchen; people are becoming like animals. <br /> <br /> But I have never seen anything bad like Cat in Hat. This movie is worse than 911, worse than Hitler, worse than Vllad the Impaler, worse than people who place babies in microwaves. <br /> <br /> With the most difficult movie, always easy. <br /> <br /> I thought it was a joke, a lot of jokes and that Mike Myers was probably a cocaine drug that used to bet a bet or something else. <br /> <br /> I'm confused
