They represent a comedy-drama, an unpleasant thing, a quick look with Cher as a widow who gradually starts having friends is a man who has been used to kill her and her husband. Chazz Palminteri, as a rifle gunman, changed the drawing to his play, with futile discussions and conversations that quickly give ear and ear. Dark air is applied to the entire project, and the director of Paul Mazursky can not find Cher forever. Although all the talented talents (including Robert De Niro as one of the manufacturers), "Loyalty" are deceptive, worthless to the matter with people who are not countless. * 1/2 from ****
