Deathstalker is headed by John Watson and is the star Rick Hill, which is another type of physics and popularity of it, if I understand it better? The plot follows like Deathstalker (Hill) trying to restore something from the evil master, and he has to go to the Lord's cave. They meet many with the nations on their way, and the schedule is very close to Tolkien, and Conan and the Kinsman. This is Conan's most successful, and even though this is a very smart movie, it has a lot of good trash and is motivated by the film and movie film! <br /> <br /> No movies available for this movie. Most photographs are located near the sky and the horizon, but the deathstalker's imagination seems to be the female women and the great hills of Hill. Women are often treated harshly and very stupid, so they are often exposed to the film and can not please many women. Scenes of invisible beings are beautiful and beautiful, and animals are not unique. And all other parts of the film are sexually explicit and destructive, but what are you expecting of your budget? This is trying to be as big as Conan but it's very poor. As I have said, this can be fun for Turkish fans but nobody else. This is very dangerous. <br /> <br /> Deathstalker is still as bad as possible, and as a movie in Turkey, I appreciate this as some of the turkeys, really fun! If bad movies are your tea cup, try this and enjoy it, but if you do not understand "bad movies" and stay away. And if someone can not stand bigger, then stay away. There's more damage here than violence, and because of the drawings, this movie has a negative idea R. No, it can be a film of a PG family safe! <br /> <br /> 4/10
