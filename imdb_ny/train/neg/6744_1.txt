As you all know, JIGSAW did not make a way to Blackbuster because of a full-time member of Full Moon staff, Devin Hamilton. Devin is the one who sells the whole movie industry. He recently released the film, BLEED, who was selling Blackbuster immediately as JIGSAW. Guaranteed buyer Blackbuster not to take any JIGSAW, and twice the number of BLEED. The next is that JIGSAW looks like floating, and THE writing sounds like a hit. The main problem is that WARNING is one of the worst films, and as we all know, JIGSAW is gold. I urge all of you to go to a simple online web site and vote for the movie that JIGSAW has made, with all your abilities. Similarly, you need to go to JIGSAW's page and submit a higher rating (if you have never been). We need to find JIGSAW about 8 or 8.5, and up to 2 (so we can download online for over 100 films). Also, try to convince friends and relatives to do the same. Hope you're all doing well, - Matt
