Touching the epic Bollywood melodrama about a 10-year-old girl who discovers she has been adopted and is determined to find her biological mother. The great success of the film is the performance of P.S. Keerthana, who plays the girl. The first half of the movie is very good. There are also some very good songs, especially the number that presents the protagonist. Unfortunately, the second part of the film, which takes place in a war-torn Sri Lanka, seems to be a totally different and disappointing film. Explosions and special effects make the difference: Sri Lankan soldiers and rebels avoid grenades, flee fireballs and are pulled by waterfall cables. All that the film can offer as revelation is inexpensive platitudes such as "One day, peace will have to be established" and "Children may find a way". The final sequence, where the girl and the mother are together, is good, but the music and a well-planned downpour are so exciting that it is a fraud. I know, I know, everything is in Bollywood style. But it is a story where great moments simply divert from the simple and powerful central story. Bollywood could certainly use a little restraint at times, too.
