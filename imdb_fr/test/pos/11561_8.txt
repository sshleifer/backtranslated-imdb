Okay ... we are in 2005 and when you finally have time to watch this movie, you will probably exclaim that it is dated. But the scenario was daring, that the music industry of that time was so bold ... and it took a while for the music created by African Americans to be promoted to the same level as white acts. In some cases, it still is - but in the '70s, this film addressed part of the "context" that many people did not know. Now we have "American Idol" - "Pop Idol" and other elements of this type that allow us to think of "record executives" and how they think they should sell something that sells and not Talent. <br /> <When I was a kid, I loved Earth's Wind and Fire album "It's the way of the world", which contains some of their biggest hits: "Shining Star", "Reasons "," Yeanin ', Learnin' "and the title.

There are a lot of lessons to be learned from this, and a lot of trade. 'insiders' who has been exposed. <br /> <br /> If you can find this uncut ... it's worth a look.
