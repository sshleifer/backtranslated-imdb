Read This: <br /> <br /> BOYZ 'N THE HOOD IS A SCENE PER SCENE, A COMPLETE ARRIVAL OF THIS FILM. <br /> <br /> Two friends in the hood, one focused on intellectual pursuits and the other is an athlete. The sports friend is involved with the wrong people and is killed. (It turns out the athlete is Washington and it's "Welcome Back, Kotter.") <br /> <br /> It makes me crazy to see people do not know it. Every time I go to a video store, it amazes me. Boyz 'n the Hood is in the "Drama" section, while Cooley High is in "Comedy". It's an embarrassing shame. This film is both funnier and more dramatic than the scam of John Singleton. At least Singleton could have had the dignity to say that his film was a tribute to Cooley High, but no, he never said a word. Boys 2 Men, however, named his hit record from this movie.
