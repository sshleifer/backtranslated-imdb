This love story heated by the light (for Cassavetes) is pleasantly conveyed by two magnificent representations of Gena Rowlands and Seymour Cassell. Rowlands has never been as beautiful as a repressed and hurt 30s woman who meets her match in Seymour. Cassell is a powder keg of energy and romantic notions (in his words). <br /> <br /> There is an excellent secondary performance from Val Avery as Zelmo Swift and an unusual Timothy Carey (as always) that is worth the entry fee. Made between husbands and a woman under influence, this is Cass's most accessible film, which should touch anyone's heart (especially Cassavetes' enemies) who claim that his films are too long and sometimes extremely heavy. Made my Top Ten this year and not seen by enough people. An 8 out of 10.
