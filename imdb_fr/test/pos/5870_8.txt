It is a thoughtful film that exposes the inequalities of the upper class and those who work for them, the haves and the have-nots. Robert Shaw does a remarkable job as Steven, the obliging and correct driver, who helps Lady Franklin (Sarah Miles) overcome her mental depression early. However, Steven has a lot of mixed feelings about this lady of the upper class. He inevitably falls in love with her, which of course goes beyond the boundaries of society that separate them. <br /> <br /> I have not read anything before, I only judge the film as I saw it. I consider it a very honest story about the realities of everyday life and the conflict between what we might want or expect from life and what we get. This is a good drama that deserves to be reviewed.
