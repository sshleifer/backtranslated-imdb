Haggard: The Movie is the real story of Ryan Dunn and his girlfriend who cheated on him, also with the help of his two friends, 1. A skate boarder who lives for nothing, and 2. A trying to be a funny scientist (who does not really work) interpreted by Bam Margera and Brandom Dicamillo. <br /> <br /> The movie Haggard The Movie also contains many characters from Jackass, etc., but it was written by Bam Margera and Co., it's a very small attempt, it seems to me that this has was written when he was bored, or as a project with which they did not pay much attention. <br /> <br /> Movies too stars Bam's girlfriend Jennifer Rivell, who plays Glauren, Ryan's girlfriend who cheated her, is still very naughty about the role of Jennifer, another to interest some people, it's Steve aka Hellboy, interpreted by RakeYohn, to whom his character does not seem to be with the story, still bad actor, also this character does not really have many lines in this film which makes it fundamentally very boring. But worst of all, it's the character of Raab, his voice is like that of a smoker who has cancer of the throat. I also think it could have been improved! Overall, I think that the characters in this film are not part of the story, as in a scene, it would be on a particular character, a minute later, a different scene, a different character. <br /> <br /> To say that this is supposed to be a film, a kind of documentary, the characters do not play it like a documentary, the actors' game suggests that it is an inexpensive attempt to make a movie with your free time. <br /> <br /> Towards the middle of the film, we begin to lose focus on the main character Ryan Dunn, even though Bam and Brandon are receiving a lot of attention. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, this film is OK, if you make fun of everything. it's not very funny, stupid stunts, a dreadful acting and an occasional nude scene!, I also think there are too many scenes just not talking and just music! 7/10
