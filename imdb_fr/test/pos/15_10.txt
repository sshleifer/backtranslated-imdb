Like others who commented on the web ... I am a 130-man pilot in the Coast Guard. That being said, and being skeptical, I left waiting for the exaggerated factors of the cheese. There was cheese, but overall, not much ... and the movie was pretty accurate. <br /> <br /> I watched the trailer again today. After seeing the movie yesterday, I realized that the trailer gives the impression that the film is nothing less than a rescue after action scenes. This is not the case. <br /> <br /> The film is really more about the character / the story than about the action. The inner struggles that Costner and Kutcher face .. Kutcher is revealed further than the film is a film. <br /> <br /> Of course, there is a little love story ... unsurprisingly. But for the most part, the film tells the story of two lives that come together and, after a while, help each other heal old wounds. <br /> <br /> I try not to like him. Kutcher really works very well and compliments himself very well in the film. <br /> <br /> As critics have said, you've seen everything before. Top Gun, Officer and a gentleman, etc. But what movie has not been redone a million times. <br /> <br /> I only remember one word spoken and I do not really remember another language. <br /> <br /> The film lasts more than 2 hours, and for some, it may be a little long towards the end. <br /> <br /> You'll laugh, you can cry, but I can honestly say it was worth the $ 4 I paid. <br /> <br /> I hope you enjoy the movie.
