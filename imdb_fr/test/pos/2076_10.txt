Absolutely the most thoughtful, deepest spiritual and intense Hamlet ever made - no other version is close. Jacobi has the best understanding of the role of all the actors who played it. Patrick Stewart's Claudius is fierce and always friendly - I particularly like the two idiots playing Rosencranz and Guildenstern. Very impeccable and yet sinister. Some might complain about the need to have a strong Ophelia - she's not a strong person, that's the problem, and Lalla Ward has the appropriate nuances. Unbelievable. Simply amazing - each of the more than two dozen times I watched it.
