I found this epic of amazing beauty, striking, even heartbreaking. A kind of monumentality in beauty and decorative richness, a magnificent dramatic movement and dynamism. The choreography above is extremely enjoyable, the actors are really nice. I was a big fan of CROUCHING TIGER? too, but this one was even better. They have the ingenuity of Kitano to feast on what is nice. This beauty affirming adventure cinema is an act of courage. When was the suspense so exquisite and authentic? And the art of showing huge crowds, gigantic armies? The film has something deeply satisfying and a good unshakeable taste. There is a huge pleasure to make a show as deliberately impressive and clean. It's far beyond words. Few adventure movies, let alone epics, have provided me with such uninterrupted pleasure. <br /> <br /> A fan can be monumental. "It's not monumental art" but it's monumental fun, like Leone's movies, like some epics from the 60s; also like the trilogy of hobbits. It's big ?? fun size.
