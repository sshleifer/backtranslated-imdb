Campfire Tales (1997) <br /> <br /> An excellent work quietness. Everything in this movie is just perfect. <br /> <br /> The film has an excellent distribution as you can see on IMDb. The reason I brought the film was because of Christine Taylor and her love of horror movies. gives access to the main parts <br /> <br /> 1. there are 4 teenagers in this movie, after crashing their car, they decide to tell spooky stories 2. there are 3 stories and the plot main (the 4 teenagers are the main plot) 3. the best story is "people can lick too" In my opinion. Perhaps the least scary story is "honeymoon" or the second story (I can not remember the name "<br /> <br /> 4." He starts talking to a girl called Amanda and then enters In his house, this story will make you think twice before chatting with someone online, basically a guy comes into his house and things go awry. <br /> <br /> 5. The plot main is sweet and simple, teens crumble, tell stories, try to panic each other in this film, teens crush their car in another couple, but kids do not care whether the couple are doing well, they are just talking about the couple in which they crashed. <br /> <br /> The men and women who made this film did it to frighten people, not to win Unlike "Scream" and "I know what you did last summer", this movie is created to make you eur "Shout" and "I know what you did last summit er" were made to earn a lot of money. <br /> <br /> Even though this movie was not as publicly announced, it's still 10 times better than Scream and "I know what you did last summer". <br /> <br /> the characters in this movie are great and have realistic features. The cast that plays these characters is great. Christine Taylor does a fabulous job with Lauren, does not go beyond acting. The guy who plays Eric (Laurens' younger brother) is also doing a good job showing that teenage boys or men can be scared too. Screams is like a parody movie, the murderer is a joke and the kids are idiots <br /> <br /> Unlike Scream and "I know what you did last summer", this movie has realistic people, not a blunder. , should be more noticed.
