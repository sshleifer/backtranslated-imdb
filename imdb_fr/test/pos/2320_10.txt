Look, we noted that a 10 on the entertainment value. It's a comedy, not an epic like The Lord of the Rings, or Gone with the Wind. Still for comedy, especially these days, it's a 10. <br /> <br /> It's not a long movie, it moves quickly and easily. Kelsey Grammar is at home the role of casual but brilliant captain of a diesel submarine, opposing the US Nuclear Navy to a war game to determine if terrorists could put a nuclear bomb through our defenses. (a bit ironic this plot ... pre-911) Do not take this topic seriously, because it is mostly fun from start to finish. <br /> <br /> Rob Schneider is the 2nd commander (like "Frank Burns") and gets a lot of laughs. All others are perfect for their pieces. Rip Torn and Bruce Dern. <br /> <br /> Let's be clear, you have 90 minutes and you need to laugh or pick me up and you're not a prude or buy it (we did it) and enjoy! I wish they do a part 2!
