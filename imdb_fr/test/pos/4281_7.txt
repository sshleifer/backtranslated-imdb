I really liked this movie. <br /> <br /> Everyone has something to blame, everyone is real. No cardboard heroes or cold, omnipotent characters who know everything. <br /> <br /> I have read here many other spectators complaining about Anne's morality and James's willingness to maintain her love for her, even if she cheated on him, but I'm not Okay. <br /> <br /> I found Anne (Emily Watson) absolutely wonderful and I felt love for her. <br /> <br /> She was a very repressed woman; her actions were unplanned: once she freed herself, she was confused and made many mistakes. But in reality, when you win in freedom, you risk making mistakes (especially at the beginning). <br /> <br /> Was she a little too thankless? May be. But we must not forget that she runs with her feet for the first time. She knows that after all, James is a good man, maybe a little too stiff, serious and job-oriented; but she also feels the need to live life as herself. <br /> <br /> Should we blame her more than him? I think not. <br /> <br /> But the change that happens in their lives generates change. <br /> <br /> James instead of letting his wife out of his life (as other viewers have suggested as the right choice) bites the ball and waits, hoping for the best. He begins to understand that what he had superficially agreed (his marriage) was actually a game of control he played with his wife. <br /> <br /> This is not a story with characters that are too emotional and precarious. (ie the usual clich√© of jealous Latin American or Italian guys), it is a story of men and women who use both the heart and the brain. <br /> <br /> It can be very painful, but if you really like a person or man) and if you are not terribly unstable, you may forgive him for cheating and let go. Unless you are a jealous, prehistoric individual, prone to the crime of passion, possessive and mentally unstable. <br /> <br /> A very good movie. The last scene, when James - despite everything that has happened before - goes with Anne to the station is really moving: she is free and he understood what freedom means for a person. <br /> <br /> Guido
