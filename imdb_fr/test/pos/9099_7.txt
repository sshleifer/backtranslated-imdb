For those who loved "Wayne's World" ... "The Blues Brothers" ... and Hell, even "Raiders of the Lost Ark", you will find a lot to love (but probably not love) in "Tenacious D: The Pick of Destiny ", a fictional epic about the formation of the group JB (Jack Black) / KG (Kyle Gass). Two unemployed losers who love rock n'roll face a dilemma when KG's mother, with long-standing support, stops sending him rent checks; JB and KG create songs for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame after an employee of the Sage Music Store (inspired by Ben Stiller) tells them about the title selection (a fun animated tapestry sequence gives the background). On the way, our zeros meet a strangled-toothed stranger (a Tim Robbins game), Sasquatch, stoner security guards, sorority chicks, and Satan himself (an ironic cast Dave Grohl), in a sequence to be raw (and played preferably at high volume). I rarely see comedies in the theater, but "Pick" is an extremely pleasant change of pace ... it may not go up until eleven o'clock, but it hums a tune both raw and intelligent for 90 good minutes. And the songs are inspired brow laughter. Recommended. <br /> <br /> 6.5 out of 10
