This movie was amazing !!! I did not know the background, so I had to let it unfold before me on DVD. There was a lot of twists and turns but still kept the story fresh and exciting. The acting game by Elaine Cassidy was in a nutshell brilliant as well as Sally Hawkins. The plot is rich with plausible occurrences and fresh ideas of the present. <br /> <br /> There is really something in Ms. Cassidy's eyes that leaves "a mark". This film is a refreshing look at how we view the "Victorian era" and our vision of society. A very useful watch.
