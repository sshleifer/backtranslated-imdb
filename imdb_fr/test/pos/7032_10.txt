I watched this film for the first time last night and I enjoyed every aspect of it: the dance, the acting, the dialogue, the plot, the screenplay and all the atmosphere created by this movie . I highly recommend it. <br /> <br /> Jennifer Gray gives an absolutely stunning and first class performance in her role as Frances (Baby) Houseman. She has a natural skill and talent for dancing and she is beautiful and enchanting on the dance floor. But what's wonderful about Baby is that she has such a wonderful depth and dimension in her character. It's not just a film about dance, but the screenwriters also gave us the opportunity to see Baby handle the different emotions and feelings she feels throughout the film and allow us to better understand the evolution of his interaction with others at the camp. his life. Gray portrays her character with such realism and emotion that you feel deeply in love with Baby as she faces everything she does in this movie. <br /> <br /> Patrick Swayze is gorgeous in his role as Johnny and really manages to make his character come alive. He gives his character a complete personality, a powerful call and a great depth. The chemistry between Swayze and Gray is enchanting and powerful and contributes significantly to the success of this film. <br /> <br /> Cynthia Rhodes is terrific in her role as Penny and her portrait of the ordeal she experiences is really powerful and brings a scary dimension to the movie. The other members of the secondary distribution, Jerry Orbach and the late Mark Cantor, deserve special mention. They also perform wonderful and imaginative performances that give this film an extra dimension of quality and credibility that is wonderful to live. The dance is beautiful and first class from all participants. <br /> <br /> The script and the interaction between all the main characters intrigue and engage the viewer in a powerful way. The plot, though extremely predictable, receives more than enough life and vitality to make this movie a success. <br /> <br /> In addition, the wonderful selection of music contained in this film creates a truly magical atmosphere and a very nostalgic environment that enhances the quality and success of all scenes. <br /> <br /> `Dirty Dancing 'is a truly powerful, beautiful and very attractive movie that leaves you deeply touched and with a wonderful feeling in your heart and soul and an inspiration to dance. I highly recommend it
