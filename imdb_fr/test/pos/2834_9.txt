Gregory Peck and Gig Young are competing for the same girl and after Peck sent Young on a very dangerous mission, they hold him for reasons. Feeling guilty, Peck embarks on an almost impossible task: to defend a fort where he is outnumbered by the Indians. Peck chooses soldiers for this mission, which he regards as the foam of the earth, and the actors who play these soldiers, Ward Bond, Lon Chaney Jr., Neville Brand among others, are excellent. The script is based on a novel by Charles Marquis Warren, a specialist in Westerns, as a writer, director and producer. The idea of ​​using this type of man as hero has inspired many films, including "The Dirty Dozen", made in 1967.
