This show is composed of the best Australian comedies, because it makes fun of everything the public wants. Among the best assets of the series, let us quote the test of the advertising route which tests the real behavior of an advertisement. What's really great about this series is its originality and the fact that it has people (chasers) who like to do what they do and who would not. This show has a lot of pieces that can crack anyone like the road test I mentioned, Mr Ten Questions where he asks 10 questions very quickly in front of celebrities such as Hugh Jackman and the Beach Boy, temporary like The Emmys Chasers and those that have existed since the beginning, like What did we learn from this week's news? Overall, I note slim 98% show.
