What can I say? You only expect the best of the drama of the BBC and MESSIAH is no exception to the rule. <br /> <br /> MESSIAH is a great thriller, a really shocking and terrifying story about a serial killer who cuts the tongue of his victims and replaces them with silver spoons. Police officer Red Metcalfe (Ken Stott) and his team are tasked with solving the mystery of these seemingly random events before more lives are lost. <br /> <br /> But be warned, despite its rating of "15" (in the UK), MESSIAH is a horrible film. Some of the murder scenes are similar to those of SE7EN, and one or two people can be very agitated. But if you can resist that, sit back in your chair and enjoy ... even if you will probably be on the edge or hidden behind. <br /> <br /> Ranked '15' by the BBFC for moderate violence and strong horror.
