I really enjoyed this movie. It is rare to find a star who can convincingly draw the physical aspects of any film on the theme of sport / dance and do the work of a leading actor. In this film, you will find two stars at the height of the situation. The two women offer warm, touching and sometimes humorous performances. The film also touched on a number of topics, ranging from race issues to sexual identity. And yet, the approach was not heavy. Production values ​​were also excellent for a low-budget film. I saw it at the Philadelphia Gay & Lesbian film festival and went back to see it a second time. It was a real pleasure for the crowd. Everyone I talked to seemed to like this movie.
