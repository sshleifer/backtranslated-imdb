The main purpose of the film, IMO, is that Joanna's entire life was just a series of facades. The film begins with its gray roots that secretly die and hide the kit used in a tissue box. What is strange is that she hides this from her husband. If she has to hide trivial things from her loved one, you can bet she's hiding even bigger things from other people involved in her life. <br /> <br /> When Joanna accidentally hits Cory, she leaves to call the police. At the moment of his return, the police and the ambulance are already present, as well as members of his community who complained: "What kind of person strikes a child, then leaves it there?" Well respected in her community, she makes the decision to remain silent about what she did. But she never realized how difficult it would be to keep her facades ... <br /> <br /> Excellent film, I've seen it often!
