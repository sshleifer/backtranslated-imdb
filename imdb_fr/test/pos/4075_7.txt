I do not understand why so many people did not like this movie. Robert De Niro was at the top of his style, delivering his lines with such confidence that one must believe that it is his everyday behavior. Admittedly, the film seemed to follow many conventions of friends while trying to make fun of the concept, it goes without saying that this film was really funny. From the police dog to the fact that Eddie Murphy did not bother me, this movie is a real guardian. Ren√© Russo also perfectly balanced the rest of the cast, establishing his role so as not to harm the nascent relationship between De Niro and Murphy.
