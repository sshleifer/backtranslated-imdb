The main reason I liked this movie is because IM (formerly Immature) was there. They were in House Party 3 when they were 11, but they all grew up now! I was a little shocked by some of the things they were doing in the movie (almost ready to tear my hair), but I had to realize that they were no longer my little boys. I think Chris Stokes did a great job, considering it was his first film.
