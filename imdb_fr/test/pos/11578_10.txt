I saw 'The Sea Within' today and I liked it. The actors in the film are wonderful (especially Javier Bardem, of course), but I thought Belén Rueda would have a better role. Lola Dueñas, Clara Segura and especially Mabel Rivera perform very well. And I can not forget Celso Bugallo and Joan Dalmau (brother and father of the protagonist). <br /> <br /> There are two technical aspects that I really liked: the photograph of Aguirresarobe and the score of Amenábar himself. I liked the song "Negra sombra" by Luz Casal on a music by Carlos Núñez. <br /> <br /> In short, I think the Spanish Academy should choose "The Sea Within" in order to participate in the Oscars. I liked other Spanish productions, such as "Bad Education" by Almodóvar, but Amenábar's film is much better than them. "The Sea Within" deserves all the awards.
