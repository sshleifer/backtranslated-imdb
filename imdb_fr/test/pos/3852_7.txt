The plot in brief - Duchess (the voice of Eva Gabor) is the polite pussy of a single mother of three little kittens. When their owner, the wealthy elderly woman known as Mrs. Adelaide, realizes her time is running out, she decides to write her will, leaving everything she has to her cats, who will then go to her butler Edgar when cats die. Edgar surprises this and is deeply offended by the idea that the cats would get everything in front of him and plots to destroy the duchess and her kittens; he drops sleeping pills in their supper one night and then leaves them stranded in the French countryside. Apart from their element, Duchess and his kittens befriend a wandering cat named Thomas O'Malley (the voice of Phil Harris who made the voice of the big bear Balloo in the jungle book); after making a pass at the duchess's, not knowing that she is a single mother, O'Malley decides to take them home. Duchess truly falls for O'Malley as the usual family bond of the surrogate develops; chaos and chaos ensue, culminating in a violent clash between O'Malley, his brother, the street cats and Edgar. We also see British geese, South American hunting dogs (what they were doing in France is a conjecture), a mouse that looks a lot like the rabbit of "Alice In Wonderland" (it was actually expressed by the same Winnie the Pooh guy) and a horse. <br /> <br /> A Disney adventure sometimes slow but enjoyable. Features the memorable song "Everybody wants to be a cat" sung by the late Scatman Crothers (best known to fans of the 1980s as the voice of Jazz on Transformers). Of course, if that happened now, it would probably be a gloomy social comment about the division into classes represented by the cleavage between the well-fed and well-nourished duchess and O'Malley, born in the street.
