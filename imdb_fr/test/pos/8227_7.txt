Ronald Colman plays a prodigal son. Although he is NOT a bad guy, he is a bit shy and did not do much in his life except to travel the world and have a good time. Now that his last venture in Africa has failed, he returns home to England. His wealthy father of the upper class plans to throw it in his ear, though, thanks to Ronald's winning style, he is greeted reluctantly, with open arms. <br /> <br /> At this point, there are two women in her life- -showgirl Myrna Loy and the rich girl Loretta Young (who is already engaged). How will all this work and Ronald act and act like a responsible adult? These are the main themes of this nice little movie. <br /> <br /> This is not a good movie and certainly will not change your life, but it's certainly very entertaining and fun. Most of this is due to the always brilliant role of Ronald Colman. Heck, at the peak of his career in the 1930s, he could have played in REEFER MADNESS or another dreck, while making him entertaining and friendly thanks to his charming character. His seemingly effortless style in this film makes it very easy to love him and it's easy to understand why Loretta Young and Myrna Loy are in love with him in the movie! In addition, writing is very spiritual and makes it a beautiful romantic comedy.
