After studying Western history back when I was a university student, seeing the views of the Second World War is quite unpleasant and completely wrong. The Second World War was the most colorful and bloody affair in world history. Although the Axis Powers committed many crimes against humanity, which is still the case today and the large number of people forget that not all German soldiers were forced to exterminate the Jewish population that not all Japanese soldiers had either swung a samurai sword and had every Italian soldier was a fascist. Most of these Axis Powers were normal people like you and me caught in a terrible conflict and just fighting for a country they loved. <br /> <br /> The Battle of Stalingrad was arguably the deadliest of the battles. in the history of the world with more than 1,500,000 victims suffered during the battle. The film Stalingrad follows a German platoon and its leader, Lieutenant von Witzland, while they are reassigned on the eastern front to fight the Soviets in Stalingrad. Von Witzland plays the main character with two other men, Rollo and Fritzi. They are all normal men and seem completely unaware of what is happening in Germany and Poland. <br /> <br /> The film follows the course of the battle. The film is overall very dark with regard to the portrait of the fight and the life of a soldier during the battle. We are shown many horrible battles and intense violence outside of battles (including a sequence of firing squads). Overall, battles are the oldest examples I have ever seen that illustrate the loss of members and, overall, death and violence. Much of the inspiration for Saving Private Ryan's fight sequences seems to come from this movie. <br /> <br /> The film is not intended to make the German completely innocent of everything in it. Many senior army officers are described in the usual way, to which most people are accustomed, evil. Most soldiers are just normal people who often talk about home. The film shows quite quickly that not all Germans were responsible for what happened during the Holocaust, most of the country and the army were totally unaware of the fact that genocide had taken place. The film clearly shows that the soldiers of the German army were simply fighting for a cause they did not really understand and that they most simply wanted to go home rather than freeze at negative temperatures in Russia. <br /> <br /> The film really shows how infernal the war is, especially the Second World War. The battle scenes will shock you with its realism and the story is easy enough to follow as you simply follow a platoon during the battle. As in most war movies, do not expect much happiness after seeing it. This will leave you a little depressed at the sight of the life that most East Front soldiers have been facing. Not recommended for children. <br /> <br /> 4/5 stars
