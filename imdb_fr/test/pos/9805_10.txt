I rented the movie and I liked it so much that I bought it. Elijah Wood (Mikey) and Joseph Mazello (Bobby) are outstanding as two boys. Their new father-in-law physically abuses Bobby. Abuse is implicit, for the most part, invisible, and has generated a lot of passion in me to help abused children. The film has a magical quality to the extent that the boys' imagination helps them find a way to deal with abuse. You must try to understand the story from a child's point of view. I always think in the end. I watched the film 3 or 4 times and each time, I think of new possible meanings. I'm not sure what Richard Donner meant, but it's a great movie! Joseph Mazello and Elijah Wood will make you kiss your children.
