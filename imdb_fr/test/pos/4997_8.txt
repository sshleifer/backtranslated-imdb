There have been some harsh criticisms of Comanche Moon on IMDb. I think this is for three reasons. First, purists are disappointed that the mini-series does not look exactly like the book. Second, it's not as good as the original Lonesome Dove. Finally, people like to complain about IMDb and the biggest movies in the world will have bad comments. <br /> <br /> I would like to say that no movie will be as good as the book. It's like that. Lonesome Dove was not as good as the novel on which he was based. In addition, Lonesome Dove's film had left some things in suspense and changed. That's how it's going to be with a cinematic adaptation of anything. So it's a vain argument looking at Comanche Moon. <br /> <br /> I agree that it is not as good as the original dove. But hey, nothing is there. I know people who guide their lives through the lessons they learned from the dove. If I wanted to compare every book I read, the movie I watched and the television I watched by Lonesome Dove; I would be perpetually unhappy. <br /> <br /> This is a miniseries made for television based on a prequel to Lonesome Dave (the novel) and a sequel to Dead man's Walk, and that's what you get. It's the best TV I've seen in years. It's a fun installation for Lonesome Dove. We discover the history of the Rangers we know and love in Dove. Zahn does an amazing job recreating Gus McCrae. Elizabeth Banks and Linda Forenelli (sp?) Also do a great job creating characters that help fill the past of the rangers and the newt. <br /> <br /> If this happens again, I promise you'll enjoy it's more than a crumby reality show.
