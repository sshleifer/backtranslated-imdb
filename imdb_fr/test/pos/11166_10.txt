Great movie about a big man. Thomas Kretschmann is first rate as in all his other films. I would never have imagined it as Pope John Paul II That says a lot for the casting director. Why do they continue to appoint him as a German officer in the movies? And he came to universal attention after "the pianist"? Of course, he looks so hot in the uniforms. I know a lot of girls drool on her beautiful face. But this guy is a great actor and has such potential. If you do not believe me, go watch "Stalingrad". I hope he will get many great roles in the future with more diversity. Otherwise, what a heartbreaking waste of great talent.
