The best book of Edith Nesbitt has been adapted into a truly magnificent film, I love it. The film itself has a beautiful cinematography and a beautiful realization of the subject. The end is enough to have you in tears, as it is so beautifully done. Lionel has made some really great films, like Amazing Mr Blunden, but it's his best film as a director at a mile and a half. The costumes were absolutely delightful, in keeping with the beauty of the countryside, and the sparkling and faithfully faithful script helped things. However, it is the quality of the game that is the strength of this film, which is not shorter than unbelievable. Dinah Sheridan is quite sincere as a mother, an essential characteristic of the character, and Bernard Cribbins was hilarious as a benefit. In fact, I preferred Perks to the movies because it is not as funny in the book. The children were perfect. Gary Warren and Sally Thomsett both performed enthusiastically, but it was Jenny Agutter's enchanting portrait of Bobbie that impressed me the most. Another special mention is the wonderful music of Johnny Douglas, the title music reminded me of Charlie Smile of Charlie Chaplin. In conclusion, a fun and poignant masterpiece, better than the book, I think. 10/10. Bethany Cox.
