Suzy Delair, an extraordinarily adorable girl, plays the role of a statuary performer obsessed with theater success. Her husband and companion, played by Bernard Blier, is a man composed but jealous. When he discovers, in a less than preferable way, that his boisterous wife has scheduled an appointment with a lush old businessman in order to advance his career, he loses control and threatens murder. Now, at this point, I have to stop portraying the film because it slides on a mirror as thin as its twists, revelations, ambiguities and suspensions that would imply that it would endanger it. I'm not sure whether it's good or bad for this French police procedure coming from the song and dance community, although it's certainly interesting to know that what we've always known is who did not do it. We just do not know who did it. <br /> <br /> The story depends on how to follow the clues, where the ideal alibis fail and the carefully crafted fabrications and deceptions disintegrate. It is interesting to note that it is a suspenseful film that creates it despite the knowledge that one would think traditionally too early and too early. <br /> <br /> Quay of the Goldsmiths is the least dark of Henri-Georges Clouzot's films. It is far from being as sinister as the shocking Les Diaboliques, as tragic as the fascinating Wages of Fear or as sinister as The Raven. Perhaps it is due to the dynamism of the dance halls and stage sets of France of the 1940s, which are all part of the middle of this crime thriller. <br /> <br /> Clouzot understands and approves both his characters, even the most rotten ones where he has more than one vindictive series with his other films. Where he may well have understood the scheming women of the Diabolical or the truckers who sink on the verge of horrible death to escape from the miserable life in The Wages of Fear, there is not necessarily any support or agree on the part of the filmmaker, because it is characters who have clearly made the direct decisions that determine their destiny. All the characters in this more complex film have scenes and moments that are close to our hearts, even the cold and hard detective played by Louis Jouvet, who worries about his young adoptive son despite all the troubles and desperation that occur in his life at any time. with the drop of a hat. <br /> <br /> There's humor and flawless sexuality, the latter mostly from Delair, which neutralizes the pressure to a certain extent. Clouzot quietly practiced his profession, patient until he made his subsequent incessant films, in which he would leave no pardon for the tension.
