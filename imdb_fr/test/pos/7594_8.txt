There is worse way to spend an evening than watching this movie, although it is a bit predictable. Drew Barrymore does a very good job as an excluded nerd in this movie - a great casting choice. What I found a bit hard to believe is that the popular girls finally accept it - in my experience, this crowd has a longer memory than that, and know how much Drew's character was AWFUL (ostrich feathers?) At the beginning of the school year would have kept them for miles, whatever the rumors told by his brother. (And does "Kole Slaw Food" really make it so popular?) I doubt it.) In terms of encouraging Drew to make big money as a journalist - well, I would have hoped she would could have told a story well before the prom. A little artificial. That said, it's a piece of cute fluff that will be entertaining as long as you do not wait too long.
