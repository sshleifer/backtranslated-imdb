Previous commentators have noted the resemblance between this film and The Third Man, the film noir film by director Carol Reed starring Orson Welles and Joseph Cotten. This similarity almost immediately strikes the viewer. It is indeed very commendable to be compared to the award-winning cinematography of the Robert Krasker Academy in The Third Man. <br /> <br /> The stolen identity plot has also been described quite accurately, but in rather ordinary terms. I found it very creative and entertaining. As common as the "Identity erroneous or stolen" device is in the theater and cinema, it is only a device and should not be confused with the plot itself. Therefore, although the viewer may have seen this device "a thousand" times, the stolen identity plot is full of surprises and twists based on this device. These are the unexpected turns that make this film much cooler, more original and more captivating than a plot synopsis. Stolen Identity does not rely on the kind of suspense that characterizes most black films because there is no real mystery here. Instead, it relies on constant little surprises. In short, the wrong identity device is quite common; but this plot is not. <br /> <br /> Finally, even if I was not familiar with the cast, I found the game players uniformly good, sometimes exceptional. I could easily have imagined that other actors were transforming this film into melodrama, with exaggerated, exaggerated gestures, and obvious facial expressions. The acting is always more subtle and subtle. Donald Buka is particularly sober and credible. He never "bluffs his blanket" with an obvious facial expression, as we see all too often in films that depend on maintaining the subterfuge to maintain a dramatic tension. <br /> <br /> The only disappointment of this film, if not excellent, was the very weak development of the sub-story of love story. In the current state of things, this seems to be an afterthought - a slight surprise, in fact - followed to the end. Or maybe during their common trial, the actors simply could not convey a palpable level of chemistry that I could appreciate. This sub-plot should have been made more apparent as the story unfolded. All in all, I thought this movie was a gem, and I wondered why I had not seen it before. Try, you will like it.
