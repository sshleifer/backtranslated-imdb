No wonder Larisa Shepitko married Elem Klimov, who will later lead the most heartbreaking war movie of all time, "Come and see (1985)". 'The ascent (1977)' ?? Shepikto's latest film is finished before an untimely death ?? is built in the same mold. This film, which takes place during the Second World War, follows two Soviet partisans who try to provide food for their starving army while avoiding the German occupying forces. The first forty minutes are terribly tense, as the two men drag themselves in a snowy and hard landscape, the world around them is completely sapped from life, heat and colors long to realize that the film was shot in black and white). <br /> <br /> After the capture of supporters by German soldiers, the film becomes a cold meditation on loyalty and morality. While Sotnikov (Boris Plotnikov) refuses to betray his army, even under extreme pressure, Ryback (Vladimir Gostyukhin), less resolute, tries to flee. Is he wrong to do it? Ryback's betrayal is discouraging, but the film does not immediately condemn his acts as treacherous. instead, the viewer is forced to think about what his or her own response might be in such a situation. Shepitko has pity on Ryback and the Bible has pity on Judas. The two men betrayed their allies to the enemy and were forced to watch them perform. However, while Judas committed suicide by hanging (at least according to Matthew's gospel), Ryback even found that this option was closed to him? in an extremely tight climax, the belt around his neck comes off. <br /> <br /> "The ascent" draws its emotional power from Shepitko's astonishing quest for realism. I do not doubt that the two main actors have spent whole days crossing snow-covered ground on their knees, and, in fact, their misery is so convincing that I caught a cold while watching the film (seriously, ). It is interesting to note that the film interposes itself several times on this reality, while Ryback imagines making an offer for freedom, then being shot by his German captors. This device, although unusual, works well with its biblical allegory; Ryback is confronted with a test of his worth and, faced with a new dilemma at every turn, he systematically chooses the selfish alternative, his own life as the only decisive criterion. At the end of the film, he is still alive, but the nightmare of war and guilt persists.
