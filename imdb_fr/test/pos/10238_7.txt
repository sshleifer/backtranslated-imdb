What's fun with Barker's Nightbreed is that it's the story of a rampaging human being, a deadly threat to monsters around the world. In this one, the monsters (the night race of the title) are the "good" guys. He shares his feeling of celebrating the different, the twisted and the black with the first film of the Addams family and much of Tim Burton's work. It also contains the goriness that is expected of a piece of Barker. <br /> <br /> Cronenberg's performance is particularly amusing, as a true human doctor dedicated to the destruction of the Nightbreed. As in most classic monster movies, villagers surround the castle with monsters of torches and pitchforks. Only this time, the modern decor replaces the castle with an old mausoleum and rustic "weapons" with rifles and bombs. And this time, the sympathy you felt when you saw Frankenstein's monster burned in the windmill is the very center of the film. <br /> <br /> This is not a masterpiece, and even Barker has made it more interesting and certainly more. to relax, to work. But it's pure pleasure, it looks great, and it's light without making fun of itself. It's worth checking out!
