The two new OSS 117 movies have a kind of humor that is both intelligent and stupid, which I find extremely amusing. It really reminds me of the classic Pink Panther movies with a man almost as good as Peter Sellers in Jean Dujardin. And unlike Steve Martin, who completely destroys Clouseau, Dujardin is rather brilliant. <br /> <br /> The comments about the anti-Semitism of the movies clearly show a total lack of humor and understanding. <br /> <br /> Whether you like or hate this movie, it really depends on your humor. I can not wait for the sequel!
