Out of any category, it is a crazy film and exceeding the limits, even in the current standards. Filmed entirely in crap-o-rama, this movie will amaze you (and more!) <br /> <br /> The amount of hilarious bad taste and sleaze is amazing. The dialogue is breathtakingly fast and campy. You will like or dislike this movie, but let it go. I have seen it 4 times and I love it. Divine is looking for the dirtiest person, but her rivals are also in this obscene and disgusting (but funny) and elegant movie. <br /> <br /> Divine was phenomenal, and "she" will always be missed. Edith Massey interprets this unforgettable performance under the title "egglady" and do not forget the energetic stole Mink! <br /> <br /> Ãœber crazy s ** t! <br /> <br /> Also recommended for sick little puppies; <br /> <br /> Female problem <br /> <br /> A desperate life <br /> <br /> Polyester
