This film is a very beautiful and slow film. There is nothing Hollywood about it. It's very Danish and the characters are very real. This is the first Danish film to tackle this transsexual theme. It's really love that has no sex. I would not say it's lesbian love, even though the two main characters (tranny Veronika and Charlotte) are attracted to each other. It's a story of love and life. <br /> <br /> The story unfolds pretty much in both apartments. There is almost no background music, which makes it more real and more intense. The two actors who play the main characters are awesome. They make them really real. These are not archetypes, but real people you might meet on the street. I think this is the first time I see a transsexual portray that as well. Very well done.
