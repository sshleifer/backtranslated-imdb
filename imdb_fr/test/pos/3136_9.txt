This small image succeeds where many large images fail. Because it was a small picture, John Ford was not harassed by the studio's big wigs. He was happier with this movie than any other because he was able to do it his way. He was also able to use his repertoire of talented characters actors who had played such an important role in his past successes. Some of them, such as Ben Johnson, were discovered by Ford and were highlighted. Johnson was recruited by Ford because he was a genuine cowboy from Oklahoma who usually did his own stunt work. Years later, he won the coveted Academy Award for his brilliant performance in "The Last Picture Show". Ward Bond surpasses even Ben Johnson in this movie. He is not the master of carts, this role is played by Johnson, but because of this film, he later received the role of trolley master in the classic television series "Wagon Train". Ironically, one of the Wagon Master villains, James Arness, would be the star of the hit television show "Gunsmoke" on a competing Wagon Train network. Ward Bond plays the Mormon leader who heads west and often returns to his devious days swearing only to be summoned by fellow Mormon Adam Perkins (Russell Simpson). When an awkward situation arises, Brother Wiggs (Ward Bond) shouts: "Ring the horn, Sister Ledeyard!" The Mormon sister, played to perfection by Jane Darwell, blows so loudly and loudly that even the devil must have been shaken by the sound. Darwell and Simpson were famous for playing Ma and Pa Joad in the classic version of John Steinbeck's novel "Grapes of Wrath". <br /> <br /> Hank Worden, who also plays one of the great actors One of Uncle Shiloh Clegg's sons is notoriously mean but not too brilliant outlaw. Worden will become famous a few years later for playing Mose in Ford's "The Searchers". Worden lived to 91 years. When he died, he was still shooting movies. <br /> <br /> Travis Blue Master (Ben Johnson) and his partner Sandy (Harry Carey Jr.) are horse traders who never take their jobs. seriously, having fun a lot, especially with the local sheriff. They find themselves mingled with a train of Mormon cars heading west. The Monument Valley, beloved Ford, is the scene of most of the film. The main reason for this association is a red-haired beauty, Prudence Perkins (Kathleen O'Malley), a red-haired beauty who catches Sandy's attention. Along the way, the train goes to a Hoochie Coochie class show, which includes a charlatan doctor (Alan Mowbray) and two dirty angels (Joanne Dru and Ruth Clifford). The Clegg family is also wanted for murder and armed robbery. Ford shows how difficult it was to make a wagon trip west at that time. <br /> <br /> The songs of the film were written by Stan Jones of the legendary Sons of the Pioneers. Jones's writing was almost as good as that of Bob Nolan, who had already written a lot for the group. Jones' most famous song, not featured in this film, is "Ghost Riders In The Sky", a highly recorded movie. The Pioneer Sons sing in "Wagon Master". This adds to the overall impact of the wagons traveling west. <br /> <br /> It should also be noted that the famous Native American athlete Jim Thorpe from Oklahoma plays the role of a Navajo leader. It was his last appearance in a movie. He died shortly after the release of "Wagon Master".
