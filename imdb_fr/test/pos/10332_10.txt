This film is a study piece for my English class, but its depth and meaning amaze me. Since we take a close look at all the facts and characters in this film, it's an interesting tale of love, hatred, war and prejudice. Well recommended! <br /> <br /> History: A wealthy Jewish girl named Patty Bergen meets an escaped prisoner of war. She then hides it in her theater house located in its huge gardens. they begin to see the qualities of others and earn love to each other. Patty's father despises her and treats her like dirt. Anton (the prisoner of war) almost blows his blanket to protect her, but Patty manages to stop him before he is seen by anyone.
