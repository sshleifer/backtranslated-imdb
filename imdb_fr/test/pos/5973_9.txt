I agree with another critic, it's such a shocking film that it will be hard to see again soon, although for the only quality, it deserves to be viewed several times. The complexity of the characters, the incredible cinematography and the superb direction make this film worthy of the price of emotion. <br /> <br /> The two partisans dragging themselves in the snow to escape a patrol are perhaps, by pure physics, the most amazing performance I have ever seen. In fact, although not episodic - the story runs - it's a film of memorable scenes. There is the distribution of rations among the partisans, the scenes of snow, the scenes of farm in ruins, the meetings in the houses, the interrogations, the scene of the "basement", the "rise". All stand out like jewels in a necklace. <br /> <br /> For me, religiosity is not obvious. Frankly, I do not think it would have been allowed in a Soviet movie. I see this as an existential parable about the value of life. Here is a story where the hero - and he is a true hero - becomes the villain, and the weaker becomes the stronger. Is it a mystical process or dictated by the circumstances? There is a transfiguration, but does it come from within or from outside? You have to see the film to understand the issues, because they can not be discussed without telling the story. I can not say enough about acting. It's hard for me to choose which track is the most touching. I do not know the Soviet film of the 70s and I do not know any of the actors, but they are all superb. I also note how director Larisa Shepitko uses children. They remind me of Giotto's angels. <br /> <br /> In the end, there is a bit of confusion. There appears to have been an earlier relationship between Private Sotnikov and interrogator Portnov, but it has remained pending. And the final scene is a bit ambiguous. But compared to total experience, these are problems. It's a movie that will mark you for life.
