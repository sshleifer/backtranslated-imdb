THE LATE SHIFT was an interesting movie for HBO that looked in detail at David Letterman's relationship with Jay Leno when Johnny Carson announced his retirement and wanted to replace him. This fight is now part of Hollywood folklore, but for those who do not know history and who know where Letterman is, it might be interesting to hear that David Letterman wanted to replace Johnny Carson as THE TONIGHT SHOW's host. . Nothing in the world, but Letterman found his dreams disappointing while frequent guest host Leno had with him one of Hollywood's most powerful agents, Helen Kushnick, who worked tirelessly to get the job done. his client. It's rare for us to see behind the scenes the Hollywood machinations recreated for entertainment purposes, but for the fans of these two nightly superstars, this film provided a fascinating look at a very hectic time of night television. According to this film, Carson himself had practically promised Letterman the job, while NBC had promised it to Leno and that's where Helen Kushnick came on the scene. The film presents Leno as a sort of milquetoast that allowed Kushnick to manipulate his career and simulate it. Ignorance of some of Helen's harsh handling of some of NBC's biggest players and presents Letterman as this smart and savvy businessman who, despite Carson's support, was guided by NBC and Kushnick. John Michael Higgins and Daniel Roebuck credibly recreate Letterman and Leno, respectively, but it's the sheer performance of Oscar winner Kathy Bates in the role of Helen Kushnick that makes the film go wild. Bates controls the screen in one of his best performances, if not less known, than that of the venomous Hollywood agent, who eats the lunches of television studio executives. The impressionist Rich Little also plays Johnny Carson, but it's mostly a fascinating story and Bates' impressive performance makes it an interesting film.
