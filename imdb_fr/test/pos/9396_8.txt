I'm not sure what I can add but it has not already been said in some of these other very fine and hilarious remarks, but I will try. <br /> <br /> So you know the plot: there is a bed possessed by a demon that "absorbs" and selectively disintegrates anyone's body (or other) rests on it with its orange body filled with soda. In some scenes, the man strangely resembling Robert Smith of The Cure, trailing inside the wall commenting on the news, and we have our various victims who just can not resist the comfort of this mystic bed. <br /> <br /> This is not an ordinary bed. No sir, Bob! Not only does he eat people, but he cleans himself, brings back the blankets and even makes himself. Who would not want a bed like that? He can even use his leaves as a rudimentary "lasso" to pin the victims who have escaped (especially if they take half the length of the movie to try to escape). <br /> <br /> Our "main" The story (if you can call it that), about these three girls who go out in this remote area to sit (??). I do not remember exactly, but it does not really matter because there are a lot of things that challenge convention that you just have to give up and accept. The dialogue in the film is unlike any other; the characters apparently speak telepathically, their mouths never seem to move and there is a constant echo. One of our girls thinks she is not appreciated by the rest of the "gang" and makes sure to tell us all her feelings about it through a voiceover, but we do not care. The development of the character was thrown out the window a very long time ago in this movie so why start now? There are scenes in which the bed laughs, snores, crackles, and makes various other noises that we suppose, judging by the non-reaction of our distribution to these noises, can not be heard. This and telepathy make the question of diegesis very difficult to determine ... but it's OK ... it's Death Bed: The bed that eats and it defies all logic, so it's OK. If you buy this very weird DVD, if you buy what he bought, say "buy"? Be sure to watch the director's introduction. He explains that the shooting of this "film" began in 1972 and did not end before 1977, he bought it for a few years without success, then 26 years later, in 2003, he released on DVD. Supposedly, somewhere, somewhere, had printed a copy in another country and made it illegal, and it was quite by chance, on a bulletin board, that our director found evidence that the people knew about it and gasped! cared about his little-known film. It was from there that he decided to try and release him. I'm glad he did it. Once you have even heard the title of this movie, you MUST see it. For my part, I will buy it and I will preach its gospel around the world ... starting with this comment
