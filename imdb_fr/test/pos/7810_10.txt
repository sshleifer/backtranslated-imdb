There have been very few great comedy films in the history of Hindi cinema. Andaz Apna Apna happens to be one of them. The film is based on a very simple story of two poor young men (Aamir and Salman) who dream of becoming rich by marrying the daughter of a millionaire (Raveena). Aamir and Salman Khan do their best to outdo and courter Raveena. The plot is complicated when Paresh Rawal & Co. plans to take back all the wealth. The film is well paced and very funny. We rarely meet a comedy in Hindi both funny and intelligent. This is one of the few movies with Aamir and Salman together (probably the only movie!). Unfortunately, this did not happen at the box office and we may never see a movie of this caliber again. Aamir Khan is brilliant in the film and has proven his versatility as an actor in this film. Salman Khan gives a very good performance as a weak-minded person. Raveena plays a convincing role as a confused rich girl, and Karishma who is Raveena's assistant / friend is also funny. Paresh Rawal, Junior Ajith, Kapoor Shakti, Deven Verma, Jagdeep and Tiku Talsania only add to the flavor of the film! All in all, the best Hindi comedy of all time and I hope they produce more quality movies like this one. You will want to watch this movie over and over again. <br /> <br /> PS - For those of you who have watched this film, I also suggest Gol Maal, Chupke Chupke, Chhoti Si Baat, Naram Garam, Hera Pheri (old and new), etc.
