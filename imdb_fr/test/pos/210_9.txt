The story told by The Cranes are Flying is certainly not entirely original. Young lovers are separated by war; bad things happen to both. We have seen it many times before. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, we have not seen filming so well, with bold plans that take liberties to emphasize separation, destruction or despair. It is all the more remarkable to come from the Soviet Union and conclude that Tarkovsky is not the last word of the Soviet cinema of the modern era. <br /> <br /> I was reading Chekhov's "Three Sisters" the other day and what the meaning of the film's title might be. In Act 2, Masha objects to the notion that we must live our lives without meaning or understanding: <br /> <br /> "MASHA: Mankind must surely believe in something, or at least seek the truth, if not, life is just empty, emptiness, living and not knowing why cranes are flying, why children are born, why there are stars in the sky, either you have to know why you live, or everything is trivial - a pure, useless nonsense. "Similarly, Veronika finds it hard to believe that the war, as well as the sufferings of herself and others, have been in vain. It is better to attribute meaning, to live as if one's life were meaningful, and not to give in to despair. Perhaps this thought drives her to her last act in the film. <br /> <br /> BTW only made a minor correction to another comment - there may be a V pattern in the movie, even though I did not notice them myself even. But the first letter of Veronika's name is not another example. in the Cyrillic alphabet, his name begins with a letter that looks like a "B" in English.
