A very nice screen version of Rona Jaffe's best-selling popular boiler on the trials and tribulations (and of course the loves) of a group of women involved in one way or another in the New York edition . Directed by Jean Negulesco, fresh from the success of "Three Coins in a Fountain" and the prototype of "Sex and the City", except that the sex takes place off-screen. <br /> <The brilliant young female talents of the day (Hope Lange, Diane Baker, Suzy Parker, Martha Hyer) are all nicely screened while Joan Crawford appears as a slutty queen of an editor who could possibly eat the Miranda Priestly's Meryl Streep and spit her out without any effort, she steals the movie. Stephen Boyd, Louis Jourdan (if it was not Rossano Brazzi, it was Louis Jourdan), Robert Evans (before deciding wisely to go behind the camera) and Brian Aherne. There is more hot water on sale than in your average laundry, but if, like me, you like "Desperate Housewives", not to mention Carrie Bradshaw and his company, you will probably like it. A very guilty pleasure.
