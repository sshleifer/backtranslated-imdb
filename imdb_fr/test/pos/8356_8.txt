Where do I start? Walt Disney's most successful film, "Lady and the Tramp", is one of my favorite films, if not perhaps, in the theatrical canon of Disney animation. The rest, however, is ... to say the least, nice. I had fun all along the movie. It was (flame shield!) Adorable! The Broadway style of songs and the kind of movie worked, and I hummed the songs for the rest of the night. I can, if you ask me, continue to sing all the songs. <br /> <br /> But where the movie was (really) good for me, it was bad in many other places. The animation was a little scary at times. Whenever there was a close-up of someone's face, I do not know ... it seemed scary to me. Also, where the hell was Lady? She gets like two lines of dialogue and only the dog kisses Scamp at the end. She gets 0% interaction with the plot and her only son! <br /> <br /> But overall, I liked it. Compared to the original, that holds? No, the songs are not so good (always quite catchy), the plot was much less complex, Lady had almost nothing to do with it, and it's not as cute as the first. But if you go with an open mind, you'll have fun, and maybe "panting! I like this?
