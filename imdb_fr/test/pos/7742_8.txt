I can not say what the source's knowledge of this movie adds, but it's one of my favorite Paul Mazursky's films (director and co-writer). It's a cover of Shakespeare's "comedy", but completely removed from the scene. Without a lot of text, Mazursky and the Cassavettes stars make the visual crisis a crisis of passion and meaning that only leads to mid-life. Desperate to refocus, the Cassavettes retreat to an isolated Greek island - where the locals and the island weave a little magic. With Raul Julia in particular, Susan Sarandon and Molly Ringwald, this is an adult fantasy that is both emotionally satisfying and beautiful. And funny. It was not a big hit at the box office, but every time it comes out on DVD, it will sell.
