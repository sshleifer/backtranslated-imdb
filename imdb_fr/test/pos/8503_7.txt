So Dark The Night poses a difficult challenge: it is very difficult to write about the subject in detail without spoiling it for those who have not yet seen it. As it remains rather obscure, it includes just about everyone. The film will hit those who are familiar with the best-known titles of its director Joseph H. Lewis in the black cycle ?? Crazy Gun, The Big Combo, even my name is Julia Ross, what does it look like in its brevity? as a strange choice. <br /> <br /> For starters, the bucolic French countryside serves as a setting. Steven Geray, a middle-aged inspector from Surété in Paris, goes on holiday in the village of Ste. Margot (or maybe Margaux). Quite unexpectedly, he falls in love with the daughter of the guardians (Micheline Cheirel), even if she is betrothed to a dishonest farmer. But the siren song of Parisian life is hard to resist, so she agrees to marry her, despite the disparity of their ages, which inevitably becomes the subject of conversation in the city. <br /> <br /> But the evening of their engagement party, she does not return to the hostel. Soon, a hunchback finds his body at the edge of the river. His lover jealous and jilted is the logical suspect, but he too is found dead. Then anonymous notes threaten new deaths, which occur. For the first time in his career, Geray, in mourning, finds himself baffled .... <br /> <br /> A particularly weak scenario, apart from the film; he plays like the bad Cornell Woolrich crossed with The Murder of Roger Ackroyd. But Lewis is proud of this squeaky vehicle. He takes his time to the beginning, but then the story? and narration ?? gain momentum (alas, around the time the script breaks an axis). Burnett Guffey illuminated and photographed the film, with an intriguing leitmotif: look out the window and look out the window; Hugo Friedhofer, who provided a hearing threat to many blacks, also scored an effective score. So Dark The Night has received a lot of talent, but in the end, this is nothing more than a gadget ?? and not a very good gadget to that. It's a pony at a turn of a movie. <br /> <br />
