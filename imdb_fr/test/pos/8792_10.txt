I love that movie! I love all the characters and I can see her again <br /> <br /> and again ... and I usually listen to the soundtrack again and again. <br /> <br /> Even though I saw it about two years after it was made, <br /> <br /> I've never been as young as Jip and his company <br /> <br /> I can understand them and I like their stories. And if anyone thinks this movie is shit, I do not agree and I say it is <br /> <br /> full of positive energy, friendship and love. .. and full of youth! <br /> <br /> The weekend has landed ... enjoy it!
