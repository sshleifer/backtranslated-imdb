Apparently done back to back with 'Erotic Nights of the Living Dead' with the same distribution and the same decor, but it is certain that this one does not have Laura Gemser. Many ridiculed by all that I prefer in this film. Of course, the story and the dialogue are coded at the top, but it's beautifully filmed in such a wonderful setting and I really like hardcore. I find it both naturalistic and exotic, and that does not just mean that there is a black girl and soft penis! I find sex scenes many and varied very credible, even if two are placed on a tree trunk at the edge of the ocean with the waves that splash constantly. The creature does not deign to appear until half an hour before the end and constitutes, it must be said, a disappointment. Yet, in the remaining time, he manages to kill almost all but two expeditions and in the case where the girls have sex with them first (or after in at least one case!) And this film is not not as slow as some people support it. In addition, there are beautiful moments of sexual exploitation, including the scientist and his envy of two "natives", and the glorious finale where the two survivors leave on board their boat, look back at the island where they are. are escaped and find There is still time for a last act of copulation.
