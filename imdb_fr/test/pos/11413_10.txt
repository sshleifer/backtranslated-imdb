Do not listen to most of these people. I will give you a better review of this movie that my friend and I love! It's about Jill Johnson, played by Camilla Belle, who keeps the children at the Mendrakis and someone burst. If you wonder how he got into the house, he probably went through the garage. anyway, do not listen, "the worst of the actors". he has incredible actor. with a beautiful story. I think there are 2 benefits that Jill has. 1. shes a fast runner and is on the track team. She came out alive! lol. <br /> <br /> it's a cool and scary movie. check it out, you will be happy with this masterpiece. do not listen to other people on the site. it is very good. Believe me, I'm good at watching movies. I am a future film critic. I absolutely want to buy this movie. and you too when you see it. it's incredibly awesome.
