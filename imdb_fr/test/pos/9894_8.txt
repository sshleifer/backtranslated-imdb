Peter Falk shines in the role of Patriarch Morris Applebaum, 90, who decided it was time to "take stock" after one final session. His three children, Lauran San Giacomo, David Paymer and Judge Reinhold are notified / invited by letter and immediately arrive at his door to look after their eccentric father. Laura San Giacomo has an excellent chemistry father / daughter, whose character undergoes the greatest rise of the event. It is a complete example of your average dysfunctional family and its memories, pains, growth and ignorance / tolerance of everyone's life. You'll enjoy the musical score and the liners are well timed and hilarious. Although I found the "Checking Out" party disappointing, the rest of the movie will make you laugh, cry and come out of the theater with a smile. Move on "Big Fat Greek Wedding" ... the "Big Fat Jewish Juicide" has arrived.
