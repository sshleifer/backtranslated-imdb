As other critics have indicated, some videos from this collection are missing, but the content of this disc is overwhelming. There are two separate soundtracks, an original recording and a new, completely redone version. Any new resident music is welcome, and I guess for the first time, the new version will be more suited to the ears, but I prefer the original recordings (probably just because they are "the originals". DVD is the old and new videos are all interesting, with live performance videos probably the least interesting of which is offered (although extracts of live recordings hidden in the form of Easter eggs are welcome) This is not a renter, it is a collection not to be missed.
