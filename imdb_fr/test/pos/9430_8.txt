Swiss scientist Franz Tobel was smuggled by Sherlock Holmes to his home country so that the Nazi agents who spy on him did not see him. Arrived in London, he moved to Holmes and Watson, but visited his girlfriend, Charlotte Eberli, where he left a clue to Holmes about the location of his viewfinder, which he divided into four pieces, but Professor Moriarity, Holmes' eternal enemy, is also looking for the Nazi bomb, and takes away Dr. Tobel and the hint left by Charlotte, a series of codes of dancing men that Holmes and Moriarity are both unable to decipher completely. . Holmes eventually discovers the code index and gets the location of the fourth piece of the bombshield, but Moriarity owns the other three and a confrontation is inevitable. Very good entry in the Holmes series with a lot of mystery and riddles to do. Atwill's portrait of Moriarity is more sadistic than the cunning genre described in Doyle's stories (or George Zucco's performance in The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes), but Atwill's acting talent makes his Moriarity a benevolent man. The script and direction make this entry more of a cat and mouse game between the two characters and this is one of the reasons this entry works so well. Excellent work on cinematography also. Note, 8.
