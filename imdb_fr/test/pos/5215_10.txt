This essentially fact-based TV drama, essentially routine, draws its energy from Cole's fine performance. It is the story of a highly qualified soldier, dissatisfied with his wife and children, simulates his disappearance and flees with the other woman. To support her in the way she is used to, he steals the banks. Predictable, but not a bad watch.
