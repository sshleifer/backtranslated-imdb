The end of the suburbs (TEOS) is a very useful movie. It's also important and provocative. There seems to be no common ground with the film or its main source of entertainment, the Meister anti-sprawl, James Howard Kunstler. <br /> <br /> Although I'm not a big fan of new urbanism, I criticize it because of its small vision. In the case of the new planner Peter Calthorpe - another speaking head - you finally hear what is rather obvious in and among the special taps of TEOS added ... Calthorpe just does not understand peak oil. <br /> <br /> I used it as an educational tool in economics classes to understand the importance of the land as a factor of production - a fact long diminished by neoclassical economics - and also in as a vector of education: Peak oil, use of our devastated lands, global warming, our food production threatened, public transit our future compromised <br /> <br /> Move over South Park! .... Made by Toronto Canadiens for $ 25,000 and released in May 2004, this video sold more than 24,000 copies in October 2005. A major DVD rental provider recently commissioned nearly 400 more copies. <br /> <br /> The End Of Sales in the suburbs have actually climbed a year and a half after its release and it is also available on one of the leading online video services since September 2005. <br /> > <br /> A sequel, Escape From Suburbia, is in preparation with a possible release in August 2006.
