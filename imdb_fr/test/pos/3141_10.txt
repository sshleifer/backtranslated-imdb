One of the most poetic narrative films ever made, WAGONMASTER is nevertheless a difficult film to love immediately. I like this film, but I recommend you see other John Ford westerns before taking a look at this one. The first time I saw him, I was 18 and I had not seen many other Westerns, and I hated him. I thought it was incredibly boring. I kept waiting for something to happen. It took me several years to love this picture. First, I fell in love with Westerners in general - traditions, characters, landscapes, ways of speaking, and so on. - and it made me understand when I saw WAGONMASTER that there was a lot going on after all. <br /> <br /> At that time, I was simply a more experienced movie buff and had learned to appreciate visual stories and listen to what each image told me. WAGONMASTER is a very visual film directed by one of the most visual directors working at the height of his career. <br /> <br /> The film is a celebration of a way of life and its subject is more emotional and interior. than the other Ford westerns. In reality, it is not as accurate as saying that it has much less external action than other Westerns. (The other Westerns have an outer action AND an inner emotion.) He places his Mormon pioneers very well in the context of nature. There are many pictures of animals and children - not for narrative reasons on the surface, but to illustrate this idea. That's why the movie can be called a poem. It is not a surface story (which hardly exists), but an emotional idea, and that goes through composition, editing, sound and music. In fact, one could say that this is a more pure film embodiment, as the images directly express the emotional idea of ​​the film, rather than having to serve a "story" first. <br /> <br /> Give this film a chance, and allow it to exist on its own terms, not with the terms of other westerns or other movies.
