The remote control out of my reach, I decided to use it and I was waiting for a miserable movie that I avoided for a year. So it started and I was not very optimistic about it, but after about 10 minutes, I laughed. Just the opposite as I expected. The comedy was smart, the acting was good enough considering the cast, the cast worked very well together, and the story (albeit slightly false and misleading) was actually quite fun. finally go in search of their fortune. The film happens in the 1930s. Along the way, they meet a number of fun and interesting characters. All have a different story or achievement for which they aspire. Really, the majority of the film may seem random. Some would say it was useless and boring, but if you're looking for the smart (and sometimes stupid) comedy embedded in the movie, I'm sure you'll like it. <br /> <br /> I liked it. the performances given by George Clooney, John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson. All of them did very well in their roles and worked very well together. But finally, "O brother, where are you?" is an intelligent, funny and cinematic adventure that I will not let go.
