Rooms and Hallways was one of the funniest movies of the 1999 Melbourne Film Festival. From the UK it is a young group of roommates and their various relationship dilemmas. Much of the humor is centered around the self-help group of a new age, where they pass around various tools like the "Rock of Truth". They also participate in a weekend of "hunter-gatherers" with hilarious results. Believe me, you will laugh at your teeth.
