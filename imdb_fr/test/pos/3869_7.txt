Bart Genius Although not the first episode of The Simpsons, Bart he's the genius is more or less the first typical episode. There is no gimmickry or theme, it's just your typical Simpson episode in setup. I still think it's an episode growing on you. There are some things I do not like, mainly the animation in spots that can be forgiven. But over time, I appreciate this story of its unique character. <br /> <br /> For example, it would be very difficult for a live sit-com on a standard budget to achieve this episode because of the different sets presented in this episode, the computer bays of Ms. Melon's class , opera, etc. What I mean is that the Simpsons realize one of the greatest assets of animation. The blatant lack of visual limitations compared to the real action. <br /> <br /> From the point of view of writing, he is also very intelligent and innovative. The concept is quite unique, and in particular the problems encountered. Rather than believing that the work was too hard, it is simply Bart's social isolation from his classmates that has let him down (though the explosive scientific experiment may prove the opposite ...) the series.) The end seems a bit unusual, largely because Bart ran naked in his room to avoid Homer was already done in the shorts, but it was still fun for the short film Marge and Lisa, if nothing else. <br /> <br /> In the end, it's a very good episode, with many new interesting points in the series, although not quite perfect. <br /> <br /> Oh, and the iconic name of Kwijybo has of course been launched on the world.
