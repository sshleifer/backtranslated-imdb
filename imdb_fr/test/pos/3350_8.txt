What can you possibly say? It's uncut hardcore, musical Alice! It also works with a big, energetic distribution that seems to have a lot of fun and although we may want a remastered version, I guess we're lucky to have even this video transfer. Rather a delight all along. There are some moments a little behind, but it could have been embarrassing and it certainly is not the case. It could also have been and today would have been too much camp. No, a very nice effort fun, harmonious and just sexy enough. Good performances, especially that of Kristine DeBell in mind and was it a Richard Prior not recognized as a knight lying on a vigorous horse (but discreet)?
