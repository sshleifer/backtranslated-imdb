I loved this movie, which I just saw at the Philadelphia Film Festival. In March 2005, I went to India with two friends and this film was very real. I told everything and savored every moment. The characters are credible, the story poignant and the end realistic, but not sentimental. I also enjoyed the discussion with the director after the screening. This film shows very well the mixture, but not the complete mixture of 2 worlds (East and West). The support cast was wonderful, describing the life that a tourist meets in India in a very realistic way. The humor is subtle and sometimes dry, which makes it all the more realistic as it is part of the daily escapades of the characters. It is so easy to identify with each of the situations described.
