I think it's definitely. The quality of the writing is such that beginners of the English language have to model their conversations on the basis of their dialogue. For example, the exchange between Paul Kersey (Bronson) and Ms. Kathryn Davis (Deborah Raffin) (to learn more about this character later) is extremely clear and goes to the point: Ms. Davis says, "I hope you like the only chicken I know how to do, "says Kersey," The chicken is good, I like chicken. "If it's not English grammar 101, I do not know what it is is. <br /> <br /> Something else about this character of Mrs. Davis: Kersey sleeps with her the second date after she is practically thrown against him and tells him she wants to see him "one last time" (this is only the fourth time), before moving to his sister's home in Binghamton, NY, to get away from goose bumps; so he does not even beat an eye as his corpse burns in the street a few minutes later. Kersey never even says her name throughout the movie. Not once. Never a "Come here, Katy", nor a "It's a beautiful dress that you wear, Kathryn" or a "Be careful, Katie, otherwise goose bumps will get you!" <br /> <br /> And while "Love" develops between the two, Fraker (Gavan O'Herlihy) keeps his eyes always vigilant on them. It's almost as if Kersey used it as a bait to go to Fraker, just as he used the camera or the car. Indeed, when Fraker bites, Kersey bites hard ... in the most incredible sequence ever recorded in a movie! The last fifteen minutes may only be riveted by the last thirty minutes of Delta Force. And that gives a lot of credit to Delta Force. In which other movie can you see Ed Lauter eliminate Alex Winter in order to recover the back of Charles Bronson, a troubled gang leader apparently calling a hotline to call neo-Nazi bikers to help him, and agile dancers of Broadway dressed in thongs posing as street punks, all set in a soundtrack written by none other than Jimmy Page. If it's not the highest comedy, then nothing is funny. <br /> <br /> In truth, there are a thousand ways to utter the unintentional comedy of Death Wish 3, but the only way to understand it is to look at it and judge for yourself.
