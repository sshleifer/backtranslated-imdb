This is not a serious movie, and does not claim to be, but it's not as serious as some of his critics, it's his title, and the first ten minutes make you wait. <br /> <br /> The plot is very silly, but it adds to the light amusement and excitement that runs through the movie. The characters are played with sympathy and, although they engage in typically adolescent anguish, they usually avoid the sickly sentimentality that is usually found in this kind of film. <br /> <br /> really worth a look if it happens; if you want an ironic foolishness, and you do not mind suspending your disbelief.
