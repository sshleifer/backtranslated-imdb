This film is incredibly free of any story. It's a pure experience where music eclipses visual impression. - Words can not of course express enough what should be expressed, but it is the obligation of chatter classes to talk, to chat, to enter the chains of production of mediocrity and therefore a necessity to express any thought or reasonable opinion about something does not need to be broken down by gossip. Therefore, these elaborate opinions are put forward to satisfy those empty minds that must be filled with a sound that you will not find so difficult that you try in this movie.
