Growing up in the late '60s and' 70s, I could not help but become a fan of science fiction. With the American Space Program at its best, science fiction books, movies, TV shows and comics have nurtured my imagination and opened my mind to the possibilities that exist in the universe. Farscape is so different from any other science fiction show yet it contains all the ingredients that have helped create shows like Star Trek, Battlestar Gallatica, X-Files and Deep Space Nine. One of Farscape's critics is that the casual viewer can not just watch an episode and understand what's going on. There have been other very successful series that used narrative arcs with multiple episodes and complicated characters. This is for me one of the charms of the show. I do not need or do not want the story to be perfectly linked at the end of each episode, as did the different Star Trek incarnations. Overall, Farscape has wonderful and fun characters and a story that says that although humans may be the least developed or advanced intelligent species in the universe, they still have unique qualities and abilities . <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, short-sighted people in the Sci-Fi channel have canceled the fifth season of Farscape. They stated that the cancellation was based on the relaxation of the notes. Yet just a few years ago, it was their best-rated original series and a critical favorite. It is unfortunate that not all artists who contributed to the creation of this show can continue their work of love because of the fiscal problems of the chain / company that made all this possible. <br /> <br /> Hey, do not take my word for it, watch the show, watch the reruns and decide for yourself. Help save Farscape!
