Another vintage piece for Chen Kiage ... (I do not remember making him a modern movie!) ... <br /> <br /> Good characterization with a simple story of trust and promises not outfits. None of the HK fight scenes, nor the kind of Hollywood hero, but it's good because of that. The characters are strong, I really felt them. <br /> <br /> Understanding Mandarin really gives the advantage to English subtitles. The film lasts 3 hours, but it was not.
