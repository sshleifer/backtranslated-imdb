I'm not sure to call this movie a children's drama or a fantasy film. When I watched this for the first time, I could not really understand the end and it was the only part of the film that seemed to lack depth and left me a little depressed for a while. Then I watched it a second time and realized how fantastic the acting was and I did not understand why he had received the meager attention he had at the time. <br /> <br /> Unforgettable performances of young Mazzello and Wood should have been made. This film is a classic. <br /> <br /> Although the original screenwriter / director (Evans) probably wanted it to be a fantasy / drama, he probably took a more dramatic turn, especially in the film's end, which leaves Much to be desired about what really happened to Bobby - was he killed? Did he escape and did he really make all these fantastic journeys? or was it just an imaginary story woven by Hanks to prove children? <br /> <br /> But overall, it did not close a happy ending we are used to in a children's movie. It may be because it's not just that. <br /> <br /> To discover a more classic ending, go to the official Elijah Wood website, where you will find the first draft of the film's conclusion (probably by the original author) <br /> <br /> And also a note of the music of Hans Zimmer which is one of the best soundtracks I have ever heard, a mix of childish and dark feelings throughout the film. An excellent CD to find if you can. <br /> <br />
