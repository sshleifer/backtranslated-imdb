Someone says that this anime could be offensive to girls ... not really embarrassing situations are fun. The first time I saw this series, I was in the video store, people around me started to laugh, no matter the age or sex. One teacher said that to guarantee someone's attention in a book, the beginning must be fun and the end should not be obvious by just reading the last page. During the first minutes of the series, the boy is hit by a car. During the last moments of the series, the same car appears. The episodes had a touching and funny end, especially the last one. I do not regret buying these series.
