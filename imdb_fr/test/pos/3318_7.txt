The Best of Everything is a television drama on the big screen that follows the careers of four women: Hope Lange, Suzy Parker, Diane Baker and Martha Hyer in a New York publishing house. The best for some women is not necessarily the best for all. <br /> <br /> Joan Crawford, the wise old mare, presides over this group of young fillies who have circled the track on screen and in real life several times. She looks good at home, as the boss should have at this time. <br /> <br /> Around the time she made the best of her life, Joan Crawford became widowed on the death of her fourth husband, Alfred Steele. It was a particularly traumatic event for her. She woke up one morning and found her dead in bed next to her. She inherited all of her stock at Pepsi Cola, where he was chairman of the board, and during the same period of production of The Best of Everything, she completed the queen bee at Pepsi Cola. Life sometimes imitates art. So this authority while barking dictatorships and coffee orders at Hope Lange sounds really real. <br /> <br /> In fact, all the women here, with the exception of Lange, are ready to go sledding. It's difficult for Lange too, but she literally makes the most of everything. <br /> <br /> What a collection of shabby cars that men are in this movie. The best of them, Stephen Boyd, is a big drinker. The others Louis Jourdan, Robert Evans and Brett Halsey form a collection of rodents as sticky as ever assembled for a single film. <br /> <br /> I can not forget Brian Aherne, who is at the head of this publication. strengthen. Prosecutions for sexual harassment are ongoing today on half of its offices. <br /> <br /> Beautiful shots of New York in the 50s make this movie a real treat. Catch him by all means.
