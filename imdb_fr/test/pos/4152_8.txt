It is a remarkable film for what is not shown as much as for what is. What is shown is the incredible poverty that prevails in Sicily as the 19th century gives way to the 20th century, a lifestyle that makes people dream of the "new" world of America. The Mancuso family lives in a place that is not even a hamlet, but a stone cottage nestled among the hard and inflexible stones of a country that can not even offer a single blade of green grass. An opening sequence shows the males of Mancuso barefoot climbing a steep hill, stones in the mouth to offer to a sanctuary at the top, in exchange for a "sign" that they should leave for the New World or stay where they are. It also shows life aboard the liner, crowded masses, aspiring to breathe freely, and conditions at Ellis Island where, as their journey is not yet complete, they are interrogated and examined to prove their "aptitude" to enter. America. What is NOT shown is the ship at Longshot, or even ANY type of shot that would identify it as a large ocean liner; What is not shown is anything that could identify America, no cliché vision of the New York Harbor and the Statue of Liberty, so that Ellis Island can be anywhere in the world. any country. The most remarkable cliché is perhaps that of a crane camera that looks at hundreds of people stuck together. Slowly, almost imperceptibly, two-thirds of the people at Screen Left begin to part with the third at Screen Right and we realize that those on the left are on board the ship and those on the right are on the dock, a powerful statement of the company in progress. fragmented. Throughout the documentary, we have the impression that we are following a real ship filled with immigrants, even though it was carefully drafted and clearly represents an amalgam of families / conditions typical of the time. With almost nothing happening dramatically, it's not for the popcorn brigade at the Multiplex but for the rest of us it's a very good movie.
