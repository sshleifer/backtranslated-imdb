There are a few cartoon films where animals or something "non-human" is human and I think this film is one of them. Apart from a few plot points and characters - this movie could be changed with everyone rather than mostly animals. Although - it's nice that someone did not do it - I think the cats are very good in this film that represents humans! :-) <br /> <br /> This film also focuses on many issues related to adults - which is rather strange for a Disney movie. He mentions alcohol *, shows a dog teaching another dog how to attack "humans" and shows a male cat called (Abraham Delacy Gilleppe Casi Thomas) O 'Malley, imagining a cat, in a surprisingly human and adult way. As an animated film - or just a movie in general, I think the quality is pretty good - the script and the characters are particularly good. The film (in general) happens in France and you meet a family of cats - the mother Duchess and her kittens Marie, Toulouse and Berlioz. You also meet the old and rich woman who loves cats, butler Edgar and an old man (who has clearly lost his balls) called George. The nice old woman discusses her will with George and Edgar surprises that what he gets from what he gets after the cats will have it. He is INCREDIBLE with this - and has a diabolical scheme in mind ... <br /> <br /> A very cute movie for all ages - enjoy "Aristocats"! <br /> <br /> * Do not understand "Basil the Great Mouse Detective" and some others maybe I can not think of yet.
