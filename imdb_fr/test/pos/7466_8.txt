I had the honor tonight of attending the screening of "These Girls" at the Philadelphia Film Festival. Upon entering the movie, I knew very little about it and just tried my luck because the plot of the movie seemed interesting. So, while I entered the theater just a few hours ago, I wondered what the final verdict would be. <br /> <br /> "These Girls" tells the story of three best friends from a small town. Keira (Caroline Dhavernas) is the leader who basically does not know what to do with her life after high school, but her father keeps pushing her to go to college, which she does not want to do. Lisa (Holly Lewis) will go to a Christian school after the summer. And finally, Glory (Amanda Walsh), who plans to spend her summer guard in summer. But this summer is going to be a special moment, because they are all singing, Keith Clark (David Boreanaz), the oldest sexy guy for whom they have been kept. Moments of pleasure and lots of laughter? <br /> <br /> Normally, I do not like movies like "These girls", but there is something in this movie that I really liked. I think the quality I liked the most was that it seemed rather realistic. Three girls who want to explore their sexuality choose a dude who lets them all sleep with him, then sing them later. It's a pretty funny story about growth, friendship and sex, but even if it sounds pretty old-fashioned, I can see the majority of this film unfold in real life. <br /> <br /> The subject discussed here is probably one of the main reasons for the movie did not get a mainstream release in the United States. All the girls in this movie are supposed to be under 18 years old. If I remember correctly, two of them are 17 years old and another is 16 years old. Now in the United States, even if the sex of minors is daily, many production or financing companies do not finance film like that because of sexual content. This information was confirmed by the director himself, John Hazlett, during the Q & A that followed the film. What makes me understand is that the sex scenes in this movie are not graphic and that nudity is minor. Not to mention that all the actresses of this film are more than 18 years old in real life. Go understand. <br /> <br /> What the film does best is that it gives a lot of laughs and very strong characters. I liked all the characters in this movie and each character seemed to have a "Now & Then" feature. The jokes were funny because they were smartly written, not because they were dirty or excessive. Everything seemed to blend in both comedy and drama. The scenario was very strong. <br /> <br /> The acting game was very good for most. I thought all three girls were great. Caroline Dhavernas, who also starred in one of the most underrated TV series of all time, "Wonderfalls", was simply fantastic. and Holly Lewis and Amanda Walsh, who also did a great job. David Boreanaz did a good job and he seemed to have fun turning most of the scenes. The guy was playing his head, so it was funny to watch him play that role. <br /> <br /> I had the pleasure of meeting John Hazlett tonight, who seemed to be a very nice guy and who was very grateful for movie reviews. I'm shocked that this movie did not go anywhere. I think with a little marketing behind it could have taken off. Unfortunately, it will be one of those movies directly on DVD that few people will have the pleasure to see. I think with the little budget that Mr. Hazlett had to work on, the film went right and I think he did a good job of running that little gem. <br /> <br /> For someone who typically hates teenage sex comedies, I can. Honestly, I really enjoyed this movie. The development of the character and the spiritual script allowed me to sit for an hour and a half and have fun. It's a beautiful comedy because it has heart and courage. I know I'll make sure to buy this movie when it comes out on DVD on May 16, 2006. If you're into adult stories, teen comedies or romantic comedies, do not miss this movie, Because c The funniest movies of the genre have been coming out for years. <br /> <br /> MovieManMenzel's final score for "These Girls" is 8/10.
