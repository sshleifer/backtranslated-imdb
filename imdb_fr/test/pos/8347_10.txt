Lady and the Tramp II: The Scamp Adventure is a cool movie that many kids can really understand. It's a well-presented story about a child who yearns for the freedom to do things his way, and how he goes about getting that freedom is just part of what makes this movie interesting. Forget the huge disappointments, like the fact that there were only adults in this film, based on a puppy's point of view, because it represents only 0.5% or less of the wonderful effect of the puppy. movie on the viewer. Good music, lively acting, animation and directing talent, and a powerful story tell the difference between freedom on the streets of New England and a comfortable home with your family. And no matter what looks bad, your family and friends are "always there" to help you, even in difficult times. <br /> <br /> I can not wait to get the soundtrack!
