What do you do if you're Aishwarya Rai, who came out of a blockbuster movie like Devdas, with skeptical critics still unsatisfied with your breathtaking performance or convinced by your strong on-screen presence and stellar comedian skills, what do you do? -you? Go home, sit down and pout? No. If you are Aishwarya Rai, you sign up for the next big song that comes along and continue to prove that you are worthy of all the praise, congratulations, super scripts and equally great roles. And that's exactly what she did with and in "Chokher Bali - a piece of passion" where she plays and shines in the role of Binodini, a young widow who provokes controversy well before her time. Directed by Rituparno Ghosh {, who will later lead her in the "rain coat"}, Prasenjit Chatterjee {Devdas in Bengali}.
