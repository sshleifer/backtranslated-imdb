Nothing short of beautiful photographs / cinematography in this film. The fact that you keep looking for and hoping for more flight footage tells you that they just have enough. The acting is fantastic, the stories are perfectly assembled and the dogs are beautiful ............. <br /> <br /> You absolutely have to rent, see or see. <Br /> <br /> Do not be afraid of subtitles ........ <br /> <br /> his punishment a bit of aversion therapy <br /> <br /> 10/10 <br />
