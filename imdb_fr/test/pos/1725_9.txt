I am a next-generation person ... I have never seen the original doctor who has heard of the series that has attracted many fans in the past and has made its mark in the 21st century. the new "Doctor Who" started in 2005, but for those living here in states like me, it's more like new episodes on a science fiction channel or on BBC America; From the first season, we present a new player, Rose Tyler (Billie piper) and a new cool teacher played by Christopher Eccelson (sorry, misspelled family name). these two go on many incredible missions and extremely extremely dangerous to save the world ... from time to time, they have companions of the ex-boyfriend of Rose, Mickey, to the current Jack Harkness (which can now be seen spinning) "Torchwood"). From season 1 to season 2, the pace is about right ... the stories can be weird, weird or very lively, but in any case, his rollercoster from the beginning of the theme song is very catchy. In season two, he becomes different and changes, and the new doctor (David Tennant) continues the fight to save the world with Rose and from that moment, some will say that a part of the season was not so good but I can not agree and it's sad to see Rose and the doctor parting but it leaves the role of "companion" opening to Martha (played by the very sexy Freema Agyeman) who helps continue the fight to save humanity ... season three is now more action / adventure level and sometimes emotional but not as much as the first two seasons; Here, the relationship between the doctor and Martha is appropriate, but the attractiveness MAY be introduced from time to time and it is obvious that it is not rosy. Tyler is that you knew his company in the first two seasons and not in the third. it was a little embarrassing for me because you got used to the rose and his manners and now to see someone who sometimes does not really question the doctor emotionally, but still makes the pace very exciting for viewers the edge of your seat. <br /> <br /> all in all, it's a TV show tour that I would like to give it more, but there are also flaws in this show that I can not mention, it's sometimes difficult to understand, but only one relationship concerns the physician and Martha's relationship is rushed and not based on knowledge; I've seen good shows on British television, but this is by far one of the coolest sci-fi adventures for the old and the new generation, but you will not have to take my world to because of that. join the adventure.
