This image is an interesting saga of the struggle of pioneers led by Daniel Boone in the Cumberland Gap Desert, threatened by hostile Indians. A treacherous French is the cause of all the problems between the settlers and the red men while Boone tries to convince the Indians that the pioneers only want to build houses and live in peace. The film has a certain appeal because it is not a neat production, but there are good scenes of action, although somewhat violent at the time. The cast is composed of B actors but they are all good, especially Lon Chaney as an Indian chef. Bruce Bennett is good like Boone but is a bit too light and sweet to be credible as a pioneer. The dialogue is rather banal but the landscape lends itself to the realism of the Kentucky backwoods.
