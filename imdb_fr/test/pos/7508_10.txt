I have been waiting for years for the new DVD of this wonderful film. I have a max beta record in French. Unfortunately, MGM omits the French track of his recent DVD ... Just a French subtitle in English ... I do not know how to make MGM aware: I wrote them emails but, of course, no answer . If I insist, it is because, exceptionally, the dubbing in French was spectacular, funny, well written, etc. George C. Scott's acting is always exceptional, and for people born like me in the 1950s, Diana Rigg represents something very different from Madonna (for example). Thanks for the help ... Regards ...
