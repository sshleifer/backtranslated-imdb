The movie's pace is extremely slow, but if you can adjust to its slow speed and long silences, this is a satisfying judicial intrigue. The story of the first emperor of China, his childhood love and the personal cost of power. The film is very atmospheric, the ceremony and the ritual extremely courteous and courteous contrast with the sudden brutal violence. Filmed to evoke shadows and cold spaces. Battle scenes are rare and brief, with emphasis on fighting within the individual on what is right and on the fact that the end justifies the means. The course of the emperor, idealist peacemaker and merciless tyrant, is meant to be subtle, but gives little general or convincing information on the motivation of the Emperor. Indeed, his actions and goals do not really change, only the attitude of Gong Li towards him is changed. The most interesting representations are those of Gong Li and the titular assassin who re-evaluate the moment when they have to fight, withdraw, kill themselves. The most expensive film ever produced in China at that time, the emperor and the assassin, is not based on hysterical emotions or great battles, but rather on a dark atmosphere of threat and inevitability. Gong Li fans will not be surprised to learn that she is still beautiful and gives a low-key performance.
