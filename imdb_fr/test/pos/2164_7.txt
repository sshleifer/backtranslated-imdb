Do not get me wrong, it was fun to watch. There is a beautiful animation except for a strange Bugs, and good music. And the standout stage was undoubtedly Elmer's floor dance, Bugs and Daffy, it was a nice and fun touch. In fact, the whole comic is nice to watch, but overall, it's not what I call exceptional, like Carrotblanca. There are very good gags, but they were used before I felt, and there is not much that I would consider hilarious. And Daffy joining forces with Elmer? In a way, given that he was the target of the hunter, did not it seem strange that he was friends with him? Although I admit that it was nice to have Daffy there. The dubbing was above average too, but I missed Mel Blanc. <br /> <br /> In total, an unusual cartoon but very pleasant. Bethany Cox
