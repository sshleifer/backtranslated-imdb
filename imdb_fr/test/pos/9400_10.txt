This film is on my list of the 20 best comedies. It's a really unique film. For the critic who said "I really have to miss something", you're right. You miss something. If you do not have the kind of humor this film needs, it's one thing. But do not give it a bad review because you think it's "looney" but you do not want it. Loony is an apt description of what she wants to be and what she is able to be. I laughed a lot more often and much more intensely at this movie than at most other fun movies. <br /> <br /> Michael Almereyda presented the best of his cast in this first big film, for which he was nominated for the Independent Spirit Award for best first film. Crispin Glover, as usual, is absolutely brilliant in a perfectly inexplicable way, and some of his funniest lines have never been said in this movie. Glover is clearly the best comic actor currently working. Harry Dean Stanton performs an excellent comic performance. William Burroughs is amazing in a small role. Dylan McDermott was chosen for the ideal casting and Lois Chiles is quite excellent. <br /> <br /> All of the above is perfectly fun, but it's one of Crispin's best performances - at the height of his performances in River's Edge and Willard. If you are a fan of Crispin Glover, but have neglected this movie somewhere, you must stop what you are doing and see it immediately. <br /> <br /> But do not forget to relax beforehand, and maybe beer or something. It's an excellent movie, but it's very unusual and I recommend being in a silly state of mind before watching it.
