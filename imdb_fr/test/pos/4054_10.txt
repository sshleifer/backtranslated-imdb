I saw this movie on PBS for the first time. Then I bought the video and watched it countless times. Whenever I look at it, I can get something else. This is concrete proof of wanting to keep a good life, but the world is changing. But you do not have to be older to keep the past, even young characters, like Charlotte, do not want things to change. The tone and mood are excellent. The cast is exceptional with stars like Kathy Bates, Beau Bridges and Arthur Kennedy. And it's fun to see the upcoming stars before they shoot with more recognizable feature films like Kevin J. O'Connor (The Mummy) and Vincent D'Onofrio. It's just one of those movies that stays with you.
