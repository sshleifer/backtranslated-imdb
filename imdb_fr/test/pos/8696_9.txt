So many of the first British sound films I've seen on video suffer from poor print transfer, poor sound, or both. Fortunately, I was able to get a copy of this film on a video of excellent quality, allowing me to focus on the story itself. <br /> <br /> And an excellent story. At first glance, the unfortunate bus passengers looked pretty boring (with the exception of the lovely Jessie Matthews). But, as the film returned to the story of each passenger the day before the accident, I discovered that the cast, unlike the initial appearance, was a group of talented artists, cleverly directed to bring real individuality to their distinctive features. <br /> <br /> Viewers may have different preferences regarding the choice between two passengers and a tragic end and those who will survive. But, the film holds your interest because it prevents you from guessing. This film deserves a much wider audience - a true jewel of early British cinema.
