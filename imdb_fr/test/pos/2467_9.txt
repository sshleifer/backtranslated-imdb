Not being a movie lover, I do not really know the names of the main directors, writers, producers, etc., but I can tell an exceptional film when I see one. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers of this beautiful film may well be at the top of their fields now, or may be able to do so very soon. I know that the actors are already there. <br /> <br /> It takes more talent than genius to show with such realism the impact of a national tragedy like Vietnam on the daily life of a typical American family, and to see us closely why there are so many Vietnamese homeless veterans. <br /> <br /> Without going into free scenes of blood and blood, it makes us understand why so many young men had flashbacks of what they had gone through. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is particularly striking and gives us an idea of ​​what happened in so many families following Vietnam. <br /> <br /> I wish there were more good films like this, not only about Vietnam, but also about other social conditions.
