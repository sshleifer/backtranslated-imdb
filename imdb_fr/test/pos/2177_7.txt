Most notably, Roscoe's comedy "Fatty" Arbuckle, starring a young Buster Keaton, fresh out of his separation from his family's brutal actor Vaudeville, made his film debut. Buster gets a pretty substantial share of this movie and it's pretty funny in general. "The Butcher Boy" has a lot of laughter and is an example of an old-fashioned slapstick, although it seems to have come from the short epoch of two-reel comedies where filmmakers still imagined in single-reel segments of course . <br /> <br /> The first half of the film takes place in a general store, with Arbuckle as the butcher of the title. This is an excuse to exploit the many opportunities for quick physical humor offered by a general store. Arbuckle is proving to be a 300-pound acrobat with subtlety, talent and grace in performing what might have been blank routines. raise them to a different level. A running gag makes him flip a big butcher's knife casually so he turns right into the right position, stuck in the cutting board, and I'm always amazed that Arbuckle really seems to be doing it every time. There is also a pretty gag that sees him bent over his scales and confused as to why his cuts of meat weigh so heavy. <br /> <br /> Buster Keaton is a boy who comes to buy molasses and who manages with skill. in a routine glued to the ground that follows. Aside from his strange and almost disturbing half-smile, his idiosyncratic attitude and body language make him instantly recognizable as a Buster as we know him. He even has his hat flattened, finally a trademark - here destroyed for the first time when filled, of course, with molasses. <br /> <br /> The second part of the film goes to a comedy more based on the situation and his rival Al St. John gets dressed in drag to infiltrate the boarding of Fatty's girlfriend. Much of the humor also comes from the generally surreal and mysterious sight provoking the laughter of these two strange comrades dressed in drag and trying to be "girls". Buster is also part of this segment, but remains at the cut, helping Saint John. <br /> <br /> The end of "The Butcher Boy" gets a little frenetic, but overall and beyond his interest in historical curiosity, it's a well done comedy that makes people laugh perfection.
