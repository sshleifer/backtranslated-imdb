This twisted comedy is well played and realized. Very funny and the quality of the production is exceptional. It's easy to understand why this short film has been accepted in so many festivals and won awards. <br /> <br /> Everyone can identify with Calvin who has a bad day, a difficult week, a difficult life. Travis Davis plays the role superbly! Richard Moll as Tim brings the darkness and forebodings that give this film the right tone. The old man adds to the humor of the story. And who would not like suicidal goldfish! <br /> <br /> This short film will make you laugh a lot. And do not miss the credits because they play at the end!
