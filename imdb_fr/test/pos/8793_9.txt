Well, I should say, "the only movie related to club / dj / electronic music and raves ... that respects respect". <br /> <br /> Seriously now. It is a gloriously amusing, fast and fairly accurate portrait of a raver's night. Although it is in a club, it is in Wales and somewhat dated. The film leaves out some of the most important elements of club life, but does not dissociate itself completely. It presents an idyllic but serious portrait of the ups and downs of the characters' lives. <br /> <br /> At the heart of the film, and the best part of Justin Kerrigan's screenplay, are the characters, eccentric, unique and completely understandable and accessible. This simple movie would not work and would be infinitely less fun without Jip, Koop, Nina, Moff and Lulu. Viewers may deny the political and social implications of the subtext of Human Traffic as a film about drugs, Trainspotting wannabe, an important hub of British youth culture in the 1990s, BUT .... they can not deny that these are endearing characters. <Br /> <br /> It's frantic, it's brutally honest, it's sobering, it's overkill, but it's a great comedy. <br /> <br /> Raves are a complex thing, as are the drugs taken at these events, as well as the people you will meet. But from someone who went to parties, becomes jaded and keeps on going ... Human Traffic is the best snapshot you can take of the subculture. Whatever you do, avoid "Groove" because it is the antithesis of all that is good for Human Traffic.
