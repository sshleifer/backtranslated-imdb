As a retired medical worker "worker of the vine", I do not get tired of seeing this film. Paddy Chayefsky was a friend of my college composition teacher and we visited him for several sessions in 1958. His writing skills have stood the test of time. week and still find something new. Many of the members of the secondary distribution have won larger and better roles in television and movies. George Scott did only a few comedies, but his timing and demeanor are as good as Jackie Gleason & Steve Msrtin. Mental rather than physical humor / slapstick wins in my book every time. And still a family movie with only 1 word of four letters throughout the movie
