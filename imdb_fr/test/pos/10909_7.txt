I remember seeing this a long time ago, and I knew most of the concept, but no detail, so I'm happy to see it again, from director Frank Oz (The Muppets Take Manhattan, Bowfinger). New star Cameron Drake (Matt Dillon) has just won the Oscar Award for his latest film, where he plays a gay soldier. He makes the usual thanks, he even mentions his former English teacher, Howard Brackett (nominated by the Golden Globe Kevin Kline), and he is considered gay! Howard is determined to erase his name and no longer be considered a homosexual, especially as his marriage to Emily Montgomery (Joan Cusack, Oscar and Golden Globes nominee) is underway. So it's about the wedding day, and when he tells Howard to say yes or no, that's when he gets out of himself and admits to himself and everybody that he is gay. Of course, this fires him as a teacher, but everyone gets up (in support) on the day of graduation. Cameron is very clear, so everyone, especially school principal Tom Halliwell (Elf's Bob Newhart), knows there's no problem being gay. Tom Selleck (Peter Malloy), Debbie Reynolds (Berniece Brackett), Wilford Brimley (Frank Brackett), Gregory Jbara (Walter Brackett), Glenn Close, Whoopi Goldberg and Jay Leno. The highlight of the film should be when Kline can not help but dance to the version of "I Will Survive" Diana Ross, it must be what convinced him of his sexuality. Kline is still good, Cusack is a surprise Oscar nominee, and all the cast members play their part in this funny comedy. Very well!
