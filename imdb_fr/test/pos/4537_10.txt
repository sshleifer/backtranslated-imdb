For making only a few films of his life, the late Chris Farley. Farley died in late 1997 and will mainly miss his co-actor in Tommy Boy, David Spade. From the lame police school 4 Spade really did a good job with his film career. Tommy Boy is a classic and we will always remember Chris Farley when we watch him. To appear on Saturday night live to make Tommy Boy, Black Sheep, Beverly Hills Ninja, Almost Heroes, Billy Madison and Dirty Work. I think Chris Farley had a short and successful career. Tommy Boy was his best in my case and I watched over and over again and laughed at the same part every time. Thank you Chris Farley.
