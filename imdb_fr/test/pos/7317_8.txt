This is one of the first boys, but some people may not be happy with this one like everyone else. I found it to be somewhat different from the average Stooge slapstick. It was funnier for jokes than for nudging or slapping. Watch for hilarious passages as Larry grabs Moe's stethoscope and sings. Moe gives him a good smack. This part made me crack for a good ten minutes. Another shot for the Stooges.
