This film is without a doubt one of the greatest monuments in the history of cinema. Looking at this film, we can only note in retrospect that the world cinema of the 1950s had such a purely humanistic dramaturgy, such a strong and adequate use of the montage of sound images and an almost religious admiration of ethical choices in human life. Cinema was not just an art form. It was much higher than ordinary life and it gave many people hope to live after the tragic war. It is said that even Picasso was moved and cried that such a work of art can only appear once in 100 years! The audience that the weather was so different. I read that after seeing Kurosawa's "Ikiru (Live)" in his first version, a young couple said calmly, "It's a good movie, is not it?" I think that contemporary cinema, although technically developed and opening up a new narrative perspective, has lost the essence - public confidence. Cienma was once the most popular art and, unlike modern fine arts and contemporary music, people hope and ideals. In this sense, "Letyat zhuravli" must appear in the pantheon of classics of all times, such as "City Light", "Ikiru" and "La Strada".
