I must admit that the first time I heard about the movie Apocalypse, it was a matter of concern. <br /> <br /> I mean, they have a lot to live on, right? In their first performance on stage, they won the Perrier Award and on the radio they won a Sony Award. When they ventured on television, they won a Bafta Award, an award from the Royal Television Society and the Montreux Golden Rose. <br /> <br /> When the first series aired in January 1999, it was breathtaking! A real breath of fresh air in British Comedy, and when the second series airs a year later, it builds on that foundation and seals the cult status of broadcasts around the world. Our web statistics show that we have visitors from all over the world. ! The program "Local for Local People" showcased the talent of the Gents for concerts and opened the doors to the gents so they could do more concerts such as "Art" in the west. <br /> <br /> The fan favorite has always been the Christmas Special, less a series of sketches but rather a tribute to classic horror movies, but still wrapped in the delicious style of the League. <br /> <br /> And of course, there was the third "hard" series, always successful with hardcore hardcore fans of course, but maybe a bit ahead of its time for a mainstream TV audience. <br /> <br /> As I say, a lot to argue. <br /> <br /> So now we have the movie and ... Well, a movie is different, is not it? It will be seen by numbers much larger than the radio or television shows and with the third series in mind, I was worried. <br /> <br /> Well, as you know, I was fortunate to have the chance to see the film yesterday at a press screening in London and all my doubts were swept away (literally) in the first minutes! I'm not going to give a plot as some critics have done, I'm not going to tell you the slogans (although there is only one), but I'll try to tell you what they managed to achieve with this movie! Leaving the cinema on Monday night, I could not imagine writing: "Oh my god, it's brilliant, it's amazing, it's the best thing they've ever done, better than the first, the second and the special in one! " Of course, I owe my visitors a much better explanation than that! So, why is it brilliant? It's a movie for everyone, the casual fan, the obsessive fan, the casual fan and even someone who is sitting in the wrong cinema! You do not need to have watched the series to enjoy this movie; it works on so many levels. <br /> <br /> This movie reminded me why I'm a fan of the League of Gentlemen! You can say that filming was also a real work of love. the attention to detail is incredible. The sets of the TV show were always detailed, but I'll have to see the movie again to look at the background! The story is moving at a fast pace, the action taking us from Royston Vasey to the real world where we meet the "Creators" who are of course the League! On the way, we manage to cross the favorite characters of the series, but always in the central scenario, unlike the television sketch. <br /> <br /> I was happy that the film is dark in places, a little scary and a bit strange ... only suitable for the League of Gentlemen. The gentlemen also managed to get revenge on the BBC censors, slipping less in the word "Mongoloid" than in the shouts on the roofs! Some may think that gentlemen are a bit indulgent, but that's the joke and, with that, my only concern: the jokes I discuss below may baffle some viewers and they could come a little too smart ... but I should not worry, there's always a poop joke waiting for you at the corner and talking about jokes, they arrive quickly and well, and in a mix of clever references, wig jokes, jokes buttocks, visual jokes and cock gags! I have not laughed at the movies since ... well, I do not remember! Fans who have been "with" the league from the start are rewarded with a plethora of "in" jokes, some running on two levels, a mainstream audience can make fun of a reference to a compact disc for a reason while Local show fans will laugh for another reason altogether! Cameos are a genius! Peter Kay and Simon Pegg are the strangest double act you've ever seen, Simon making one of the biggest laughs of the movie just making noise! I was a little worried about the aspect of the movie dating from 1690 when I first heard about it, but as a story in a story, I was just beginning to say it when ... but it would be tell! All I have to say is that it goes perfectly and adds to the overall mood of the film! I am not a professional film critic. So I find it hard to say how much I liked this movie, but for the moment, I'll just say that if the so-called reference for British Comedy films in recent years was the excellent Shaun of The Dead, then I'm sorry but a new reference has been defined by the inventive, hilarious and sometimes scary ... The Apocalypse of the League of Gentlemen's. <br /> <br /> Jason Kenny 2005
