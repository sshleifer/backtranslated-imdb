I really enjoyed this movie. I had read the book a good ten years ago and was intrigued by its film translation. <br /> <br /> The scenario is very faithful to the book, which charmed me - it's a rarity in itself these days. The characterizations were solid and credible, and the strategy allowed me to upset my perceptions, even though I already knew the end of the book. <br /> <br /> A smart and well-designed film.
