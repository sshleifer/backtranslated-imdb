STAR STARS: ***** Saturday night **** Friday night *** Friday morning ** Sunday night * Monday morning <br /> <br /> Mr. Bean (Rowan Atkinson) is in this world, but not of this world. His mind just does not seem to understand things as an average person would, and his life is a long-term disaster for that reason. he does not seem to mingle with anyone and he seldom speaks. But he never gives up and, despite the fact that the simplest of tasks is a constant struggle for him, applying his own crazy methods to solve the problem is always profitable for him. <br /> <br /> Watching the sorry state of modern British humor, with all its focus of sex and vulgarity in general, you would be forgiven for forgetting that a show like Mr Bean was done at one time. There's nothing wrong here, just a good clean humor and noted U-type Tommy Cooper and other products from the 50's. And I find it also funny funny laughing now in my early twenties that I was doing it when I was a boy in the early 90's. <br /> <br /> Although I can look a little further now and see there must be more to this character than the eye. There must be a reason why he does things as he does and things seem to continue to go wrong for him. As others have noted, he seems to have autism. In fact, I am so convinced that I really think that if it was a professional psychologist who had to analyze it, I think that Mr. Bean could be the first known fictional character to receive a diagnosis similar to that of the syndrome. Asperger. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a truly hilarious British humor at its best before all becomes obsessed with sex and vulgarity, then this would be highly recommended. Series like Little Britain work because it's done well, but it's just as vulgar as the others. Programs like this show that we were once more sober and civilized, and we hope to start reproducing that kind of humor again in the near future. *****
