This film is one of my favorites of all time. I'm sorry that IMDb is not more positive about this. I hope this will not prevent those who have not experienced it from watching it. <br /> <br /> I have always loved this movie. I watch it about once a year and I am always delighted with the film and especially the remarkable performances of all the actors. <br /> <br /> I always wondered if Jean Stapleton had really done the end of the dance with Travolta ??? ? If anyone knows this anecdote, please leave a comment. <br /> <br /> Thank you and have fun!
