It's a film about a man that everyone thinks is Jewish. It's a movie about Lawrence Newman, who lived in Brooklyn in the 1940s, at the time of the Second World War. One day, when he takes glasses, people start to think they are Jewish. And it's only because he looks like it. And he lives in a very anti-Semitic neighborhood. Then some people treat him like dirt. They make this judgment, as a Jew, of Larry's new wife, Gertrude Hart, too. Neal Slavin's Focus (2001) is a pretty good look at anti-Semitism. It's a problem that will not go away. The film is based on Athur Miller's novel, which, I admit, I did not not read.But the film is really good, so I'm sure the book too. The actors do a good job.William H.Macy is always good, and his work as Larry Newman is brilliant.Laura Dern is Gert Hart and she is gorgeous.Meat Loaf is almost scary as a neighbor who wants to prevent the Jews from enter by all necessary means. The character of David Paymer as a Jewish trader, Mr. Finkelstein is the most likeable of the film.Paymer is the ideal choice for the role.One of the biggest scenes is the one where Mr.Finkelstein and Newman fight against these Nazis with baseball bats.They unite for evil.The Christian and the Jew.
