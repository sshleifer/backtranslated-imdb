The book is better than the film especially because of the prose of the writer Ondatje. Before seeing this movie, someone who had seen it told me that the love described in this film was not real. After seeing this film, I realize how much his suspension of disbelief in this regard could have distracted other viewers. Frankly, some intense demonstrations of love were laughable and seemed on the verge of parody. But in the end, everyone should realize that this is a great artistic message. It is not at all about love, it uses "love" to dialectically reveal the human division or the arbitrary boundaries of countries that help to justify wars and hatred. These are misunderstandings and blind pursuits of things that separate us from the so-called. The critical scene for the true theme of this film is when the hero's or anti-hero's requests for help for his lover failed in the desert are ignored and ignored for the reasons shown in this scene. This film also talks about hope and forgiveness, the hope embodied in the interracial relationship between the recovering character of Binoche and the Indian minesweeper (which echoes in Sikh's boyfriend-boyfriend relationship with his colleague white who ends up dying absurdly) and the forgiveness evoked at the Caravaggio the character's first hunt and then come out of what he thinks to be the hero's confession for his "crimes" of war (treason of the country). I think the film could have been even better done. I do not know if a more realistic portrait of the circumstances of love would have made the real themes and points of this film even more obvious or not, but I agree that this film does not deal with a realistic romantic love, because people Behind this film a work of art or a movie involves an early scene where potential lovers meet for the first time. The hero talks about how a new car, a broken car, a fast car, etc. (I paraphrase) is always a car, whatever the adjective you put in front. She answers that parental love, platonic love, romantic love, etc. are very different types of love. It's ironic, because this film speaks of the love that all human beings should desire, it is the love of (or) peace (and not of materialistic things which are generally the real reasons for the wars, illustrated by something most of us want, like "cars." "Let's say) Otherwise, we risk letting ourselves die in a cave in a vast desert with old murals and swimmer drawings, which suggests that the seas and the vital waters that lived there have practically disappeared, I believe that "The English Patient" won the Oscar because of these big messages, not for its description of romantic love. tend to move in this direction.The relationship between the hero and the heroine was a necessity to attract the public.Unfortunately, this vision of love can be surpassed at the age of divorce and so many singles who seem incapable to to reunite at so many levels, so ridiculous versions of mythical It is difficult to enter into love, even in daydreams, what love of the film has always been, especially in the good old Hollywood. The film may not match what people expect but a 7 out of 10 movie to see absolutely, anyway.
