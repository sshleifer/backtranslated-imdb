Entirely shot in Bulgaria, The Man With The Screaming Brain is a hilarious love affair between two ugly, ugly American types and a murderous gypsy in a hotel. <br /> <br /> William Cole and his wife Jackie arrive in Bulgaria for a business trip and take a taxi driven by taxi driver Yegor. Things start to go wrong when Tatoya, the maid, murders Yegor, William and a mad scientist implants a piece of Yegor's brain into William's head. The robots end up getting involved, as do the gypsies with broken fingers, the head injuries, Bruce Campbell on a pink Vespa with small streamers, and the physical comedy in the All-Of-Me-style of a character at war with a voice in the brain that half master it. of his body. <br /> <br /> The Screaming Man is an incredibly funny movie. It has the most hilarious tracking trajectory I've ever seen (when Bruce Campbell's character, fresh out of the lab and completed with a giant frontal scar and blue hospital pajamas, collides with a square and makes fear to a crowd of people) and collapses A scene of murder that made everyone laugh. The whole thing is a damn riot from start to finish and I would recommend it to any physical comedy lover, Bruce Campbell, or to the B-movie genre in general.
