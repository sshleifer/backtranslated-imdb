I certainly have not seen all of Jean Rollin's films, but they mostly seem to be vampiric nude women's parties, which is not bad if you like that kind of thing, but it's a major change and could almost being Cronenberg without the nightmare mechanical bios. Except that it's in French with subtitles of course. At night, a man who rolls on the road meets a woman who is wearing her slippers and bathrobe and takes her in his arms, while another woman lingers wearing nothing. As they drive, it is obvious that something is wrong with the woman, as she forgets things almost as quickly as they happen. This does not prevent the man from having sex with her once back in Paris and in his apartment. The man goes to work and strangers come to his home and take the woman to this "tower", a huge apartment building called the Black Tower, where other people of her own (for whom things "not of memory ") seems to be the least of their problems) are held for any reason. Time and events go by in the movie, which mainly consists of trying to find out what's going on and getting out of the building for this woman, and she manages to call Robert, the guy who picked her up in the first place , to help the victims. her. The revelation of what happens happens in the last moments of the film, which has a rather strange but touching end. By avoiding what seemed to be his "typical" formula, Rollin created what I consider to be his most fascinating and disturbing film. I really like this one, take a look at it. 8 out of 10
