The story of "Mulholland Dr." is known: what should have been another excursion (after "Twin Peaks") in the competitive field of TV series stopped abruptly once the driver finished. It was too risky and twisted for producers to advance an investment. Lynch used all the material filmed and cut and began new filming to finish a completely new movie. The result: one of the most impressive cinema experiences of this decade that can be ranked among the best works of David Lynch. His previous films, Eraserhead, Blue Velvet, and Wild at Heart, remained distant in an irritating way that prompted the viewer to play the role of a voyeur, without ever involving him in the plot that unfolds like this. /> <br /> 'Mulholland Dr.' It's a puzzle that lacks pieces, others have obviously been borrowed from "Eraserhead" and "Lost Highway", but that never seems to be an unfinished business. On the Internet, I came across many instructions and essays to explain this film. I am aware now that he loses his magic when you try to decipher it completely. All of these detailed explanations of the solutions are not only wasteful, but also a dubious attempt to provide an answer where nothing is absolutely necessary. Imagine this scenario: a little child dissects his teddy bear to find out where the secret and the specifics of this bear are. Is it because he wants to destroy his toy? Is the secret in the teddy bear or really in the child's heart? Transfer this to 'Mulholland Dr.' it means that innocence is one of the most important conditions to watch and appreciate. <br /> <br /> David Lynch succeeds not only in describing the surface of human behavior, but also in fighting against all that lies underneath. Human desires, dreams, obsessions and fears - all that remains unexpressed; emotions that are often repressed. "Mulholland Dr." intensity calls a casting that completely opposes the substance. Actresses and actors willing to follow the visions of the director in a selfless way. Laura Elena Harring, Naomi Watts, Justin Theroux solve their task so impressively that you would not want or could not imagine another cast. While their game at the beginning seems to be a little superimposed, you will quickly realize that this stereotyping is intended to manipulate the viewer and to divert it as soon as the red thread of the film is visible. <br /> <br /> When you claim the criterion of a film that is well done so you can lose yourself and dive into what you see on the screen, Lynch has managed to achieve a masterpiece. A modern masterpiece that testifies to David Lynch's status as one of the most important, creative and courageous directors of the present. Like any filmmaker who exceeds his limits, he is confronted with criticism and ignorance. This will disappear as soon as you find the individual key of the Lynch movie world. "Mulholland Dr." is more than just a sleeper ?? it's a must for anyone who loves ambitious cinema. In addition, the film relates to Hollywood, in its form and content, which was barely audacious before.
