This movie is a warning for all those sitting on the Internet during a typical day at the office. My warning is, do not reveal too much about yourself, 2 Pay attention to who you are going through! , there are spies on the Internet. I thought it was so scary what this man and woman did to poor Angela Bennett. I did not know that someone could take their life away with a click of the mouse. My question is: why does this computer make this noise when it works? as a clicking sound, mine does not do this or this one. This movie also tells you that there is fraud on the Internet. Why could Angela not run the virus destruction program in a cybercafe? I also thought that, like all computers, the transfer rate on the disk was slow. This film is correctly described in this film. When you save the program on your floppy disk, the bar only moves slowly !!! I liked Angela's house at the beginning of the movie. Why did not anyone believe Angela ???
