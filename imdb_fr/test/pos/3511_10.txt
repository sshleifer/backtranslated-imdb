I first saw this afternoon in the 80's on the T.V. I think I was 9 years old. (Photo showing a violent horror movie on regular television). Anyway, I saw it again years later and it's like I remember it, it's really good, scary movie. I think that the reason it was unnoticed is that it was not followed by a series of sequels, namely Friday the 13th. But it's one of those films that takes up the original idea and the do better. Although it's a deadly movie in the woods, like Friday, it has more in common with the original Texas Chainsaw massacre. This is because the film creates a particular atmosphere and feeling of terror, even in broad daylight. And killers feel more threatening than Friday. There is also a good amount of suspense. I recommend seeing it now that it is released on DVD in late July.
