It's a funny movie, there are not many. OK, the plot is a little disturbing, but very original. A teenager trying to take revenge on her father, because he has not been there yet and is sending him to jail almost because he lies to impress an older boy, how could that not be to be funny? Plus, it's not the typical movie featuring teenagers. The first remake I saw is better than the original, the only problem with both: Gerard Depardieu. With another actor, it would be a perfect 10, because it plays all the rolls in the same way, it sucks. Another problem is that all women rely on him, it is not credible, it is not attractive! There was a rubber troll that was more beautiful than him, come on!
