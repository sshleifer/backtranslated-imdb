I saw this movie when it was released in cinemas. It is certainly a memory, I had forgotten the title until recently. A friend found it via an online search. <br /> <br /> One Dark Night is rather unusual for the suspense / horror genre of the moment because it does not contain any blood. He is afraid of teenagers, but teenagers are respectable in their own way. It's a good old movie with props and scenes that reflect the weather. Our hero rides a motorcycle without a bucket, for example. <br /> <br /> As has already been mentioned in previous reviews, One Dark Night is currently available on DVD. The original negative was not available for the DVD transition. Some reel changes are a bit difficult but it does not detract from the story. That said, the colors are bright and the lighting is very good. <br /> <br /> Adam West plays a rather small role in this movie as RayMar's son-in-law. Her role as an authoritarian and indifferent husband is fortunately short. <br /> <br /> The story is built over the course of the film. Unlike many horror movies of the time, One Dark Night is a thrilling story that gives the viewer time to soak up what's going on. <br /> <br /> The last 20 minutes of One Dark Night are making it a memorable success. RayMar's telekinesis abilities are used to open old tombs in the mausoleum, remove coffins, open them and move corpses. Attention has been paid to many details in the final scenes. The rotting corpses, riddled with worms, seem very real.
