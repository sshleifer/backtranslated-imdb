I think Never Been Kissed was a totally awesome movie. The cast was really good and they played very well. I really like Drew Barrymore and of course it was excellent. At first I was scared because it said it did not come out in video. Boy, I'm glad it's because it's a movie beyond cool. Go see it if you have not already done it!
