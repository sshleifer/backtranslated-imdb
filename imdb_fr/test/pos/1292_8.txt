Humphrey Bogart, in his first role, looks very young, plays well, but has a pronounced phlegm that only lets him see later in his career. Still, he is very good and very attractive as a young idealistic inventor of a new aircraft engine. <br /> <br /> Dorothy Mackaill is the real star here, playing a once rich woman who is torn between her true love for Bogart (he's also in shambles) and the comfort and security of marrying a man over. elderly (Hale Hamilton). <br /> <br /> Astrid Allwyn plays Bradley Page, Bogart's sister on the trampoline, and Barbara Leonard as a cosmetologist, Jack Kennedy as Gilligan and Halliwell Hobbes as the faithful (and wise butler). <br /> <br /> Both Mackaill (who was a star in the silent films) and Bogart were trying to gain ground in the talkies in 1932. Bogart was a slow-growing actor on the Broadway scene; Mackaill slipped and would soon appear in the production of skid-row as PICTURE BRIDES. Yet they are both very good here. Mackaill was not even 30 when she appeared in this movie!
