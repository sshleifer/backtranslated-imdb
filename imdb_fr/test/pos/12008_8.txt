What can I say about this film if not the narrative is one of the most exciting in the film's history ... and is based on a true story! Old enough to remember the Berlin Wall, while it was still used to contain a country, this film gives you a gloomy glimpse of the sinister incarceration of the inhabitants of East Berlin and their desperate attempts to escape, what whatever the price. The film follows the lives of two families who decide to escape using a hot air balloon made by them. Always afraid of being arrested by the authorities, under the control of the neighbors, they must calculate a plan to reach the other side of the wall. A tense and exciting story of courage and determination that truly pays tribute to all those who have succeeded and failed the perilous journey of West Berlin and freedom.
