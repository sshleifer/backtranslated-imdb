I can differ from many people on this forum, but I like to watch Mind Of Mencia. The reason I love Mind Of Mencia is that the host is not afraid to make their point of view heard or to exploit stereotypes. Carlos Mencia does what we all do with our friends but does not want to admit, then some. <br /> <br /> Mencia has no problem making jokes about races, religions, gender or directions. Although it gets a lot of attacks for that, it's a breath of fresh air in these politically correct times. Mencia does not care to offend anyone, but he is not racist and even jokes about his own race. <br /> <br /> The typical format of the spirit of Mencia is as follows: there will be a skit open pleasure of a person or a recent event. Mencia then introduces himself and makes a speech of 5 or 6 minutes where he approaches various questions. The show then has 2 separate skits divided by commercials. In these sketches, Mencia does a variety of things, such as making fun of people, giving personal opinions with a fun twist, or just making parodies of people, events or movies. At the end of the show, Mencia comes out for a minute with a final skit or something to say. <br /> <br /> People criticize Mencia for exploiting stereotypes and saying that her statements are too offensive. Carlos only does what everyone thinks about certain breeds but is afraid to say it. As for Mencia, being offensive, he only says what he thinks. I do not find anything wrong with that. <br /> <br /> The show is not perfect. The sketches can not be set up in the best way and sometimes Mencia passes the line in his jokes. However, in most cases, it is a show in which the actor says what goes through his head, regardless of the consequences, and presents a humorous topic. So, if you are not afraid to laugh at stereotypes and see someone express their opinion and often say what you meant, then look at Mind Of Mencia. However, if you are easily offended, you should not watch this show because you will be offended or even worse, you may even laugh.
