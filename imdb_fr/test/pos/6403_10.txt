This series, although idealized and romanticized, presents the originality, the sensuality and the good humor that comes from life on an island. <br /> <br /> I lived in a remote part of Hawaii for a few years. and found hilarious, eccentric and fun people in remote (non-touristic) areas. <br /> <br /> Every time I see the reruns of this series, I tenderly compare my memories of Hawaii's one-way experiences with the depictions portrayed and fictionalized in Key West. <br /> <br /> This series is not reality TV. I hate reality TV. <br /> <br /> It dates back to the days when people were still writing creative TV shows. Give me a "young writer" who is inspired by "angels in the spray, sorcerers in the palm trees and elves in the shells" every day.
