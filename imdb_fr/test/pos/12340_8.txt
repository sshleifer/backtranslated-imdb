ONE DARK NIGHT is a very unknown and little-known movie of the early 80s that deserves an audience I'm afraid I never have, and it's a shame. I have seen this movie compared to other films that have acquired a larger name over the years, including PHANTASM, HELL NIGHT and MAUSOLEUM. It's a very different film from those and I do not see comparisons other than the mausoleum, which is a bit similar to that of PHANTASM, but not enough to make real comparisons. I'm not sure how this one went without a wider acceptance. Maybe everything is in marketing, I do not know. Maybe a remake would breathe new life into this one, unless Raymar drains it all his life. I'm not very big on all the remakes that abound nowadays, but I think they work well with less known movies (except the terrible remake of GHOST SHIP, which apart from the opening scene and Mudvayne , Not Falling blaring, was totally crap). So, if a remake of ONE DARK NIGHT were to fall into good hands, I think that would make many people look at the original. I know that's what I do if there's a remake of a movie I've never seen before. I'm afraid that nothing less than a remake will bring this film back to life. Unless, of course, Raymar saw it. <br /> <br /> Anyway, ONE DARK NIGHT is a must for horror fans, especially horror fans of the 80s (because we all know it's at this moment -the fabric). Scary setting. Rather good to act. Very good story. Campy. What do you wish for more than a horror movie of the early 80's? What is nudity and gore? Well, sorry. No nudity or gore in this film, but it's still great! A solid 8 out of 10. Enjoy.
