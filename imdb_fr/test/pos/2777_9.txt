Although it was not the most technically advanced film I saw, it was a fun and enjoyable hour. The main characters are adorable and you really have to like them and feel something when Susie Q. has to leave, but you feel good when she comes back as Maggie. <br /> <br /> Numerous stock market parcel dialogues, but most of all, a lot of fun.
