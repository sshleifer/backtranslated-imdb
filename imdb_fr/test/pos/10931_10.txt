I just read what I think is an analysis of this film by a lyrical Irishman. Nice to read. <br /> <br /> However, a concise analysis of this film is that it is an intertwining of the seven deadly sins with the four types of justice. <br /> <br /> Envy, greed, pride, laziness, anger, etc. and justice in retributive, distributive, blind and divine forms. <br /> <br /> I could show three examples of each, one for each of the three protagonists; However, it is much more fun to note them for yourself. <br /> <br /> This is an excellent movie. <br /> <br /> Do not miss it.
