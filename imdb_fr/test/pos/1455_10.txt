Frank Sinatra has done so many great things in the entertainment world that it's hard to be one of the best. If I had to name the best thing he had ever done, it would be his performance as a musician and poker dealer addicted to the heroine, Frankie Machine, who is barely saved by the love of a good woman ( played unusually babelicious Kim Novak). The scenes of "cold turkey" between Sinatra and Novak are terrifying and heartbreaking. In fact, the film is almost perfect, from Saul Bass's title graphics to Elmer Bernstein's innovative jazz score. It may not be the kind of thing you think about the 50's, but it's still a must.
