The Killing Yard is an excellent film, though sometimes uneven. Morris Chestnut is making a phenomenal effort as a mentally wounded and sentenced prison inmate, and Alan Alda's defense advocate is none other than genius. The emotion and raw reality illustrated in the flashback scenes of this film have the ability to put viewers directly at the heart of the events represented. I was not even born at the time of the Attic riots. However, through extensive research, I find that "The Killing Yard" tells the story of his just righteousness. I would definitely recommend this film to any educational or activist group as a very useful learning tool.
