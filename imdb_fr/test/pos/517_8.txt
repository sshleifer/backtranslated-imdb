I must admit that I am a big fan of the all-powerful David "the Hoff" Hasselhoff since he starred in the hit TV series "Knight Rider" of the '80s. Whether it's his extraordinary debut in as a high school libidinous basketball player in the hilarious revenge "Revenge of the Cheerleaders" or his brilliant representation of a dashing prince in the sci-fi gem "Starcrash", the Hoff has proven time and time again that he is an actor while just great (and shamefully underrated). The Hoff excels here as Gary, a cynical and skeptical photographer who, with his virgin and repressed Leslie Cummings, is investigating a haunted and dilapidated hotel on an isolated island off the coast of Canada. Massachusetts. They do research on witchcraft through the ages and the last owner of the hotel was an actress who practiced black arts. A family who is bickering is also present on the premises to check the hotel. Soon, the mysterious Lady in Black (a truly strange Hildegard Knef) begins to be crushed in various horrible ways. <br /> <br /> Of course, the rest of the cast gives Hoff the courage to run. : the always-perky Linda Blair projects her usual charm as a pregnant pregnant woman who ends up being possessed (natch!), the legendary jazz singer Annie Ross gets caught by a joyous self-confidence like an old sordid bat (the poor Annie ends up being cremated her lips are sewn and she is hanging in a fireplace) and the gorgeous blonde Catherine Hickland overflows with sex appeal of each pore that goes like a vigorous whore. The competent direction of Fabrizio Laurenti, a rather frightening atmosphere, the glossy and glossy cinematography of Gianlorenzo Battaglia (the fuzzy shots of Steadicam that blur are particularly pleasing), the brilliant special effects, the quivering quivering scores of Carlo Maria Cordio and Randy Miller, sadistic violence is at the height. But finally, it is the extremely dynamic and charismatic presence of the one and only Hoff that makes this choice a succulent piece of Italian horror cheese: he removes his shirt once (hubba hubba!), Is sprinkled with blood, and - - WARNING: Major * SPOILER * in front of you - meets even an unnecessarily horrible end. Produced by none other than Joe D'Amato, this image is generally considered good and fun.
