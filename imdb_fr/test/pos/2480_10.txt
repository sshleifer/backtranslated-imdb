First of all, the whole scenario is mainly improvisation, which adds to the fantastic illusion that what we are watching is a real documentary. Second, the actors hired by Watkins were deliberately chosen to represent their true political alliances and antecedents. The hippies described are true hippies, the government representatives (but not necessarily within the government themselves) are at least in fact warm conservatives within the system, and many of the police officers are real police officers. The interactions of these actors, given the textual freedoms granted by Watkins, eventually become violent and even Watkins himself is convinced that a member of the cast was shot. (We hear him yelling "Cut! Cut!" In the background.) <br /> <br /> An incredible movie, although American critics have been quite stern in their criticism, one of them between them actually reporting that it was the "most shocking" movie had ever seen. This is not totally unexpected, because the unveiling of this oppressive American-style mentality at that time would certainly shake some cages. This pseudo-documentary certainly requires an open mind, but if you seriously look for an extremely accurate representation of the culture of the 60s, it would be the film to watch.
