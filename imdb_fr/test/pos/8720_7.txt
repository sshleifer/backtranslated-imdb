Matthau, a famous dentist, runs his single with his blonde mistress, Hawn, after telling him he is a married man and father of three. After trying to commit suicide, Matthau decides to be responsible and marry the girl. Worried that she becomes a "housebreaker", bright-eyed Hawn wants to meet his wife and explain everything to her. Matthau uses his faithful nurse Bergman to play the role of his wife and that's when things get complicated. <br /> <br /> A ridiculous comedy with irresistible tracks hits quite often, but is never credible. The script asks us to believe that we, men, are one-dimensional idiots who make us believe. But maybe this comedy does not need to be analyzed too deeply, relax and enjoy the always so funny Matthau, the always so charming Bergman and the beginner Hawn, who essentially created here the role of the stupid blonde.
