I watched Six of a Kind for W.C. Fields - it only stays about 10 minutes and has a long scene, the famous billiard sequence he made famous in the vaudeville and several other great moments. The remaining 55 minutes are also delightful, thankfully, mainly because of the hilarious Charlie Ruggles in the role of embarrassing banker J. Pinkham Whinney. He is the leaf of everyone. He stammers and stumbles for our greatest pleasure. Mary Boland, his partner in comedy, also plays his wife, Flora. George Burns and Gracie Allen participate in the proceedings. Boland is particularly fun at the beginning and end, but Gracie and Ruggles use most of the picture. Gracie is funny, certainly, but she can also get tired. And poor George Burns has absolutely nothing to do except repeat Gracie all the time. I do not remember laughing at him once (though he has a big scene with Ruggles, where Ruggles is desperately trying to get George to take Gracie and leave him alone with his wife for a while, and one with Fields, where he asks Fields to sell him a sweater, but these are exclusively fields). The situation is constantly amusing: the Whinney will drive to California, but to help them cope with the expenses, George and Gracie are recruited. 8/10.
