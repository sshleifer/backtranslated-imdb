Darr was a Super Hit movie, which was loved by many peoples. It tells the story of Shahrukh Khans' innocent obsession with Juhi, who loves Sunny Deol. Honestly, it was an entertaining film, but if you look good, it's not too realistic. Shahrukh Khan keeps on phoning Juhi and tells him he loves him too much. He announces to the college that he loves her and gives him beautiful surprises as beautiful pictures of her. Unfortunately, instead of being flattered that a guy loves him too much, she is very scared. Personally, I know hundreds of people who get caught by someone, and they benefit because they play for a long time. Yash Chopra gives us a good movie that entertains, largely because of the character of Shah Rukh Khan. Sunny Deol is supposed to be the main actor, but Darr belongs to Shah Rukh Khan and offers a superb performance. Shah Rukh Khan is literally the villain of the movie, but I would be happy if he got the girl, because he loves her so much. Sunny Deol gives a decent performance, but he beats all these guys alone and survives a brutal knife attack. Juhi Chawla is cute as always in a pretty good performance. Some good songs, including Tu mere Samne, being the best.
