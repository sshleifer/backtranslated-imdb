Sheba Baby, is another Pam Grier Blaxploitation movie. It was one of Pam's less visceral films of this kind. Pam plays Sheba Shane, a Chicago gumshoe. Sheba's father owns a small credit company in Missouri. When local mobsters try to lead her business father, Sheba attacks the wicked. <br /> <br /> Pam Grier had already made her mark in Blaxploitation's films, when Sheba Baby arrived. Coffy and Foxy Brown fans know that Pam is capable of explosive intensity as an actress. In Sheba Baby, the inflamed performance expected by Pam's viewers was not so obvious in this movie. Not that Pam does not wager on Sheba Baby. She's just not as vigilant as other Blaxploitation movies. <br /> <br /> The secondary distribution in this film is a clear disappointment. Sheba Baby is Pam's film, from one side to the other. And although Pam is a little more moderate than in her other films, she still gives a convincing performance in Sheba Baby. This film is definitely worth it, if you are a fan of Pam Grier.
