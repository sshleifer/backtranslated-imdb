This is considered my favorite movie of all time. It's the best parody of a sci-fi movie to date. the fact that it was a Star Wars mailing made it even better. <br /> <br /> I love clever people. Think about it when the Marx brothers or the Three Stooges meet Star Wars. The writing is hilarious. The effects are funny. The free association that takes place guarantees all sorts of things that come out of the left field. (I almost wet my pants when the Wookie monster approached the princess.) <br /> <br /> Space Balls was a much longer movie, but it contained only about 15 minutes of good content, and I Feeled as scammed. then, like buying a hamburger that turned out to be basically loaded. Hardware Wars, although it only lasts about 15 minutes, deserves to pay a feature price, IMO.
