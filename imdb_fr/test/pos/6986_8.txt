It opens with your cliché too long ship flying through space. All I could think of at that moment was "Spaceballs" and hope that there would be a sticker on the back that said, "One breaks for nobody". The film then shows cryogenic freezers with Vin Diesel narration. I always thought his voice was cool since I saw Fast and the Furious. As soon as I discovered that he was also a criminal, I thought the movie was going to be a cliché. It was. It was very cliché and fate seemed to be against them at every turn. Blackout every 22 years. Fortunately, they land on this day. Extraterrestrials can only be in the dark, hey it's a solar eclipse. Although I thought it was too easy and it was only a cliché, the film was successful and gave a major kick to @ss. I even went to buy a copy of Pitch Black after seeing it. I really can not wait for Chronicles of Riddick.
