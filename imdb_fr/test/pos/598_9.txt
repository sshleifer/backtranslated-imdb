The first feature film, Muppet Movie, and with the possible exception of The Muppet Christmas Carol, puppeteers around the world are still looking for a guide. Disney has defused the Muppets and this film proves it again and again. Classical comedians and guest stars, stick to a simple but original plot, the classic jokes of the lame Muppet, the genius of Paul Williams in songwriting and the Electric Mayhem folly, and offers an amazing movie, especially when realizes that the main actors are puppets. . Only Croft approached Hensen's genius with the puppets. Half of today's pleasure is that the actor / actress is still alive ???? I only hope that Frank Oz and Dave Goelz, as well as the rest of the surviving Muppeteers, will somehow save and revive Kermit and Company from the deadly grip of Disney.
