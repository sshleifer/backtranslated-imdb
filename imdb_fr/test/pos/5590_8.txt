Who won the Oscar for best actress for 1933? It should have been Laura Hope Crewes for her beautiful portrait of the most monstrous mother of all time. She's really one of the great character actresses of all time. She played the frivolous Prudence Duvernoy in "Camille" (1936) and her most memorable role is that of Aunt Pittypat in "Gone With the Wind". <br /> <br /> Irene Dunne was the "official" star of the movie scenes with Laura Hope Crewes were dynamite. <br /> <br /> David (Joel McCrea) is in Heidelberg when he is offered a job in New York. His wife, Christine (Irene Dunne) can continue her studies at the Rockafellar Center. Their first stop in America is a visit to David's mother, Ms. Phelps. To say that Laura Hope Crewes dominates every scene is an underreporting. From the very first moment - in a frenzied effort to greet her "big boy" - all the attention is on her. Even sitting at the tea table, when she forgets about Hester's existence, or even how she takes her tea, you know something is wrong. (Hester has been living here for a while.) <br /> Frances Dee is completely sweet and so good in her role as the adorable Hester. Her performance in this film, especially the scene where she had a nervous breakdown and its consequences, proves how much she was underestimated as an actress. <br /> <br /> All the young actors are excellent. Eric Linden is as beautiful as Robert, the younger son who realizes that his mother is horrible but can not do anything to escape the charm of his mother. Joel McCrea said at one point "painting roses on bathtubs - it's more your style". There is a very subtle suggestion in Robert's film of sexuality. <br /> <br /> Irene Dunne is excellent in any movie or genre she has tried.
