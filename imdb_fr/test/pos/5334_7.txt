The first feature film featuring characters from Aardman, Wallace and Gromit, incorporates elements from the previous half-hour show aired on television. <br /> <br /> Wallace runs a company that is trying to humanly capture thieving rabbits. vegetable gardens and has the brilliant idea of ​​trying his invention on unlucky rabbits once they are caught. Of course, as in other Wallace and Gromit movies, things do not go as planned. <br /> <br /> As in A Close Shave, there is a love affair for Wallace, in this case the Lady Posh village, and a big bad villain with a bull dog. Gromit is beautifully animated with a wide range of expressions that make the character laugh. And of course, Peter Sallis gives Wallace's voice again and suits him perfectly. <br /> <br /> And as in A Grand Day Out, cheese plays a prominent role in comedy as the film progresses. <br /> <br /> On the downside, this film is a bit long. There are big effects, and some pieces make you sit around watching, but this story might have worked better as a short subject rather than pushing it further.
