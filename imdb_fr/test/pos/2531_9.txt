It was really a "nightmare" of a movie; I saw it nine years ago on cable television and I have not forgotten it since. Pixote is a 10-year-old boy who lives on the streets of Sao Paulo, Brazil, and leads a criminal life with his teenage friends Lilica, Dito and Chico. they steal, support, sell drugs and murder to survive every day ... In the first half of the film, Pixote is arrested by the police and sent to a sadistic foster home where he witnesses all the abuses committed by older inmates and guards with the rest of the children; One night, Lilica's boyfriend is killed after being beaten. Pixote and his friends decide to escape during a riot. The rest of the film shows Pixote's descent into a criminal life; he shows no feelings or remorse after killing someone, perhaps because he knows that good feelings are of no use in the world in which he lives ... But there is however a sweet scene in the middle of the film; Pixote and his friends are at the beach, missing (and wishing) one of his friends from the recovery center that was there. I thought it was a poetic and melancholy scene in the middle of all these horrible events ... boys obviously aspire not only to their friend, but to a better life. Filmmaker Hector Babenco's "Pixote" is a courageous and depressing film that does not hesitate to show the hardest reality that many people - including myself - tend to ignore or misunderstand. This movie will probably open your eyes and make you a better and more compassionate person.
