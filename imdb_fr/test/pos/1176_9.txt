I was totally surprised by the quality of this film, because when I saw it for the first time, I was only slightly amused! I must say, however, that I am still very disappointed that Donald O'Connor did not have a bigger and better role! He was a huge talent. <br /> <br /> There is great chemistry among all the main members of the cast and Matthau has never been so funny. <br /> <br /> I am extremely pleased that this photo was made because we see Lemmon and Matthau teaming up for the last time; in a vehicle that puts their talent to good use. Brent Spiner proves that "Data" from Star Trek the Next Geeration is not the only good character he can play. <br /> <br /> The scenario is very simple, but the comedy and the characters work really well and I laughed heartily throughout this film and I highly recommend it.
