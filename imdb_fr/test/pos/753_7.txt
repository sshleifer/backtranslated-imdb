Nurse Charlotte Beale (the lovely Rosie Holotik) arrived at Dr. Stephens' clinic for the lunatics ready for a new job. What she does not expect to do is find another presumed doctor at her post after Stephens was attacked by the manic "judge", wielding his ax, Oliver W Cameron (.. in a gag in the race, whenever he faces a situation out of his control, he retires to repeat his name). This doctor is Geraldine Masters (Annabelle Weenick). She does not know if Beale is right for them. After a long discussion about the post (which is a rather delicate scene because the two debates on sending a letter by Stephens to Beale sending him a job at the clinic with Masters often reminding him that he is no longer in charge), Masters agrees to leave her In the nursing profession, the good doctor may not be what she seems to be. <br /> <br /> The assortment of loonies includes Sam (Bill McGee), a simple-minded child-man who was the last victim of Stephens lobotomy, Jennifer (Harryette Warren), a woman who needs an adult to comfort her as she wallows in the heels of Masters, like a puppy, Danny (Jessie Kirby), an inconvenience that often tries to steal the disordered Harriet fake baby (Camilla Carr). ), Allyson (Betty Chandler) a sexy nympho who just wants to be loved and jumps in front of any man she sees, and "Sergeant" Jaffee (Hugh Feagin) your typical case of soldier who did not escape the madness of the war. <Br/> <br /> The film shows the unorthodox methods of Masters to run the clinic and allow patients to move freely with the doors of all rooms without questioning locks ... and, not to mention, the fact that Oliver is still allowed to walk despite the fact that he cut Dr. Stephens with an ax. And what exactly happened to Dr. Stephens? Ah ha .. <br /> <br /> The trash at the wheel of the Tacky 70 is very fun if you like a distorted cinema brand. I am attracted to bizarre movies about mental rejects because of their unpredictable nature ... you never know what might happen, especially in the event that they are allowed to roam often without supervision. Some consider the budget low as a handicap, but in the case of this film, I think it improves the experience. With cheap photography and low production values ​​(being shot for peanuts in a house in poor condition), this sounds more scary and I felt like a voyeur scrutinizing the madness through an outside lens looking towards.
