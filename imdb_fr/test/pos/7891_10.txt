I finally saw the real reason why Peter Boyle became famous. It was not the monster of "Young Frankenstein" nor the grumpy Frank Barone in "Everybody Loves Raymond". For the youngest people who only know him from television, try this film, it makes Frank look like a saint. <br /> <br /> "Joe" is Boyle in his best acting role and, as someone mentioned, probably gave him inspiration for "Archie Bunker" on "All In The Family" ". I think Boyle even went back to "Joe" a bit to play Frank. (I say that because I noticed that the basement of "Joe" and that of Frank Barone were similar.) <br /> <br /> I did not know anything about this movie when I took it out of the library, I just knew Boyle and Susan Sarandon were introduced. Yes, Susan looks great here and, for a young actress, a very good role at first. A young hippie who wants to flee, escapes from his parents' house and lives with, the ultimate lost in a hippy fog caused by a drug, which also sells as much as he buys. <br /> <br /> After an almost fatal overdose on too many pills, she is hospitalized while her parents go to collect her belongings, her mother will not go to the sad flowing apartment, but her father does. While Dad picks up his things, his boyfriend comes home and the two words are exchanged, then the father does what we hear later, Joe says he would like to have a hippie. <br /> <br /> Joe shoots him. to say how much he hates different cultures / races, hippies and a laundry list of others. When he says, "I'd really like to kill one of them," the father (trying to make him look like he's laughing) says, "I just did it." Joe almost buys it but also takes it funny. <br /> <br /> Later, when the police are on the scene and the story is in the paper, Joe realizes he's not joking. Instead of nailing the rich to get money by blackmail, he does it, so to speak, to blackmail him. Just wanting him and his wife to "get to know each other," he and his wife. In short, their association is clumsy, but after Sarandon gets wind of what his father has done, the bottom may break. <br /> <br /> As all this is happening in the end, you will have to look for yourself. Although it is more than 35 years ago, the end is something unexpected unless you have already seen the movie, of course. Again, I recommend it especially to those who have not seen it. <br /> <br /> 10 stars for Boyle who does not only play someone totally opposed to his nature, but who shows to others that he is more than just a TV and movie comedy actor .
