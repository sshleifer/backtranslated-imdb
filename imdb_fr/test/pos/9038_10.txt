This film was shot and filmed for the first time in Oxford, Missouri, birthplace of W. Faulkner, place of the 1948 book. Most of the extras were locals. I went to Oxford and that changed a lot. This film presents Will Geer as sheriff; he was then blacklisted. These are the authors and actors of social dramas such as this film and Grapes Of Wrath, which were the target of HUAC a few years later. I do not remember if the actor playing Mallison's boy (Claude Jarman Jr) did something after the Centennial TV series (1978), but he was great in this previous movie. And do not miss Elizabeth Patterson who later played in Little Women.
