WARNING: SPOILER, SPOILER, SPOILER !!!! <br /> <br /> This is written for the spectators who have moved away from "Mood for Love" puzzled and confused on the paths that the main characters choose in life. Reading other reviews and reviews, it seems that many viewers and critics have forgotten some very important details that may have prevented them from enjoying this delicious tease of a movie. <br /> <br /> We are so accustomed to seeing blatant sex in narrations that we forget that there was a time when filmmakers suggested the "nightmare" by simply showing couples wet mouths that were going on sled or in hay to return to the next scene with a domed hose or a big toddler stuck to hip ... "Meet your child". <br /> <br /> The director chose the same nostalgic approach to tell the story of Mr. Chow and Ms. Chan. Last warning ... SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER <br /> <br /> Mr. Chow cheats Ms. Chan by showing her real emotions when they repeat her departure forever. Next scene: Ms. Chan leans her head toward Mr. Chow in the cab and says, "I do not want to go home tonight." Translation: "Let's do it" <br /> <br /> Why then did the couple simply not decide to get rid of their deceitful spouses, divorce, raise their love child and to live happy forever? The answer is that this whole story takes place in Hong Kong in the sixties. A bastard would live in a sad life of shame if he were the son of an adulterous woman, while a "legitimate" child could lead a tragic but noble / honest life if his mother chose to relieve him of his "father" misleading - the invisible Mr. Chan. In short, Mr. Chow and Ms. Chan sacrifice their relationship for the future of their child. <br /> <br /> That's why Mr. Chow, after learning that Ms. Chan lives alone with a little boy, smiles and ends her dream of making Mrs. Chan her Mrs. Chow. He then also realizes why Ms. Chan went to Singapore to be with him, only to return to his starting point and leave ... choosing never to see him again (but not before taking an unidentified memory) Mr. Chow live with this wonderful secret without anyone to tell. Nobody except a ruined temple wall and of course us, the viewer, ... but only if we listen carefully.
