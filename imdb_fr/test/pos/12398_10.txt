I just saw this movie on Showtime in the wee hours of the night. I looked at the beginning with an open eye, but instead of falling asleep, I invested myself in this astute and bitter film. It was very credible and engaging. I could have done without so many blasphemies (as in all of David Mamet's films I see), but I really enjoyed the experience. I know teens swear, but I do not need to listen to it. Anyway, the story contained interesting surprises that I will not reveal, but if you have the chance to see this movie on Showtime, I think you'll enjoy it as much as me.
