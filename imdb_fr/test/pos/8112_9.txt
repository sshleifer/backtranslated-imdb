This film went into production before the start of the Second World War, but was not published until it was well advanced. With significant fascist sympathy in the United States and Chaplin himself suspected of being a sympathizer of communism, The Great Dictator is a very courageous undertaking. Such risks in making films - thinly veiled political statements - would be almost inconceivable today. Imagine the consequences if we made today an equally satirical film that criticized US foreign policy? <br /> <br /> This film is hilarious, poignant and tragic. The tragedy is that Chaplin pleads for madness to end, but it is already too late, for him and for us. To see if you have any interest in history, filmmaking, politics or cinema as art.
