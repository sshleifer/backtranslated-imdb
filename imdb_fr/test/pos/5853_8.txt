I can not believe it can happen at all. We do not know if Justin and Richard were troubled or committed crimes in the past. The film seems to imply that they were not in trouble. So, the first crime they commit is murder? Just to play and jostle with the cops? How can they look for a girl and say that you are? In addition, Richard seems to strangle the woman with little or no effort, nor does the woman seem to struggle. Hmmm. This concept is really hard to believe. That said, let's move on. I was really hating these punks and I would love to be there with my shotgun with tactical police ammunition and see what their plastic suits are doing at that time. As for Cassie, victim of Carl Hudson, she spent a terrible time trying to survive. The memory of being stabbed 17 times by Carl leaves her in an emotional mess. Sandra does a great job as an actor. She must have made me believe she was an angry cop. In terms of solving the crime, I thought it was great. This film kept me planted in my chair. I loved the game of all but Sam. He did not get up and go. The only thing this movie did not need was the love scene or should I say the rape scene.
