Sinatra is beautiful in this film, a dark and painful look at the dangers of drug addiction. Just look at his frenzied fury, howling anger and destructive anger near the end of the movie so that anyone thinks twice before using heroin; maybe they should show this to children in the health class instead of the blind mind that we have to endure year after year. <br /> <br /> This is the story of a man who is simply trying to make a new life for himself after being in prison, trying to get rid of his drug use and his job card merchant in illegal gambling operations, who is shot down, plunged back into the mud by the evils of human nature. He is exploited by his employers, drug traffickers and even by his enigmatic, cunning but stupid wife. <br /> <br /> Even if you did not like the movie itself, it's worth seeing, just for the soundtrack. Everything is heavy, swinging jazz with large sections of drums and brass. That, along with its groovy, but slightly sinister sound, helps create the mood, as well as the snickering and sneaky drug dealers and cards, who always seem to hover like vultures around Frankie Machine. <br /> <br /> I recommend it to anyone - especially if you like black film, zoot costumes, fedoras or jazz.
