It's another good western, which I enjoyed. It's not an epic, but it's good for what it is. It's about 3 trappers friends find themselves in search of a fort which remains the only thing that separates them from an Indian band, which feel the resentment of the Americans on their land and want to take it back. That's the essence of the story. What follows is action, excitement, even a bit of humor and forbidden romance. One of Jed's friends, Gus, reminded me a lot of the character of Quint (played by Robert Shaw) in the movie Jaw. They both have this crisp and gruff attitude. Anyway, if you're a Western fan, you should find a lot of things that please this particular entry. I think she deserves a 7/10
