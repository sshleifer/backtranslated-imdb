Night Gallery never really impressed me, but this episode stands out. <br /> <br /> A television channel manager is auditioning a strange act: a young nerdy boy who makes predictions. The executor considers it a waste of time until both predictions come true the next morning. <br /> <br /> What initially seemed like a show became a hit show because the child's predictions are always accurate. <Br /> <br /> Then, one day, he refuses to do the show. Faced with an hour of imminent spectacle, everyone is at the end of their sentences, even threatening legal action if he does not fulfill his contract and does not make his daily predictions. <br /> <br /> The boy gives in, and predicts a seemingly utopian tomorrow. <After the show, the confused executive asks for an explanation, but only to find out why the complete truth is too terrifying to be revealed.
