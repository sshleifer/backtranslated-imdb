I swear that if I had already tried cocaine, I could perfectly understand this movie. Its pace, as well as the dialogue, emit at a speed that some viewers might need to stop and relax. <br /> <br /> Stunning little elements appear throughout the film, such as how Rob Lowe the character always seems to lose a shoe, or how some characters continue to spiral in his zigzag path. The story was extremely well directed and the direction seems perfect. <br /> <br /> The film smells awkwardness and kindness. This is the one most people would appreciate. A few moments of laughter-very-if-you-are-alone assure me that I will certainly look again.
