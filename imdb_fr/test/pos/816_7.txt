The working girl, Kitty (Sothern) is engaged to Bill (Kelly), who neglects her by working long hours in her garage to save money for their wedding. After being raised on her birthday, Kitty meets a double blind meeting where she meets the heir to a department store, Bob Hartwell (Hamilton). She falls in love, but leaves him when his protestations of love seem to cover his desire to become his mistress rather than his wife. Faithful loyal Bill rallies to comfort her and finally, she gives in to her repeated requests to reinstate their engagement, partly under pressure from her family's support to her family after losing her job. When Bob returns, however, convinced that he wants the wedding after all, will Kitty follow his heart or his conscience? <br /> <br /> This movie was much better than I expected. At first, Bill's character appears as the kind of Irish cartoon that Jack Carson has played so often. But Kelly (and the script) infuses the character with true compassion and love, and Bill turns out to be the best person in the whole group. Viewers could find themselves supporting him against the inevitable Hartwell! However, the tone of the film oscillates between a light romance and a much darker side, especially in the description of a dance marathon and a rather horrific accident in Bill's garage. <br /> <br /> The cast is completed by Jane Darwell as the mother of Kitty, a mischievous yet not completely odious child, Mickey Rooney as younger brother of Kitty, and Spencer Charters as Kitty's father .
