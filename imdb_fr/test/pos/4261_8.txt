Putney Swope tells the story of a symbolic black man sitting on the board of a major advertising firm who was accidentally elected chairman of the board while the firm's owner confesses while trying to stammer a idea of ​​which he was apparently very excited. Putney, of course, takes his new role to heart and fires almost all the staff of the agency, hires a new crew (all blacks, except for a symbolic white man) and sets out to create the most offensive commercials and non-PC that we can never ask. for. Now, his crew is rather heterogeneous and despite this, they succeed in one way or another to succeed while making money. I rather like the scene where potential advertisers are unloaded from their cash bags and then ordered to "go out". And their ads will follow later, like them or not. The story is good but, of course, the highlight here is the ugly advertising, especially that of the "Face Off" acne cream. It's rather old-fashioned, but it's still a fun movie full of hilarious moments. Robert Downey Sr. was working for an advertising agency specializing in experimental advertising at the time and I guess it was his major finger for Madison Avenue agencies. Very good and funny enough funny. 8 out of 10
