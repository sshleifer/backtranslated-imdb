It's a haunting short film. James Franco and Rachel Miner offer performances that hurt, sound right and stay with you. As it's called a tragic story, it's not really a spoiler. But I wanted to change the result, even if it suits the story, because I had already come to worry about these people. I can only think of a few short films that have had this effect on me. Beautifully shot, played, edited. High caliber work at all levels, even the use of good sound and / or good music to advance the story. The final credit song finished the job, pulling me even more emotion. It's the first thing from start to finish. Congratulations to the screenwriter / director and everyone involved. <br /> <br /> This is my first review of a movie in the comments section. I promised to do it in exchange for a copy of the DVD. Criticism could be good or bad, just my honest opinion. That's it and it's the least I can do. I'm so glad I could see him.
