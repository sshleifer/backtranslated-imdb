This is one of Stan Laurel's best solo comedies, before 1927 with Oliver Hardy. Laurel is a very good actor in the film and provides a good comedy. The best scene of the film takes place when Stan dances with Mae Laurel (his common law wife) at Caf√© Espanol. Stan does funny things, without hearing the music. I will recommend it to all Stan Laurel fans.
