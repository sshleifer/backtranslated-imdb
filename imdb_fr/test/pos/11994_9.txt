Everyone is entitled to an opinion. The only criticism that counts is yourself. I think it's a good movie. Much better than the original. <br /> <br /> In "Caddyshack", Rodney Dangerfield is funny, but obnoxious. He was asked to do the following, but things got bothered. Jackie Mason shows the saying that "less is more". He is funny, but a man with real family problems, a more complete person. This is not a drama, but a film that makes you feel. In fact, on some points, you feel sorry for Jackie Mason, especially when her daughter left him. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is good and, overall, a good sorry. A good ending for the series. <br /> <br /> In the TV show "Alf", Alf says he cried in "Terms of Endearment". The woman, Kate Tanner, played by Anne Schedeen, also said that he cried at "Caddyshack 2".
