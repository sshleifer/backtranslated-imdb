The name "Lucio Fulci" brings together images of graphic death and mutilation in the minds of May fans. Through films like "Zombi 2," "The City of the Living Dead," "The Beyond" and "The New York Ripper," Fulci has the reputation of being one of the most goretic directors in history . And although many of his subsequent films certainly justified his reputation until the release of "Zombi 2" in 1979, Fulci's films did not contain the amount of blood and courage he knew, in fact, they were for most without gore, rely on more traditional shocks and disturbing images to work. "Do not Torture a Duckling" contains almost no gore, yet it ranks at its best. <br /> <br /> "Do not Torture a Duckling" takes place in a small Sicilian town where superstition reigns instead of logic. City dwellers are very suspicious of strangers and anyone, often avoiding them. After a series of child murders although many people descend on the city, including Andrea Martelli (Thomas Milan) who tries to discover the truth about the murders while they occur. <br /> <br /> It's a remarkable film. This is very well done with an excellent cast filled with many favorites from the Italian operating cinema. It also contains a solid score as well as many creative courtesies of the camera movement or Lucio Fulci. But the real draw of "Do not Torture Duckling" is the unsettling nature of the film. Young children, about twelve years old, are shown mocking the backlog, visiting prostitutes and being offered sex by an older woman. It also contains very harsh comments on the middle class and the Catholic Church. It's for reasons like this that "Do not Torture a Duckling" was blacklisted across Europe on its first release and has never been broadcast in the United States. However, "Do not torture a duckling" is a monumental achievement in the cinema giallo, as well as the best work of Lucio Fulci. I really can not recommend it enough, check it out.
