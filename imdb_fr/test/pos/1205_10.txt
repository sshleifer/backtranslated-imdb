Now more than ever, we need Peace & Love in this world! <br /> <br /> This film really showcases the wonderful music of the Broadway show and the fabulous choreography of the legendary Twila Tharp! I saw him again after many years and he still looks good. <br /> <br /> Thanks to MGM / UA for putting it on DVD! I love the option to see in widescreen. MGM is a fan of this in many DVD releases. <br /> <br /> You must love treating Williams as Berger and John Savage as Claude. They could not have chosen better actors and actresses for this film! Beverly D'Angelo is a "hot mother" in this movie - I forgot how hot it was! WOW! <br /> <br /> The distribution is great, <br /> <br /> with the late great late Nell Carter in a couple of scenes, as well as the crazy Charlotte Ray (Ms Garrett on 'Facts Of Life') <br /> <br /> History has weakened a little towards the end, but the anti-war sentiment of the late 1960s is still relevant and is still relevant today. <br /> <br /> It is beautifully filmed (not bad on site) and is so colorful and charming and really brings back the spirit of 1968 on the big screen. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie when it was released in 1979 when I was 15 and was moved at the time, and it still moves me to 40 years old. Other critics here say they think it should have been done earlier - I do not think Hollywood was ready to do such a movie in the late '60s and early' 70s. <br /> < The Vietnam War ended in 1975, and everything turned a little too close to home, I think this story must be filmed before it was (as in 1969, 70, 71). > <br /> Congratulations to Director Milos Foreman! I love that movie !!!!!!! <br /> <br /> It's nice to see him again, this time on DVD. He never seemed better!
