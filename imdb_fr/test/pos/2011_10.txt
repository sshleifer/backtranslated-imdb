It was a classic of modern television! The story goes like this, Bob has a girlfriend named Alicia. Bob and Alicia are in love and want to get married. Bob has a bud named Owen with whom he works. Owen is jealous of Alicia. He likes to hang out with Bob. Now, Owen hangs out with Bob and Alicia. Bob and Owen have a secretary named Heather. Heather is very prone to accidents. She is also, if you have not guessed it, quite lonely. She also hangs out with Bob, Alicia and Owen. Sometimes Alicia wanted Bob to have no friends. <br /> <br /> At the end of the first season, it seemed that Owen had ended up finding a real long-time girlfriend. Bob and Alicia drove the night before their wedding, driving into a small car and getting bogged down. Go out in the middle of nowhere! What happened next? And poor Heather? Has someone married? Sorry, the series is over. <br /> <br /> Even a TV Guide call did not prompt FOX to think twice before putting it back on the air. It was a big show with a big distribution. I also liked Heather. She looked cool in those glasses and was hilarious. I miss this show a lot. It's like reading a good book with the missing ending ...... sad.
