This is not a bad movie, but the acting and the scenario can be better. I like this film because my life is largely similar to that of the movie. It is difficult for a lost generation to make a living in Romania, and 90% of us choose something else, which includes dealing with people with "bad habits" if you understand me, but that comes with the territory . this film represents me and I like it. I have a rage in me that I speak with barley people, I live in a messy society and I can not fit in and I do not want, and that's the story of the film too, so you r like me, you can understand the real movie, otherwise you will find it easy and cheap.
