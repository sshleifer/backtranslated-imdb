What a surprise. A basic copier of the classic comedy "The Nutty Professor" only more naughty. The funny guy Tim Thomerson (who steals the show under the pseudonym Blinkin in Robin Hood) is completely hilarious like Dr. Jekyll, the anal retender, and the crazy sex madman, Hyde. <br /> <br /> The funniest scene is where Dr. Lanyon (Mark Blankfield) catches Jekyll in bed with his daughter and tells him: <br /> <br /> "how dare you take advantage of my innocent girl. "<br /> <br /> Jekyll responds:" But, sir, I'm going ahead with the operation. "<br /> <br /> Lanyon replies," oh well in this case fu * * your brain out !!! "
