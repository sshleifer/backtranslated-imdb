Well, I can say that I am human, Wong. And I did not vomit. I laughed. And laughed. If this movie made you throw up, there is something wrong with you. But this movie is amazing. I bought it four days ago and have already watched it 5 times. Animal cruelty takes my heart, but not long enough to be guilty. The film is shocking, disgusting and vulgar. The acting is horrible. What else do you want from a movie? I am a maniac of cult cinema. Pink Flamingos is great. As someone said, Rocky Horror looks like teletubbies.
