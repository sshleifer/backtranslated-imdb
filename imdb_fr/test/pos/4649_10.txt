This is my favorite movie of all time !!! <br /> <br /> I remember seeing him when I was younger and since then I like him a lot. I used to rent it so often in this video store that carried it, and when we moved, I could not find it, so I went to the remote store just to watch the movie again! Finally, I found it for sale and I bought it and watched again and again .... great movie! <br /> <br /> Since then, it was my very first DVD I had after having my DVD player ... OK and well I had them at the same time, the quality of the DVD is much better I could not believe it! You must see this one!
