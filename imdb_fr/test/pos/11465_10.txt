This is an excellent horror movie for people who do not want all that gore and sensationalism. This film has the same level of horror, suspense, humor and even a bit of light nudity, but nothing big. Linnea Quigley is not on top, as she was in "Return of the Living Dead" where she danced naked in a crypt, but she is still essentially the same slutty character. Cathy Podewell is a virginal and chaste character before moving to "Dallas" and we are also introduced to Amelia [soon Mimi] Kinkade, the sexy and sinister mistress who would be dark. When she and Linnea are owned and tend to the house, they revive the bodies of their dead friends to scare the survivors. I've heard a lot of people compare this movie to "The Evil Dead," but this film is a rival to this one in the same way that Freddie was competing with Jason. This series of films is however much better than that one!
