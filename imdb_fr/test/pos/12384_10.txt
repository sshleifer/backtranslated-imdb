Seriously, I do not really understand why people here denigrate him. I mean, <br /> <br /> the idea of ​​a killer snowman ravaging a tropical island paradise is pretty absurd. The good news is that producers have understood and made it a comedy in the spirit of Army of Darkness. <br /> <br /> Especially in the second half of the movie, when the little killer attacks snowballs, I burst out laughing. For example, put one of the small ingredients in a blender (Gremlins 1) and mix it. After that, he turns into a snowball and screams in a shrill voice "It was fun!" <br /> <br /> Finally, an incredible movie, praise it.
