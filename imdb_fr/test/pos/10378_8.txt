Do not expect a classic military comedy that pretends to make fun of the military while reinforcing a militaristic perspective. Instead, he deconstructs the elements that make the military such a deadly machine. A kind of East German version of "Buffalo Soldiers". <br /> <br /> "NVA" operates at a meta-level that makes it understandable for hero's attempts to escape from the military exercise, to the extent possible. It's not about noisy laughter, but persistent smiles. Utopian, of course (in a scene we will show you the hard reality), but very thoughtful. <br /> <br /> Just to complete the 10 required lines: Do not go into this movie if you've been an army officer and loved your job.
