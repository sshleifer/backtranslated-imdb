I lack vision cable and I have more "DirecTV". So, being a rural resident, I have to wait for the DVD versions. Being a lover of blondes but not blondes, I have of course not only "Barb Wire", but I have "Stripperella: The Complete First Season". I have not yet found a "VIP" or second season for Stripperella. I have the DVD "Baywatch Hawaiian Wedding". I have the "Playboy" questions that Pamela Denise Anderson asked. I could go on. I love Pamela! There is nobody or anything that makes me feel guilty about Stripperella. But there are some things I do not like, but I live with them, because other series describe smoking and drinking too, sometimes. But these are my personal peeves and I try not to let them spoil the fun of a series like this for me. The change of animation style surprised me, but I adapted myself. However, the amount of female nudity has decreased, which is a big disappointment, because we expect a lot in a series with a premise like this. But here again I adapted. One of my favorite episodes of "Mork & Mindy" was when they met Robin Williams! So of course, one of my favorite "Striperella" episodes is when Pamela & Tommy visit the club and the comparison begins! If there is really a "Season 2", I hope to find it, because to complete, I have to complete my collection. I recommend it for other fans of the female form and lovers of blondes. (Hey! Psst! "Blonde" and "blondes" are the feminine form to spell "blonde"! Your software should already know it!)
