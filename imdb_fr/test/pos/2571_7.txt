In "Black Snake Moan", screenwriter-director Craig Brewer is so obsessed with the heavy symbolism that part of me has wanted to dismiss the film as a whole pretentious - a stifling parable of the South with a subject so risk. The film also contains a heavy spiritual subtext where religion is being introduced into the image - again, it is integrated without subtlety. After the darker opening scenes, the film gets dulled more and more until all the production comes with the artificial quality of a play (and I admit that the last 15 minutes are going too well far in the territory of "Happy Ending" for my taste). And this should not mention the archive footage of the musician Son House, ruminating on love and death (and heavily announcing upcoming events, of course). Yet, in a strange way, these demerits are also qualities of "Black Snake Moan," the story of Lazarus growing old (Samuel L. Jackson), recently dropped by his wife (for his brother, no less), who falls almost dead nympho Rae (Christina Ricci, easily giving the most prominent portrait of trailer waste on celluloid); By taking care of the girl's health, he attaches her to her radiator to defeat her demons and, hopefully, redeem herself. While Ricci falls into ruin from her skinny outfits, her performance is risky and mature - not a trace of Wednesday Addams to regain, and she easily holds her head with Jackson, who personifies "the blues" in her portrayal of an imperfect man , God fearing. The scene where Lazare sings a song in Rae in the midst of a storm / power outage is compelling, as is a scene inside a show jumping club that makes you want to find you . The frame is solid, and the literal symbolism (the chain, the radiator, the strange hazy man who haunts Rae's libido) can be highlighted as a deliberate consequence of superstition and spirituality. And it's the conviction with which this spirituality is played that gives "Black Snake Moan" much of its strength - Jackson and Ricci's committed performances make it a film that goes from heartbreaking to edifying with, finally, a grace flawless. Although Justin Timberlake's jealous lover is a conspiracy I could not do without, neither he nor the subtly sledgehammer can prevent this film from being a fascinating meditative film.
