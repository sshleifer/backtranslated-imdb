I would like to tell you a few things before considering seeing this movie. If at some point you think you've seen a good camera job, be prepared to be surprised by this movie. For the record, this film was shot in 1957 in Russia, but the technique used here is probably something we saw much later in the western world ... about 20 years later. The level of emotion through the film varies a lot: happiness - war of love - despair - joy, but in the end you stay with something quite unique: the joy of seeing a masterpiece of cinema. Young filmmakers of our time should study more of these kinds of films and they may be able to create something similar. Even though I think movies like this are very difficult to find ... If you've seen "I'm Cuba", then this movie would please you a lot, but otherwise, get ready for a unique experience. Russian filmmakers have something in common: very small budgets, great actors and a joy of creating art ... and they are able to create more masterpieces than the Western world combined. I'm not a big fan of Russia, in fact I hate everything communist, but filming in this part of the world manages to create such feelings difficult to describe. <br /> <br /> Enjoy it. <br />
