I do not have much to say, it is an excellent finish of the story. Most people said there was not enough intrigue and it was just good for the eyes. But think about it, everything was explained in FFVII, you can not add intrigue to a story as great as it would ruin it. They did their best and I think it should be considered as a final FMV .. the last fight. <br /> <br /> Chart - 10/10, Absolutely Amazing <br /> <br /> History 8.5 / 10 - Do not think they could enlarge it further. And the thing they could do was pretty smart, I thought. <br /> <br /> Characters 9/10 - Most of them have already been explained during the game, but still have not been treated in 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> Sound - 10/10, since I'm a fan of metal, I loved fighting music .. and the piano only comes in there .. It's a great ST And I was not disappointed. <br /> <br /> Tilt / Replay 10/10 - Nice every time. <br /> <br /> General - 9/10 (FF Fan View 10/10) <br /> <br /> Personally, I think that's what was needed, a fight to put an end to all this .. the plot was already in place. The action was necessary as much as the people complained. I loved every second of this movie. It was a pleasure to visit the world of FFVII one last time. <br /> <br /> Remember this .. most movies that have been created from a game have been made by filmmakers. I think it's good enough for a team of game directors .. Do not think I saw a better movie game .. <br /> <br /> Thank you Square, I think you did well things!
