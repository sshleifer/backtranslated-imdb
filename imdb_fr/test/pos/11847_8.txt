I was very impressed by this film, if only for comedy. It may not have been the sharpest and most witty humor of all time, but I thought it suited all scenes. the characters are feeling. Sometimes we watch a little slapstick and other scenes revolve around a decisive discourse on relationships. It may sound a little frustrating for some viewers, but it has brought me closer to the dilemmas of the irregular chaos of the characters. <br /> <br /> The acting game is great for everyone. I'm a big fan of Andy Richter, but I was not crazy about that role, contrary to what everyone seems to be. He was very successful, but Julianne Nicholson and Lauren Graham stole the show, each in their own way. Jay Mohr plays as expected, if you've seen it in other movies. I have always loved him. <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie is very entertaining and provides a good foundation for a few types of relationships. Some movies try to surprise with respect to issues and relationship issues. The conclusions proposed here are not surprising, but it is amusing to see them reveal themselves throughout the film.
