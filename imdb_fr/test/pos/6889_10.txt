Hello everyone! The best drama of all time is now on Gospel Music Channel! Visit their website to check the program and find the number on your cable or satellite. It was one of my favorite shows that was growing. He has everything I want from a TV show, a family-friendly drama that does not disgust me. The story of a man who, after losing his job, decides to leave for a great cross-country adventure. Along the way, they meet all kinds of interesting people and find themselves in the middle of all kinds of problems. This show was originally a spin-off of Touched By An Angel, another very good family show. Make sure to check!
