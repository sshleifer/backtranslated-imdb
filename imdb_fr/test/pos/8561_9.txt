I agree that this film has perfectly achieved its objectives. I saw him at Showtime late at night as a teenager, and still in college. I thought it was funny. And there are breasts everywhere! It looks like in the late '70s and' 80s, many movies of this type were made, ranging from R-rated movies like "Porkys" to "Soft Au Core Girls"; it's a shame that they seem to have lost the rating in terms of popularity. What made HOTS great is that, as in the previous two movies, it's a lot of fun. HOTS is like a female version of "Animal House", where girls form a kind of sorority and engage in the night on campus. Note that anyone who designed the "Hooters" girls' outfits certainly saw this movie.
