There is this whole horror theory that some people adhere closely to the fact that monsters and violence must stay out of the screen. Park Chan-Wook throws this concept completely out of the window and shows what he wants - and what he wants to show is about everything he can think of. Leaving actors and dialogue to create subtlety, Park seems ready to do anything to get his message across. Whether it's long scenes together with the camera running around a mahjong table or whole weeks limited to a single shot between two scenes, dialogue between the scenes before and after the bloodletting, Park does not does not stick to a specifically structured style but focuses more on narrating the entire story of a couple's relationship, from virginal revolt to total co-dependence for self-annihilation - and uses vampirism as link and priesthood as drama. It's as simple as that and complex at the same time. <br /> <br /> You must pay tribute to him. Too many people are willing to compare any modern vampire movie to Twilight, Twilight being almost always the least of the works, but here the stories are actually comparable, but this one is more raw and honest. Nothing of this glow comes into the window at night to talk about shit, but nothing from the dirtiest, most desperate and most virginal scene to eventual spousal abuse when the two protagonists start arguing over power . It's the same thing - a boy and a girl meet, a girl discovers that this guy is a vampire, decides to join him anyway, but without happiness, just spend a little time as they are forced to keep one for the other. short of options. The motivations of the girl are particularly interesting, because we desperately need power and attention, a fault, upset by the guy who just wants to lead a good life as best he can under the circumstances, but who is a hypocrite who can not admit that he simply uses his vampirism as an excuse to act against his moral training. <br /> <br /> The film is not perfect and it tends to stretch (there is no structure in three acts, in five acts, or acts here, but scene after scene Park Chan-Wook is willing to show everything in a frank and honest manner while ravishing the awful sensibilities of tension and gore, and also provides an expert soundtrack to hit emotional highs fairly effectively too. > <br /> --PolarisDiB
