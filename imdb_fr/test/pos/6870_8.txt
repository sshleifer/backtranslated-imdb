It's a shame, House Calls is not better known. Is it perhaps because romantic chefs are mature, worn out at the store and fearful as guns, rather than excessive teenage stars? Could be. If you are over 35, you will probably have this comedy. If you are over 45, you are really going to have this comedy. If you are 25, wait until you are older to see it. <br /> <br /> The unlikely pairing of Matthau and Jackson works precisely because it is so improbable. There's a wonderful Matthau line that sums up what's going on between them: "I like old titles because you do not have to explain who Ronald Coleman is." (If it's not the exact line, it's close ...) <br /> <br /> The hypothesis of a substandard hospital run by incompetent sounds right. The portrait of a senile chief surgeon by Art Carney is absolutely brilliant. It's impossible not to burst out laughing on delivery. Secondary intrigues, if you can call them that, are also fun, as between Matthau and Jackson's teenage son. Everything hits exactly the right tone. <br /> <br /> Okay, Matthau has to wear women's clothes that are a bit exaggerated and easy to wear. But still - it's Walter Matthau lying around! It's funny!
