If Western Union is not exactly the true story of the construction of the Transcontinental Telegraph, it certainly reflects the spirit and dedication of the people involved in the project. <br /> <br /> Dean Jagger is responsible and one day he is thrown off a horse and fractured ribs. Randolph Scott, a fugitive outlaw, finds Jagger and is ready to steal his horse, but changes his mind and has helped him out. Later, he is hired by Western Union and works for Jagger. <br /> <br /> Jagger also hires a young man from the east, played by Robert Young, an engineer. Young makes one of his rare films borrowed from MGM for 20th Century Fox. Young and Scott become friends, but rivals for Jagger's sister, Virginia Gilmore. <br /> <br /> Western Union has a lot of action, enough to satisfy all Western fans. The telegraph crew has to deal with work problems among outlaws, Indians and your garden. <br /> <br /> Slim Summerville as a shy cook and Victor Killian as a border character charged with protecting him have some of the funniest scenes. They both provide a good comic relief. <br /> <br /> Fritz Lang got good performances from his casting and moved the film forward quickly. Western Union is a solid Western entertainment.
