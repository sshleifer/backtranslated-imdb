I'm a fan of horror movies, and it must be one of the most phenomenal horror movies I've ever seen. The plot is totally original (who else would think a city totally obsessed with a certain symbol that goes to death and madness?), The special effects are incredible and the cinematography could not be better. Some may find this disturbing, but that does not mean it's a bad movie. It is also a good point. The spiral symbol is a bit ubiquitous. The spiral notebook, the spiral shells, the spirals on the cakes. Of all the shapes they could have used (square, triangle, trapeze, rectangle), it was one of the best choices. If you can find this movie, go see it. It is certainly unique and quite unforgettable.
