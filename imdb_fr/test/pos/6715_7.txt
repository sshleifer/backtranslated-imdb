The life force begins in the space where HMS Churchill follows Haley's comet and its equipment detects an alien vessel 150 km long in the comet's head, unable to contact the Earth due to interference. Colonel Tom Carlsen (Steve Railsback) decides that this is the one and only solution. chance to investigate. Exit outside in a spacesuit Carlsen and some of his crew enter the mysterious spaceship and discover the remains of a bat resembling a race of creatures and three humanoids in the perfect look, two men (Chris Jagger and Bill Malin) and a magnificent woman (Mathilda May), all they take aboard the Churchill. Thirty days later and back on Earth, the Churchill is detected on the radar, a rescue mission is sent to discover that the spaceship is in flames and that the entire crew is dead. The rescue team found the three humanoid extraterrestrials and brought them back to Earth where, in a space research center in London, they resuscitated and began to literally suck the life force of the human victims who must in turn do the same. that the epidemic is spreading throughout London ... <br /> <br /> This English production was produced by the famous Menahem Golan & Yoram Globus who, in the early 80's, were responsible for many of the films of Low-budget action under their Cannon production company, usually featuring Chuck Norris. They wanted to get into the big movie and signed director Tobe Hooper for a contract of three films (which were Lifeforce, the invaders of Mars (1986) and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 (1986), a sequel to Hooper's own classic ), all of which went bankrupt and almost went bankrupt Golan & Globus & Cannon was gone. Anyway, despite the fact that I'm a box office flop, I must say that I think Lifeforce is a horror of science fiction extremely pleasant, although rather ridiculous. In 1985, when it was released in theaters, Lifefore was reduced to 101 minutes by Golan & Globus, but in recent years, the longer version of 116 minutes has replaced it on DVD, VHS, Laserdisc & TV, although apparently the original version of Hooper the movie lasted 128 minutes, so there are still more sequences somewhere. I will base my comments on the longer 116-minute cup, Dan O'Bannon's script, Don Jakoby, and Michael Armstrong & Olaf Pooley's uncredited rewrites based on Colin Wilson's 1976 novel 'The Space Vampires'. many extraordinary works. ideas, its scope is really ambitious and it was felt that it ended up being a bit of a mess, but a very entertaining hell. It moves forward like a rocket. Basically, there is a really interesting story here, even if the film is bogged down. There are also hilarious moments in Lifeforce, the scene where the security guard tries to convince the naked Vampire woman to surrender by offering him a half-eaten biscuit, a real classic of the camp, the scenes of hypnosis horribly crushed , including the one where Railsback ends up kissing Patrick Stewart and many more. I do not know, tell me weird, but I thought that Lifeforce was extremely entertaining and entertaining in every respect: weird dialogues, weird dialogues, strange ideas that never met, and some great visuals. A film that will annoy you. <br /> <br /> The director Hooper had about more money here (more than he had for Poltergeist (1982) himself) and he puts all the time to profit carry this spectacular film on big screen, John Dykstra, the head of Star Wars (1977), Star Trek: the movie (1979) and more recently, Spider-Man (2002) was invited to handle the visual effects and, in general, they have looks fabulous. The sequences that take place in space, especially spaceships, look great. There are also very good visual effects on Earth, including the destruction of London as hundreds of blue souls fly everywhere. There is nudity but not a lot of blood, there are dead corpses, some gunshot wounds, someone's skin is peeling off, blood spews out of someone's eyes, nose and ears, and there is a severed arm and zombies. The makeup special effects are also usually very good. I would not say that Lifeforce is scary as such, it's more of a sci-fi movie than a horror movie. I liked the way Hooper turns footage from the outside as he constantly turns his camera to effectively capture the feeling of weightlessness A "solid" ground so to speak. <br /> <br /> With a supposed budget of about $ 25,000,000, he did less than half of his theatrical performance and did not burn the world on video or DVD, which is a shame . because even if it's a little mess, it's very pleasant to watch. Shot in England. Well filmed in widescreen 2: 35: 1 format, the 4: 3 cropped image is awful and cuts huge amounts of information on both sides of the screen. This is particularly noticeable during opening scenes that take place in space, where it is sometimes difficult to distinguish. what happens and the meaning of the immensity of space and the extraterrestrial spaceship is lost. In a very stupid film, Patrick Stewart replaces Sir John Gielgud, Nancy Paul replaces Olivia Hussey, Frank Finlay replaces Klaus Kinski and Anthony Hopkins declines the role of Caine. <br /> <br /> Lifeforce is a weird movie, not two ways really & anyone looking for something simple and straightforward should look elsewhere. Anyone looking for something a little different in the kind of science fiction than trying Lifeforce is one of those movies so bad that they are good movies with awesome effects and that's not your average movie.
