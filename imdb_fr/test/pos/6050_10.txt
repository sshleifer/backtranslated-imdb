Semper Fi! I saw "The D.I." in 1957. Two and a half years later, I joined the Corps. <br /> <br /> Web and the company had done their best in 1957. Boot, in 1959, looked more exactly like the Boot Camp shown in "Full Metal Jacket" - Yes. A black rookie in my training platoon was called "Snowball". My name was "Stick", because I was skinny like a rail. Each recruit had a nickname, sometimes rather vile, that held him through his service in the Corps. To be hit or hit on the ass when we messed up was SOP. "Give up and give me fifty," it must be great. Then, it turned into: "Give up and give me two cents!" <br /> <br /> DIs were a bunch of sadistic bastards, but it was a sadism controlled us stupid MoFos alive when we hit the fight. 200 years of experience were rooted in this "sadism" and all that the ID had, or said, had a purpose suited to its mission. <br /> <br /> A bad D.I. gets grunts killed. A good D.I., although apparently the biggest asshole in the world, keeps them alive. You can not kill the enemy if you are dead. <br /> <br /> In case you do not know, the Marine Corps has a main mission: Kill the enemy. PFD. <br /> <br /> Everything else is pure bravo sierra. <br /> <br /> MstGySgt WHT, USMC (ret)
