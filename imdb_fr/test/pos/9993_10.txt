if you watch it at home on DVD or Blu-ray! make sure you have a good sound system. it's the musical score that makes you move in the movie. I watched the movie several times and found it great, but after an upgrade to my home theater audio system, what a difference. I will watch this movie again and again. <br /> <br /> If you do not have a good sound system. Find a friend who does it and watch him there. <br /> <br /> also look at the additional stories and extras that accompany it (the BR or DVD). finance ... but for those moments, only boys have it. Today, I hope that part will go to girls .......
