having never seen anything on the part of this person worshiped by the Luvvies, let alone a production of Venice merchant, I can not say how faithful he is to the previous adaptations of the piece, so I will treat it like another film that tries to be more than ever novocaine for the eye MoV is an enthralling film about a young lover, bassanio (fiennes), his merchant friend antonio (irons) and a jewish money lender, shylock (pacino) . <br /> <br /> Summary of the scenario <br /> bassiano is broke and needs money to seduce the charming portia (collins), he goes to see his friend antonio, who talks with his difficult situation , so borrows money on shylock now <br /> antonio does not do it like the Jews in general and the Shylock in particular and the Shylock bitter and twisted by the abuse of which it was victim, and the Christians in general agree to lend the money to Antonio provided that if Antonio does not repay the loan by the agreed deadline, Shylock cut a pound of flesh Antonios body <br /> <br /> comment <br /> <br /> > the film is breathtaking, it is played and spoken so as to make you think about the meaning of each line, which in turn causes the viewer to understand the characters and their motivations <br /> <br /> he seems to me that this is a movie about shylock choices and how bad choices m lead to the ruin of shylocks <br /> <br /> moment shylock asks for his pound of flesh he is doomed, because the rest of the world is against him and wants to cause his loss <br /> <br /> This has me much disturbed, normally in a movie where a victim has a chance of revenge against those who have hurt him, that the victim succeeds or shows the villain to the error of his way leading to a big hug <br /> < not in MoV the victim quickly becomes considered the villain and is stripped of his fortune and faith <br /> <br /> this film is a powerful and subtle representation of the occasional anti-Semitism that shows how an entire society can minority and give the impression that the victim is really the offender <br /> <br /> I was blown away by this movie 10/10
