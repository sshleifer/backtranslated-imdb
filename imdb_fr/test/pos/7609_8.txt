I saw this film for the first time years ago when it was still new and I was satisfied. It's a beautiful story of Hollywood imaginary beliefs for teenagers. However, this is not realistic. As much as you would like to believe, these stories never happen. That's why it's irritating to watch movies like this one. They play with the minds of teenagers. Imagine how many girls still in high schools believe in this magic and are disappointed. I would not recommend this movie to my little sister or cousin. The director should have spent more time thinking about the plot instead of thinking about the actors. Yes, they (the actors) were good, but the idea is not worth it. There are a lot of movies about teenagers. So, why do not we do a better one?
