I am a physics student myself and I must say that I think this is one of the best "popular" introductions to string theory. Elegant Universe manages to make the whole subject of string theory (although it is actually M) accessible to a wider audience. <br /> <br /> Some "popular science" programs believe that the best approach is simply to attract public attention. thoroughly, their technical jargon without explanation and the presentation of the theory in a boring and stale style. This program reviews concepts such as general relativity and quantum mechanics, and explains the problems that must be solved between them in order to have a coherent theory that can be applied to the universe, both large and small. <br /> <br /> I guess some might say that this is slow and takes too much time to come up with interesting things like extra dimensions and wormholes, but the problem is that: this goes to the against the problem. Explaining string theory from the beginning is almost impossible without mentioning at least the physics at its core, and the way it is explained in The Elegant Universe is clear and fun. <br /> <br /> That you really like this program Does it depend on whether you may want to be first stunned by some of the ideas presented by Greene: the extra dimensions and distortion of space-time are not really prevalent in everyday life, are they? However, if you persevere with some of the more exotic concepts of this program, you will find that it will give you insight into the research that is guiding the world of physics today. And if you study physics, well, that's great entertainment and you can probably follow that and enjoy it even more!
