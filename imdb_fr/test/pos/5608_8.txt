Catholics, the number one religion of self-healing comedians all over the world, understand this one and a half hour joke best. This does not mean that he can not fend for himself, that the film does not miss its defects, which is the case. Technical problems, mainly: the belief that in 1998, digital was the solution while it was in its infancy - a beta of a beta if you want, and a re-mastery will never improve it. For God's sake, Hal ... get a Red One. Or three. <br /> <br /> If you like Hartley movies of course, you'll love it. I loved it because I loved Grim / Fool, and in retrospect had other advantages: I could not help but notice a disturbing self-prophecy, a hovering plane hovering above, used as an omen of Armageddon in this 1998 film. It was as if Cheney had had the idea of ​​Hal. That's right - Hartley moves his players in the camera, as if it were the House of Commons, an element of the gadget that requires some rest. After all, we are already attentive to the actors and the writing is alive. Not great to write, but ... fervent. Can I use the word fervent? Determined, intelligent, not condescending. <br /> <br /> Absolute love of PJ Harvey in this adventure, I would like it anywhere. Oddly, if Helen Mirren needs to be younger, she should look for Harvey and bring a bottle of blonde.
