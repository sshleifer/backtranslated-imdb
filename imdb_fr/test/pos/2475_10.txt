Death Camp Opera: Here, now! <br /> <br /> Ten years ago, I read that a very special film was made about the polarization of our society. A certain Peter Watkins was the author. His picture was interpreted by non-professional actors, citizens like you and me ?? and others. The violence of the atmosphere has been described as extremely realistic. Was it a movie, a documentary? Both in fact. Over the years, I realized how difficult it was to find it. Maybe I would do it by chance? Anyway, it's still an old story. I saw him not long ago. Totally impressive. My favorite art peace: Punishment Park is his name. I love this "docu-fiction", this "truecastmovie", this "realityshowfictionnal", whatever happens. After all the shock films I've seen, I'm getting the best with this strong and intense cinematic experience. I found a masterpiece. There is enough on the net to know a lot about the movie. It's even to buy on DVD, with extra stuff. The only words I want to add relate to my own experience with this movie. I can only trust a peace of art so sincere and committed around people and for those who direct, act or watch. A cinema that is simply a real human experience within an artistic adventure ?? or the contrary. <br /> <br /> So, I'm not talking about all the "mucos" we can see on TV, especially the "real'shity-show" that the concepts of people playing themselves are interesting but used in a stupid and perverse way. In Punishment Park, we can see real people living as they are. We only place them in a very specific context, with a few lines to follow, and let them be what they want. It is a kind of therapy, a means of individuation for those who are inside the film but also for the spectators active in front of screens. Then, finally, the director's film puts on a short and sweet film about the apocalypse, a screaming scream, a "death camp opera", where people are on the run after virulent trials. Punishment Park is for those who want to grow up. See this movie and have the opportunity to choose your own morality. Grow up and harmonize with that! If you can feel it! If you can see it !! In my case, Punishment Park is stuck in me forever, with all my love, my conscience and my will.
