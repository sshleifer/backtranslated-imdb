Well then this episode makes fun of Al Gore. I'm sure it pisses a few Liberals. South Park makes fun of everyone, much like the Simpsons. If you make fun of the politics you love, you may need a better sense of humor and take the series too seriously. That said, this episode is hilarious and one of the best. The portrait of Al Gores is hilarious, Cartman's stratagem goes terribly wrong and the results will make you laugh on the floor. It's basically all you want from an episode of South Park and it's easily one of my favorites. I will not comment further on the plot because I do not want to reveal anything.
