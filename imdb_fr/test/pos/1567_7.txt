There is not much in the story. A young woman steals money from the damn Vermont supermarket where she works, decides to flee to Florida where he dreams of going to school with his friend Julie and meets a strange couple on the road. If you remember the elderly couple of "Rosemary's Baby", you have an idea of ​​what these people look like. Bill has a comic face and is retired from the army. Sandra is a former stripper turned into a fucking truck, although we do not find out right now. They are affectionate, helpful and full of common sense. <br /> <br /> They adopt more or less the girl, Alice, and promise to drive her in their sophisticated RV, although they do not drive "directly" to Florida. <br /> <br /> This is where the film could have been wrong. All the filmmakers had to do was transform the elderly couple into personification of evil. They took the virgin Alice (handcuffed to bed or whatever) and sold her body to any fat-ball driver who has a lot of money and loves violent sex. (Alice could very well have escaped, with many unsuccessful attempts, before the final shooting.) But no. The couple is really very nice and Alice is far from being a virgin. Alice surprises Sandra with a customer, asks her questions about the company and tries to turn things around. Bill prevents everything from happening and insists that she does the job properly if she wants to do it at all. They do not talk to him in it. They guide her. <br /> <br /> Alice earns several hundred dollars, several hundred dollars more than when she met the couple. Bill and Sandra keep their money in a safe where customers will not find it. Alice understands badly. She does not find the work of prostitute very pleasant and thinks that she will never be paid, because every time she asks to be filed, Sandra answers: "What? Not here, darling. Not in the middle of nowhere." However, after being asked to give her gun to Sandra, the couple gave her the money she wanted and released her with love to continue her trip to Florida. <br /> <br /> Do you know what I found the most tragic moment in the film? It had nothing to do with prostitution or theft. Alice was waiting for a room with her friend Julie after she arrived in Miami. Julie is after all a legitimate student. But when Alice calls her friend from somewhere in Alabama to assure her that she's on the way but she'll be late, Julie hesitates and says, "Well-my mother does not think you should stay with us. And to tell you the truth, my roommate is not cool either, I invited you, of course, but I thought it was like a week-long visit or something like that. , Alice "There is a long silence before Alice hangs up. A single shot is fired (some white images of the film) and no one is touched. Tears only appear once. Nobody hits anyone else. No car explodes in a fireball. No police officers pursue them on Interstate. <br /> <br /> The direction is sometimes clumsy. Too much to do between Sandra trying to disarm Alice and Alice's hand holding the waving gun. There is almost no musical score. There is a brief masculine and feminine nudity and it's clumsy, as it's probably supposed to be. Alice is not unappealing but she is not babalicious either. She wears Asian eyes, a kind of robust version of Molly Parker. Cinematography seems cheap and the colors are faded. The direction is a simple narrative, with some enlightening flashbacks. Nothing is wasted. And of course it was all around Danbury, Connecticut. The city is etched in my memory because I crossed it after a flood and I remember cars covered with a film of mud until the door handles. <br /> <br /> I do not know exactly what. Alice found. (I'm afraid I think the answer to the riddle is that "she found herself".) The acting is not bad at all. Judith Ivey is better than that. It's definitely worth seeing, a calm and orderly movie that treats the audience like adults.
