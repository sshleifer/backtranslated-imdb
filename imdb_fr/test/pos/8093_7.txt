The biggest part of this film is a hilarious and brutal satire on Nazism and fascism, made up to the success of these movements. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, in the final moments of the film, Chaplin abandons any pretense of doing art (not to mention comedy) and goes completely to propaganda. And not anti-Nazi propaganda either, but some of the most cursed and silly propaganda ever from Hollywood. <br /> <br /> It does not matter that nothing we have seen so far indicates that the hairdresser is even able to pronounce the speech we see him giving (pronounced, ironically, with a disturbing fanaticism with wild eyes ); such trivialities should not interfere with the message.
