A classic of blaxploitation, this film had a terrible influence on rap for the "toasts" performed by Rudy Ray Moore. Toasts are long stories that rhyme, that are funny and give a point, and you can see how they would evolve naturally in rap. To learn more about toasts, Rudy Ray Moore, and the importance of this film, visit Dolemite.com. <br /> <br /> That leaves us just to talk about the movie itself. This film contains many "fun and exciting outfits" for its money, because almost every shot has an element or a scandalous dialogue. It starts when Dolemite is released from prison to find out who arrested him and brought him to justice. I did not know that prisons released people so that they could prove their innocence, but it's me, I'm a neophyte in prison. Queen Bee, who is Dolemite's main prostitute, helped him in this task and ran his brothel while he was away. She also sent all her prostitutes to the karate school. He therefore has an army of female fighters. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie in two parts, which is usually a mistake, but in this case provided an interesting contrast. The first part I watched during my lunch break while exercising, did not like it very much. This seemed to me to be a blaxploitation particularly badly done, with a ridiculous story, a poor craftsmanship - well, I guess it gives the impression that there was SOME SAVE - and tons of places, outfits and scandalous dialogues. But I did not like that - in fact, it made me feel dirty. Let's face it, a white man who watches something like that to laugh at the clothes and words of the characters gets a racist pleasure: how ridiculously do these black people dress, what nonsense they say. I did not really like that, I did not laugh and I was not looking forward to watching the rest. <br /> <br /> Later in the night, while I was in a "much more relaxed state", I looked at the rest ?? and legitimately loved. Like Disco Godfather, whom I had watched a few days ago, the warmth and sweetness that make her pleasant even if it's ridiculous or violent. The character of Dolemite has a self-parody aspect that makes it all fun, and the appearance of several actors who were also in Disco Godfather implies that we follow the efforts of a group of friends who just want to do something to have fun together. Even poor dubbing, karate fighting and everything else make it even more charming. <br /> <br /> What I find interesting in Dolemite films is that they have a moral ambiguity that I do not see in other blaxploitation. movies, and certainly in very few mainstream movies. In this one, there is an African-American woman who gives a speech about the mayor (white), saying "he did more for the black community than anyone else". We discover later that the mayor is surprised, corrupt, but I like that the film portrays this woman as essentially ill-advised and does not seek to "redeem" it in any other way. There is also the figure of Hamburger Pimp, who is portrayed as a useless drug addict, and no one makes an effort to find a redeeming and socially positive angle to what he is, he is right. In Disco Godfather, the religious character played by Lady Reed is presented as an idiot for wanting to pray for her child, desperately lost to angel dust. I like the fact that the films feature portraits that are so critically critical of people in their own communities who are not smeared with sugar or who are trying to buy them back to make them more enjoyable. <br /> <br /> There are many dubious things, such as when Dolemite says "Move me and let me go, or I'll take those Hush Puppies out of your muthatf ** a **." There is Queen Bee who reaches out and answers the phone: "Dolemite Total Experience". And you will not miss (although you may want to cover your eyes) the long nude scene of the mayor REPULSIVE. I'm all for the old men mustachioed, but even I have limits - and my limits are usually a few kilometers from most people, so be forewarned. The DVD I have had is clearly edited, which is visible in some dialogue scenes, and in the end, when the murder of a major character by Dolemite obviously excludes the main event. <br /> <br /> If you get the DVD, however, be sure to watch the three movie trailers of Dolemite movies because they are cool. I was not going to watch The Human Tornado, but after watching this trailer, you'd better believe I am. Plus, there's a scene in Dolemite's trailer that I can not remember from the movie when Dolemite swings against a Mexican-looking thug, obviously missing, and the guy turns around in the trunk of a car. <br /> <br /> After watching the first half, I was going to say go through this and watch Disco Godfather, because the movie and the story got a little better, but after really enjoying the second part, I I would recommend watching this one on Disco Godfather, as this one is even more fun, outrageous and good-natured, and contains toasts which, even if we do not understand the roots and shades of the form, remain to be seen. <br /> <br /> --- See other reviews on my bad and nerdy movies site, Cinema de Merde, cinemademerde.com
