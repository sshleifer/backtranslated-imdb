The lovely Candace Bergen as widow Perdicaris is kidnapped and held for ransom by Sheik Raisuli played by one of the most dashing Sean Connery. The incident occurred in 1904 as Theodore Roosevelt ran for the presidential election. Needing a good example to show the muscular foreign policy of the United States, Brian Keith and Roosevelt make an astounding statement to the Sultan of Morocco, "Perdicaris alive or died of Raisuli". <br /> <br /> But in this adaptation of this incident, the famous statement is the only true thing in this story. The Perdicaris in question were actually an Ion Perdicaris who was a Greek immigrant and a dilettante playboy. In fact, Perdicaris renounced his US citizenship years ago and regained his Greek citizenship. Regardless, however, his situation was quite usable at the time. <br /> <br /> The damsel in distress makes a better screen for screens, so it's a widow and her two children who are in danger here. Of course, as it is presented here, some of our European powers also resorted to this incident to settle in Morocco. The intrigues go far beyond the ransom demand of a brigand. <br /> <br /> The Wind and the Lion is hardly historical. But it's a nice movie and Sean Connery is always fun to watch. Brian Keith is also my conception of Theodore Roosevelt and the Roosevelt White House scenes are faithful to all the stories told. John Huston plays the always patient Secretary of State John Hay, inherited from his predecessor William McKinley, whom Roosevelt inherited. <br /> <br /> But kids do not use this film to miss out on a story about Theodore Roosevelt's story.
