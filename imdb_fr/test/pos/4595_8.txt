I have never seen a movie go down worse than that. And it's a shame, because it's the funniest movie of the year! One would think that an ad with the line "The director of" Office Space "" would be enough to justify a major release! But there is no advertising, no posters, no website, I doubt that the stars have even known that it came out this weekend. What does 20th Century Fox think? Mike Judge's sci-fi comedy takes place in 2505. But it could come true in about 10 years (if things continue as they are.) Luke Wilson and Maya Rudolph find themselves frozen in a secret military experience and wake up in a consanguineous zombie delays. The film reminds me of "Sleeper", "RoboCop", "Planet of the Apes", "Blade Runner" and "Network" by Woody Allen, as well as the late "Futurama". Try to see it before Fox burns all the prints!
