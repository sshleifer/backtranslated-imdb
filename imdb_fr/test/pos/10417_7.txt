Despite its New York sets and New York characters, "Summer in the City" is not an American movie, it's better than that. The most unusual is the mix of styles and genres. The director Niami skillfully shows combining comedy and tragedy, pathetic and drama. <br /> <br /> The secret of Niami's success seems to be a panoply of great characters - everyone could have his own film built around him - and then fill them with performances beautifully crafted by one of the most wonderfully caste eclectic that would be hard to find in the same country, much less in the same film, ranging from Bai Ling to Ornella Muti, Robert Burke to Peter Stormare who reveals here that he has much more in him than the stereotypes of nasty he plays in Hollywood movies. Even Sandra Bernhard is funny here! <br /> <br /> John Cale's soundtrack is an added bonus.
