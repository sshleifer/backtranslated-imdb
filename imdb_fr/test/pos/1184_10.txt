I just watched the hair after 20 years. This hit the house. For those of us who have tried to stand on the shoulders of the civil rights movement and fight the rule of privilege and power; who resisted the fascism of the Johnson / Nixon administrations; who now, as veterans of the civil wars, led the war in Vietnam every day until the American beast died and fled; for all those who said no in different ways - it is remarkable how much we failed. What was the size of the real table Treat was dancing on? How drives the magician behind the curtain. We were 20, 22, 24. We did not know the nature of the enemy. The size of the monster that for the next thirty years and counting would continue to eat the world. How could we? Even with the smoke and the bat! In our hand, like Treat, we were too young, too bourgeois, too invested, too much of the actions we hate. <br /> <br /> But there was a moment. As André Grégoire observed in My dinner with. . . there was a moment or two somewhere in the late '60s and early' 70s, where we might have found something in addition to the yellow brick road. Something does not feed on Bechtel, Prisons, Enron and Dick. Something collaborative. Something innocent and critical at the same time. Something with the dance. <br /> <br /> But we missed it. As Kong bending a beam, the "revolution" has returned. In sexism. Racism. Homophobia and overwhelming political class. Until we get to "W". To treat would have hated "W". And Iraq and the pathological lies. If they were in this movie. Then. But the moment passed and "W" was almost inevitable. Total incompetence in riding the drunkard, the drunkard, the children's lives and the shops of China. <br /> <br /> We should have done something more. Something better. But we did not know what. <br /> <br /> Now what?
