I just wanted to write a quick answer to all the people who give a bad review to this movie because they think it's not funny or it's boring. <br /> <br /> Here's the trick: the movie is not supposed to be a comedy. It has depth. Like many of Demme's films, these are people living in some of the most remote corners of our society who are striving to find fulfilling lives. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the film and home video industries do not deal with subtlety well and drop it into the "COMEDY" basket. It's funny, but a lot of humor is offbeat. However, the heart of the film does not concern humor, but the people who compose it. <br /> <br /> It may not be one of the greatest movies in the world, but it's solid and entertaining. <br /> <br /> And the casting is one of those that shows why casting is an art in itself. Michelle Pfieffer is great and maybe it's the film that showed she had some actor chops to add to her beauty. Mercedes Ruehl is a big drunk and manages to paint the landscape as she alone can, in a role that requires it. Play as Oliver Platt, Joan Cusack in more modest roles and the talented Dean Stockwell ... and even Chris Isaak. You have an excellent distribution that makes all the difference here. <br /> <br /> Matthew Modine is fun, but more importantly, he is a major hottie in this movie. Hot, cute and sexy. <br /> <br /> Sit down, expect the unexpected and let the movie take you where it wants to go and you should have a good time.
