I can not believe that I rarely see this title mentioned by all the monsters of the 80s and I will certainly not join all my critical colleagues to say that "Bloody Birthday" is horrible to watch. On the contrary, it pleased me a lot and I was pleasantly surprised by the ingenuity and surprise twists it offers. Do not just refer to this film as "another 1980s slasher", as the victims here are rather unlikely, as are the killers. We met three young people with a cherubic look, all born of a solar eclipse. By the time they were delivered, the planet Saturn was blocked by both the sun and the moon, and because of this, the children are emotionless and seemingly unconscious. It really begins to manifest around their tenth anniversary as they embark on a deadly, deadly madness. <br /> <br /> Of course, this thing is a crazy and even slightly offensive incredibility, but who cares? Unlike many other horror movies of this period, he tries at least to bring something original and imaginary. For once, the children's game is good and the whole movie exudes a scary atmosphere and grizzly music. The murder scenes are grim and tense, and it is always disturbing to see them being hired by angel-faced children. I do not know who hired the 3 children but they did a good job. Especially the girl and the child with glasses are very memorable. The dark images of the heartless trio remind you of classic highlights such as "Village of the Damned", "The Bad Seed" and "Children of the Damned". This film is not nearly as memorable as these milestones, but very entertaining and no horror lover will regret it. <br /> <br /> Bloody Birthday was written and directed by Ed Hunt. Not particularly the greatest cinematic genius, but a pleasantly deranged guy who also brought us extremely entertaining cheese festivals like "The Brain" and "Starship Invasions". If all this is not enough to convince you, Bloody Birthday has a lot of nudity. And not just any nudity, but a dance-topless act by Julie Brown of MTV-VJ. Oh, and keep your eyes open for a totally redundant appearance of Joe Penny, who will later be the star of the television series Jake and the Fatman. Check it out !!
