I had no idea what I was going to see when I decided to watch this movie and, to my surprise, it's an extremely well-made horror movie, which is easily one of the best The film is of course on a budget, and it's an excellent example of how the story and style of a film create chills, not special effects! Strother Martin is one of the great character actors of all time and he plays a rare role here. The film also features Martins' good friend, L.Q. Jones and "Green Acres" Alvy Moore. Jones and Moore also contributed to the production of this film. TV veteran Charles Bateman is the star and beauty of the movie "Enter the Dragon" Ahna Capri is his girlfriend. Capri is in a bikini at the beginning of the film and she is beautiful to watch! The film does a great job keeping the story without adding a fake end, and I really liked the way the movie ends. Very good atmosphere, interesting story and well directed by Bernard McEveety. Martins' performances are excellent as well, as he does not back down at all and really takes on the role of Doc. Good movie and underrated!
