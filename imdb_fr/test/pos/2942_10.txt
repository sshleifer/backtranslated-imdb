I saw this movie with my girlfriends and we all loved it! He is so sweet and comforting, a real tearful! I was still thinking about the story a few days after watching the movie. It's such a beautiful story about the hardships of all families, something everyone can relate to. I really recommend this movie to anyone looking for a rental on Saturday night. With your girlfriends, your family, your boyfriend, everyone will really enjoy! : D This is a true story about a real family that would turn the heart. Not to mention, beautiful landscapes and fantastic actor. See, I'm sure you'll love as much as me!
