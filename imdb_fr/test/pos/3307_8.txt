You can not take this film seriously ..... the plot is predictable and banal, the game often excessive, laughable dialogue; but it's all fun! Three "career girls" of the late 1950s arrive in the big city and all the evils and temptations that their mother advised them to warn: married men, alcohol, pre-marital sex, abortion, etc. <br /> Then Amanda Farrell (Joan Crawford) enjoyed professional success, but her personal life was sacrificed for an office with her name on the door. <br /> <br /> This film may have been credible 50 years ago, but now just great! Rent / buy and enjoy.
