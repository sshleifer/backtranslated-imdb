Robin Williams is a national treasure, especially when he frees himself and puts aside his maudlin approach to drama. He manages to brighten the usual sober rhythm of Barry Levinson, and some moments in this film are really brilliant. <br /> <br /> As a funny American president elected in "The Man of the Year", Williams finds the hilarity and excessiveness associated with him. What makes him so attractive is his humanity and his sympathy. Here is a man who can attack his audience but who really loves them too. His humor is like a barbed wire, and yet he is cathartic. That's what makes it very attractive to film and real life people. <br /> <br /> Laura Linney represents again an intelligent woman in distress. She is a fabulous and very talented performer, but I think she fell into a stereotype and, unfortunately, it would have been more interesting to have a less recognizable performer in this case. Walken walks in his thankless role and the climate scene in the SNL skit barely floats above the water. <br /> <br /> Enter some hilarious moments, which are priceless. Enjoy Williams and forget some of the deeper moments that slow down this entertaining film.
