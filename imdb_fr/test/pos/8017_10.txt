Okay, I love Aidan Quinn, even with a bad script. This is not the case in The Assignment. As other viewers have said, it's a film I stumbled on cable and I got so invested that I did not want it to end. Take a Cuban American Navy officer (Quinn) who is a soldier and a family man. Add a crazy agent (Donald Sutherland) in search of the world's most famous terrorist and add a Ben Kingsley and you get "The Assignment". Sutherland witnesses Carlos's most notorious terrorist actions in a cafe on a beautiful day when he is so deeply rocked by this man's pain that his only reason for living is to get this man as long as he breathes. <br /> <br /> Take a soldier on a pass in Israel who is a dead ringer for this man and who is beaten and held by Kingsley until they realize they have a plan. Assuming Carlos to be himself, or being forever responsible for never helping him rid him of his world, this is a very heavy journey for duty and guilt. By not helping his country, he is obliged, as a man, and his military duty to choose wisely. So the training begins. Let's say that Carlos' training is up to the academy of arts and holocausts. When I say this intense and wonderfully screened, scripted and executed film, the best, I do not underestimate it. The three actors could save almost all scenarios. This is a movie to display from the first image to the credits. I'm not in terrorism or movies about it, but I got hooked! Congratulations to Aidan Quinn who, for once, plays a heavy one that could support any actor, including Gary Oldman. It's a compliment. Rent it and get a lot of popcorn. Oh, did I mention sex ?? It works better than "Last Tango!" And its educational content.
