The life of three distinct and distant individuals merges with the brutal murder of one by the other. The one-hour film reveals only the event that unites the three individuals only after half of the film's duration. I saw other segments of the "Dekalog", but this one seemed to me to be the rarest in dialogue and yet the most fascinating by its structure. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a law student practicing a fake defense lawsuit. for a man accused of murder. Obviously, the man repeated the same arguments as a full-fledged lawyer, but it never appears on the screen (at least in the short version of Dekalog 5 an hour). We are made to imagine that this must have been the case. A taxi driver who is a misanthrope has two facets in his character: the good side feeds a mangy dog, cleans his taxi meticulously, picks up dirty rags thrown by people who lack civility and remembers his wife in the process of die; the bad side frightens the poodles, refuses to lead a drunkard - probably worried that he vomits in the taxi - and fishy with pretty girls. The disgusting protagonist who kills without mercy, throws stones on bridges in fast traffic jams and pushes strangers into the urinals without any provocation, is also a person who can make innocent girls laugh. Kieslowski's film and screenplay show the good and the bad side of two of the three main characters. <br /> <br /> However, the film does not deal with the death penalty but with a treatise on murder. The fifth commandment "Thou shalt not kill" is explored theologically - ("Even God spared Cain ..."), sociologically, the tenderness of brutes towards children and poor dogs abandoned and psychologically (after the effects of a night of drunkenness with a friend This led to the accidental death of his sister, which he carries the photograph). What makes ordinary people become murderers - this never quite explains, but the suggestions are legion. <br /> <br /> In the world of Kieslowski, there is a model where events and people are linked in a cosmic sense (note the similarity between the clown and the murderer, hanging from the mirror of the cabin). Kieslowski and the young idealist lawyer seem to be asking us to look at the Commandment literally and figuratively - why are we killing? Is there a force beyond society (the drunken night that led to the life of a girl) that makes us hateful killers? <br /> <br /> would be missing the forest for the trees to discuss the two det spoiled murders in the film - both without mercy. The film invites the viewer to think about why God is asking us not to kill. <br /> <br /> I understand that a longer version of the film was made by Kieslowski. But even this short version of an hour is superb with its dark and scattered scenario, its intelligent editing, its interesting cinematography and its first-rate direction that provides much more than the sum of its parts. This segment anticipates the healthiest Dekalogs 6.7 and 8.
