"Hitch" is a good surprise: a romantic comedy that has romance and comedy. Most romantic comedies for me go from mediocre to horrible because they are neither funny nor romantic. "Hitch" takes actors like Will Smith, Kevin James and Eva Mendes on a fun and light featureless journey that made me laugh and, yes, a little "aww, how nice!" <br /> <br /> Meet Alex Hitchens (Will Smith), aka Hitch. He is a self-proclaimed "Date Doctor"; he helps hopeless guys like Albert (Kevin James) win guys like Allegra (Amber Valletta). Sadly, Hitch has to take care of Sarah (Eva Mendes), a gossip columnist who tries to break Doctor Date ... just because the cast is so energetic and clearly fun. I wonder why Will Smith did not make more movies like this. His fast and accurate shooting style is perfect for this kind of music and his chemistry with Mendes and James is wonderful. James is a real discovery. I have never seen his show 'The King of Queens', but he is funny and sincere, and he proves once again that big white men can not dance hip-hop (Smith's reactions to his attempts are hilarious). Mendes is hot and hopping (not like that, damn it) because Smith is the perfect partner, and Amber Valletta is sweet like Allegra. <br /> <br /> "Hitch" is not perfect; it's a bit long, and things get too "dramatic" towards the end (even if it's redeemed by the happy ending filled with fun dances). But it's a good reminder of romantic comedies that carry a lot of theaters.
