This film is good for entertainment purposes, but it is not historically reliable. If you are looking for a movie and think "Oh, I want to know more about Custer's life and his last fight", do not rent "They died with their boots". But if you want to watch a movie for the pleasure of an old western movie, with a little romance and just for a good story, it's a fun movie to watch. <br /> <br /> The story begins with the first day of Custer (Errol Flynn) at West Point. Everyone loves his charming personality that allows him to get by with almost anything. The film follows his West Point career and his many battles, including that of the American Civil War. The film ends with his last fight at Little Big Horn. Between battle scenes, he finds love and marriage with Libby (Olivia De Havilland). <br /> <br /> Errol Flynn describes the arrogant, but suave George Armstrong Custer. Olivia De Havilland is a very nice and sweet Libby, especially in the flirtation scene that Custer and Libby have for the first time. Their on-screen chemistry made you believe in their romance. The game in general was impressive, especially the comic (although stereotyped) role of Callie played by Hattie McDaniel. His character will certainly make you laugh. <br /> <br /> Heroic war music has brought out the excitement of battle scenes. The beautiful costumes set the tone of the time. The screenplay, at times, was cheesy, though the movie was still nice to watch. The director's portrayal of Custer was that of a hero, and history shows that it is questionable. Some will watch this movie and see Custer as a hero. Others will watch this film and learn to hate it. <br /> <br /> I congratulate him for this 1942 western movie.
