8/2008. When I wrote my comments, shortly after watching this film, I took a critical view, believing that Lemmon and Matthau had essentially "phoned" their performances, which had paired them as they had already done several times before. <br /> But seeing him again, it seemed different, especially since none of the two mega-stars had lived much longer after its release. <br /> <br /> With the exception of Spiner, all eight directors are artists with considerable experience, and inevitably much longer than we have seen in many of their other movies and TVs. job. But is not it almost everyone? <br /> <br /> To see him again, even if he will certainly not be considered a "classi" in their career, it's a funny film, with a lot of interesting landscapes. as well. <br /> <br /> From my point of view, it reminds me that many movies, plays, etc. can often be viewed from a very critical point of view, or rather from the clearer side, without waiting for film to be another "Citizen Kane", "Casablance", or (in terms of two sons), another original "Odd Couple". It will also remain an element of permanent nostalgia for Lemmon and Matthau, as well as for other actors.
