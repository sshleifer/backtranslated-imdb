Alistair Simms inspired the portrait of Miss Fritton that transcends the trail. This is one of the great characters of the comedy in the film. The character of Joyce Grenfell - Ruby Gates is just as wonderful. <br /> <br /> This is a movie you should curl up on the couch on a wet afternoon and be transported a long time ago when wild schoolgirls terrify earned our respect - not our anger! I heard that a remake was being prepared with Rupert Everett as Miss Fritton? It will be hard to compete with the master - or should it be a mistress? - Alistair Simms. <br /> <br /> Praise him, he beats so much what's happening today in comedy.
