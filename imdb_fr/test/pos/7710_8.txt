Police history is not typical of the Matrix Universe. It's a film-noir-esque private eye story, with a strong narrator and a very rich feel. Rich, in terms of its visual appeal. The scenes of snow, granulation, all stuns the eye. <br /> <br /> But what about history? It's interesting, even if it seems a bit out of place. The agents hire a private investigator to find Trinity. He discovers that they had already tried this approach, but with dangerous consequences for the detectives hired. Nevertheless, he tries to locate it and finally succeeds, thanks to the references of Alice in Wonderland, hackers and chat rooms. Then things start to get interesting ... <br /> <br /> In short, this is a perfectly satisfying animated short film. <br /> <br /> 8/10
