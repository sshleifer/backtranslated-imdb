This movie was shot quite soon after Karen's death so that maybe Richard Carpenter and Karen's closest people feel a bit guilty about how they were able to contribute to his health problems. Over the years (almost exactly 25), it had become easier to deny complicity. Richard spent the years after Karen's death continually remixing and recompiling the recordings he made with her. He married his cousin, Mary, and from what I read, it looks like he's planning a next generation of carpenters with his kids. He seems to have regretted the realization of this film, and it is perhaps for this reason that it is available in any form. It seemed like a fairly honest assessment of Karen Carpenter's tragic short life and incredible talent.
