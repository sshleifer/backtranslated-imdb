I wanted to see this since my French teacher recommended it to me more than forty years ago. Perhaps the long wait was worth it because the restoration of the Criterion Collection DVD is impressive. <br /> <br /> In broad outline, this film follows the used scenario: a quartet of men diligently plots a robbery of a bank, the theft takes place, a small event apparently insignificant leads to the ultimate disappearance of all. Even if the filming sequence is metamorphosed, it happens fairly early and is ultimately not at the heart of the film. This film separates from the typical heist film by giving us a glimpse of the character's personality and their motives - he plays as much as a drama as a thriller. Relationships play an important role and we remove a kidnapping, giving us two movies for the price of one. <br /> <br /> John Servais plays Tony the Stephanois (always called "the St√©phanois") with such weariness that he could have come out of a Camus novel. Tony has just been released from prison and resists criminal life again until he has an extremely unpleasant interaction with his ex-lover (who has met another man) where, as a punishment, he physically whips her up with a belt. . Fortunately, this scene is happening in front of the camera, but you probably will not forget it. After this sobering event, as there seems to be little hope of reviving this relationship, Tony meets two of his former criminal partners, Jo and Mario, and decides to join them for a final big holdup. They use the services of Cesar, an Italian cracker - played by the director Dassin himself - and we go to the heist. <br /> <br /> The holdup unfolds without a hitch. But the feminine tendency of Cesar is a trait of personality which proves fatal for all the people concerned. However, we can understand his attraction to the nightclub singer for whom he fell in love, because there is a brilliant piece in which she plays a sexy nightclub number and inspired by cinematography - this must be one of them most memorable scenes of any black film. <br /> <br /> It has long been established that Tony has a close relationship with Jo and his family; In fact, Jo's son talks about him as an uncle. I think it's partly to help Jo's family that Tony accepts the burglary. The final scenes, where Tony saves the life of Jo's kidnapped son, partly redeem his actions more brutal and amoral. But only partially.
