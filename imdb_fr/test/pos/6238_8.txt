As one of the other commentators (perhaps @ Amazon), the WOR-9, the beloved and old decrepit, introduced me for the first time to Tourist Trap in New York, around January 1983. Devil Dog: The Dog of Hell, I had been waiting to see since its Halloween debut in 1978, it had just ended, and I thought I was filled with horror for the day (stop laughing - this monster "Borgost" ( sp?) with three eyes that Ike Eisenmann draws in his room is scary). <br /> <br /> As much as I still appreciate Richard Crenna wearing his horror hat designed for television, it's the first 10 minutes of Tourist Trap, following Devil Dog that day, which Mark left - and months later, it turned out to be the first movie I recorded on a TV channel. WOR used to play this quite often, often like the Saturday afternoon Million Dollar Movie, as others have pointed out. This is one of those offers that offers a powerful punch of horror in the front, a real hook of the left - and practically starts again with the rest of the casting, dances and blows, setting the scene of opening in a wider context along the way, then moving on to something else. the real highlight (see The Night of the Living Dead, Re Animator). <br /> <br /> Two paragraphs and I did not mention a single mannequin. Look at it - the damn things are pretty scary, without the music and the script. I can also remember scary and similar models in the attics and basements of various parents and say what you like about the fact that Schmoeller and Carroll's approach is relatively simple - no one, before or since, has played as well. In real life, a good model will make you take a double take - and here it's pretty much the last thing you'll see, if you're stuck at the late Slausen wax museum and its booth at the edge of the road. Yes, there is a point ("I liked it a lot"), where Chuck "Slausen" Connors tries to pass for Vincent Price. Yes, the plot could have taken a whole paragraph in its infancy; I can not see the script being so thick. It does not matter. From leadership to competent acting (Meryl Streep is categorically absent, and here it helps instead of hindering), to another useful and effective score of Pino Dinaggio (see Carrie and various other Palma films), to various lighting, film backgrounds, using different sound levels ... I could go on - every element of this low-budget production comes together and you get a lot more work than the sum of its parts. <br /> <br /> Did I mention it was scary? Hell? Stephen King talked about this film in Danse Macabre about a year after its release, and with good reason. Like many of his works, it may not be a great art, but he tells a scary story and does it well. The rest of the cast may be relatively unknown (was not Jocelyn Jones also in this movie in Texas?), But Chuck Connors and Tanya Roberts were and are still well known to the public for you to think - at the Stephen King's way - that it can happen to you or to people you know. <br /> <br /> Comparisons between Psycho (intrigue) and The Chainsaw Massacre in Texas (overall appearance), even if they are not the first associations of my mind, are valid. I only wish I could comment on the DVD, which I can not wait to buy, because Tourist Trap has become notoriously difficult to find in video since the almost complete extinction of independent video rental points, where he had a house apart WOR and cable in the 1980s (though TMC / Showtime seems to have picked it up and played it regularly now). No, no mess here, I'm afraid, no intrigue - go see it yourself (okay, there may be a little bit below, so scroll down if you like - better prevent that to heal). The models are damn scary and I would rather show that say ... :) <br /> <br /> For the record, Tourist Trap also has great replicas, "we are going to organize a party!" How do I look, huh, how do I look? "To" you are so pretty, "" you can not hurt me, "" I should not have to hide it - it feels good! "(Listen again to this inflection of Vincent Price), the inevitable" you are crazy! "(delivered at the right time and in the right tone) ... and try - just try - to keep the hair on your arms when you hear the manikin's head screaming "Molly!" - especially when you realize who this head belongs to ... :) <br /> <br /> PS ... Charles Band was the producer, and probably owned the rights on the As I understand it, the band was the brain of Full Moon Entertainment, which could explain both the later use of music in Puppet Master and, thus, the commercial approach to characterized Full Moon since the enjoyable Franchises Puppet Master and Subspecies, to, uhhh ... Trancers and Bad Channels (sorry, BOC).
