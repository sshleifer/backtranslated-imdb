"Cherry" tells the story of a naive and single virgin who decides to have a baby but does not know how to do it. This easy going little sleeper is full of weird characters and ironic humor. Fresh, fun, break the mold, I really loved this movie ... for what it's worth. Recommended for romantic comedy lovers who want something different.
