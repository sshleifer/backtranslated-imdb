It's a charming film for the least. The main character, Fanda, is an old man who refuses to be among the undead around him. He and his accomplice make jokes and get into trouble around the city. Meanwhile, his family wonders what to do with him. From there, Fanda's relationship with his wife, best friend and son is growing. This eventually leads to one of the best movie ends I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> The characters in this film are rich and deep. They develop well during the movie. The film has a whole range of moods. It goes from clear and funny to dark and dark. All the slow passages for you in this movie will be made in the end. <br /> <br /> The autumn spring carries the same message as many other European films: do not lose sight of the little pleasures. in life. If you liked Amelie, The eighth day or Life is beautiful (all the great movies to date), you will surely love this film.
