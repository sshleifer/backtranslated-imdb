In the late sixties, director Sergio Corbucci created four spaghetti westerns following: the classics THE MERCENARY, THE GREAT SILENCE, THE SPECIALISTS and COMPANEROS. Three of them, all except the SPECIALISTS, are consistently on the list of top ten lists when spaghetti westerns are evaluated. Until recently, all I had seen was a very poor compilation with English, Italian versions, a blurry and almost incomprehensible picture. Now, having seen a beautiful widescreen version with subtitles (still in two languages), I can safely include THE SPECIALISTS in this group of four classics. Johnny Halliday is very good like the charismatic Hud, a notorious hand with the weapon that comes back to Blackstone to investigate the death of his brother, who was lynched by the townspeople for losing their savings. This is a voluptuous beauty that owns the bank, of a Mexican bandit leader, El Diablo, who was once friends with Hud, an honest sheriff who dreams of better days and a small group of hippies - that was in the late sixties, and the hippies were everywhere, even apparently in our westerns. It's not a desert western, shot somewhere in the Alps, and it's nice to watch. There is a little more nudity than I expected in a western, but it's not a bad thing. Sylvie Fennec is adorable as Sheba, who is perhaps the niece of Hud or the girlfriend of his deceased brother ... it was never specified. This film deserves to be seen, and once again, we argue for a nice DVD with all the accompaniments - I think that THE SPECIALISTS would be as well known as all the other westerns of Corbucci, and it's really a eulogy.
