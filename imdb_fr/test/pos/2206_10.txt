First of all, I watch this show since I was little, and I always liked that. Of course, maybe I did not understand that when I was young, but I still enjoyed it! And now that I've been able to understand it for many years, I love it even more. The score of this musical is the most wonderfully detailed score I have ever heard! Each note is perfect, I do not even need to hear the song to enjoy! <br /> <br /> Let's move on to this production: it's beautiful! Of course, no one could play Mrs. Lovett except Angela Lansbury, and she does it perfectly. And she should, she's been playing that role for a number of years. George Hearn is absolutely great. The best Sweeney Todd I have ever heard of. He has a wonderful voice, yet he can launch his voice so well! His "epiphany" is incredible, as you can see by the reaction of the audience. The judge, Toby, Antony and Pirelli are also so wonderful in their roles. Everyone is perfect! Well, I still have to move quickly in Johanna's green finch and linnet. She does not sing at all well this song. <br /> <br /> This show can be enjoyed at any age, but it is not always accepted. I am not your typical middle-aged theater lover, I am only 15 years old. However, Sweeney Todd made me enjoy music more than any other musical.
