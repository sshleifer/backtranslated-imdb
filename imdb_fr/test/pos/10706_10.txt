Shimmering documentary about how a small group of idealistic young men used music, art and dance to unify and heal the community of Vigario Geral, one of the most violent neighborhoods of the Rio slum ("favela" means neighborhood in Portuguese), offering its young people a positive alternative to the murderous world of drug traffickers, gangsters. <br /> <br /> In their first feature film, Zimbalist and Mochary designed a breathtaking film because it works at different levels. As a social document, it gives the facts we need to know in order to have a context for understanding the meaning of the particular story told here. The story itself is well developed, with a strong narrative arc and, for more precision, it is crossed with an acute suspense. Anderson Sa, his central, arresting and charismatic protagonist, is a wise, articulate, courageous, spiritually evolved natural leader, a talented performer, a visionary who accompanies his speech. <br /> <br /> Music and dance are not lacking. distract. There are talking heads ?? mainly Sa and his closest associate, Jose Junior - but they are presented with an imaginative cinematic brilliance. The montage nicely mixes sequences of different themes, punctuated punctually by some fixed texts full of facts. The rhythm is as lively as the music. A lot of work is done in 78 minutes. <br /> <br /> Grupo Afro Reggae, the neighborhood social club created by Anderson, Junior and a few in 1993, uses music and dance as weapons to fight drug traffickers. and the duplicating police. They teach percussion techniques to all children who wish to join a class, as well as dance, martial arts, a community newspaper. Do not smoke, do not drink, no drugs. There is a subtle and discreet spiritual fabric in the movement, inspired by the Hindu god Shiva, the destroyer of old habits. <br /> <br /> Jeff Zimbalist, who was also a senior filmmaker and publisher, is a student of culture and modern media at Brown University. He has perfected his documentaries for PBS and others, and he teaches film at the New York Film Academy and elsewhere. Matt Mochary, like Andrew Jarecki ("Capturing the Friedmans") did it recently, just turned to the business world. <br /> <br /> Zimbalist and Mochary won the Best New Filmmaker Award at the 2005 TribBeCa Film Festival and "Favela Rising" were tied for best film of the year in the 2005 awards International Documentary Association. I could continue for pages on Afro Reggae, Sa and this movie. A better idea is simply that you go see it! My rating: A 10/10
