Good movie. <br /> <br /> I managed to get it back on DVD in a store sale. Â£ 2.99 seems to be a bargain and it is. The film is called "To Kill For". It took a little detective work to find out his original name. <br /> <br /> In the UK, it was ranked 18 and rightly so, although the quality level of the films depends on the "ability to sell". Having seen Final Destination 3 last night, in my opinion, it should have been a 18. <br /> <br /> Maybe the delicious thing, Traci Lords, tends to move the leaderboard to 18. Such a shame. <br /> <br /> Traci is a great actress and should have the chance to appear in more and more important productions. His ability to transform what is called a B-Movies into a great performance is not surprising. <br /> <br /> Long live Traci Lords and her incredible talent as an actress.
