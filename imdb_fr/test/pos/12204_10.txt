This is the first science fiction series I have been seriously addicted to since Star Trek (and I have not watched Trek for years). He takes the theme of the invasion in somewhat different directions, but did so in a very exciting way. It also borrows the soap opera format, where the bow continues throughout the year of the series. The CGI definitely does not overcome either the plot or the characters, with the exception of Nim, the new creature who is a pet with a definite attitude. (All that would show what he really thought of the neighbor's impending dog is A-1 in my book.) It was a stroke of genius. <br /> <br /> I still have questions at the end of the final (intelligent, I hope) and fingers crossed to make me believe that NBC or someone else (Sci Fi, maybe be) will continue to broadcast answer these questions. <br /> <br /> A really great show.
