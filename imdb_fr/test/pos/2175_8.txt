I recently read the story to see how these two characters agree, and if you can convince yourself, this film is better than Balzac. I think the story goes that Colonel Chabert is a man who has suffered a lot and is coming home, not like a hero, but as an outcast. <br /> <br /> As someone mentioned at first, I wondered if Chabert looked like Martin Guerre's return. No. It is firmly established by Balzac that Chabert is the real deal. What's interesting is that it's not him, it's his way of dealing with his wife and society. <br /> <br /> I think it's a timeless story of men going out to fight for their rights. country and when they go home, time has left them behind. Chabert is a tragic figure made even more poignant by the astonishing Gerard Depardieu. I do not care if he has been in 1 million movies, he's captivating. <br /> <br /> Fanny Ardant has a horrible character to play. Formerly a prostitute, Rose used her feminine devices to climb the social ladder. Are his emotions true for Ferraud Account? I think they are and they may be related to her social status at the time, and you start to feel some empathy for her. <br /> <br /> Fabrice Lucini is sneaking into my heart. He is exceptional here as Derville. <br /> <br /> I think if you can get your hands on this jewel of a movie, you will not regret it. French cinema at its best.
