I was very moved by the soft power of this movie and the atmosphere it created. I think he should have received a lot more credit than he did. I agree that Michelle Pfeiffer should have been nominated, but I think all the performances were exceptional and Michelle Pfeiffer and Jessica Lange portrayed the profound affinity and conflict of the sisters with great depth and emotional sensitivity. Although I did not read the book, I found the modern concept of King Lear very cool. I will certainly never look at the room again in the same way!
