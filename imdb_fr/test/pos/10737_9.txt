I consider myself lucky to have had the chance to see a wonderful movie with two wonderful actors. "Kramer vs. Kramer" was great for me because I think I could understand. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, my parents are divorced. Even though I was older than Billy in this film, I felt his pain and confusion. Having two parents whom you thought happy and who end up hating is the worst. In fact, through this film, I think it made me realize that my parents are also people and that they have had as much pain as my sister and myself. <br /> <br /> Back to the movie, it was a good thing one. Yes, it's dated and Meryl and Dustin are very young. But I would recommend this to a lot of people, because I think most can have a relationship. There are funny, sad, happy and soothing moments that these great actors carry fantastically. It's a good movie and deserves more credit than a 7.5. <br /> <br /> 9/10
