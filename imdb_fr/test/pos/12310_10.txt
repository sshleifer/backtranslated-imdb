I've been waiting for years for THE DEAD to appear on video, having practically ripped up my VHS copy. This is one of the most beautiful movies ever made for the holidays. It takes place at the feast of Epiphany (twelfth night). This is a simple and poignant vignette of characters attending a dinner prepared by three women from Dublin. At the heart of the story is a couple without love, a woman who once passionately loved a young man who died for her and a man who wants to feel the same kind of passion for his wife, but who feels incapable. All the performances are breathtaking and the scenario blends beautifully with the characters of the dinner. Of course, his source text is the news of the same title by James Joyce, and much of his narrative structure is entirely preserved. John Huston's long career as one of Hollywood's greatest filmmakers had a truly fitting finale with this film, which was scripted by his son, Tony Huston; his daughter, Anjelica Huston; and is dedicated to his wife, Maricella. Thank you to Lions Gate for recovering the rights to this movie and having it published on DVD. For fans of all things Irish or for those looking for a literate, subtle and incredibly moving holiday movie, it's a real gem.
