Having touched the modeling industry (as a model), I watch this show with a slightly different vision than most people. Although I admit that ANTM can be a fun and entertaining show, it seems that, as the seasons go by, it continues to drift away from reality. <br /> <br /> The show appears to be almost pure advertisement for its competitors, as none of the winners of the series (nor its competitors) has made a name outside the frame of the series. This may be because the truth is that any girl with the real potential of being a high fashion model should not have too much trouble submitting proposals to agencies (you can do it by email or post if the distance prevents you from participating in an open agency call), sign an agency and start a modeling career. Yes, the process does not guarantee success, but apparently, ANTM no longer. And participating in a reality show seems to offer less dynamism in the modeling business than signing with a top-notch or decent agency (only one competitor in each cycle has a guarantee anyway). <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, the series can not hurt, can certainly be fun and has a kind of magic that is particularly suitable for teenagers, which I found. Although, I must add, ANTM can become a little tiring and boring, after watching several cycles, as it has become for me. And in addition to some unrealistic situations (all more outrageous than others), the only other problem is the misuse of "Tyra, Tyra, Tyra!" Tyra really seems to want to guide these girls to success, but is it necessary that the temporary searches of each model be covered by images of Tyra; for virtually every panel and challenge to include a story or scenario that "Tyra" has lived through and overcome? I do not think so. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, get out of Tyra, put it in a little more reality, and ANTM could be a 10-star show, instead of a 7.
