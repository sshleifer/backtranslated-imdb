I have 2 complete sets of life time, this is my favorite movies of all time. Love all the actors and actresses .. Superb image..Love Patrick Swazy..This is the movie, which showed his real talent. But for now, he does not get credit for the display made! We missed a lot of merit in these films. Love the way they portrayed the dry and dusty monologues of the Civil War. By making one of the greatest love stories of all time and showing through all the obstacles of life .. How 2 divided countries divide. But all and all the people remained strong, even though the war divided kinship and lifestyles. can still stay until today! Simply the best ... Party with the wind does not compare to this movie. Patrick Swazy at his best ,. After seeing this movie for a hundred thousand times. I became a big fan of Swazy..And I followed his career since..Have all his movies after he did the North and the South!
