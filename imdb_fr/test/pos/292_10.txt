It is an apocalyptic vision of the hell of our contemporary world. The social criticism of our superficial commercial values ​​makes this film an exceptional vision of the cliché "The war is a hell", highlighted by a mythical trip upstream in Cambodia by a special forces captain whose mission is to eliminate ( with extreme prejudices) a rogue colonel who left behind the army's concepts of justice to create his own world. When I saw Apocalypse Now in 1980, I thought it was a deeply flawed masterpiece. In particular, I found the final segment of the journey with Brando, which encompasses Conrad's heart of darkness, quite boring. I finally had the chance to see Apocalypse Now Redux and the flaws were fixed. Redux makes the film a true masterpiece, certainly among the 100 best films ever made. Brando's performance now seems complete and complete, perhaps a little less mysterious, but much deeper. Martin Sheen is brilliant in the heart of one of the best theater ensembles ever assembled. It's good to see a young Harrison Ford, Scott Glenn, etc. among the first on-screen representations that suggest how good actors will be recognized. The additional images greatly enrich the work of Robert Duvall, Fred Forrest, Lawrence Fishburne and Sam Bottoms. If you've never seen this movie, skip the original and head straight for Redux. I wish we could get a group of Gangs of New York Redux from Scorcese to fill all the gaps in this potentially very imperfect masterpiece.
