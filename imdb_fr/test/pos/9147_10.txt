No matter how many times Wile Ethelbert "Famishius Famishius" Coyote tries to take the road "Burnius Roadibus", we always know what will happen, even if our sympathy remains with the WEC. The culmination of "Hook, Line and Stinker" is a program at Rube Goldberg which, according to the WEC, should finally be completed by RR; but of course, you know what's going on. <br /> <br /> So, Wile E. continues to hilariously engage in fanaticism (defined by George Santayana as redoubled efforts after you forget your goal) while Road Runner almost never becomes aware of the potential danger - or the absence of danger - in which he could be. A real classic. <br /> <br /> And yes, the middle name of the coyote is Ethelbert. I learned that from "Jeopardy!"
