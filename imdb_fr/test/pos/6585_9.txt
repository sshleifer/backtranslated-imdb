This is another one of those rare films that you feel grateful to be presented instead of the usual guts of Hollywood. It really is a real roller coaster ride, as we follow the effects of a counterfeit 500 euro bill on a multitude of people. We ask "and if" all the time, but it's certainly a butterfly effect captured on film. It will make you laugh, cry and bite your lip. I loved every minute! And thanks to SBS Australia for presenting really entertaining movies, which are even worth reading the subtitles. The only drawback is that I will not book a holiday at Frozen Land - they all look very depressed - and it must be very cold. Anyway, look at it, it's worth every second.
