It is rare for a film to encompass both the problem-solving process and a far-reaching moral dilemma AND a fairly accurate historical film, but Fat Man and Little Boy succeed this turn. <br /> <br /> This is the story of the Manhattan Project - the Second World War efforts to build the atomic bomb, told in the form of the conflict between the two men who created it, General Leslie Groves and Robert Oppenheimer. <br /> <br /> The historical characters are an excellent study of the opposites: military against civilian, practice against idealistic, emotional versus scientific, brutal force against problem solving based on consensus, immediacy against long-term vision. A fictional character, played by John Cusack, is added as a kind of synthesis of the two historical characters, to show the humanity that escapes strangely to the real people (and of course the obligatory love interest played by Laura Dern). Looking for a straight documentary might criticize melodrama duds (and occasional blur with facts, but that's Hollywood for you), but the purpose of fiction is to synthesize and galvanize events into more universal truths. . <br /> <br /> One of the great visuals of the film is the one where Oppenheimer attends the first atomic explosion: it's totally through his reaction, and given the great graphics inherent in an atomic explosion, it's a brave and quite effective way to describe in one moment the ambivalent effect on humans of unleashing such power (the kind of thing lost in the typical version of the story that turns to Hollywood.) use of music is particularly excellent in the last third of the film. <br /> <br /> Quite accessible and highly recommended both as a historical and dramatic film of the highest order.
