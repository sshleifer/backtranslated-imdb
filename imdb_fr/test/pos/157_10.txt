I will not bore you with a synopsis, chances are you already know them. And I hope you already know Park Chan-Wook's work. <br /> <br /> I strongly disagree with some of the other commentators stating that "Park did not leave the trilogy of revenge blah blah blah." Because what do you know? He has!!! The trilogy of revenge was first different, how can you even compare the sumptuousness and subtlety of "Sympathy For Mr Vengeance" with the frenzy and extravagance of "Oldboy"? Park Chan-Wook has an incredible style, but his films do not all share the same style! This has been true and remains true with the release of "Thirst". <br /> <br /> "Thirsty" is an amazing picture, he has everything you want in a movie. Violence breathtaking, gore good taste, good mood, incredible suspense and sex scenes even very realistic. The story is so crazy that at no time can you guess what will happen next. I'm so happy to say that Park is in great shape again with this fantastic story of dark-comic-vampire-love. Watch as soon as you can!
