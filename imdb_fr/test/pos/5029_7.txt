As a previous critic said, Travolta stole all the scenes he was in. Recognize the character? It was Vinnie Barberino, tall and always a little fishy, ​​but always kind, oh yes! <br /> <br /> William Hurt and Bob Hoskins were disappointing, maybe because their characters were badly written, or they just did not care. I continued to see one of the Baldwins (I never remember which one) as Hurt so that Hurt's amazing talents would not be lost. <br /> <br /> Andie McDowell is a cabbage, but not very credible; partly writing. The development of the character was just not an important thing in this movie. Just watch for Travolta, sit back and enjoy.
