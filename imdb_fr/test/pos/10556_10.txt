What a beautiful film it is. I found it full of the delightfully unexpected pain of being a single dad of a teenager. And it is well located in a tropical island. <br /> <br /> Gerard Depardeiux brings his European flair to this story about a divorced father of a teenager. They are on vacation together and she is starting to add to the excitement of the island in many unexpected ways. But you will need to see the movie yourself to see all the hilarious situations they find on their own. <br /> <br /> There are some classic cults that all teenagers should see. This film should be added to the list. In addition to Dirty Dancing, Ferris Bueller's Day Off, Bill and Ted's excellent adventure, Rocky Horror Picture Show and Animal House, My Father the Hero is scheduled for a film study. Look at it as if you had a teenage girl and you're going to laugh out loud. Look at it with your teenage daughter and get ready to laugh at it for months.
