when fellini filmed 8 1/2, many commented that it was the most personal vision that ever existed to find its perfect expression. When Dante set fire to the flames of his eternal passion, many were astonished by the honest brutality of his unshared feelings toward a young woman. when onur tukel and a merry band of talented and mischievous filmmakers - from the Mecca of cinematic folly - met together during the cold two weeks of December 2000, many commented that nothing more sophisticated had been committed ... much less on film. <br /> <br /> Well, for those who doubt, look at this original piece and find out why ID is both a charming and powerful thing. and if it does not discard you, go back and erase one ... it's probably time for you to do it. <br /> <br /> Congratulations for a superb work of art
