From time to time, you come across a movie that exceeds even your wildest expectations. Given the IMDb rating of 4.0, I did not really expect much with The Brotherhood of Satan. I was hoping that at a minimum, it could be a cheesy fun like The Devil's Rain or any other satanic horror movie of the early 70's. I could not have been more wrong. Instead, I got an ambitious and intelligent movie with a cast that I really enjoyed. In general terms, to reveal nothing, the style and structure of the film are much more experimental than the narration as simple as that of the early '70s. The Brotherhood of Satan does not hit you in the head with conspiracy points and explanations. Much remains to be left to the spectator to fill in the blanks. As a spectator, you know that something is wrong, but you do not really know what it is. The unknown contributes to creating a much more frightening atmosphere than most similar movies. The end is effective with his surreal images. I was stunned when the final credits started rolling. Those who want a dazzling finale will be disappointed with the simplicity of the end. A smaller film would have tried to do everything possible and would most likely have failed miserably. <br /> <br /> There are moments in the film where it's easy to forget that the director, Bernard McEveety, mainly worked on television before the Brotherhood of Satan. Some scenes are so well prepared, enlightened, and shot that even the most accomplished filmmakers could learn a thing or two. For example, I have seen enough movies over the years to realize that filmmakers can sometimes seem to have a hard time making big screen shots indoors. Not here. The scene where men discuss their action plan in the sheriff's office is amazing. We see all five men at once ?? each doing his own thing as in real life. In a smaller film, we could see all men at the same time, but everyone would be motionless, waiting for his turn to deliver his dialogue. It's a small scene, but it seems so natural and beautiful that it's one of my favorite moments in The Brotherhood of Satan. <br /> <br /> Finally, I mentioned the acting in my opening, so without going into a long speech, I will simply say that the Brotherhood of Satan presents Strother Martin and LQ Jones Any movie with these two guy is almost an automatic winner with me.
