No pun. I'm not going to mess up about the story, but it's safe to assume that you already know what kind of character is represented by the main actor. And of course, being a priest while being "ugly" exaggerates all that. Moreover, it is the most erotic film of Park Chan Wook to date. <br /> <br /> If you've seen Wook's previous films / works, you know he's very visual (in a good way) and it shows up again here. Although he is moving away from the theme of revenge from his previous films to the surface, there is still enough hidden heat. And when it comes down, many bad things begin to happen. But through all this dark, there are also moments of light (fun) to have too. A very stylistic and provocative film, which lives outside the general public and does a very good job ...
