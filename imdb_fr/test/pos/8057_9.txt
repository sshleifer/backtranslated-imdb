I claim that the fictional biography of "The Phenix City Story" goes back to areas where American filmmakers have rarely ventured. Director Phil Karlson got his directorial position in "The Untouchables", a very popular television series based largely on "Kansas". City Confidential "and this film, and it has become one of the most admired and imitated films ever made.The rarest exercise for American filmmakers seems to be the film or television series anti-crime centrally focused on the hero I remind the viewer how powerful the producers "Cain's Hundred" and "Hardcastle and McCormick" and even "The Untouchables" are to work to produce something other than episodes largely devoted to the non-fictional activities of criminals rather than These powerful, seminal and very gritty films have their own style, and their lesson seems to be the attention to detail about opponents and victims of criminal organizations and their gang members. There is a twelve-minute prelude to the film, in which journalist Clete Roberts interviews real-life participants from the Alabama city who had struggled against his corrupt vice gangs. The problem arises from the presence of Fort Benning on the other side of the river and the existence, almost a century ago, of dens in the area. The film details the return of John Patterson from Germany where he was a prosecutor. His father, defeated for the Attorney General of Alabama, refuses to join his pursuit of the lords of 14th Street despite several provocations, including the beating of his son, avenged by Patterson his executioner. There are several well-developed characters, including Ellie, who works in one of the clubs, and his honest boyfriend, the union boss, Patterson and John's wife, Ed Gage, the agents of the stage managers, and Zeke Ward, an honest black man. victim of his opposition to them. Harry Neumann's cinematography and Stanley Fleischer's art direction are in black and white and look a lot like informational films, which adds to the film's realistic power. Harry Sukman's music contributes effectively to the film. The writer Daniel Mainwaring and Crane Wilbur have produced a quick and simple story that is divided into several parts. The first part illustrates the vice-presidents' empire from inside one of their clubs and shows the fate of a victim who is beaten and then apprehended by the police in the pay of the crowd. In the second part, Albert Patterson refuses to oppose the leader of the Mob, the intelligent Rhett Tanner. In the third part, the young Patterson is back and after several incidents, including that of having to hit the cretin of the mob for revenge, he decides to head his father to the state attorney general. His wife is horrified. and the crowd kills Zeke Ward's daughter and deposits the body at Patterson's home with a warning that her children will be next. Some other incidents of this type, including the loss of a trial in which the Patterson prove that the moron killed one of their friends who found the car involved in the murder of the girl and witnessed the accident report by death, convinced Patterson to run, and he wins the state-wide Democratic nomination despite the state tactics of the crowd - and is quickly murdered. John Patterson prevents a self-defense crowd from engaging in an open war with the crowd on 14th Street and uses their voices to call the capital and demand martial law for the city of Phenix. The clubs are closed and the material confiscated, but not until the girl inside is murdered by the Crow's fool, and Zeke Ward must stop Patterson from killing Tanner instead of bringing him to justice. The end of the drama is optimistic; but the prognosis for the city is less optimistic than described; the crowd actually tried to come back and then moved to Tennessee. In this well-played classic of anti-crime cinema, Richard Kiley is young but very strong like Patterson, playing it without an accent. John Mcintyre as a father is very good, while Edward Andrews as Boss Tanner is of a prestigious caliber. Kathryn Grant, Ellie, Jean Carson and Kathy Marlowe, Mob Women, John Larch, Children, Biff Mcguire, Young Victim, James Edwards, Zeke Ward, Lenka Peterson, John's Wife, and some good actors like city ​​dwellers and gang leaders. It's hard to say enough good things about the realism and lack of posture in this movie. it's certainly one of Phil Karlson's best staging efforts. Karlson also participated in "The Scarface Mob" and then "Walking Tall". A sober and inspiring look at the ease with which complacent citizens of a democracy of public interest can accept tyranny and how some honest men can teach them the need to fight for their rights.
