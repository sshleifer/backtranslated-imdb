My family is watching this movie again and again. Even our 3 year old loves it. I like the "goodness" in the movie. Give foreigners a chance ... show good will towards the one who clearly needs an unconditional acceptance. The film gives a feeling of good will and victory. Another aspect of the film that makes it so appealing is the personality of Velvet's brothers and sisters. The bird lover. The lover of insects. The boy in love! Very cute and happy film. However, there is one thing that irritates him. Thus, Mrs. Brown often gives Mr. Brown a stupid or imprudent air. She sometimes comes to know everything, and to himself, as he is not. Too bad to put this in such a beautiful story. Nevertheless, we will continue to enjoy this wonderful old movie!
