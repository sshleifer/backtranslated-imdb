It looks so much like movies like PULP FICTION or DOGS TANK that it's impossible to think that Tarantino's movies were not an inspiration for this Thursday. However, for a low cost film of the B series, it's not bad. The plot about gangsters is captivating and fun. There is also a bit of black humor and sarcasm in PULP FICTION. The resources were not numerous, but the film is well produced. The game is also good. I enjoyed the scene when the girl was sitting on the couch, teasing the doctor ... It was hot and fun at the same time! The soundtrack is good too. I did not hear many songs, but the ones I heard pleased me. I mark it 7/10.
