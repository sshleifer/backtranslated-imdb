Guest House is perhaps the most stupid, the most tasteless and the most violent comedy ever produced, but Guest House is also very funny. Do not listen to critics, they have no sense of humor. Although the climax is running out of steam (without throwing up), it's still a fun party movie. Seven candles in the eyes out of ten.
