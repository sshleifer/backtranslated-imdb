First love. Teenage love. We all experienced it even though it was not as sweet as that shared by the protagonists. "Friends" could be considered an adaptation of the classic "The Blue Lagoon", born in 1949, and his remakes of 1980 (the most popular, with Brooke Shields) and 1999 (with the young Milla Jovovich). While "The Blue Lagoon" puts the two young lovers in a deserted island, without any contact with civilization, "Friends" goes in the opposite direction and it is certain that it will sound much more true and that it will be a more difficult film with a contemporary audience. Paul and Michelle who, for various reasons, turn away from the family and the adult world to end up living together in a small cottage in the south of France. Having only one and the other and their childhood innocence, their friendship develops slowly to become much more difficult as they struggle to support themselves, in this sweet story that unfolds at age adult. This film, even to this day, is controversial since the actors are teenagers and they certainly look at the ages indicated in the film (15 and 14 1/2). The film contains a hint of child sexual abuse, nudity, depictions of sex, and teenage pregnancy. But the real controversy is not about the subject but the fact that Paul and Michelle's love is portrayed as a natural and healthy relationship. Although it worked well for lovers stranded in another era and on a desert island, having them in a modern setting presents very difficult moral problems. Juvenile intercourse laws are in place in almost all countries, and the lack of adolescent sexuality education is considered one of the causes of the rise in unwanted pregnancies and abortions. It's a film like this: child pornography or a slap that puts us in front of our own hypocrisy in the face of a modern society that is not aimed at adolescent parents and laws that are clearly going to against human nature and hormonal development, but what is needed to prevent child abuse? Is hormonal development parallel to emotional growth? These are not easy questions and most of us will feel uncomfortable with them. As an artistic piece, this film is truly a forgotten and raw jewel. The scenario progresses with extreme simplicity, although sober, but never bangs to indicate its message, although, according to the current standards, it is a little slow. The photography is beautiful and there are scenes of great beauty. The game of the two protagonists varies from really terrible in some scenes to wonderfully innocent and credible in others. Pop music, unlike most current productions, is used with taste and lyrics sometimes speak the thoughts of the protagonists. All in all, it's a delightful piece, even if the moral values ​​do not match with yours.
