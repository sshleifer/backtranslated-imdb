The diabolical plots Professor Moriarty to take control of both SHERLOCK HOLMES AND SECRET WEAPON who could win the war for the Nazis. <br /> <br /> Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce return to the screen as beloved detective of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and sidekick, Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson, in this entertaining little mystery. Universal Studios has not lost money on either fancy production values ​​or a sensitive script, knowing that its two stars would be all the appeal a public would need. Indeed, Rathbone, like the cerebral ego, and Bruce, like the idiot, seem to really become the characters they create, keeping their faces cheerfully straight in the exercise of utter absurdity. <br /> <br /> Dennis Hoey makes his first appearance as Scotland Yard's stubborn inspector Lestrade; team with Bruce, these two good-hearted but pedantic accomplices are to save twice the life of Holmes intellectually superior. Lionel Atwill, a master of the sinister who deserves greater recognition for his talent, does an excellent job like Moriarty, which makes the villainous villain a worthy enemy of the steel Holmes, savoring the scenes where he manages to inflict torture and pain. <Br /> <br /> William Poster Jr. and Kaaren Verne play the Swiss scientist and his girlfriend who are at the heart of the mystery, but they are not given much to do. Sweet Mary Gordon makes a symbolic appearance as a landlady Mrs. Hudson Holmes. <br /> <br /> Rathbone spices his already classic Holmes rendition by appearing disguised three times over the course of the story, thus revealing to the viewer that the great Sleuth was a little cabotin at heart <br /> <br /> This movie -. which is more or less based on news items from Sir Arthur "The Men of Dance" and "The Empty House" - followed The Voice of Terror (1942) and preceded SHERLOCK HOLMES WASHINGTON (1943).
