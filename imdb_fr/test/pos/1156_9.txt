1904. Morocco, a North African country, is suspended from precarious independence, while the various European powers - France, Germany, Great Britain, Russia, Spain and now the United States - compete for influence in the region . The sultan (Marc Zuber) is a weak puppet. his uncle, the Bashaw (Vladek Sheybal), who is manipulated by the French and the Germans, is the real power behind the throne. Enter Berber Chieftan Raisuli (Sean Connery), the leader of the Rif tribe and "the last of the Pirates of Barbary", who kidnaps an American missionary Eden Pedecaris (Candice Bergen) and her two children and takes them hostage. Back in the United States, President Theodore Roosevelt (Brian Keith) threatens to go to war on this issue: "Pedecaris Alive or Raisuli Dead!" - see in the question the ideal way to exercise his diplomacy "Big Stick", although the Secretary of State John Hay (John Huston) is not so confident. However, the Raisuli have less sinister projects for Pedecarises, who are more than able to support themselves anyway. <br /> <br /> John Milius's great historical film, based VERY vaguely on a true story (that is, Pedecaris a middle-aged man), is a wonderful escape. There are breathtaking scenes of action, a well-written spiritual scenario, a beautiful cast that plays with the material and does not go beyond its reception, like, for example, "Pirates of the Caribbean" or "Lord of the Rings" . It's not really an "epic" film in the strict sense, but it's one of the best pure action movies ever made. <br /> <br /> If the historical context is fragile, the scenario is interesting and, as some critics point out, it is even more relevant today than it was when done. As President Roosevelt says, "America is like a grizzly bear" - fierce, strong, but a bit blind and reckless sometimes. At the time of filming, the United States had just been propelled onto the world stage as a superpower after their brilliant victory in the Spanish-American War. Roosevelt seizes this incident to prove his worth. In real life, things did not go well, but allegorically, it works well. Although written in a right-wing perspective, Milius's scenario is accurate enough to evaluate America and its place in the world. He admires Roosevelt and his method of "big stick" diplomacy, and correctly recognizes (in Roosevelt's words) that even if one can fear and respect the United States, they will never be truly "loved" by the world, no matter what theyre doing. . And there are certain scenes - like Roosevelt's targeted shooting at European leaders and the almost comical surprise attack by the Marines against the Bashaw's palace - that show the reckless and violent side of America, while others - the decisive confrontation with the Germans - show their heroism. The historical / political context of the film is, of course, nothing but meat on the bones of what is essentially an exciting action / adventure film. There are brilliantly executed action scenes, such as Raisuli's rescue of the Pedecaris from tribal members who cross twice, which features some of the best swordplay of a movie. The opening entrance to the Raisuli and the aforementioned march and attack of the US Marines are brilliant pieces of bravery. And the final battle, which combines elements of "Lawrence of Arabia" and "The Wild Bunch", while a major historical fantasy (a three-way battle between Germans, Americans and Rives), is a superbly crafted scene. scene, exalting adrenaline. sequence. <br /> <br /> The excellent distribution presents excellent performances. Everyone seems to be having fun with the movie, and it shows. Sean Connery is astonishingly convincing as a Scottish-accented Berber, but manages to draw his interesting, well-drawn and chivalrous character who comes to respect his hostage and horror of the modern and incivile war. Candice Bergen, an actress I have never loved, gives a beautiful interpretation of the crazy Eden Pedecaris, who is just as hard as her kidnapper. Brian Keith is an incredibly convincing TR - you really feel like he must have been that way, an athletic, surly man, yet practical and intelligent, with an admirable sense of self. Roosevelt's boxing and target shooting scenes, while discussing foreign policy, are among the most painful moments in film history. And who can forget phrases such as "Why spoil the beauty of the thing with legality?" John Huston provides solid support as Hay tired and cautious, acting as a perfect foil for the much more impetuous Roosevelt. <br /> <br /> Among the privileged actors, the best are Geoffrey Lewis, Samuel Gummere, the cynical ambassador caught in the middle of the political plot, and Steve Kanaly, the marine captain gung-ho, who defends with enthusiasm (and performs) "military intervention!" as a simple and direct solution to the whole complex situation. Other familiar faces such as Vladek Sheybal, Nadim Sawalha, Roy Jenson, Larry Cross, Marc Zuber and Darrell Fetty are also doing quality work, no matter what their role. Spaghetti Western fans will recognize Antoine Saint-John ("A handful of dynamite") as the German general and Aldo Sambrell as one of the men of the Raisuli tribe. <br /> <br /> "The Wind and the Lion" is all around, a wonderfully realized adventure film. There's something for everyone: a wonderful sword and sword game, a lot of humor, a tough and brave heroine (and her two cute kids), a beautiful romance (if not consumed) and an interesting political / historical context (although fanciful). It's not a masterpiece, but hey, that was not what I was trying to do. I give "The Wind and Lion" nine exciting stars and my highest recommendation.
