I am going to read a new report on 'Mer des Caraïbes, May 1891'. A small boat sauvetage dérive sans but mer, containing six condemned by a shipwrecked shipwreck and the docteur du navire, lieutenant Claude De Ross (Claudio Cassinelli). The night before, a foreigner can take the ferry to the island, with no name and no card. Le bateau heurte des rochers et é déchiré. One of the prisoners is this one who seems to be a gluante creature of poisson-homme mutant. Le lendemain morning, Claude revived and retreated to wash on a plage. Il finds a pool of white bouillonnantes and one of the dead prisoners in the ocean. Claude warned another surviving prisoner, José (Franco Iavarone), from wherever he was drinking, the eau car cela le tierait. All other renowned subjects are given by other surviving prisoners, Peter (Roberto Posse), François (Francesco Mazzeri) and Skip (Giuseppe Castellano). François quits seul to try to attract an animal to nourish, find a great oil spout. But I'm on tour, this is one of the hommes-poissons. Claude, José, Peter et Skip continued to explore the island's stories that attributed the death of François to a sort of animal attack. Footsteps later, Skip is you when I'm lying on the bottom of a pool. Maintenant, il ne reste plus that Claude, José et Peter. He is buried in a cemetery with beaucoup of tombes vides et des signes of recent magical nook rituals. Claude receives a nearby south rock serpent. Soudain, a coup de feu retentit et la tête du serpent explose. Une femme à cheval nommée Amanda Marvin (Barbara Bach) turns to be the wilderness of Claudes. He read the quote of his immiedement, while he was part of Edmund Rackham (Richard Johnson) and did not visit me. Claude, Joseph and Peter decided to continue walking to finish you to find the great house of Rackham in which they were invited to restore. That night, Peter putsuit Amanda and the essay of the violin in a marais. Peter quickly devouring the nourriture pour les hommes-poissons. Et un prêtresse vaudou appelée Shakira (Beryl Cunningham), who hit with Rackham, made a ritual of magie noire consisting of breaking the gorge of a poulet au cimetière. I beg your pardon, Claude and Joseph tell you what the burning fish is like, because I'm not too worried about Rackham, I think I'll read my mind. Jose monte à cheval is missing. Claude was released from one of the hommes-poissons by Amanda, and I was invited to leave. Claude sees Rackham affronter à nouveau. Rackham warns that a scientist and father of Amanda, I profess Professor Ernest Marvin (Joseph Cotten), will not kiss her for life. Rackham said that plus Ernest will rest in the long term, plus the aura of chances to survive. Rackham told Claude they are right. Rackham has retroceded the citation of Atlantis plus 2000 ft of profouer. Il used the hommes-poissons to access the best losses of Atlantis and kisses Amanda et de son père pour les contrôler. I affirm that the hommes-poissons are the descendants of premier inhabitants of Atlantide. Rackham offers Claude a part of the treasure if the aide to garder Ernest on Friday. Later on, Claude became aware of the name of Ernest Marvin as a scientist condemned for the expense of the transplantation of organs of animals chez l'homme. By decaying the secret work of Ernest, I would say that Rackham reminds you that poets are not descendants, but I read the genuinely modified issue, and I was transformed into amphibious creations by the grotesque experiences of Ernest! Rackham in Claude's final conclusion assists you in finishing your efforts to take you to a large pool and replenish you slowly with water, areas that fly from the islands to start irruption and to send you the flip-flop partout. Rackham sees the quest for the island with its treasures and Amanda. Claude escapes to a deadly boat for Amanda and quitter he sails that I want him to die in eruption? Reviewed by Sergio Martino, beaucoup aimé the film that mixes different genres. Sergio Donati's scenario is fast, interspersing and having fun. The intrigue is small and small, the one who allows me to continue to regard. I'm telling you that I did not see the original version and I do not have any pictures of the scenes added to the United States for Roger Corman. Barbara Bach made an actress extravagantly attractive, but did you disagree with the fact that she was not present at the time of snakes, I think that I have more than an unpleasant one. Richard Johnson made a great michigan and Claudio Cassinelli a nice hero. The hommes-poissons eux-mêmes on the air a fake foot when the caméra wears trop longtemps sur eux, mais ils ont l'air plus cool et j'ai vu pire. Certains effets thumbnails that are also a median aspect, but in the ensemble, I've always loved it. There is no vraiment of blood-froid, violence or nudity, but I have not missed it. The photograph by Giancarlo Ferrando et la mise en scène by Massimo Antonello Geleng is combined to create a très joli film. Costumes, accessoires et décors d'époque comme la maison de Rackham et le laboratoire d'Ernest avec son vieient équipement scientifique. The parameters of the jungle see you as luxuriant as you liked by the visually exposed splendor. J'ai vraiment aimé ce film et j'ai été diverté à long au son exécution. Je ne sais pas trop à qui je recommanderais car cela mélange different genres. I suppose that someone who fits me is choosing something different and generally well done. If you can find a copy, I'm happy to see you soon.
