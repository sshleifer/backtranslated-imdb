This film is synonymous with entertainment. It's the funniest movie I've ever seen. The lines, the actors' game. And clothes, wow, talk about 70: s. If you ever see this little gem, buy it. It's worth every penny. By the way, the opening song is great. If anyone knows where I can find it. Thank you for sending me an e-mail.
