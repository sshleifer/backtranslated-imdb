I had heard of "games" and "Dungeons and Dragons" before, but I knew it might look like what I saw in "Gamers: Dorkness Rising". These guys are so funny and fun to watch. Especially the guy who plays the "bard" or "minstrel" or whatever, he has a gift for physical comedy and timing. There is so much humor and energy in certain scenes that really make you think that at least a part was improvised on the set. The special effects had to be a bit worked, but I saw it at a convention last year and that's one of the things they said they would redo and improve, so it's probably bad now !
