I recorded The Morrison Murders on the Lifetime Movie network and watched The Morrison Murders on the Lifetime Movie network, as well as on Courttv. Jonathan Scarfe and John Corbett played Luke and Walker Morrison very well. I'm glad Walker made his brother Luke confess to the murder of his parents and their brother Bobby. I like to watch real stories on the Lifetime Movie network, as well as on Courttv. The Morrison Murders is a good movie to watch. The next time The Morrison Murders takes place on Lifetime, Lifetime Movienetwork or Courttv, I'll watch The Morrrison Murders again because my favorite actor, John Corbbett, is in The Morrison Murders. I give The Morrison Murders a figure of ten because it's a good Walker movie about who killed his parents and his brother Bobby and finally discovered that it was his brother Luke who murdered his parents and his brother Bobby.
