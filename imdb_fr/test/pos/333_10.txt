When I entered the theater, I thought it would be a good movie. And I was not a little disappointed. WOW! This movie is great! The emotions felt throughout the film are extraordinary! Excellent game of Madhavan and Simran. Beautiful music by A.R. Rahman. It's probably the best Tamil film I've seen in a long time. Mani Ratnam has once again proved himself the best for producing meaningful and sincere films. <br /> <br /> This film is about a young girl (PS Keerthana) looking for her biological mother (Nandita Das) who abandoned her in a refugee camp to fight for her country, just like her husband (JD Chakravathy). A young novelist (Madhavan) discovers the story of this young girl and decides to write a story about her. He and his wife (Simran) decide to adopt this young child, but one day, she discovers that they are not her real parents and decides to look for her birth mother. <br /> <br /> This movie shouts really EXCELLENT. The way Mani Ratnam presented the film is magnificent. <br /> <br /> My rating - 10/10
