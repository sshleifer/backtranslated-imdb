The title of the Chinese film "In the Mood for Love" is "fa yeung nien wah". This can be interpreted as "those flourishing years (formerly)". <br /> <br /> The whole movie is a well composed piece. A complex love story told in a simple visual approach. Writer-director Wong Kar-Wai has choreographed a dance of hearts - it's her, it's him, it's love. I can hear Galasso's theme: dum dum-dum, dum dum-dum and strings - almost like heartbeats. A play with prelude, stanzas and epilogue. <br /> <br /> The director optimizes the use of music (Michael Galasso's score, Nat King Cole singing in Spanish and songs / Chinese tunes). Rhythm and lyrics make viewers feel what they feel / think rather than verbal dialogues. I can hear Nat King Cole giving us hints: "Aquello ?? ojos verde" (this thing, thrown, green eyes) plays when the two meet, and "Quizas, quizas, quizas" (maybe ??) when she is indecisive. <br /> <br /> Nostalgia is omnipresent in the film. Design details abound: handbags and ties; Novelty Japanese rice cooker; cups and saucers and plates in green glass with striated patterns (I remember my father cherished them at home); mahjong session; kitchenette; bedroom furniture; the thermos for the take-away noodles that she swings when she walks. Maggie Cheung, slim and elegant, looks great in the fashionable patterns and colors of traditional Chinese clothing - "cheung sam". Every change in her dress denotes another day, another time in history. Wong Kar-Wai is ingenious in this way. <br /> <br /> The scenes may take place in the same place, but their atmosphere is different, they are advanced to the next stanza. Go up and down the stairs to the won noodle stand. Standing near the wall, at the corner of the apartments, the rain falls. In the corridor, in both directions, towards his writing corner. <br /> <br /> Anecdote: So she helps him write his novel about martial arts. Maggie could help as she has been in kung fu / martial arts movies. "Eastern Three Heroes" 1992 is a fun action movie with Maggie Cheung (Cat Thief Catcher), Michelle Yeoh and Anita Mui, three superheroes fighting evil. <br /> <br /> If you appreciate the performance of Tony Leung, do not Miss "Chungking Express" 1994 (in the second segment - a different romantic rhythm) and "Happy Together" 1997 (an intense and colorful painting on friendships , faith and destiny), both written and performed by Wong Kar-Wai. <br /> <br /> Being able to understand Cantonese and Shanghain dialects, and after visiting the official website, I realized that the epilogue was not completely translated. Here is my version of the Chinese legends: <br /> <br /> It was a kind of unbearable meeting. She always kept her head down and gave him a chance to get closer. He did not have the courage to come closer. She turned around, walks away. <br /> <br /> The time and the place were past. All that belonged no longer exists. _______ <br /> <br /> Those missing years, apparently separated by a glass dust, can see, but can not grasp. <br /> <br /> He has always aspired to everything that has happened If he manages to pierce this glass of dust, he will come back in times long gone. ________ <br /> <br /> "In the mood of love" by Wong Kar-Wai evokes the simple poetry and wisdom of Rumi, the Sufi philosopher - "inside and out", "l 'mind and body' of life, love and life. <br /> <br /> [Return.
