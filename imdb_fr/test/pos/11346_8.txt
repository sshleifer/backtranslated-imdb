Beautiful 1962 film in Hong Kong starring a man (Mr. Chow) and a woman (Ms. Chan) who become close friends when they suspect their spouse to have a love affair. Stylistically, the film is also beautiful. Wong Kar-Wai uses a lot of slow motion and close-ups on body parts (feet, hands, waist). The film itself has a reluctance and propensity that suggests its period. It's sexy without showing everything. Wong Kar-Wai also does not allow the public to see what the spouses look like, suggesting that Mr. Chow and Ms. Chan be together. Smoking is even made to be stylish with close-ups of smoke curls. A very beautiful film. Just get ready for the end. <br /> <br />
