Many people blaze this film for the presence of Paris Hilton, but it is not a good reason to oppose the film. The reality is that Paris has a rather small share, it passes the vast majority of the film off screen. The film also makes fun of her repeatedly, usually involving a camera and at least once in night vision. For those who like the Paris Hilton stage presence, it can be a movie to see at home when it's out on video, because during the screening I was at, we all laughed at their woes through the film and she is described as a "woman of questionable values". <br /> <br /> The film itself was pretty good (unlike the recent flood of weak horror movies), it has all that a good horror should do; a scary villain, an excessive violence, acts that make this average person shudder ... this film hit all the bases. This is really worth a look.
