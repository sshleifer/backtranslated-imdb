It's another western about an avid cattle baron who is trying to hunt small farmers and farmers. All this has certainly been done before and since. But The Violent Men is something special. <br /> <br /> Barbara Stanwyck plays the role of vixen as she often did in her latest films. She is married to Edward G. Robinson, who is crippled, and is the cattle baron here, but Robinson is crippled and there is some indication that his injuries may have left him helpless. It does not matter Barbara, whose brother-in-law Brian Keith meets the needs. It does not please Dianne Foster, who is the daughter of Robinson and Stanwyck, or Lita Milan, Keith's Mexican girlfriend. <br /> <br /> The subplot unfaithfulness almost resumes the film, but Glenn Ford veteran of the Civil War, convinced little rancher came to the west because his health allows him to stay here. It is every time the silent Western hero that people make the mistake of pushing once too much. I almost expect these famous words from Wild Bill Elliott to come out of Ford's mouth: "I am a peaceful man". Would have been very applicable in The Vioilent Men. <br /> <br /> The 50s were the age of the adult western, themes were in equestrian operas that had not been explored before. The following year, Glenn Ford would make another western, Jubal, one of his best explorers of infidelity as a conspiracy. <br /> <br /> There are enough traditional Western elements in The Violent Men and many for those who are addicted to soap operas too.
