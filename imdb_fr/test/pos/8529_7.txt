The year 1983 was marked by a strange phenomenon. two rival Bond movies. "Octopussy", with Roger Moore, was part of the official Cubby Broccoli Bond franchise. "Never Say Never Again", produced by a rival producer, is, apart from the terrible "Casino Royale", the only James Bond movie that is not part of this franchise. His great attraction was to bring back the original Bond, Sean Connery; his title would have been drawn from Connery's remark after "Diamonds Are Forever" that he would never play the role again. Some complained that Connery was, at age 53, too old for the role, but he was actually three years younger than his successor Moore, who not only shot "Octopussy" the same year, but then shot another Bond's film, "A View to a Kill", two years later. <br /> <br /> The film owes its existence to the settlement of a dispute over film rights about Ian Fleming's work. It may be unfortunate that the terms of the settlement include a clause stating that the new film was to be a remake of "Thunderball" because it may not have been Connery's biggest bond. (A remake of "Dr. No" or "Goldfinger" might have worked better). The plot is about the same as the previous movie; The SPECTER terrorist organization, acting in concert with a megalomaniac mogul named Largo, has stolen two US nuclear warheads and is trying to force governments around the world to ransom by threatening to detonate them if they do not receive a large sum. Of course, it's up to Bond to save the world by tracking missing missiles. <br /> <br /> The film is lucky not to have one, but two of Bond's most beautiful daughters, Barbara. Carrera, Fatima Blush, seductive but deadly, and Kim Basinger, Domino, Largo's girlfriend, who goes to Bond's side after learning the diabolical plans of her lover. A number of Bond's films have a plot that depends on the hero's ability to defeat the mistress or the villain's accomplice. Similar developments exist, for example in "Goldfinger", "Live and Let Die" and "The Living Daylights". . In the official series, Bond's ally is generally considered the female lead, but here, Carrera, playing the role of the villain, is featured above Basinger, who was a relatively unknown actress at the time. Of course, Basinger has become one of the biggest stars in Hollywood, while Carrera is one of the many girls in Bond that have faded a little. <br /> <br /> Among the wicked, Max von Sydow is a Although Blofeld is the head of SPECTER, Klaus Maria Brandauer seems too bland and tasteless as Largo, except perhaps during the game "Domination", a more sophisticated variant of these violent computer games, such as "Space Invaders", so popular in the world. early eighties. Brandauer can be an excellent actor in his native German language, in films such as "Mephisto" and "Oberst Redl", but he does not seem so expressive in English. <br /> <br /> One of the features of the film is that it follows both Bond's normal formula and sometimes departs from it. There is the standard intrigue of the world in peril, sequences of chases, a series of exotic locales, glamorous women, sinister villains and a specially written theme song based on the title of the film. There is, however, no extended pre-credit sequence, and we see some familiar characters in a new light. For example, the leader of Bond, M, becomes a languid and insightful aristocrat, his American colleague Felix Leiter is presented in black for the first time, and the Q scientist is described by Alec McCowen as a cynical disillusioned (despite his characteristic name of higher class). d'Algernon) a distinctly workers' accent. There is also a funny cameo from Rowan Atkinson as a British diplomat. Although Connery may not have been very good here, as he has done in some of his earlier films, this familiar ringing change makes it one of the most memorable links. 7/10 <br /> <br /> A blunder. The character of Rowan Atkinson indicates that he comes from the British Embassy in Nassau. As the Bahamas is a Commonwealth country, Britain would have a high commission in its capital, not an embassy.
