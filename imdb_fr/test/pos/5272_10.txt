The Helge Schneider phenomenon challenges any easy description or quick categorization. Yet, for the international audience who does not know it, it could be said that it is a rough mix of Weird Al Yankovich and Andy Kaufman, which adds flexibility to the jazz music and outfits of the 70s. While his stage performances are already eccentric, his works are simply hilarious. <br /> <br /> "00 Schneider" is, in my opinion, the best film of Helge. He plays in two main roles: the police inspector "Kommissar 00 Schneider" and the murderer "Nihil Baxter", as well as in a more valuable role as a doctor "Dr. Hasenbein". <br /> <br /> scene, we see how Baxter, a lover of modern art, accidentally kills the circus clown Bratislav Metulskie, to whom he bought a worn Jaguar that works poorly, when a beloved sculpture escapes from Baxter's hands and hits Metulskie fatally. After reading the incident in the newspaper, 00 returns from retirement to investigate the case with the support of his loyal sidekick, Lieutenant Koerschgen, who is played by an older actor with the same name. They quickly go back to Baxter's track and interrogate him in his quaintly decorated mansion (one of the best scenes in the movie!), But fail to gather evidence. The story unfolds in several turns, with several scenes that do not always really contribute to the progression of the plot, but are hilariously funny, like a dream awake before 00 (including the most unusual view on the crotch brief of a man running in the film history), a party of the police department in which Koerschgen clashes with the chief and must be hospitalized, then visited Dr. Hasenbein, already mentioned. Baxter is finally caught trying to escape to Rio de Janeiro by plane. <br /> <br /> One must always mention a special mention: Andreas Kunze, who plays here the wife of 00. in the films of Helge. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this film. The catch? You must understand German (because I doubt that there is an English version) ...
