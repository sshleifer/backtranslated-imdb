Kingdom of Kingdom, Vermont, 1927. Noel Lord (Rip Torn) lives with his Indian companion, Bangor (Tantoo Cardinal) in the area where a large dam is to be built. However, Noel does not want to abandon his lands and will have to fight the dam society to prevent the county from destroying itself. <br /> <br /> "Where the rivers flow to the north" is a captivating and contemplative story fueled by the memorable performances of Rip Torn (recently seen in the small but juicy role of Louis XV in "Marie Antoinette" of Sofia Coppola) and Tantoo Cardinal ("Dance with Wolves", "Smoke Signals"). Director Jay Craven (who also co-wrote the screenplay with Don Bredes, based on Howard Frank Mosher's novel) and cinematographer Paul Ryan created this compelling story with unique and contemplative images / visuals remember the best moments of Terrence Malick and John Huston. It is an underrated independent period piece from the first half (electric) of the 90s, generally regarded as Quentin Tarantino's burlesque boom ("Pulp Fiction" is a masterpiece, but the Man Suffers Orson Welles Syndrome), Disturbing Todd Solondz's Suburbs, Danny Boyle's Dark Vision on the UK (Not to mention that "Beach" is spinning with DiCaprio, though) ... Jay Craven should also be more considered on the lists of great independent filmmakers. He leads a respectful and discreet career and it's always a pleasure to see a constant talent like his. <br /> <br /> My vote: 8/10.
