I absolutely loved this show. I never understood why his name was Bug Juice. I must have been about 13 when he came out. I remember they broadcast it on channel 4 during the summer holidays, between the Pugwalls summer retransmissions and Saved by the bell or something like that. I remember sitting there and wishing to be at the summer camp too - ha ha. All the children who were there seemed to have fun so much that it was about "discovering who you are" and "growing up". First kisses and all that. I remember that there was this really cute guy in it, I think it was the main reason why I got up that morning that summer. They should have more docu-soaps for teens like that, I thought it was great!
