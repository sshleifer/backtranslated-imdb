I first met Arthur Penn's "Four Friends" late at night on HBO. Having never heard of it, I was expecting very little, but I was watching because I was interested to see what a creation of a Penn team and screenwriter Steve Tesich would look like. For the next two hours, I was mesmerized by this incredible team of talents and the story they wove. A semi-autobiographical account of a young immigrant to America who grew up in the midst of the turmoil of the 1960s, "Four Friends" follows the story of Danilo, an immigrant from Eastern Europe (the brilliant Craig Wasson), since his arrival in the United States to decade that changed the American landscape. Her friends Georgia (the radiant Jodi Thelan, in a role she has unfortunately never been able to match), Tom (Jim Metzler) and David (Michael Huddleston) accompany Danilo. "Four friends" covers too much territory so that I can explain it here, but if you have not seen this movie, I urge you to find a copy (it has just been published on DVD) and watch it. You will not be disappointed. The Tesich script is wonderfully poignant ?? sometimes funny, sometimes incredibly sad, but always fascinating and honest. Penn leads with a sure hand and a clear love for the time and the people we follow. The cast is uniformly superb. This film should have made Wasson a major star, who is truly one of the most wasted talents in this country. Jodi Thelan, not your brainless Hollywood sexpot, warms up the screen in a performance that makes the audience in love with her character as easily as the characters in the movie. The subtle performances of Metzler and Huddleston could easily be overlooked in the shadow of their co-stars, but they are excellent and help anchor the film. Miklos Simon and Elizabeth Lawrence, parents of Danilo, as well as Reed Birney and Lois Smith are also remarkable. I'm not without a copy of "Four Friends" since the day I saw it for the first time on HBO many years ago. This film is and remains one of my favorite movies for over 20 years. I can not recommend it too much and I think if you give it a chance, you'll feel the same way.
