Clouzot followed The Crow, where no one knew who wrote the poison, so everyone was suspected, with another masterpiece, the Quai des Orf√®vres four years later, in which we know immediately (or think do it) a polar. Louis Jouvet does not show up for forty minutes, at which time Clouzot created a rich milieu composed of Music Hall, music publishers, etc. and a nice cast of colorful characters. Angela Lansbury lookalike (Lansbury appeared in Woman of Paris the same year) Suzy Delair marks as the singer whose desire to improve her fate inspires the jealousy of her husband / companion Bernard Blier who follows her to the house of a old man is already dead. From there, things go very badly, his car is stolen before leaving the scene. His pre-arranged alibi is put to the test while, without his knowledge, his wife confesses the murder to the next photographer, a lesbian wardrobe in love with her, who volunteers to return to the scene of the crime and recover the Delair's scarf and, as long as she is there, pensively wipes her imprints of the murder weapon, a bottle of champagne. At this point, the investigator Jouvet intervenes and from that moment, it is essential to keep the plates rotating. Clouzot's production was relatively small, but almost all of it was, as Spencer Tracey said in another context, "cherce", with The Salary of Fear and The Diaboliques to Come. In short, it is a must for French moviegoers.
