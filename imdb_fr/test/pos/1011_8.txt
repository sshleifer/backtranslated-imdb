I'm strangely attracted to this movie since I saw it at Showtime in the early 80's. I say strangely because it's more like a ridiculous piece of soft down, a genre that does not particularly interest me. The dialogue is pompous and absurdly philosophical (meaning, probably, only for its Franco-Italian producers) and the conspiracy completely foreign. What she achieves is a wonderfully hypnotic and quite pleasant mood. The landscape (the beautiful Philippines), the nakedness with the softness and the wonderful partition all contribute to a strange and extremely viewable exercise in a kind of realization of film rarely seen today. It's really one of my big "guilty pleasures". I was fortunate to find him on an old laserdisc and have watched him more times than I find him in good health. A valid moodpiece.
