I do not say anything new when I say that "Ray" was beautiful. To congratulate this film, I must mention something that sets it apart from other films. Very rarely, a film is entirely made by the actor or actors. "Ray" was simply created by Jamie Foxx. Without the wonderful performance of Jamie Foxx, "Ray" would be just another interesting and informative biopic. I always thought Foxx was funny, because of his years with "In Livin 'Color" and "The Jamie Foxx Show", and I also knew he was talented because he used his own show ("The Jamie Foxx Show ") to show off his musical talents. But I never imagined he could play a role like this. I do not know much about acting and what they're going through to get into a character or anything like that, but what I saw from Jamie Foxx was extremely impressive. He wrapped himself up in this role and made us see Ray Charles rather than an actor describing Ray Charles. The story of "Ray" was excellent, certainly, but Jamie Foxx gave it life.
