This show is not stop to hilarity. the first joke will make you wet your pants. And it's probably the weakest joke of all. I started watching it when the second half of season 2 started airing. And now. I'm addicted only 2 weeks after I started watching. I downloaded episodes and bought the DVD. Recurring clips such as "road test" and "news" are hilarious. Then there is the announcement that they use "Use Emo Use your own tears for more effective use" Also funny in the political side of things. Nothing is wrong with them. it's funny. All Australians who do not find it funny. Do not complain and do not look at him. ALL Australians listen Wednesday at 9am on ABC
