Although I saw this film in Korea, in Korean and I did not understand the language, the pictures say more than enough. As far as I can tell, here is the story: Two superb sword fighters become friends in their service, as guard of the king. One of them is opposed to the habits of the king and begins to murder important men. The other must hunt him down. This film is visually awesome. The swordfighting is great. And the film has a captivating end. I just hope this film will be marketed for western moviegoers. And be published on DVD, of course.
