A documentarian explores seemingly unrelated paranormal incidents linked by the legend of an ancient demon called "kagutaba". <br /> <br /> From its appearance, the film looks like one of those camcorder movies that have been popular in recent months, even one that will be released next week (PARANORMAL ACTIVITY)! However, unlike films such as CLOVERFIELD, REC and BLAIR WITCH, where most of these films are completely chaotic and chaotic, this film is essentially presented in a traditional documentary style. It contains television clips and interviews and the scenes of fear are very subtle, except for the last 20 minutes when we enter the chaos effect and where the fear factor is enormously increased. <br /> <br /> And it works. The film is very captivating and makes you think. Yes, you heard me right: that makes you think. You have to pay attention to the unbound details given throughout the movie and the gain is important when in the movie these things start to mingle with each other. The film is also very slow, which in this case is a good thing. As an audience, we absorb the details displayed on screen, however subtle they may be. <br /> <br /> Above all, it's a scary little movie. I am a person who is afraid of ghosts and paranormal more than killers who kill teenage victims then yes, the film gave me nightmares. Some pictures here are really disturbing to watch, including a closer one in the end that makes you say "What am I looking at ?!" Well, it's better to leave unanswered. There are about ten recurring characters here, all of whom gave authentic performances in their roles. <br /> <br /> The only thing I do not like in the film is the end, because most of the questions remain unanswered. The question "is that it?" went in my mind. This left a bad taste in my mouth. However, the rest of the movie is just captivating and really scary. Do not see this alone in the dark because you will regret this choice. In addition, I can see in a few years that Hollywood will redo this movie. It will be interesting.
