This film, without a doubt, is the best I've seen and really shows what British talent can do. Its effects are extremely good given the fact that the film takes place in the middle of the 18th century and that all the roughness and grime disgusting of England at the time are very well captured. The characters are developed and fleshed out, furious MaCleane frolics to that of bandit of road and exhibition "The Gentleman Highwayman" contrast well with Robert Carlyle, which is cynical and honored and shows that it is possible to like a thief and a criminal. I quote: "There is more honor in his little finger than any of you, fat bastard! '<br /> <br /> I'm not talking to you, of course! But this is probably the most moving and emotionally charged scene ever seen in a movie, but you'll just have to see it to find out, just say it involves a rope around your neck. <br /> <br />
