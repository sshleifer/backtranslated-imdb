Darling Lili is fantastic! This is by far one of my favorite movies! He certainly did not deserve the bad reviews he received. Julie Andrews, starring Lili Smith (Schmidt) is the best part of the whole movie. She is mesmerizing and spectacular! Julie Andrews being by far my favorite actress and singer, I'm really not surprised at her stunning. This movie is just ... awesome (I do not have any adjectives anymore!), It's beautiful, wonderful, amazing, funny, terribly romantic, sad and just fantastic, and all thanks to Dame Julie Andrews! to her husband, director Blake Edwards. Oh yes, Rock Hudson was good too :) <br /> <br /> Julie Andrews is the beautiful and well sung singer, Lili Smith. Rock Hudson describes Major Larabee, who soon falls in love with Lili, and she with him. But their case was not a coincidence. The German government had planned this meeting (I do not know if this is exactly what you call these people, but you understand), because the singer Lili, warm and joyful, is in fact a German spy. Lili is asked to seduce Major LArabee to obtain information on the new Opertaion Top Secret (later known as "Crepe Suzette"). Although Lili is on a solemn mission, she falls in love with Bill (Major Larabee), making his original quest difficult. But Lili finishes and completes her task after discovering something that is not really true about Bill. The end will remain unspoken by me as it is wonderfully presented. If you prefer, you will really like this movie, I certainly did it !!!!!!!! <br />
