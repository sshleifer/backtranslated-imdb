After seeing this movie, I can not understand why so many people seem to hate this movie. I'm not saying it's one of the 250 best of all time, but in its genre, it's a great movie. I know that few people find it amusing to see how a legendary story like "Robin Hood" is turned into a comedy. Many people still seem to believe that we should not laugh at certain things ... they are wrong. <br /> <br /> Mel Brooks did a great job with Robin Hood: Men in Tights. I also saw Robin Hood's original films, but I've never seen them as well as these. It's just a continuation of hilarious moments and parodies of famous characters and movies (Winston Churchil, The Godfather ...). <br /> <br /> I recommend to anyone who wants to laugh at watching this movie. For those who think that Robin Hood should not be bothered, you are wrong, but you'd better not look at it because it will probably offend you. I give this film an 8/10.
