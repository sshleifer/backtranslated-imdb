Even people who do not like the film, usually because they find the end confusing, should appreciate the acting of Elijah Wood and Joseph Mazello, who played the two young roles in this film. <br /> <br /> Spoiler WARNING: At the letter level, the end makes no sense. People who think that the ending makes sense at other levels are divided between those who 1) think the younger brother was killed by the stepfather, the only time Mike (the eldest son) was absent to deal with the neighborhood gang or flew the wish in his wagon to escape the situation by death and those 2) who think that the youngest brother is imaginary and that his flight into the wagon turned into flying machine reports that it overcomes the abusive situation. <br /> <br /> I prefer 2). This makes a lot of sense as to how many children handle situations of violence. It is not uncommon for an abused child to divide his psyche and project his abused self into something else; a stuffed animal, even an imaginary friend. In this way, it is much more logical to say that it is always the young boy who is abused and never Mike. In reality, it is unlikely that one of the brothers will suffer all the abuse, although that happens. In addition, it is Bobby, the younger brother who is also encouraging, who insists that they can overcome the situation. In addition, the death of a brother or sister in real life as a result of abuse would have been too overwhelming for an adult with this in his story to turn into such a fantastic and optimistic ending as this one.
