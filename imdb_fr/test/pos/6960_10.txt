I highly recommend this movie. It blurs the line between the fantasy of childhood and the everyday reality in such a homogeneous way that you have to see it to believe it. The actors and the director have such a perfect timing that in a scene a name fight becomes a kind of dance. I loved the script, the actors, everything. Although I think there were one or two decidedly delirious scenes, the movie was flawlessly shot overall.
