A rhythmic and entertaining black taking place in Vienna just after November 11th. Donald Buka is a refugee who can not find legal employment because he has no paper. No papers mean no work permit, so no way to get a passport. He survives driving a friend's taxi at night. If he gets caught, it means three months in prison. One night he takes a ticket from a big hotel and drives him to an airline office. Buka takes the man's luggage and returns to the car. There, he discovers that his client has acquired a useless hole in the neck. What to do? Call the police? Without a work permit, they will seize it very quickly. No, he needs time to think about that. He goes to an isolated place, empties the pockets of the man and hides the body. He now has an American passport and a lot of money! It goes through a contact with the underground world to change the passport photo. Now all he has to do is go to the man's hotel and get his plane ticket. His ticket for freedom! Needless to say, it would be too simple. Joan Camden, the mistress of the deceased, is waiting at the hotel. Camden is on the run from her rather nasty husband, Francis Lederer. Lederer is of course the pig that hit the man in Buka's taxi. Camden calls the police because she thinks Buka has stolen her lover. Buka shows his new passport and manages to get out of trouble. Camden breaks down when her husband Lederer shows up at the police station. Lederer convinces the police. Camden was mentally depressed and released. She escapes again, finds Buka and the two decide to leave the country together. Lederer appears again and Buka must decide if helping Camden is worth his freedom. This film is much better than what I sound. Buka is best known as the short-lived cop killer of "Between Midnight and Dawn" from the 1950s. The film was produced by actor Turhan Bey.
