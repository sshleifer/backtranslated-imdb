This gives ordinary guys / girls the chance to be on TV singing like their favorite stars. <br /> <br /> Most of the time, they sound like the singer they are supposed to represent. <br /> <br /> Another peculiarity: a team of makeup artists and customers dress up the competitor as this singer. They may not look like them, but the likelihood of finding someone who looks like a person who looks exactly like themselves is very slim. <br /> <br /> It's a pleasure for your Saturday night - and for wannabes competitors who are raging as they are on another TV singing show. The fact that there is no prize involved and that it is for pleasure means that it will attract a different type of person. <br /> <br /> The only problem I have is with the children's version - it looks like they went around the drama schools, what became of the normal kids?
