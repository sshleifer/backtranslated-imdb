I am surprised that there is confusion about the title of this film. Obviously, this is an inquiry into the nature of modern love. This suggests that love is love when all is well, but in which people reserve the right to stand first, and if things get complicated, they come out and move on. <br /> <br /> This observation has generational implications, since it comes from generation X, comments on Gen X and ultimately aims at Generation X. It expresses the disappointment that love has been transformed from the one that the baby boomers, the parents of Generation X, engendered in their marriages and their family lives and gave Generation X innocent and generous childhood that she finally appreciated. <br /> <br /> Gen X's attitude towards love is, of course, flippant, but decisions are made and commitments broken, Gen X children are the victims the heaviest. This is clearly stated at the end of the film. I was so spicy that I took a week to recover from the shock I received from this epiphany.
