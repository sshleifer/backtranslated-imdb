Having seen only five episodes of the series before that, (I watched the reruns on BBC Two), I do not really have much experience in the League, but I'm a beginner fan and a big fan of British comedy, I can say that this film is hilarious. See Herr Lipp (whom I did not see on the screen before the movie), Briss and Geoff on the big screen was an extraordinary comic experience. The League takes full advantage of its presence on the screen to turn the head (it will surprise him) and horrible murders with random battles of the style of the Middle Ages. <br /> <br /> Geoff is undoubtedly the funniest character of the three protagonists of this film, because he has the best liners and general behavior, as in the series. One of my only disappointments with the film was not to hear Geoff yell "Well now, I have this gun", even once (even if there is an accumulation in part of the film). The film as a whole is, to use the phrase that everyone does, Pythonesque and it reminds a lot of movies like "Life of Brian". The appearances of Tubbs and Edward were welcome, but Papa Lazarou's phrase "Hello Daves" made me crack more than anything they had said (Lazarou is probably my favorite Vasey character after Tubbs and Edward.) ends poignantly with one of the main being killed and I can only hope that this is not the last adventure of Vasey on the screen of the League. With Gatiss evoking the possibility of another series or another film, I am now very excited. It's a film that I will see again, partly because the projector died at the end, leaving about ten minutes of the film, but mostly because it's inventive and hilarious. It does not really bother me if it's not as good as the TV show, because I liked it. <br /> <br /> One thing though, if you've never seen the League, you'll still love it, but Dave knows what you're going to think of people who invent that. As Tubbs or Edward might say, this is a local film, intended for the local population, and a precious thing. <br /> <br /> **** on ***** (4/5)
