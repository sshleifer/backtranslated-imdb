Just to remind anyone who just read the comments on this excellent BBC mini-series, published in 1981, that it was only available on DVD in recent years. Since then, it's available, but initially only in the British format (for which I bought an 'international' DVD player, which you have to hack - I guess, to see it illegally), but the series is now available. on amazon.com - 3 discs-- for between 19 and $ 21, to view on DVD in American format, no piracy. There were 41 reviews, average 5 stars. This mini-series is one of the best in Oppenheimer, the Manhattan Project or anything that has been produced by the BBC.
