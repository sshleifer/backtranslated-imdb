Created in 1928 and named Mortimer before Walt Disney changed its name (because his wife convinced him), Mickey Mouse became the staple of the Disney brand. I always thought this drawing was the first cartoon to feature Mickey. This is actually the third, but it does not matter. For a short animated film of six minutes, it's nice. The story goes that Mickey would pilot a steamboat until Captain Pete took him off the bridge and stopped to pick up a cargo, and Minnie Mouse missing the boat. When she gets up, she drops her scores and a goat eats them, Mickey helps her twist her tail and play the melody, and get other animals to become percussion until Pete come again to stop him and make him prepare potatoes. Mickey Mouse was number 53 on the 100 biggest icons of pop culture, and the number 31 on the 100 biggest cartoons. Very well!
