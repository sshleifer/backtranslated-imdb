First, let me say that this is probably in my opinion one of the 10 most underestimated films since its release in 72. I loved this film, it is very urban, sandy, without Real Hollywood Glam ... Feel for all the characters here, I love the blood abound just splash here. Joe Pesci was pretty good here, but it seems to me that he was definitely outmatched by the main character Joe Cortese, now I do not know anything about him, but he can really act. I think this movie is probably true, because living in New Jersey, living near Philly, you see that kind of thing all the time. I think that if the film had a larger budget, and say that Robert Deniro as Jerry's boss, you would have a perfect movie, but hey, who should I argue, I was so absorbed by this movie, that he's already in my head, with Mean Streets. I hope that Hollywood returns to this filmed and meticulous display of filmmaking: it would be very useful for them to do so. This film is a great drama with big actors. and I highly recommend it to anyone.
