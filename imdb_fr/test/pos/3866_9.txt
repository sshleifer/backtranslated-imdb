AristoCats is such an impressive Disney classic that I loved it so much as a child. To this day, I can not help but watch this movie. It is such a wonderful and charming film, with excellent animation and beautiful songs. Animated films like AristoCats really miss me, they had a perfect voice, not to mention the hand-drawn animation that makes it perfect for the family. AristoCats is also very intelligent and intelligent, the story was so wonderful. This film is simply irresistible, I think the most memorable moment for me was the cats playing the piano learning the appecio, lol, it was so cute with the piano playing and painting. <br /> <br /> Douchess and her kittens are very pampered in their huge mansion, mainly because their lady is very rich and treats them as if they were her children. But when the lady feels it's time to do what she wants, she leaves everything to the cats and not to her butler. The butler gets angry and takes the kittens on the road and abandons them in the middle of nowhere. Douchess and the kittens wake up and with the help of a smooth street cat by the name of Thomas O'Malley, they go home to find their lady, but learn the freshness of being a ray cat. <br /> <br /> The AristoCats is just a perfect Disney film that, in my opinion, is a little neglected. I always highly recommend this movie for kids or families, it could please everyone. The songs and the story are just unforgettable. I will always join the best song in the cinema "Everyone wants to be a cat", a great song. I also like those dogs that kept the farm where the cats were abandoned, they were so cute. It's a fantastic movie, look at it, you will not be disappointed. <br /> <br /> 9/10
