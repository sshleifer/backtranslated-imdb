I am a big fan of cinema and also an active rugby player who believes that rugby is the biggest game ever played. Forever Strong is a mix of Carter coach and sloppy rugby. This film is full of theatrical characters, well-developed characters and action scenes that will make you dodge and dodge at your seat, but with more handles than footballs and almost every cut is eliminated as soon as a player touches the ground filmed to look almost like football. If you want to bring your kids to see a movie that will build a character from the inside and could inspire a blind to see him again, I can easily give him 9 out of 10, if you want to see a great rugby movie that really shows the sport . you'll have to wait for the next one, because Forever Strong is mainly a practice, a run and a movie on the fly, for that I give it a score of 7.75 out of 10.
