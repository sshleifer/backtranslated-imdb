I must say that I did not expect much from this film, but it turned out that it was not bad at all. The most striking, of course, was Aidan Quinn's performance. I would never expect to see this great actor as an action hero. The great thing about this is that he really builds his character (Annibal). I mean, it was not like Mel Gibson or Bruce Willis would, he was sensitive and modest. For example, he is really upset when he kills someone. I also noticed that some pictures were avoided. When Annibal has received his training, you would easily expect him to be a rebel and behave like any average American would in such a situation, asking what's going on and what he's refusing to cooperate with. But Annibal is a professional naval officer, he does not give up and tries not to lose his courage in which he succeeds rather well, with the exception of a brief breakdown on Christmas Eve, which seems very realistic. I'm glad Aidan Quinn had the opportunity to show another side of him (actually two, because he's also playing the bad guy), even though the movie was not so successful.
