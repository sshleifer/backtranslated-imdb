Before continuing with the new millennium, I will go back in time because I had completely forgotten these jewels !!!!! <br /> <br /> In 1987, while still "low" in the '80s, Disney was able to start a series of TV movies titled "Not Quite Human" about a teenage geek who as in "Inspector Gadget", looks like a human but is really a robot !!!!! Now, this SCREAMS 80S, as well as other movies like "Tron" and "Honey, I narrowed the kids" because it combines everything that was once with the technologies of tomorrow !!!!! <br /> <br /> My parents remember seeing this on TV at the time, when I was born, or something like that. However, my very first encounter with this movie took place on Old Disney Channel (once I saw this and the other parties on the 12th day of May '99 !!!!!) <br /> <br /> > "Not Quite Human" is a very good series of movies to watch, if ever you can find these movies. <br /> <br /> Has this been shown recently? If this is the case, send me an e-mail or a personal message. <br /> <br /> 10/10
