Having seen enough movies, very few things do not remind you of other movies. Nevertheless, it was a watchable but somewhat disturbing film. I had to turn it off from time to time and come back later. Like "Silence of the Lambs", he staged the search for a serial killer who kidnapped someone and confined her to her room of horrors. Like "Flatliners", the main character explores a dreamlike world using an experimental procedure. The surrealism of dream sequences is what makes this film, because we find the characters in a situation and a landscape in which, literally, anything can happen. And beyond this continuity and "make sense" are not necessary, making it a dream for the filmmaker. <br /> <br /> The only thing that seems a little behind is the fact that in the end we hope for the redemption of the serial killer or the exorcism of his demons. You really feel sympathy for the little boy inside the man, but it is clear that the innocence of the boy can not be separated from the horrible acts of the man. The attention changes as it should be to save the man to that of his victim.
