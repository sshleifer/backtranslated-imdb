I missed the beginning of the film. I went in when the supporters were on the farm. I can honestly say that it was horrible. The moral ramifications are stunning. <br /> <br /> My fear of pain and torture leaves me unable to see anything other than cowardly. I see Christ as an ability that has been portrayed by the brave patriot and I can only pray that I may or may be morally irreverent to follow his example. <br /> <br /> I see that a main theme of the film is to show the weakness / strength of the tortured, but what a lamentable decision to be faced. All because the soul of man can be deformed in such a way that the pain and suffering of a human being are in some way satisfactory. Whether mental or physical. <br /> <br /> I found the film very provocative.
