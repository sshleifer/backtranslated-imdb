Before I begin my comment, here's a little slang lesson from Australia that can help you watch the movie and understand some of the other Australian and foreign commentary. <br /> <br /> In Australian slang, "thongs" form a pair. rubber sandals (not to be confused with the same American word that refers to revealing underwear), "stubbies" is a brand of Australian shorts, a "stubby" is a small bottle of beer, and a "stubby holder "is a foam insulation for a small bottle of beer. <br /> <br /> If you like black comedies about petty criminals, then you will love this movie, but many people on IMDB have a weak stomach and do not like black humor. have reviewed this film which unfortunately gives this film looks more mediocre than it is. Many critics have also compared it to Lock / Stock and Pulp Fiction, while it's the same genre, but it's a completely different and original style. <br /> <br /> Many critics have also filmed this film. use the characters of the dead brother of Heath Ledger to open and guide the story of this film, without having to watch the film closely enough to realize that his brother was killed by the same villain who wants to kill the character of Landes this is explained half way through but not clearly. enough for most people to understand. <br /> <br /> This film is also reminiscent of the Lock / Stock and Reservoir dogs in that it is the first feature film by the director / screenwriter, and for a first film that he evaluates as well as these two films. done, like Lock / Stock and Reservoir Dogs, I consider this film as a 10/10 for a director / screenwriter's first film. Unfortunately, unlike Tarantino and Ritchie Jordan, he does not live up to expectations in his next movies, like Ned Kelly. This movie is one that you need to definitely add to your DVD collection and is one that fits several viewings quite easily.
