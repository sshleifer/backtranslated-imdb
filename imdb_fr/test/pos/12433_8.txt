Before watching this movie from beginning to end, I had to catch the last half hour. I usually do not watch a movie if I have not seen it from the beginning, but a friend was wearing it and once I started to watch it, I could not stop. <br /> <br /> I am really surprised. this film did not have a broad theatrical release. It's a pretty funny movie (often gallows humor), and its monster and monster truck are pretty menacing. The monster gives Leatherface a beautiful appearance and the monster truck is a cross between a German artillery vehicle from the First World War and a giant coffin. <br /> <br /> A timid young man of twenty-five years old is on a long journey to prevent the woman he loves to get married. His ex-best friend rubs shoulders with him and constantly lets him go. They are threatened on the road by a black vintage hearse and the aforementioned monster truck. They also took a hitchhiker, played by the sexy Aimee Brooks. <br /> <br /> I also watched the animated trailer with the director's comments, as well as the electronic press kit and found them interesting. I would bet that the feature film commentary with the director and the two male stars is also very nice, but I have so many other movies to watch that I've never seen before ....
