One True Thing rises above its potentially schlocky content to give us a view of a family of complex relationships and real, imperfect people. Rene Zeleweger discusses the death of his mother with the public prosecutor. sparing us cheap cinematic movies of "shocking" disease and death. From there, we look at a family system in which everyone respects a set of unexamined rules and uses the mother's cancer to show what happens when all the rules change. <br /> <br /> William Hurt as an important father, and Meryl Streep as the mother of Suzy Homemaker are both superb; nuanced and not what they seem to be. Zeleweger is boiling, angry and surprised by herself. Tom Everett Scott does not have much to do, but he does it well. <br /> <br /> The story is predictable and takes at least a sneaky turn she should not have taken, but the performances, and the vision of the family as a place where anger and the love are also mixed up is worth it.
