Whenever this film receives a mention, the discussion begins and ends usually with the wonderful collection of cars and scenes of drag, often neglected by the sometimes eclectic characters that populate the film around the three central characters <br /> A character Rebel, played by the great Australian actor Max Cullen. Rebel is a blind dragster who nearly robbed the hero and his group in the middle of the night because he does not use a lighthouse. <br /> <br /> In the history of the back, we discover that the master builder of Rebel Street racing cars, and he and his wife seem locked in a time chain of the 1950s. Rebel continues to play a minor role in teaching Mike, played by Terry Serio, the almost spiritual truth about street racing. It's not the speed, the reaction times that make a good runner. It's the one who feels the car the best and who will become the biggest <br /> <br /> That's what Rebel explains to Mike after a test drive: "You have all the pain, you just miss it "<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Graham Bond, is another well-known actor who lends his talents as a crooked policeman seeking to get an idea of ​​the financial action generated by street racing. The confrontation between Bond and Fox played by Richard Moir adds a tension to the story. Bond expects not only results, but also Fox to launch the world of racing. <br /> <br /> For most of the film, Fox is manipulative and perverse. Yet, at its peak, it presents a sense of honor that transforms the last minutes into an extremely tense and memorable end. It's almost as if the film was refocusing on its true intent, showing us the culture of street racing rather than the daily activities of people. <br /> <br /> One of the main criticisms about the film is the script. . While this is not exciting, I think the complete lack of chemistry between Mikes' girlfriend played by Deborah Conway and her mechanic played by Vangelis Mourikis has more to do with the problem. Any scene in which these two people interact should have been cut off <br /> <br /> Finally, Kristoffer Greaves is a remarkable performer. He plays a remarkable interpreter. He plays a deaf and crippled member of Fox's inner circle. His story is never explored, was he hurt in a race, born this way, what does Fox consider worth keeping in the vicinity? <br /> <br /> The reality of the film is simple, it is about street racing, and the culture behind it. When cars fly and action sequences are in motion, this is the only time director John Clark and author, Barry Tomblin, seem really comfortable with what they do. <br /> <br /> So if you're looking for an in-depth exploration of human relationships, moments of life that define drama, then this movie is not for you. If your heart beats with the thought of a breathtaking Chev 57 or the iconic GTO Phase 3 burning in the streets of Sydney, you will not find much better than this movie.
