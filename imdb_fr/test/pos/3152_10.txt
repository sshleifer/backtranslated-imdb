I have a little hobby: finding really cool pictures that are pretty much unknown - and informing people about them. This one is at the top of my list for spreading the word this summer. This independent movie (and I mean really independent - not Miramax, Fox Searchlight indie) might be easy to forget in the maze of celluloid, but if you want something completely different - you have to check this one. <br /> <br /> Basically, I thought it was really great. I should have known from the cover of the DVD, front and back, that it was going to be something totally different, but, they all say that their material is different from you hanging on. Well, this one is really different. It's in your face: beautiful and scary and unashamed to tell you to wake up. War, peace, September 11, poetry, even a kind of disturbing music video featuring a "patriotic" song of the time, and a strange guy in a RV. Do I need to say more? Just see him.
