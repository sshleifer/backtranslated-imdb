What a trip in the past. <br /> <br /> Do not look for good acting, credible intrigues, or anything that looks like a quality movie. <br /> <br /> This is pure blaxploitation at its best. Scandalous outfits, an irreplaceable dialogue, an objectification of women and the slowest cops you can imagine. <br /> <br /> This centerpiece of the "godfather of rap", Rudy Ray Moore, who left us for good last week is the standard that measures all the blaxploitation. <br /> <br /> You do not only see the blaxploitation at its best, but you also have a glimpse of his comedy genius and you'll understand why his archives were kept under the counter.
