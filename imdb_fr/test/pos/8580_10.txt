*Warning! Some detractors! * <br /> <br /> Matt, a rich writer, is actually just a boy in his behavior. He cares only about his own needs and does not care about the consequences of his actions. As he meets Nimi and his relationship with his family and community, he begins to feel that something is missing in his life. <br /> <br /> He begins to realize that he is actually isolated and impersonal. convenient structures that lack heart and commitment. Nevertheless, he shies away from any responsibility and hesitates to change his life. But will he be able to resettle in his old life and ignore the links he has already - subconsciously - formed? <br /> <br /> Nimi's situation is the opposite. She is pressured by the regulation of her Nigerian community, her prejudices and her medieval values. As a single mother, her position is difficult and she gets worse when she falls in love with Matt, a white devil (as the referendum would say), a man who can not commit. The women in the community plan to marry her on a referendum to end her unmarried status and give Sammy a "name". But that would mean that Nimi renounces independence and self-determination. But is there an alternative for her if she wants Sammy to be accepted and become a respected member of the community herself? <br /> <br /> This film has it all: a very sensitive and sensual love story (with VERY sexy scenes of Matt and Nimi) and an endearing child who makes the association, a landscape beautiful in bright colors. <br /> <br /> Colin Firth (* swoon *) and Nia Long show remarkable chemistry. It's just fantastic to watch them. And Fissy Roberts as Sammy is just to die for. You just want to adopt it. I love how Sammy and Matthew talk to each other. They are both at the same level in many ways. Especially when Sammy asks Matt to talk about sex. This scene is absolutely adorable! <br /> <br /> Almost nothing to say .... wait! This is not true. One thing is not good: the film is not long enough! (Well, and maybe the referendum is too bad and too stupid to be convincing ....) <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10, at all costs!
