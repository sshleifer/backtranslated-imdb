I have seen this movie since 1972 and I always remember it as one of my favorite movies of all time. I would buy a copy if it was on DVD and it's a shame that this is not the case. One would think that everything that starring Peter Sellers would be reported. Much better than "Being There" and as good as the Pink Panther series. Uschi Digard had a small role for a well-endowed interpreter. She's a bonus in this movie. I think the medical world may not like this movie, because it really makes fun of the profession and also shows that Sellers has never been available to treat them, because its way of sleeping in bed was as good sucked as his analysis of urine samples.
