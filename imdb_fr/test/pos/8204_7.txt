You can go into the details of this film and say how that could not happen, or how the main character could just get into the office and start using computers, and so on. could just sit down with a bucket of popcorn and enjoy the story and the acting game. Personally, I prefer the latter, I live in real life and I watch the news with all that is dark and dark, and I prefer to be entertained by my films and see the villains get their fair reward. Do not take it too seriously and you can fully enjoy this movie.
