A powerful film that found much of its meaning in the second half of 2007 after the new desperate movements of the Burmese people against their tyrants. I had a complex mix of feelings about people there, something like compassion and admiration at the same time, and a little anger because I felt that no one, nor the countries of the world or themselves, did not do anything that would put an end to this shame. I think that these feelings are directly from the film and that they were intended at the time of its realization. So it's a hit movie. The desire for peace, the quest for enlightenment, respect for life sometimes lead to subjugation. In fact, it is the Burmese Buddhist culture that has left the door wide open to its dictators. But how can you feel angry with these poor people?
