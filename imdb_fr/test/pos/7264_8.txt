If you liked Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Smoking, chances are you'd like it too. Although I suppose that some of the British jokes (like calling two characters from London, Dixon and Winterburn, after the Arsenal football players) can be lost, it's still a breathtaking entertainment, one that truly abounds of vitality. <br /> <br /> Carlyle, Miller and Tyler are all excellent, bringing depth to their characters, and the interaction between the two protagonists is always well judged. In fact, Scott's management is very confident, since this is his first feature film and proves that he has the talent of his father to put us at ease in an unknown environment. <br /> <br /> Hell, I convinced myself. I will see him again!
