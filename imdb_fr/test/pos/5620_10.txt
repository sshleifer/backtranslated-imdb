The story itself is routine: a boy runs away from home and finds himself in a troubled music school for kids. He convinces a famous violinist to sponsor this school. The film is an assembly of 11-week shoots and leaves many funny holes that the watching spectator can find for himself. <br /> <br /> Whatever the duration of the whiskers of the plot, the film is justified by his music and his game. There is a lot of music, featuring classical works played by Heifetz and by the Meremblum Orchestra, one of the biggest symphonies for young people of this day, and that says the music is excellent. In itself, this would make the photo worth watching. The management and scoring tasks have been entrusted to Alfred Neumann. <br /> <br /> The acting game is a study of contrasts. The children of the orchestra, most of whom had little or no experience as an actor, surely drove the director Archie Mayo crazy, looking into the camera, exaggerating their parts and obeying the instructions too closely. But the spontaneity that results from their lack of training adds an interesting charm to the photo. The veteran actors were wonderful with the material they had to work with. Walter Brennan played his part perfectly, a role he imitated in real life. Joel McCrea and Andrea Leeds were perfectly suited to their roles. And the role-playing was a real Who's Who of the actors: Marjorie Main, Arthur Hohl, Paul Harvey, Charles Coleman, Perry Ivins and Porter Hall in his typical role of heavy - all ideally interpreted. And the little players: Jessie Arnold, John Hamilton, Marjorie Wood, Jimmy Flavin, Dulcie Day, the gritty voice of Lee Phelps in his usual role of policeman and many others. If you're a fan of character actors, this movie will bring you a lot of memories. <br /> <br /> Overall, the photo is very nice and is recommended, even if you are not a fan of classical music. . <br /> <br /> tvcat
