The main criticism of AT THE EARTH'S is that it's cheap, the special effects are bad, et cetera. Yes, some special effects are painfully bad, but what many people forget is that it's really fun, which is very important in my book. <br /> <br /> In comparison, just look at the latest STAR WARS movies: they offer the latest special effects created by the latest technological advances, capable of creating breathtaking visual effects with a scope as large as imagination of man. And yet, with all the glare, these films were also exciting a funeral. As Yoda would say, they are not fun! In other words, who cares whether the FX effects are not the best, while the spirit of the film is fast, humorous and clearly action-oriented. AT THE HEART OF EARTH: the contrast between lavish Victorian England and Pellucidar's wild and worldly setting, cast of characters, the concept of a lost underground world, telepathic Pterodactyls, revolting human slaves, Jubal the naughty (lol!), the inspired group of Peter Cushing (who is great!) and Doug McClure, the excellent music (it's really good), the cinematography of the incredible Alan Hume and the last but not least , Caroline Munro. She is sexy in this movie. One of the sexiest B-movie girls ever filmed on screen. <br /> <br /> Seriously, anyone who does not like this movie does not know what pleasure is. Give me the heart of the Earth of any turgid STAR WARS, she shows up at any moment! At least she has Caroline Munro, whom no CGI fx can ever recreate.
