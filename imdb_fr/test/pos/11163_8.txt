Playing at the 2007 German Film Festival in Australia http://www.goethe.de/ins/au/lp/prj/ff07/enindex.htm, thanks to Peanutqueen and in particular to AriesGemini for his recap of the actors of this set. <br /> <br /> In Australia, these films were subtitled in English and, although French films often have a mainstream release, German films have yet to reunite this type of commercial audience. But like BMWs and Mercedes when the Germans succeed, I really like their movies. Like PQ, the time spent here was so fast that the audience laughed a lot by seeing all 9 men and 9 women advance in the speed dating line 5 minutes at a time. <br /> <br /> While many films overflow one that I could have watched a lot more of. He had the kind of characters and character development for a series. Over time, I will re-read AriesGemini's review 100 and refer to the actors I've loved and their other work in order to keep a close eye on them. I agree .... most of these actors will go on bigger and better things. Some very good actors in this film. I saw it in the program listed as a fake documentary. Mock or otherwise it was very real. And quite romantic in his way. <br /> <br /> Viva the Deutch!
