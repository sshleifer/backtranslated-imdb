It is a film that every child should see before growing up and being distorted, ideas that are often passed on from generation to generation. I grew up in two different places, but only 20 miles apart. I went to school and had friends of all colors, creeds and religions for the first eight years of my life. Then I moved to the hillbilly country (but not now) where it was very unusual to have only one African American child in your class. My class of high school graduates had 2 or 3 Afro-Amercians (god, why can not I just say black?) You can call me a honky or whitey or whatever, all this political correctness pisses me off like many others! ) Back to the film, try to see what happens when people get a distorted view or what ignorance or lack of understanding does to a culture or country! This is an excellent movie that everyone should see especially children.
