Things that are only now "news" have been taken for a given in this shocking documentary. I fear that, as the investigation goes on, the producers of this film will no longer be justified. <br /> <br /> The producers show us the Davidians, the government agents, the investigators, with all their faults and all their humanity. No criticism can say that one can tackle the consequences of watching and listening for oneself. The evidence - congressional evidence, 911 cassettes, news footage, expert commentary, interviews, photos and personal videos - are perfectly woven and tell a troubling story. <br /> <br /> Do not wait. Watch this movie and tell your friends.
