It is true that "They are dead with their boots" gives a highly fictional account of the life and career of George Armstrong Custer (Errol Flynn), but that is remarkable, especially with regard to the Battle of Little Big Horn . Because it is not an acquired fact, a film of 1941 tries to present in a favorable light the American rider and the Indian chief, the Crazy Horse chief (Anthony Quinn). I am almost tempted to say that "Little Big Man" in his unqualified anti-kustres position seems unbalanced by comparison. In addition, the title of the image should not be misleading? it's not just a movie about the Battle of Little Big Horn, it's a film that shows the intrepid cadet of West Point, the famous hero of the Civil War, the Indian fighter and, finally, the husband. <br /> <br /> The film begins with Custer's stint at the West Point Military Academy, where retribution and insubordinate behavior lead to frequent demerits. During a punitive military exercise, he meets his future wife, Elizabeth Bacon (Olivia de Havilland), who, like Custer himself, is from Monroe, Michigan. Custer intends to court her, but the outbreak of the Civil War demands it. Custer's legendary bravery is illustrated by a series of battle scenes, the largest of which is devoted to his engagement with legendary southern cavalry general Jeb Stuart at the Battle of Gettysburg. While on leave, he went to Monroe and courted Elizabeth, who promised him his hand in the marriage. Immediately after the war, Custer and Elizabeth Bacon were married. <br /> <br /> When the civil war is over, Custer is demoted, no longer has a real command, and must follow the slow and slow process of promoting the small, professional American army. As he begins to drink, his wife intervenes on his behalf with former General-in-Chief Winfield Scott. Custer receives command of the 7th American cavalry that he trains to become an elite unit. Neither Custer nor Crazy Horse want the battle, but greedy businessmen and corrupt politicians decide to build a railroad across Indian lands, in flagrant violation of earlier treaties. Custer explicitly recognizes the justice of the cause of Crazy Horse, but engages in the battle to accomplish his duty as a soldier, denouncing the conspiracy of financial interests in a letter he writes on the eve of the fight. <br /> <br /> "They died with their boots," although the historical accuracy is short, is as good as war movies and westerns in the 1940s: Custer and Crazy Horse are played by major actors neither the Indians nor the Confederation of the South are denigrated, and the court The scenes with the beautiful Livvy de Havilland are simply charming. The only drawback, and that's why I can not give 10, is the underlying current of racism in the representation of African-American servants; Elizabeth's servant, Callie, is the stereotypical, overweight, good-natured and superstitious black mammal. <br /> <br /> It is also interesting to note that the film is not faulted by Custer or Crazy Horse, but by the greed of the railroad Companies lobbying Washington politicians with methods semi-criminal to break the assurances they had given to the Amerindians. A few years later, the insinuation that American entrepreneurs might even think of doing something far away would probably have implied that the filmmakers were communist sympathizers. <br /> Needless to say, "They died with their boots" omits the fact that Custer's overly aggressive tactics skirt the reckless, greatly overestimate the importance of his engagement with Stuart and does not mention the lack of recognition before the battle from Little Big Horn. Nevertheless, Custer was perceived as a war hero by his contemporaries and he had spectacular feats to report in the battles of Brandy Station, Gettysburg, Trevilian Station and others, although his exploits were not so decisive for the civil war Dead with their boots, "he suggests. <br /> <br /> Anyway," They are dead with their boots "is a well-made war movie with Western elements, three outstanding performers (Flynn, Quinn and de Havilland), and offers a positive view of Native Americans and negative on large sums of money, which would not be seen in major Hollywood productions for decades.This would deserve a 10 without the racist mingling of African Americans.
