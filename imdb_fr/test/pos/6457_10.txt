I saw this film for the first time on the cable in the 80's and it really rocked me. He appeared on television about six months ago. <br /> <br /> Filmed on site, black and white cinematography graphically depicts New York's 1950s as the "urban jungle" rough at a time when the port activity industry in the city, especially in Manhattan. <br /> <br /> John Cassavetes has always brought a particular intensity to his acting and is magnificent in the role of the dodger of the army. His short television series "Johnny Staccato" dating from 1959 is also a pleasure to watch. <br /> <br /> Sidney Poitier and (later in the film) Ruby Dee bring freshness and vitality to their roles. But Jack Warden's superb behavior as a brutal and brutal team leader caught my eye. To get an idea of ​​Warden's versatility, watch this film, then check out a 1962 episode of the TV series "Naked City" entitled "The Spectrum of the Rose Street Band (available on video)". If you are a movie fan, it's a must. Enjoy!
