I was a big fan of this series. Yesterday, I watched it again on DVD. I was worried about whether the laughs would come or not? But in a few episodes, I laughed hysterically and some episodes were good. Rakesh Bedi (Raja) and Satish Shah are brilliant while Swaroop Sampat is really bad but I think she's doing her job, maybe a better actress could have been used instead. a good pure comedy. <br /> <br /> If this series was to air during the current year, I would have given 9/10 and think that this series is almost 25 years old and that his comedy is still good I give it 10 / 10. I would highly recommend this series to watch on DVD.
