I really liked this film about the love between two adults in Britain after the war. The high levels of BBC TV are evident in the production, and superb leading actors (Claire Bloom and Joss Ackland) make it an uplifting experience. Bloom and Ackland have already worked together in the field of theater. Their chemistry and their interactions are splendid. I recommend this version of Shadowlands to the 1993 film version.
