People say that this movie is a "typical horror movie for teens" ... well, it's a horror movie with a teenage girl in it ... what are you waiting for! It's a good movie, I counted 3 shouts in the audience while the film was filming and it was a very nervous film. The movie did not bother me at any point and I was even on the edge of my seat at some point. The only thing that was a little bad was that it was a bit slow to get into the real plot, but all of that led to why she was where she was and why what had happened had passed. The acting was good, the decor was good and the script was good too, I hope to see a 'When A Stranger Call 2' in a few months! Good movie!
