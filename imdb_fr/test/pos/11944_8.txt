In general, I have trouble watching a TV movie, the extremely long commercial breaks will break my concentration and I give up to find a good book. This one however made me support the additions and stay with until the end. I realize that the film was based on a true story but it was not revealed why it took so long to find Denny? They had his name and I would presume his social security number. Although he has moved a lot, it seems that he would be found as soon as his number entered for a job, etc. The actors seemed a little old for the piece and a buried metal object, once unearthed, was not rusted. These are just technical problems and do not pull the file. For a LifeTime movie, it was better than most.
