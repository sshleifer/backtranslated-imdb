I grew up in New York and this show started when I was four years old. I had a half day nursery school and it was on WPIX Channel 11 in the afternoon. I love music and stories and I remember having them humming at home while playing. <br /> <br /> I just watched part of an episode on YouTube. child. Of course, I stopped watching when I entered grade one because it was before the end of class (no VCR or digital video recorder at the time). I grew up, not realizing that the show was still active until my 11th year! <br /> <br /> I did not know that there were DVDs and I wanted my nieces and nephews to be young enough to enjoy this show, but they all exceeded the demographic criteria or I would buy all in DVD sets. It was so much better than many children show today.
