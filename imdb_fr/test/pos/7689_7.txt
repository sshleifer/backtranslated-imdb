I recently had the privilege of viewing what is supposed to be the latest 35mm format, Technicolor, and I found it much more alive and touching than ever. As close to the original material - basically, all the scriptwriter N. Richard Nash was doing was thin, changing a lot of recitative into spoken dialogue and inserting a transition scene or two (including a very amusing one for Pearl Bailey). Oliver Smith's production design is trainee in the "50s" adaptation mode of "Li'l Abner" - "The Guys and the Dolls", but it works well for the folk and unrealistic quality of this work. Stereotypes and racism are present, but not to a degree of grinding. In addition, for a film of his time, it's quite straightforward: adultery, violent behavior, drug use and self-destructive habits of the people of Catfish Row are not minimized at all. But there are debits, starting with all the variations of the text of the scene. The loss of so much compromises Gershwin's genius - no wonder the family does not like it. Reorchestration, especially that of Sammy Davis Jr., is incredibly fashionable and vulgar. George knew what he was doing, guys. you did not have to spoil it so much. And if Poitier and Dandridge do well and their double sings sing well, there is a gulf between the sung and spoken voices of the characters - you are constantly aware of this artifice. What really matters here, of course, is music, among the best ever written for the theater. Despite all the DIY, he survives and it should be stone not to be affected by it. If the treatment does not really suit the property (and it should not be), there is still no reason not to spend some money to restore this ambitious film of the masterpiece of Gershwin and sensitize new generations to his genius.
