Let me start by saying that there is no bigger fan of the original "Lonesome Dove" than me captivating works. There is no comparison between "Lonesome Dove" and any Western movie - at least not since the legendary collaborations of John Ford and John Wayne. It was with real reservations that I sat down to watch this new mini-series, with the non-participation of McMurtry and the original cast members missing. After watching the first episode, it was clear that it was not "Lonesome Dove". In almost every respect, this sequel does not match the original. But what? I did not expect him to be up to it. Considered as a personal effort, this film is engaging, entertaining and of very good quality. If this had been done as a new story and not as a continuation of "Lonesome Dove", there is no doubt in my mind that he would not have received so many negative reviews. Jon Voight did a commendable job as Call, Barbara Hershey was a wonderful Clara and new characters such as Gideon Walker and Agostina Vega were well rendered and credible. Louis Gossett jr. deserves special mention as a horse wrestler Isom Pickett. The film made me love the characters, and I ask nothing more than an actor. it is regrettable that this commendable effort is in the shadow of its predecessor - it is worthwhile to look at it on its own.
