It's a decent movie. Although not long for me, it contains a lot of action, courage, common sense and emotions in this time frame. Matt Dillon and the other main character do a great job in this movie. The emotions and intensity were convincing and tense throughout the film. It's not typical of the high-cost Hollywood action movie, but it's really a very satisfying film for the price. My evening was excellent because of this movie. This film is a traditional action film, with an excellent interpretation, a story and a staging. I would recommend this movie. The development of the characters has been good and suggests that they are attending a real event. I think this film was made with a cheaper budget, the acting and the quality were much higher.
