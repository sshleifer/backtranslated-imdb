I saw this film last night and it was one of the best TV movies I saw. It was very well done and the acting was superb, very convincing. The music was good and the cinematography was beautifully shot. Take away the desperation of Requiem for a Dream and you are lost. An excellent description of the world of addiction and its consequences, presented in a very open and accessible to all. bravo to mtv for giving us a good shot to change! $ $% like Crossroads.
