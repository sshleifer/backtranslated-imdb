Yul Brynner is Major Surov, a Russian officer singing, dancing and drinking vodka, stationed near the Austrian-Hungarian border during the Hungarian uprising of 1956 in Anatole Litvak's The Journey. Although the film has not yet been released on video or DVD, it remains one of Brynner's most fascinating performances. Due to political unrest, a group of travelers can not leave Budapest but take the bus to Vienna. Before they can reach the border, however, their passports are seized and they are arrested for interrogation by the Russians led by Major Surov. <br /> <br /> The Major has reason to suspect the existence of a Hungarian freedom fighter among the groups being smuggled out of the country. Indeed, Lady Ashmore hides a mysterious passenger, Paul Fleming (Jason Robards, Jr.), who claims to be an American but who does not deceive anyone. She primarily helps Fleming repay a debt she owed because of the problems her past association had caused her. A British journalist played by Robert Morley, an American family played by E.G. Marshall, his wife Anne Jackson and their two children, the first on the screen of little Ron Howard. <br /> <br /> Major Surov takes a close interest in Lady Diana Ashmore (Deborah Kerr) and a romance of sorts develops between them. She offers him only disdain and a stiff upper lip, although we suspect that his heart is still beating. The plot of the cold war and the powerful acting play the story but the romance is never quite convincing. It remains one of my favorite films by Yul Brynner and deserves to be seen, if only for his passionate performance.
