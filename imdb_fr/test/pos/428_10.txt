"Hey, I did not order a taxi!" "Yeah, well you have one ..." What can I say about Hack ... what a man among men. He was a comforted ex-policeman turned taxi driver with a gold heart. If you could (and luckily for US viewers ... one person a week) penetrate the cold, harsh surface of Hack's outside, you have the chance to see a caring man devoted to lawful justice. The show was superb, I laughed, I cried, I smiled ... all in the same episode. My arms creaked when our dear friend Hack left his taxi in another dark alley ... with nothing but his fists ... ready to avenge an injured civilian. A smile appeared on my face as the screen showed me a criminal with facial expressions from a dark alleyway as the Taxi of Justice's headlights lit up on his face. Week after week, I canceled my duties as president of the Klingon Association to take advantage of the warmth of Hack's influence. I have never seen a better show and I lamented the loss of one of the greatest treasures in the United States when the show was canceled. In other news related to Hack, I would like to announce to the world that my wife and I are waiting for Hack Koen to be born in about three weeks.
