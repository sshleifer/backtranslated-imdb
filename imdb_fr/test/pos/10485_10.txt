Perfectly directed, written, interpreted and filmed, this silent and unpretentious Danish film is an example of cinema at its best. And if there is someone who can look at BABETTE'S FEAST without being touched at a very basic level, it's someone I make fun of knowing. <br /> <br /> The story is pretty simple. In the 1800s, two elderly old ladies (Birgitte Federspiel and Bodil Kjer) resided in Jutland, where they sacrificed their lives, their romantic possibilities and their personal happiness in order to continue the religious ministry of their deceased father to the small flock that he served. . One of the young admirers of the women sends them a French, Babette (Stephane Audran), whose husband and son were killed in France and who fled his country of origin not to know the same fate. Although they do not really need her services, the sisters hire her as a housekeeper and cook. Over the years, his intelligence and tireless efforts in their favor allow the aging congregation to stay together and the sisters to live more comfortable imagined; indeed, the whole village admires it and depends on it. <br /> <br /> One day, however, Babette receives a letter: she won the lottery and is now, according to village standards, a rich woman. Knowing that his new wealth will mean his return to France, the sisters wish him to be able to prepare a truly French meal for them and the members of their little congregation. The meal and the evening served is indeed a night to remember - but not for reasons that could be expected, because Babette's feast is a food for the body and mind, and is finally her gift of love to the women who took her and the villagers who were so kind to her. <br /> <br /> The film is extraordinary in all respects, meticulous in detail but not too impressive in its presentation. As the film progresses, we come to love the characters both by their simple devotion to God and by their far too human weaknesses, and by the scenes in which Babette prepares her feast and in which the meal is consumed are powerful, beautiful and incredibly memorable. Many films have used food as a metaphor for love, but none of them addresses the simple art and beauty of BABETTE'S FEAST, which reminds us of all that is good about humanity and nourishes the world. body and mind. Highly, highly recommended. <br /> <br /> Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer
