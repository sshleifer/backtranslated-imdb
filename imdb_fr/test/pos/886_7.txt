After watching a preview of this film in my local mall where there is a stand for the purchase of foreign films, I found it very entertaining. Before watching the movie, I went to IMDb to see what notes and comments he had received. I was worried when I noticed low numbers and negative ratings. Despite the hype, I watched at the movies and to my surprise, I found it incredible. <br /> <br /> The story was great (attention) and the characters and their relationships in the movie are amazing. I have not seen such a good combination of main characters for a long time. I really felt for both characters and felt a strong bond. Reading the previous articles about the fact that this movie was not "epic" enough or that the martial arts were inadequate, I could not disagree any more. This film is what it is, it's not Braveheart and it's not Enter the Dragon, but it's still a wonderful movie that does a great job in combining story and action. <br /> <br /> While Sword In The Moon is not perfect (what movie is?) it's still wonderful and moving. Just wait for the final scene, with the music and cinematography together, to take your breath away. I only hope that more people will be able to see this film in order to give it a fair vote.
