Sometimes it's hard to be a pirate ............... but really, Miss Jean Peters has a lot of fun - and it shows, especially during her first swordplay party friendly with Blackbeard (Mr. Thomas Gomez - eminently hoardable) when the joy of playing is evident. With fifty years of hindsight, feminists seem determined to seize this film as a sort of anthem for the emancipation of women in a male-dominated society, but I have serious doubts about the fact that Mr. Turnner or Miss Peters had such a concept in mind the time. It was an exciting and entertaining family film, with no pretense, no hidden meaning, no alternative program. It was fun. Mr. Louis Jourdan is both seductive and treacherous as his love interest. Herbert Chapman is wise and philosophical as a wise and philosophical doctor. Mr. James Robertson Justice is just a little incredible like the master. But it's Miss Peters who stays in the memory. Teenage, illiterate, tough, but vulnerable, wonderfully agile and ultimately brave, she is everyone's idea of ​​a pirate lady. There was a window of opportunity for her in disguised costume roles - which she did not choose to seize is a matter of regret.
