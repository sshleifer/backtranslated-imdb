I remember watching this series eagerly every Saturday night. It was the highlight of the week. I liked everything, the location, the costumes, the actors and the wonderful music of Clannad (I still have their album Legend). I loved how they solved the problem of Michael Praed's departure by creating another Robin, this time the Earl of Huntingdon. I believe there were legends of several robins in medieval times. Another thing I liked was the fact that it was filled with young actors. I'm sure Robin and his men would be young, after all, people did not live that long at that time. Other Robins always look too old (Kevin Costner with his ridiculous accent looked like Robin's grandfather). The only sad thing was the end, it's a pity, they would not have been able to at least do a special stage to solve all the problems and give a happier ending.
