It must be one of the best post-Astaire musicals made by Columbia. Produced by Arthur Schwartz and directed by veterinarian Charles Vidor, this image truly put Gene Kelly on the map and enhanced Rita Hayworth's reputation as a privileged partner of female dance in the cinema. She plays a dual role here as she performs contemporary numbers from the 1940s with Gene and co-star Phil Silvers, but also puts her in the role of her grandmother, a nightclub artist in the late nineteenth century. century. <br /> <br /> The music must also be distinguished because it was, I believe, the last project on which the legendary Jerome Kern was working (the most famous today for "Old Man River" and "Smoke Gets in Your Eyes "), and his lyricist was also the same. legendary Ira Gershwin. They provided a partition full of charm and characterization. The music of the historical sequences is particularly remarkable because its style is perfectly used in the early twentieth century and corresponds to the initial period of Kern. It's a bit like taking a record from one of your favorite bands from the 1970s and hearing them sing a song in the original style of that era. <br /> <br /> The story is rather innocuous, which suits me perfectly because this film is as close as possible to the golden age of the Broadway musical style in the years 1930-1940. Even aspects of 1940's war propaganda-themed film music give it extra charm, as the talented trio sings "make way for tomorrow" and even amusingly mocks America's enemies and uses a period jargon as "gremlins". <br /> <The most memorable performance of this film is probably Kelly's dance to the "Alter-Ego Dance", in which he argues and then dances with himself as a metaphorical image of the battle of consciousness. This foreshadows much of his later work and is also an effective and memorable scene in itself. <br /> <br /> Fans will want to look for it for a variety of reasons - Kelly fans will see it as a rare opportunity to see it outside MGM's boundaries with a different set of co-stars and music above its own. usual MGM material. Hayworth fans will want to see Rita in glorious colors at the height of her fame and abilities. And fans of classic Broadway musicals will certainly want to hear Kern's final score and marvel at the quality of Gershwin's lyrics and the compatibility of their styles. It is a jewel in the crown of Columbia's musical program.
