Burt Reynolds' response to Clint Eastwood encroaching on his red comedy field with his orangutan comedies was to make his own Dirty Harry in the Chicago-style thriller, Sharky's Machine. Originally intended for John Boorman, but ultimately directed by the star itself, it is a complete commercial package with Reynolds, a narc who gets caught by the Vice Squad (literally - they're at basement) who launches nailing a mysterious crime lord who supports Earl Holliman as the next governor. You can guess the rest, but if Reynolds tends to lose sight of the story from time to time, he has a good eye for the individual scenes and gets almost a show from Rachel Ward as a high-class hooker for which he falls in love. The romantic sub-plot is exceptionally well developed, there are some good action scenes and some nice touches, like giving the villain like Vittorio Gassman a mirror image of the hero or Reynolds and a killer finding a witness to adjacent apartments in the same building. One of the best films of the star of his glory years, it is not a classic, but it makes it a special Saturday night special.
