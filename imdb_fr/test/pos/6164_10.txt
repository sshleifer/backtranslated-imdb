Absolutely one of the best aviation movies of all time and on so many levels. Hardware addicts will drool before the largest mass of flying Spitfires outside of a reenactment of the Battle of Britain. No less than eight flying Spits are available for very precise terrestrial and aerial sequences. <br /> <br /> Those who marvel at the tradition of flying and recite high flying scrambled eyes will identify with the reverence of the characters the freedom to be fast, free and high in their dark blue world. Be warned: romantics and even dog lovers are treated in a very emotional movie. The basic message is common to many veterans of the war, in that their best hours, their life time when they felt the most alive, were actually during the war, when everything else is sad and gray. <br /> <br /> The intrigue is about the Czech pilots who fled their country when the Nazis invaded and joined the free squadron of the RAF. There are a few subplots, all of which deserve special attention. This is simply an excellent old movie that even the most fervent anti-hardware romantics will love (keep the Kleenex handy). Beautiful photos, a first-rate acting game, specific details about the life of the RAF during the Battle of Britain. Easily candidate to the personal DVD collection of any aviation enthusiast.
