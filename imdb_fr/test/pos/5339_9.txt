I was extremely amused to read some of the bad reviews of this movie. First, many said they took their four year old daughters and granddaughters with them and did not take advantage of them. First, I do not think it's a children's movie, at least not for very very young children, not at least for four years. He has a very subtle sense of humor, but he is not meant to offer quick fun as we see in Tom and Jerry or something like that. Many people also complained that it was going very, very slowly ... I guess these people are all used to "quantity" over "quality". Although I have a small quality problem with this film, namely that the film was not as thorough as the shorts, I still think he did very well for a feature film. And how can people complain about these jokes? The jokes were sensible, timely and well thought out, never rude insults or "in your face". Wallace is extremely intelligent, but cautious, and Grommit is the most adorable, intelligent, and cute character. It was a beautiful film and the theme was very appropriate ... for adults ... especially with the increase of obesity and metabolic diseases in the world, there is nothing wrong with promoting vegetables and the fruits for once ... and this has been done with great taste in that ... although people are interested in the appearance of vegetables, that does not necessarily mean they are healthier or that they eat more ... but simply that they temperate with the nature, which is in fact what allowed the legend of the rabbit to be realized. And for those who complained about religious jokes, I told them ... Are you serious? Many villages revolve around the local church and legends / premonitions, etc. are normal themes, no harm is done to them. This movie was absolutely amazing, but some people have had negative comments about it and I find this absolutely absurd !!!
