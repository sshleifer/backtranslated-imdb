This surreal and absurd film is the first film I've seen from cult Swedish director Roy Andersson. A seasoned filmmaker, he has made a living filming commercials, making only four feature films in the last forty years. This background shows: the film looks like a collection of fifty two-minute artistic commercials. There is no story linking these vignettes, although some characters appear in more than one vignette (there is however a theme below: the absurdity of modern life). Some of the mannerisms of the film (the fact that actors appear in a pale white make-up) are more irritating than enlightening. Some skits represent very little (a man does not know in which queue?). The other sketches are better, though. The best is that of the rocker who dreams of going on a honeymoon with his wife rock guitarist in a house that looks like a train (you have to watch it to get it). A film that deserves a visit, even if the comparisons made by some film critics with great directors such as Keaton, Tati and Kaurismaki seem outdated: Andersson lack of vision and the lack of history linking the vignettes is fatal to the claim from this movie masterpiece.
