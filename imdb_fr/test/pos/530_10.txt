I just saw this movie tonight. Upon entering this film, I thought it would be good because I really like Natalie Portman and Susan Sarandon is also an excellent actor, but it was much better than I could have imagined. You leave the film feeling good. The acting was excellent, which can be hard to find recently. Natalie Portman is destined for great things and as a student at New York University, I find it great that she goes to school instead of just being an actress. Anyway, back on the subject, the movie continues to interest you and I really think that everyone should go see him. I would give more details, but I do not want to give the film.
