Alexander Nevsky is legitimately considered a cinematographic masterpiece. He has, however, aged badly. People decide not to talk about it and talk about great battles and good music. The sound effects may have been good at that time, but aside from the annoying organ, all sounds are likely. Moviegoers will shoot me, but I'm sure Alexander Nevsky's modern viewer will agree that blatant propaganda and dreadful music are damaging the film. I gave this film 10/10 because it's undeniably a masterpiece. He has his good side though. The costumes of the Teutonic Knights are superb and the battle scenes are pretty good for the time. It is however a masterpiece that shows its age.
