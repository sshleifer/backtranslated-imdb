RENDITION is a film not to be missed with Kelley Sane's solid writing and Gavin Hood's direction that takes us on a journey of a man's journey through hell. Once again, Meryl Streep convincingly embodies the role of today's CIA and interprets superb interpretations of Jake Gyllenhall and Alan Arkin, two superb actors of Reese Witherspoon, as well as actors of Middle Eastern descent who add to the reality of this story. /> <br /> In RENDITION, you see how "terrorism can lead to terrorism" and as the film progresses, linking history to what is happening in the Middle East is a reality screen. External shots add to the intensity of the story and Peter Sarsgaard does a remarkable job playing the assistant roles in the way US policy is conducted. Too bad there was no more audience for this film, because with THE VALLEY OF ELAH and LIONS FOR LAMBS, RENDITION plays an important role in showing the public that the fight for the defense of democracy and protection of it can seriously go astray.
