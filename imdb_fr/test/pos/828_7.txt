It's really nice to see Van Damme's movie improve slowly lately and especially compared to the "Derailed" and "Second in Command" C flops that were both tragic and disastrous. The Sheperd: Border Patrol is a good action movie with very nice action / fight sequences. It is good to know that Van Damme still knows how to boast, because his last film "Until Death" contained no martial art! <br /> <br /> That being said, this film is significantly inferior to "Until Death" which was a very good turn for Van Damme. "Until Death" did not have the overwhelming action of most of Van Damme's films but was dark and realistic and Van Damme's performance as an actor was surprisingly good in this film. Still, The Shepherd is definitely a film worth seeing, especially for Van Damme fans or fans of action movies in general, but if you're looking for a movie with a little more storyline ... you might want to ignore this one! <br /> <br /> I think this film was pretty well done, especially with the small budget on which it would have been shot. The only real problem I have with this movie is the title; "The shepherd"? I do not understand! I guess "Border Patrol" just does not have the same tone without the word "Shepherd" in front of him !!! <br /> <br /> My rating for this film is 7 out of 10 but it's by The Van Damme Film Standards do not appear in any other category of films. <br /> <br /> That's good for a Van Damme movie.
