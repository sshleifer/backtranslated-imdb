It's a movie that many people consider a classic - Apocalypse Now, Redux, 22 years after its original release, is redecorated. <br /> <br /> The film is vaguely inspired from the heart of Conrad Darkness, the main plot (if any) is Captain Willard's trip on a naval ship in the Vietnam conflict to end to a rogue colonel. (Colonel Kurtz) We see the characters and the situations he encounters, and he tells the Colonel's story along the way. <br /> <br /> My first impressions of the film are that it is not very attractive sometimes, especially very early, but at least a good dose of comedy is put in place, in the form of a fanatic of surf, Colonel Kilgore. As the film progresses, however, Willard reads many reports about Colonel Kurtz to the end, as everything comes together and the film's atmosphere reaches an incredible level and continues until the end. 'at the end. the end. <br /> <br /> The usual aspects that everyone looks for in a decent film are all of a good standard. Cinematography is particularly exceptional, and I found that the performances of Martin Sheen, Marlon Brando, Robert Duvall and Frederic Forrest all deserve special mention. The score I found at the beginning seemed out of place, but as the film progressed ... I'm not quite sure that it actually improves, or that it matches better, or if he just grew up, but at the end of the movie I really enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> This is the second time I see the Redux version, (I saw the original about four times). I will say now that the first time I saw her I was disappointed. I was expecting a "classic" movie, with a lot of war. The fact that Willard got the mission at the beginning of the film and did it through to the end had bothered me because all the character interactions on how IS the movie seemed useless. This is due to the fact that the plot is not entirely defined (the focus being more on the character and the trip than on the plot), in most cases, a second viewing is necessary to fully appreciate the story. movie (as for all movies are more character than plot), like the second time, you know where the plot goes. I had a similar experience with It's A Wonderful Life, which is now one of my favorite movies. <br /> <br /> With the four major Vietnamese films, Apocalypse Now wins over the rest in terms of atmosphere, but lacks action and commitment. of platoon, the emotional intensity of The Deer Hunter, and can not be compared to Full Metal Jacket (probably my favorite of the four). Apocalypse Now is a great job, especially towards the end, where it becomes stunning. It is recommended to all those who like a good movie based on the character and who do not fear occasional violence.
