Nothing boring about this film, which is held by fully realized characters with a certain depth. Even hooded torturers have body language. Jannings' performance is brilliant, all want, want and need. A Henry VIII as he was to be. Henny Porten is perhaps nobler and purer than Anne Boleyn, but she plays the following role: A victim caught in the mouth of a big (huge) baby. <br /> <br /> The cinematography of Sparkuhl is magnificent in its restoration, the sensual hues. Lubitsch lets these characters breathe and reveal their corruption to the slightest malice. It takes its time, which can test the patience of an audience accustomed to being carried away by the action, but the time is worth it. Slow down your heart rate and watch this little miracle of the silent German film.
