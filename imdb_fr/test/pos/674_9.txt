The subject is World War II and Robert Ryan is a rejected soldier whom Lupino hires as a handyman. She is a war widow. <br /> <br /> The set is limited but the acting game compensates for it. Robert Ryan is in conflict: it seems a nice moment, then confused as to his place of residence. At first, Lupino tries to help him. It seems troubled but nothing more dangerous. But how do we know? The suspense is built. I really appreciate movies like this one, which rely on the human element for suspense. What is this man capable of? There are scenes with O.Z. Whitehead and Dee Pollock as an annoying grocery boy who sees that something is wrong. We continue to think she will be helped, and then Ryan's personality will change again. He becomes like a Jekyll / Hyde character and finally pursues Lupino with a knife. <br /> <br /> It's worth watching these two great actors. 9/10.
