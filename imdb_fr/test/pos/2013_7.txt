Jon Cryer resumes his role as a neurotic guy in Two and Half Men, which he perfected in this series. He aspires to maintain good relations with a girl like the one his colleague has developed, and the tet-a-tet between him and the best friend of his partner's girlfriend is quite funny. Then they realize that they are attracted to each other and start going out together. In one of the funniest TV shows of all time - I think in the final episode - he and his partner are discussing the fact that he wants to propose to the girl. <br /> <br /> His partner is preparing him for the moment by suggesting: "What is the worst that can happen? She says no." <br /> <br /> Armed with a new optimism, he proposes to go out with him to dinner. To which she answers, <br /> <br /> "GOD, no!" <br /> <br /> I laughed so much that I cried.
