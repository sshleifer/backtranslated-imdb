I must admit that I know some of those involved, I was in the precursor of The Planet, Evil Unleased, but it was more than 10 years ago and I have since lost contact with them. I have watched BBC Scotland News and an article about Scottish cinema, which mentioned and broadcast clips from The Planet and comments from director Mark Stirton. This made me order a copy of the movie on DVD. <br /> <br /> Let's move on to the movie now. The level of acting, writing, direction and SFX is among the best, OK, it's not Star Wars, but I've seen a lot of Hollywood products far below. It's very odd to watch a movie in my local accent of north-east Scotland, but it's fast gone. <br /> <br /> ^ Sweet spoilers ^ <br /> <br /> The planet is based on several classics of science fiction; Star Wars, Alien, Black Pitch, Forbidden Planet and Predator, a handful of crew members of a space ship survive their boat attacked and destroyed by unknown ships. They escape on a deserted desert planet, one by one, they are killed. by invisible attackers, the lone passenger of the ships, a mysterious prisoner also going on the planet, a battle ensues as the crew fights to survive. <br /> <br /> The planet is a brilliant sci-fi movie certainly hiding its budget is limited, well done to Mark, Mike and all those involved, I look forward to your next job.
