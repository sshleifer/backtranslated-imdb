Watchers is a fun movie if you do not take it too seriously. The novel written by Dean R. Koontz is obviously much better, but the film itself is entertaining in its own way. The movie has a lot of changes for the Watchers novel, the only difference is the main character Travis. In the book, he was an adult and a retired soldier of the Delta Force, while he was a teenager in the film. Watchers has its good points, the film has some bloody scenes by parts. I'm a fan of Micheal Ironside and it was cool to see him in this film, he always makes an excellent performance in all his films. OXCOM's costume is rather corny, but the camera never really shows the creature until the end of the film. The Einstien dog was impressive because he was well trained. <br /> <br /> The film sees two genetic experiments escape from a laboratory, a dog and a monster. Both experiences are telepathically linked as both animals are part of a military project where the dog would infiltrate an enemy base and then the creature would attack and eliminate them. The dog finds a teenager named Travis who takes him home and discovers he is intelligent. He named the dog Einstein. Meanwhile, OXCOM roams around and kills people, two government agents are sent to find the two previous experiences. the incident becomes uncontrollable. Soon, Travis learns he is not safe because the OXCOM is attracted to the dog and will stop at nothing to kill him, but Travis and his mother will then rescue his girlfriend who is being held at the hospital by both agents. They then hide in the woods while government agents and OXCOM are not far behind. <br /> <br /> Watchers is not an excellent adaptation of Dean R. Koontz's novel, but a film about the horror of the 80s, including some fans. the book may not want to look at this because it's not true to the book, but horror movie fans of the '80s might want to check that.
