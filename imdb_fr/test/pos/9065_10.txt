I really liked this original scenario and the different places he took me, emotionally, spiritually and just stupid. I did not get caught up in the "credibility" of the script or the actors and I did not even think about it before reading the critics listed here in IMDb for the movie. Listen to Michael Parness's Q & A on his idea of ​​the movie, wanting to see how crazy, or "f'ed," he says, falling in love is really interesting. I identified myself with not having a history book love story and enjoyed seeing the dysfunction at its best. I like to watch David Krumholtz in everything he does and follow his career for a few years now. I think this is one of his best works and tell everyone, just watch this movie to watch an amazing young actor. I agree that Guillermo Díaz was really a thief and that what he did with his character is really a great lesson in engagement theater. I both laughed and cried in this film and was disappointed that I did not win a prize at the festival. I wonder why it did not happen. I gave Max 10 points to Grace, because these independent, creative, interesting, unique and creative films deserve an audience. Technically, watching this movie is really very well done ?? the colors are incredible and, finally, it's one of the best soundtracks I've heard in a movie for quite some time.
