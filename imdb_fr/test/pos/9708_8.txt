That's what you expect. This causes laughter, shouting and uprisings, not necessarily in that order. It's over-the-top. You will see things that you may never be able to erase from your mind. "Jackass Number Two" is better than the first; the actors definitely took more risks by filming this film. Many stunts could have killed the actors, including Johnny Knoxville. The treatment of the animals was suspect, but apart from that, the film achieved its objective. If you like the preview, watch the movie. If you do not do it, avoid! <br /> <br /> 8 of 10
