ONE NIGHT AT McCOOL'S / (2001) *** (out of four) <br /> <br /> By Blake French: <br /> <br /> According to Harald Zwart, director of the movie "One Night at McCool's", " This film is "a dark comedy about the power of women over men and how a group of people can perceive different realities. It's the same story told from three different points of view, and every time we tell the story, we try to reveal a little more about what really happened, nobody really knows it. "<br /> <br />" One Night at McCool's "marks the debut as a feature film director of Zwart, an award-winning director in the field of video and music, who began making short films in I'm still nervous when a commercial and video director turns to the movies, we've seen so many examples of how these guys think they're going to do another commercial or music video for Zwart resists this trend, capturing a specific humorous truth in "One Night at McCool's" from a complex and inventive storyline by the late Stan Seidel, although he is often somewhat confusing. /> <br /> "One Night At McCool's" presents three men who share their distinct experiences about a particularly beautiful young woman.In some ways, this film is the comic version of "American Beauty", but to other considerations it's a world apart. <br /> <br /> "It all started one night at McCool", explains each of the three men to their various listeners. There is Randy (Matt Dillon), a call for tenders at the local bar, and his cousin, a lawyer named Carl (Paul Reiser), who stays until the closing of the premises. Detective Dehling (John Goodman) arrives when the living room becomes the scene of the crime of the deceased boyfriend of a mortal woman named Jewel (Liv Tyler). Randy is the first to see her, because a person treats her with malice. He defends her and, before you can say SEXY, they have a vigorous sex and she moves in with him. At first, Randy is reluctant: "Sex and violence in one night is a little too much." But who could hijack a jewel like Jewel. <br /> <br /> Jewel changes the life of each of the three men. For detective Dehling, she has been drawing pain since the death of his wife. For Carl, she makes him forget his loving family and his nice little suburban household. For Randy, she lights a few lights, both positive and negative, later persuading him to contact a great bingo player named Burmeister (Michael Douglas) to stop his deceptive practices. <br /> <br /> It is interesting to see how the film perceives the three different chronicles. Even the script of Jewel is relative to the man who tells the story. Dehling sees Jewel as a beautiful hypnotic gift from God. Carl regards Jewel as two sexy legs and a lot of cleavage. Randy does not know what to do with her, an awakening to her boring journey, to a life nowhere. Jewel herself is the most intriguing element of this film, but she is delightfully portrayed by the ever-charming Liv Tyler ("Armageddon"). She's not really interested in men, but what they can offer her. His motivations are all simple, not really evil or bad; she's just a young woman who learned early on that she can get what she wants out of life because of her beauty. <br /> <br /> The movie has a lot of fun with its material. From the cast, passionately enthusiastic to the hilariously confrontational, "One Night at McCool's" takes advantage of most of his humorous ideas. What makes the film even more funny is the difference of viewpoints of the three men. The actors also have a lot of fun with their characters. Goodman is curiously whimsical; Reiser is very well suited to her frizzy and uncomfortable part; Douglas is devious and mysterious in one of the funniest performances of the film; Dillon gives his character an arrogant personality, even if Randy is a dull person. Liv Tyler is dazzling. She injects Jewel with the perfect amount of boastful charisma and tantalizing spirit. It reminds us of the intimate performance of Mena Suvari in "American Beauty". <br /> <br /> "One Night at McCool's" is the first film of Michael Douglas' new production company, Furthur Films. It's a creative, authentic and sexy production. Along the way, we often find ourselves caught in a tangled structure, but this is a natural reaction to a film that intentionally mixes multiple angles into a single story. The film ends on a note both black and comic. This is another of those comedies in which serious events take place in a humorous way; that is, black comedy. Many movies of this kind are either too black or too quiet. "One Night at McCool's" is one of the few that really works. <br /> <br />
