As a fan of science fiction movies, I also like Alien. But Pitch Black is definitely better than Alien 3 and Alien: Resurrection. This is part of the Alien series. But it's no stranger, it's something else. OK, enough comparisons. This film, but I think: why people are afraid of darkness. You can not escape the darkness. It's impossible. You must be confronted with the darkness and that, what happens in the darkness. In this film, I also enjoyed the fact that Vin Diesel's character, Richard B. Riddick, was not a good boy. He had secrets and he did bad things in the past. For other people, he is a hero who tries to save them all. First of all, he wants to get out of this planet himself. There are also other metaphors in this story. All the big fans of science fiction should see this picture.
