I know what you're saying, "Oh man, Pinochio is not scary!" but this film exceeds much more than a manic pinochio. Behind her tells the story of a mother and her daughter strangely attached to her doll Pinnochio who seems to speak to her. The only strange thing is that no one else can hear the doll except for her. In the end, it's a shocking revelation that, like me, will shock you. Look at this. Tries.
