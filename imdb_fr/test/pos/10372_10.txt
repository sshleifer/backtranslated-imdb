After The Funeral was absolutely superb, and by far the best episode of the season. Cards On the Table, which started so well, was disappointed, but was considerably disappointed by the last half hour, and I did not know what to think of Taken After the Flood, even though I remember being confused at the end. After the funeral, as I said, it's one of my favorite episodes of Poirot, with five little pigs, Sad Cypress and The ABC Murders. I was afraid that they ruin the story, but on the contrary it is very faithful to the book. Now, I'm going to say that changes to the books do not bother me and try not to compare movies and television adaptations to their sources, except when the book is a masterpiece and the adaptation does not make it not justice. That's why I hated some of the Marples, like Nemesis and Sleeping Murder, and so far from the Poirots, The Murder of Roger Ackroyd, Taken At the Flood and Cards on the Table are the only ones that really disappointed. All the rest goes from the good to the remarkable, even the recent Rendez-vous avec la mort, despite the many deviations from the book, which, I admit, is not a favorite, was surprisingly good, thanks to the excellent values production, outstanding overall performance and excellent score. . Back to After the funeral, the production values ​​are fantastic. It really has a cinematic feel, and the amazing photography and gorgeous landscapes and costumes have made it a visual feast for the eyes. The music was very moving and even haunting, and all the actors played a fantastic role. David Suchet is impeccable, as always, as Poirot, and Geraldine James and Anna Calder Marshall are equally formidable. But for me, Monica Dolan and Mrs. Gilchrist stood out with Donald Sumpter and Polly Walker as the best actress in a Poirot episode, that's the quality of his performance. Not to be missed, one of the best episodes of Poirot and by far one of the most faithful. 10/10 Bethany Cox
