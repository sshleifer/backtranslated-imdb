What can I say? This film has it all ... romance, separations, rich children, punks and preparations. This is my favorite movie of all time that I can recite line by line .... I remember his first appearance, I was 14 years old and I could not enter ... so I finally saw him by cable ... I became addicted! I wanted to move to California and become a Valley Girl .. (Hey, I even remember Moon Zappa's song, do not you?) I tried in vain for years to get the soundtrack never produced ... now you can find it on rhino records ....
