Nothing really unpredictable in this film, but a solid film in all respects. From act to cinematography was solid. Not a perfectly linear line, but you could not see anything coming. Maybe a little melodramatic points, but again, a pretty decent film nevertheless. Well worth a visit. If in doubt about the type of movie to rent on weekends, try it. Although you may not want to run and buy this product, I thought it was worth it.
