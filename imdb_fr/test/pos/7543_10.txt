There are other films about boarding schools and student and staff antics, but "Les Belles de Saint-Trinian" exceeds them all! The plot has been completely summed up by other posters, so I will not cover the same terrain. I just want to say that it's a pity that it's FINALLY released on DVD, but in a format that can not be used in the United States! :-( <br /> <br /> Have fun, dear New Zealand and Australian friends! And if you're reading this, you're interested, help him to publish it on DVD with Region 1 coding! Also, is it possible to be notified by e-mail when (I will not say "if") it was released on DVD in the United States? Thank you!
