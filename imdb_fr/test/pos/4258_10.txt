Directed at the height of the Black Power movement, this film depicts the African-American Putney Swope (Arnold Johnson) named president and CEO of a company after the death of former CEO White CEO. Once in power, he decides to turn it into a militant organization. <br /> <br /> I do not know how Robert Downey Sr did it, but he did it! "Putney Swope" is the ultimate jab to America's power structure. This is the kind of thing that seems to come from Richard Pryor's mind. It's a classic comedy in every sense of the word. A real masterpiece. Hilarious.
