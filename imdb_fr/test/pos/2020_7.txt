It was an interesting movie. I could have done without the bathroom scene and the seduction scene - EWWWW! Apart from that, I loved the catchy music around which this film runs. Chris / Izzy's parents are awesome! They totally support the interests of their sons and believe enough in him to support him - now it's great !! What really surprised me was Chris's realization at the end. It was not quite the "Hollywood" that ended on its way to self-discovery. The general rise to stardom and its downfall have been quite difficult.
