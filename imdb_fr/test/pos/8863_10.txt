John Carpenter's The Thing is without question the best horror film ever made. Not only that, but it's also one of my personal favorite movies of all time. What makes the movie so great? It's hard to put your finger on it. Everything seems to work well in The Thing, it's one of the rare occasions when everything seems to be in place. The film is even superior to Alien in creating a type of atmospheric hell. The fact that it's not just gore (which is wonderful in reality), but that it's able to create paranoia unmatched in movies. A truly wonderful movie that is revered by all horror lovers and all those who have taste.
