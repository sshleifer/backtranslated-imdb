Dan Ackroyd in his leading role as Johgn Burns, a psychiatric asylum fugitive who presents himself as his own pseudonym for traveling to La La Land and hosting a popular talk show while the usual presenter ( Charle Grodin in his amaranth) takes a vacation. Along the way, Ackroyd meets Walter Matthau, an idiot benefactor, and the rest is a hilarity. Ackroyd and Matthau argue very well. Donna Dixon, Ackroyd's real wife, is another psychologist. The end feels a little hasty and artificial, which is the only thing that prevents me from giving this film my maximum score, a 8. A lost jewel of the 80s.
