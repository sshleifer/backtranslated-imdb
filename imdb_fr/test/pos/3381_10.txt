After becoming addicted to the mini-series "North & South", I could not wait for the sequel "North & South II". A few years later, book III entitled "THE SKY & THE CHILD - NORTH AND SOUTH - BOOK III" was published. Finally, the last installment came for the ongoing saga of the Maine and Hazard families. I was so captivated by this series that I filmed every part of the television, then managed to attract family and friends and watched it AGAIN, every time a new player wanted to see them. My tapes are old and I'm thirsty for this trilogy on DVD. If you missed Book III, you did not get any satisfaction and you do not know how it all went. Do yourself a favor and demand this set on DVD!
