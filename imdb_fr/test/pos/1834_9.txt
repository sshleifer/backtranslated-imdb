There are so many positive reviews on Return to Me that my opinion is not necessary to encourage you to watch this movie. However, I feel the need to express my admiration for this unique film. Bonnie Hunt proved she was not only an outstanding actress, but also a wonderful director and screenwriter. This film has everything and is full of humanity, tenderness, humor ... Do not miss it, do not wait anymore. And, when it comes to bad reviews, do not pay attention. Some viewers forget that this type of film should be viewed with the heart, not just with the eyes. If some viewers prefer Notting Hill or You have Mail, it's their mistake. For me, Return to Me is a real gem, an unforgettable film.
