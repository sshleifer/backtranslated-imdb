A poetic examination of the human condition realized without dialogue. The anti-hero, The Man builds a craft to escape a group of marauders, out of the wastelands of what was once a civilization, to the ruins of the city to recover its survival. He cross paths with The Brute, brilliantly interpreted by Jean Reno, "The Professional" and "Mission: Impossible". The man is saved by an old crazy genius who lives in a fortress of his own project. Using their wits, The Man and the old genius manage to keep the Brute and his fellows at bay, but they realize that it only takes a short time before their defenses are compromised. So they pause. This is a highly understated story of the desperate struggle for life, with excellent action scenes and intelligent humor. Of all the films of the genre, such as "Road Warrior", "Omega Man" and even "Ultimate Warrior" (starring Yul Brenner as a knife fighter, the best fight is the most artfully crafted. The video is hard to find, I would give my left eye for one.If your local art house already has a cover of this movie, I urge you to break any commitment to be able to see it big.
