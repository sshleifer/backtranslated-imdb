I've seen a lot of action thrillers in my life and it's clearly one of the best of all time! There are very few movies that I even consider to watch many times and this is one of them. Everything in this film is just right: Clint in the role of the superb lead actor, Rene Russo in that of his non-stupid partner (it's a very rare combination - sad, but true!). Of course, John Malkowich deserves a lot of praise for his great villain, but let's not neglect Eastwood's first buddy, played by Dylan Mcdermott, who, in my opinion, fits the role perfectly. The soundtrack is absolutely fantastic - an original soundtrack CD (shame on producers!). The plot makes sense and there is no loss of rhythm, the audience is constantly excited about the outcome of the duel between Eastwood and Malkowich. I give him 10 stars!
