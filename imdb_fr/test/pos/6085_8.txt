Anthony Minghella's "The English Patient" is a film that takes us back to the golden years of Hollywood. He is tall and impressive in size, yet so intimate in his heartbreaking representation of love and human suffering. In 1997, at the Oscars, the film won nine out of twelve awards, making it the most decisive since Bernardo Bertolucci's "The Last Emperor" in 1988. According to the author's novel Canadian Michael Ondaatje, published in 1992, the same name, 'The English Patient' is a moving meditation on life, love and loss that traces the story of a man badly burned in the aftermath of the Second World War. <br /> <br /> During the war, a man (Ralph Fiennes) is discovered in the fire remains of a plane crashed. The face marked by indescribable recognition and this man apparently suffering from amnesia, he is supposed to be an allied soldier and is simply referred to as the "English patient". After the war, in the hills of Italy hurtling down the mines, a caring nurse, Hana (Juliette Binoche), who apparently lost all her entourage, stays in a ruined monastery to watch over the dying man. Over time, she learns more and more about her "English patient", who turns out to be a Hungarian geographer, Count Laszlo de Almásy. Rather than losing our memory in the crash of the plane, we learn that this scarred man may have chosen to forget his past, both to protect himself from persecution and to heal tragic memories of his past love. Numerous flashbacks tell us about Almásy's earlier exploits in the Sahara Desert and his love affair with a married woman, Katharine Clifton (Kristin Scott Thomas). <br /> <br /> It's easy to understand why "The English Patient" was so successful at the Oscars, it's such a beautiful film, mixing the peaceful beauty of the Italian countryside with the huge golden beaches of The Director of Photography John Seale captures the landscape perfectly, and from David Lean's magnificent film "Lawrence of Arabia," a film depicts the desert with such beauty and grandeur, making particularly of the vast aerial shots taken from Almásy's plane Even in the most intimate moments of the film, an excellent use of close-ups and lighting captures the emotions of the scene, combined of course with the brilliant performances of all the actors of the distribution A long time ago My favorite actor, "The English Patient" might well contain the finest performance of Ralph Fiennes and, given its history, includes such films as "Schindler's List" and "The Constant Gardener" is not a supplement to take lightly. . His count Laszlo de Almásy is at first a very likeable person, but as we learn more about his past, his attractive qualities deteriorate as a result of his less admirable tendency towards other. "The property" is a major theme of the film. When Katherine asks him what he hates the most, Almásy responds with "Owned property, when you leave you should forget me." However, as the relationship progresses and Katherine may be trying to get away from him, Almásy reveals a hint of arrogance, insisting that her love for her gives her the right to receive her at all times: " I want to touch you, I want the things that belong to me. "<br /> <br /> Juliette Binoche, who received an Oscar for her performance here, is excellent as Hana, the lonely nurse who is afraid of loving because of the tragedies that have always hurt his loved ones. After taking care of Almásy alone, she is joined by a dubious Canadian thief, David Caravaggio (Willem Dafoe), who lost his thumb during the war and thinks it was Almásy who delivered it to the Germans. Hana also begins a brief relationship with Kip (Naveen Andrews), an Indian bombshell in the British Army. However, because of his background, Hana fears that his involvement in Kip will condemn him to death, especially given his very dangerous work. <br /> <br /> 160 minutes long, "The English Patient". wonderfully evokes memories of classical classic romantic epics, successfully finding a balance between mystery, love, joy and tragedy. The end of the film is heartbreaking and painful, but it is also edifying in its own way. If some relationships are doomed from the start, others have a very good chance of bringing happiness. Nevertheless, in all cases, it is always better to have loved and lost than to have never loved at all.
