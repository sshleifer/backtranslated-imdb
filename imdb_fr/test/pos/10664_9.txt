An important milestone in the history of cinema, "Bronenosets Potyomkin" is one of the few mainstream films that deserves to be described as classic. It is this image that made Sergei M. Eisenstein a leading figure in cinema at the time. And today, we remember him as a wonderful piece of cinema that he has always been. <br /> <br /> 'Potyomkin' is a film that must imperatively be considered as a single entity. Do not just watch these clips showing where they only show the sequence "Odessa Step by Step", then go to "Citizen Kane" or "The Godfather", see it all in one hour of glory of 75 minutes to truly understand and enjoy it. However, do not expect every infinitesimal detail to be perfect. I mean the game of the silent era of the 1920s makes Scooby Doo a master of understated realism, some plot points may seem illogical and some battle sequences seem dated but it's still an extremely enjoyable movie. <br /> <br /> The most memorable moments of the film are the mutiny on the battleship, the body of Vakulinchuk falling from the ship, the sailor in the tent at the end of the pier, the mother holding her dead child , the baby carriage on the steps of Odessa and the lion rising to roar as a new carnage ensued. For every new pair of eyes that look at her, "The Battleship Potemkin" comes to life.
