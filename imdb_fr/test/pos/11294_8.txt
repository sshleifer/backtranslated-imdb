I saw 'Begotten' last night and I am divided by two vis-Ã -vis the film. <br /> <br /> On the one hand, I appreciate the fact that this is the total reversal of a Michael Bay movie. No dialogue, extremely stylized granular B & W photos, some of the most truly horrible images ever recorded, and a very convincing use of sound (which nobody seems to have understood yet). It is a reflection on a theme, and it dares to go where most filmmakers do not act only in terms of images, but in terms of production and concept. It's a film that most people do not understand, and if you read these comments, you will find many people whose inability to understand this film makes them scream about the "pretense" with the fervor of a rattling gibbon. the bars of his cage at the time of the meal. It really shocked and disturbed me, and the last time a movie was able to do it was a while ago. half. I understand that the use of repetitions and monolithic rhythms as a baton is of artistic interest, but in this case it does not help everything to remain coherent. Imagine that you are approached by a man in tatters in the street that grabs you by the shoulders and says something that completely confuses the core of your being ... but then, instead of letting you shatter and heckle in his wake, he keep talking and talking and talking. At the end of the film, I found myself watching my watch from time to time. <br /> <br /> This is not entertainment, people. This is the denigration. This is how you deprogram people who have just watched "Glitter". If you watch movies for entertainment, it will frustrate you, bother you and make you angry. You do not approach like a chocolate cake you want to eat because it tastes good. You approach it as if something on the menu that you had never heard before, something you stealthily see through the kitchen door, something that is dark and flickers and twists on its tray; something you do not order because it's going to taste good, but because you just need to know what it looks like.
