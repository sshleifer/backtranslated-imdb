Excellent performance by Mary KAY Place, Steve Sandvoss, Jacqueline Bissett and Rebekah Johnson. Great story that plunges you into the film, emotional, but light. I own this movie and everyone I shared it with loves it. Ideal for mixed businesses, more than 18 people. <br /> <br /> A pleasant production, not a cheap budget, well organized and that holds your interest. Uses more recent ideas for backtracking and keeps the viewer at the edge of his seat. <br /> <br /> Whatever his environment, he adheres to one or more of his audience. points of view in this film. <br /> <br /> We would like to see a sequel!
