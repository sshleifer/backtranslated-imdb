I saw this movie last night and I found it decent. I guess you would say there are times. Some of the scenes with special operations forces were cool, and some of the location shots were very authentic. I will not put this movie in my DVD collection but it is just recommended for rental. I guess nothing sets the movie to another level compared to others of the same genre. The action is good, the acting is decent, the women are extremely attractive and exotic in my opinion, and the story is quite interesting. 7 out of ten
