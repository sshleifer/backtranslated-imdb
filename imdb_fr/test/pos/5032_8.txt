Michael is probably too cute for most fans of action movies and Hollywood for the crowd of intellectuals, but I found the film extremely funny and touching, although it is both hairy and formulated. to investigate a man who claims to be an angel, they end up escorting him on a grand tour of the country's west-central countryside, but they discover that it's every one of their hearts that needs an investigation . <br /> <br /> separate film, as with most of today's movies, there is not much new material, but as a whole it has a refreshing and original approach and is quite quirky to entertain one all the way. <br /> <br /> Although not a "family" film, it is suitable for all ages and is a good movie to share with the whole family or someone special. <br /> <br /> "Michael" is not a big movie but it's definitely a good film, a touching film that deserves a visit. <br /> <br /> KWC
