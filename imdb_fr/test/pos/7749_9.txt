This show is great. "Haruhai Suzumiya" is not only a very well-written animated show, but it also reflects elements such as philosophy, science fiction and a little religion. It's hilarious at times and "cute" (for lack of a better word) to others. In fact, this may be due to my lack of experience with Japanese anime series, but it's one of the best of the kind I've seen. <br /> <br /> I must first of all pay homage to the authors. I have not seen such brilliant imaginations in a TV show since the first Star Trek. I hope that writers will continue to add new strange characters and give a glimpse of the already awesome characters that have been added. <br /> <br /> 9/10
