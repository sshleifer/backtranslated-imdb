It is a film by Oshima, the director of the infamous "In The Realm Of The Senses", a movie so brazen sexually and shamelessly controversial that it was banned for a while. This film is set for the first time in 1895 in Japan and features the beautiful Keziko Yoshiyuki in the role of Seki, wife of a rickshaw driver who cracks for a much younger man who courted her in kind. This man, Toyoji, comes to see her while she is sleeping and seduces her, even if she is soon ready to be seduced. Soon, they have an affair and plot to kill Seki's husband, to be together forever. They do it and throw it into a well. However, they did not rely on the ghost of the deceased husband who haunted Seki and other people in the village! This film is visually very surprising, the use of shadows highlighting this story of murder for passion. Ms. Yoshiyuki (who is still active as an actress) is particularly good in her role. It is sometimes sexual, but not like "In the realm of the senses". Part of what comes from it is part of our imagination. I found that this film had a consistency of mood that makes it very visible. A bit scary but it goes with the territory. I would recommend this.
