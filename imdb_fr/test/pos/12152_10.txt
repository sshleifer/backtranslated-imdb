I've become a big fan of Barbet Schroeder's work, so maybe I'm a bit biased today, but I think this film is great, although there may be some lengths. It is a romantic and non-romantic vision of the Great Liberation at the end of the sixties, surprisingly stylized (superb scenography!) And, in my opinion, always very watchable. <br /> <br /> Basically, it's an ironic tale of the story of Adam and Eve being chased out of paradise after tasting the "forbidden fruit" that went from an apple to a hypodermic filled with heroin . The woman encourages a man to use it, thus accelerating his destiny. I say accelerated This guy seems to be doomed and sentenced to an intense life and an early grave from the sequence of the title. There is no room for any hope. <br /> <br /> Although the story is rather sad, I was captured by the beauty of the beautiful places of Ibiza and Mimsy Farmer.I found that his character was both superficial, enigmatic Endearing, boring, interesting and boring. It represents in a way what men see in women in a simple, non-offensive way. in general are put to very go od use ?? which seems to be a kind of Schroeder brand. <br /> <br /> There is even a bit of humor, mostly delivered by Stefan, the main German character and his accent. His main enemy is not a snake but an old German of dubious reputation ?? and heroin provider - called Wolf. Although it is a German name and Stefan is German, he says it English and starts to jealous and spits the name at his friend at regular intervals. to become a crying boy ... Sometimes Stefan has to work to win a "wine cellar." One day, the guy goes snorkeling and eventually embarrassingly clumsily rocks with his rubber fins. in the history of the film.
