I can not believe people give bad reviews on this movie! I wonder why ...... maybe because of the book ..... I have to admit, he really does not follow the book ... of course ... Dean Koonz's book is fine better ... but the movie is so good !!! it's suspenseful ... the actors are good ... especially michael ironside, who made a great game in this movie! <br /> <br /> come on a guy ... give this movie a chance. ..there's still a lot worse movie than that .... as a sum of all the fears ... ghosts ... the Da Vinci code ... these are some of the worst movies I have seen .. really boring if compared to the observers who really have great elements in the movie ... this movie contains a lot of suspense and non-stop action !!! I'm looking for this movie ... but it's very difficult to find it on DVD ... <br /> <br /> very personal ... I really recommended this movie to everyone ... look -the! !!! you will never regret !!! <br /> <br /> 10/10 *
