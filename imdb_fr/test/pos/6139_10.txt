William M. Thackeray once said, "A good laugh is a ray of sunshine in the house." When I looked at Take Away, I must say that the sun was shining in my house. This film was superb, the inauguration very skillful, the story well anchored, in two words, two fish'n chips merchants who normally are forced to form a kind of alliance to engage in a struggle of David and Goliath against a fast food chain that builds a restaurant in their street. The end was hilarious even though I found many people disagree with me about it. <br /> <br /> The film was very discreet, but portrayed the stereotypes of contemporary Australian ethnicity, especially the collision or clash of cultures if you will. the traditional Anglo-Australian and Italian-Australian stereotypes, and how they found a kind of "unity in adversity", very nice. <br /> <br /> I found the role of Vince Colosimo in "Tony Stilano", an Italian fish Owner of a flea market in his thirties, his acting was very authentic and convincing. Thanks to his performance, he really managed to bring out the essence, or should I say the soul of Australian Australian stereotype, which is actually not too Italian nor Australian either, Colosimo found this balance, breathed his lungs and brought him back to life. <br /> <br /> The cinematography could have been better, other shots of the region would have been nice, from what I can see, it was in Melbourn, but where in Melbourne? for me it looks somewhere between Ivanhoe and Bullen, although I'm not 100% sure of that one. <br /> <br /> I do not know why so many people compare this movie to "The Castle", although they have similar themes. Take Away is in a class of its own. <br /> <br /> I think the movie was excellent with a capital "E", it has everything, it's funny, the jokes are great, it deals with the contemporary problems that the Australian society is facing, the story is true, I loved it! I highly recommend it.
