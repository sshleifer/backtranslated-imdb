If you want to see concrete evidence of what a misguided and uncontrolled government can do for "unpopular" people, this film provides it. Read what some people are saying about the "Patriot Act" adopted after September 11, and then watch this movie. Is it worth it? Do we really want to give our freedom to these people? Regardless of what you have seen on TV, you are not fully informed before watching this movie. I apologize for quoting another criticism, but it bears repeating: Roger Ebert of Siskel & Ebert said: "What is interesting is that if you are looking for people who are unbalanced fanatics ... you do not find them among the Davidians of the Branch, you find them among the FBI and the alcohol, the tobacco and the firearms, it is the people of this film who deserve to be feared, I think. I think that all those responsible for September 11 should be brought to justice, but I think the government has not honored its duty to protect the rights of individuals, and this film proves it dramatically.
