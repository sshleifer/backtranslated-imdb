This game is one of the best horror games / shooter games I have ever played. The plot is a little hectic, but the game never fails to send you a lot of thrills and excitement. Many people dropped the game when they discovered that there was no cheat code and that there were very few health potions and ammo. But in reality, once you have gone through the game once, you are more familiar with monsters and different pieces, so you can easily get away with it a second time. The puzzles are great, not too difficult, not too easy. There are tons of different monsters so you never get bored. And there are a lot of play areas. You really feel like playing in a good Stephen King novel. It's nice and scary. Choose this cheap game and have fun.
