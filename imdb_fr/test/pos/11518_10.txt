LIGHTS OF NEW YORK was the first 57-minute "all taken" feature film directed by Bryan Foy (from the famous vaudeville family). <br /> <br /> The story has two barbaric barbers (Cullen Landis, Eugene Palette) yearning for "living in a big city" and getting involved with gangsters and illegal drinking. One of the guys is accused of murdering a police officer but is saved at the last minute by a pistol (Gladys Brockwell). <br /> <br /> Most of the story takes place in a nightclub called The Night Hawk, which is led by a crook named Hawk (Wheeler Oakman) who glances at a pretty chorine (Helene Costello ) who is Landis's girlfriend. Costello makes a brief dance and we hear Harry Downing (created to look like Ted Lewis) sings "At Dawning" in his best style Al Jolson. <br /> <br /> The acting varies from good (Palette and Brockwell) to horrible (Oakman). Some actors smothered their lines but then stayed the course. As mentioned elsewhere, it was a short film on two and his budget was minimal. surprisingly well, all voices are clearly heard and the silhouette of death is slightly cinematic. <br /> <br /> The film was a box office success, even if it was presented as a silent film where the theaters were not This little movie should not cost $ 1.3 million, but he briefly made the stars of Costello and Landis and certainly launched Palette in his long career as a character actor. <br /> <br /> The co-stars include Mary Carr as a mother, Robert Elliott as a detective, Eddie Kane as a street policeman and Tom Dugan as a thug.
