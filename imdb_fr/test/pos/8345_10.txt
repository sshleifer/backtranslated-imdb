I am a student and I bought this movie from a used bookstore because it sounded really funny from the description. Nothing would prepare me for what would be the funniest film ever made! <br /> <br /> It's especially good to see if you're an atheist, like me. Because then you can see how stupid these Christians are. They seem to think that non-believers like to live in really disgusting and messy houses and just drink beer and be mean to their neighbors. It's a RIOT OF LAUGHING! <br /> <br /> My friends and I watch it every two weeks so that we can entertain ourselves beyond our wildest fantasies! See this movie NOW! <br /> <br /> Let's hope that Rich Christiano still makes some of these movies to keep us pagans!
