To be honest, other critics of IMDb, I really liked this show. The reason? Well, he did not try to be more than he is; I mean, a sitcom with regular expectations, with a well-known and repeated plot, fun and talented actors, and smart jokes geared towards a post-graduate audience. <br /> <br /> That's what Grown Ups offers: try to be mature but in a fun way. <br /> <br /> Jaleel White is always funny and offers humorous and hilarious jokes. The humor is very 90 years without taking into account the trends of the new millennium and this is the main reason in my opinion for which the series was not successful. He got stuck in the 90's. <br /> <br /> Oh and Mrs. Ribisi was really funny and happy. <br /> <br /> My favorite show should be the one about Karma biting your ass! Not a cult classic, but I'm sure this is part of the regular nostalgia of the early 2000s.
