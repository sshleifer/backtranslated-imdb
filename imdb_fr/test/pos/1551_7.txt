After being away for a while, Columbo came back with some new mysteries made for television that, although not as good as the original series, are better than the shows of the late '90s. /> <br /> "A murder can be dangerous for your health" used then (and I imagine now, if you think about it) the real crime indicates the situation of a murder. The assassination is being carried out by George Hamilton, the host of a successful crime TV series, which is very successful. His opponent, Peter Haskell, who lost his job, tries to blackmail Hamilton when he discovers a porn video made by Hamilton with a minor actress in salad. Hamilton uses Haskell cigarettes to inflict the death blow via poison, also giving himself an alibi. <br /> <br /> We bring Columbo to find out what happened. You know the rest. Very entertaining.
