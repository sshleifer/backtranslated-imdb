Maybe this movie was supposed to be just funny. Maybe it was meant to excite teens to nudity. But what I drew is actually something that many people believe. And it's: "Cool guys finish last". <br /> <br /> There's a phrase in Angel Heart from Lisa Bonet's character that says, "It takes a bad ass to make a girl's heart beat faster." True. Probably. Women always say they want flowers, sweets, politeness, etc. But (at least at an early age), they end up turning to the slim, gooey, disrespectful and indomitable babe. The one they know they can not comply with their beliefs. And that's part of the attraction. After all, what excites a guy who already fits what you want him to be? I think that may have happened to Boaz Davidson. And what he has to say in this movie disguised as sex and nudity, parties and all that teenagers can tell is that you will be heartbroken. It happens to everyone and it will happen to you. And it's a strong final statement in the movie. That said, the movie is fun. It's funny and it shows pretty well the antics of high school students. <br /> <br /> This is a rare film, cold enough to please the teenage clientele to whom it is addressed, but also intelligent and poignant enough to show it. like to have a broken heart. No high school movie has ever done better. As I said, I think writers have had to experience a situation like this. Maybe we all have it. <br /> <br /> This is an old movie, but if you come across a shelf picking up dust on a shelf in your local video store, you may be surprised. It's way better than Never Been Kissed.
