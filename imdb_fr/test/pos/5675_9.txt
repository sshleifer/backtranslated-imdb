If you've ever seen Open Water, it's the same kind of independent film, pissed off and upset. I liked the action, the suspense. the slow build of all this, I just hope they do not do this to what they did at Open Water, with this sequel .. but anyway, the only thing I do not have Loved, it's the boring younger sister, I was looking for a fang from the beginning ... the film starts a little as it should, the children prepare their trip, they hire a guide who mysteriously left 5 minutes. before they arrive, so I guess his assistant takes both sisters and boyfriend on the water, now notice that it's the second day of their adventure, oddly enough the first day they've spent to guess, hmm a crocodile farm .. so they are there and everything is good for a little while, then a shot, the time of the crocodile ... very intense, you know something in this movie you do not see not the crocodile, a devil all. a lot, but when you do it, it's very scary, I like the muzzle and the eyes of the fang, and the veil of fog that seems to grip the hook every time he looks up over water, very very scary, but good, all in all it's a great movie, if you can go beyond the boring little sister.
