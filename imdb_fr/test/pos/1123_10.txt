This show is absolutely fantastic. It offers all the drama and romance of teen shows like The OC and Dawsons, but it's a lot funnier. It is a show with morals and values, without everything being coated with sugar and sanitized (ala 7th Heaven.) We do not have sororities or fraternities in Australia, and our university system is completely different, I have no so no idea of ​​the accuracy of Greek life portrays. But I do not care! Because this show is my new favorite! Any writer who can make me love a basher Bible with a racist and homophobic flag must be a genius. <br /> <br /> And Cappie is my new Pacey. Sorry Josh Jackson, you've been dethroned!
