The last installment sees Sho Aikawa and Riki Takeuchi (colder than ever in his reversible coat!) Are running against each other for a last battle, this time in the future. The plot owes a lot to Blade Runner, but in the frenzied, comical and low-budget style of Takashi Miike. I thought it was the weakest of the three DOA films, and although the end was still scandalous, it lacked the shock value of the previous two. Compared to Ichi the Killer and Visitor Q, DOA: Final is not nearly as extreme, but remains faithful to the two other films in the trilogy. That said, fans of the first two (and fans of Miike) will get a lot, because they will link the three films and give a final explanation of the relationship between the two protagonists.
