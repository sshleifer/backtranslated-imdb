It was my first movie Gaspar Noe that I watched and I must say that I was shocked. I do not mind gore in general, but it's not even gore, it's real butcher. For some of you, some scenes may be impossible to see and I mean really disgusting. Leaving aside these aspects, the main ideas revealed here and the dialogue are quite brilliant. When you are given a strong argument against giving new life to the world and how it is given, you can not stop and take a minute to think about it. The actors did their job well, representing the general masks of a hand that few people found in the depths of a sick society. The film is full of metaphors, but I will let you discover them. Do not look at it if you want to have a nice and relaxing time. I recommend this movie to anyone who wants to think or just watch something different from what you find in your average cinema.
