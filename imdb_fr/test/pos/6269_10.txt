Blademaster is certainly a memorable entry in the Sword and Witchcraft category. I found Blademaster with Quest for the Mighty Sword at a thrift store frequented by the mentally handicapped and I was very happy to pay 2.00 coins each. Credible sets and costumes, good sword fights and a beautiful warrior, Mila, make it a nice watch. Some problems though, there were a lot of details in the plot that did not suit, like the cavemen. I did not understand their purpose. In addition, this movie could have really benefited from some additional monsters. The snake was cool, but I guess it borrows a bit from Conan. However, any type of primitive movie where someone ends up with a hator is acceptable to me (see Yor and Battle for Endor). I think that Ator is cool! Oh, and did anyone else call Gallager to the bad guy or is it just me? I give a blademaster a 7/10
