Swift's socialism and pacifism resist against all odds in this well-done remake. (Did you know that there is no hyphen after the word "good"?). He meets miniature warriors, socialist giants, philosophers of the head in the clouds (literally) and pacifist horses that lead Yahoos - almost Neanderthal humanoids. (This is where "yahoo" comes from?) We also meet the naughty Dr. Bates, the devoted Mary Gulliver, the sweet and devoted son Thomas and the complete cast of a real insane asylum of the 19th century. Suspending disbelief is easy, and our girls ages 7 and 12 enjoyed it as much as my husband and I did. (Sorry for the length, IMDb requires 10 lines.)
