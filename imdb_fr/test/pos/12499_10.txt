I had nightmares involving Sesame Street and the Muppet Show during my childhood. I loved the programs, but when I slept, I dreamed of muppets that looked a lot like those on TV ... but not quite the ones on TV. <br /> <br /> They spoke gibberish, laughed and sang while eating and killing each other. They would take a bite of their flesh in cute felt and it would tear up followed by arterial bleeding. PLEASANT! But it was the past ... I LOVE THIS SHOW! I saw Peter Jackson's MEET THE FEEBLES years ago and I wondered why there was no similar work. Here is Old Hobbit's vision, sick, twisted and socially powerful. <br /> <br /> If you like this show and you have not seen MEET THE FEEBLES, go to Amazon or a movie of this kind. source. You are in for a treat. <br /> <br /> By the way, Clarence would be kicking Triumph's dog ass all the way.
