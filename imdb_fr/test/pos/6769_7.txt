Send them to the freezer. This is the solution that two butchers find after discovering the popularity of selling human flesh. An incredible story with humor and possible allegories that is more than just a horror movie. Complex characters defy superficial classification and make the story intriguing and interesting - if you can stand it. Certainly a dark film but also a little redemptive.
