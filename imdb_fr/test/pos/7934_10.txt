Nevsky is one of the great epic war movies. Of course, others, such as Birth of a Nation and Napoleon had come before, but this one is equally influential. The acting game is stock, but anyone who knows the first thing about Eisenstein would know that it was part of his movie theory. This film, unlike many of his silent works, speaks of the heroic individual as much as the group. This reflects the Stalinist philosophy that appeared in 1938. His film shows us all the same power that can generate people who gather to fight against what they perceive as an evil. Nevsky is just one of many men. He is a prince because he is the strongest, but not because he is somehow different from others. The romantic angles of the film provide a more personal story than Eisenstein had previously allowed. All the elements do not work and the movie is probably a bit long, but it still sounds.
