Before Barton jumps out at me, just keep in mind that opinions are like donkeys, we all have them ..... <br /> <br /> I loved Sigourney Weaver and Jeff Daniels, I loved the dialogue and thought the acting was sublime. Minimized just perfectly and minimized. Unlike others, I did not find that @ quite predictable. <br /> <br /> Sigourney's role was refreshing, realistic and realistic, especially the scene where she faced the bully in the trailer. <br /> <br /> it was nice and I did not expect to recommend it to anyone. That's why there are different flavors of ice cream, something to satisfy everyone ...
