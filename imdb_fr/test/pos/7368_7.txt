I recently bought this film for three dollars at a garage sale, and although I'm happy not to have to pay the usual $ 19.99 for this DVD, I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the video. movie. <br /> <br /> It is organized as an anthology of horror, divided into 5 stories, including the story of the "connector", which features four teenagers, whose car destroys a dark and lonely road at middle of the night. Apparently, these kids love horror stories, because that's what they decide to do until the morning - tell scary stories around a campfire. Each character, in turn, tells a story, after which his own story ends with a nice little touch. <br /> <br /> The first story, "The Hook", is a bit of a waste of time, a little bland and dull. Fortunately, this is not one of the main stories and may only last 5 minutes. The goal is simply to present the film and it is easy to miss the non-originality of this piece. <br /> <br /> The second story, "The Honeymooners", is, okay. You guessed it is two people on honeymoon! They travel in a motorhome to Las Vegas. They decide to stop somewhere for the night, but a mysterious stranger quickly asks them to leave the scene, on pain of being attacked by dangerous and unknown creatures. This story has a very good configuration, but just a "ok" delivery. Basically, it's pretty funny and mysterious until the monsters appear, then it's a little fishy. <br /> <br /> The third story, "People can also lick," is my favorite. This is a girl whose parents go out for the night and whose older sister leaves her for a party. So she's going to be all alone - a fact she lets one of her Internet friends know. The problem is this internet friend? Is not exactly a girl of thirteen. The conclusion of this story is a little less climatic than I would have liked to see, but it is still pretty good. <br /> <br /> The last story, "The Locket", is certainly the one full of atmosphere. Placed in a scary mansion on a dark and rainy night, this is the story of a young man (played by Glenn Quinn!) Who rides a motorcycle that stumbles upon this house just when he easily has a problem with his bike. He meets the silent girl who lives in the house and falls in love with her at first sight. Unfortunately, everything is not right - and it may have something to do with the locket hanging from his pretty neck ... <br /> <br /> Once the stories are over, we are presented a twist. involving the presence of four teenagers in the car, which, in retrospect, should have been obvious, but he did not really see it coming, and that's quite a nice conclusion for the film. <br /> <br /> all in all, a good movie. Rent it if you can, because unfortunately, I do not really think it has much value. But the next time you're in the mood to shoot a scary movie in the same vein as "Tales of the Darkside" or something, take that movie and popcorn, turn off all the lights, and offer you this leafing through.
