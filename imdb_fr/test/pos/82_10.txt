When the circus arrives in town and places the lion's cage directly above Bugs Bunny's house, Bugs ends somewhere in the range between panicked and intrepid. Despite the title "Acrobatty Bunny", it is only at the end that Bugs and the lion perform acrobatics. But even before that, it's pretty funny what Bugs does not eat; in one way or another, he always manages to use the weakness of the other character against him, then to shoot any suitable object out of nowhere! Bugs then ended up in the circus in "Big Top Bunny". I liked this one better, because the latter was a little addictive by giving the antagonist an Eastern European accent (I know it was during the Cold War, but still). I recommend this one. <br /> <br /> And in the end, we can say that it will never be Aloha Oe for this cartoon.
