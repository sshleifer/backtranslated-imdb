This is one of those games where you like it in pieces or hate it in tatters. Even if you are an unconditional fan of Mario, you may not like this game. You can hate him because he is short and rather boring and easy. Or you can love I know a lot of people who say that it's amazing, and others who think it's the worst Mario of all time.It really depends on the guy I personally like this game and I think it's the best game on wii, but you have to determine it yourself So I think you should definitely get it if you are the good Nintendo fan. But if you like too much classics, you might not like it. So, try it yourself.
