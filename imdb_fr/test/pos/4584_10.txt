I had never heard of this movie when a good friend recommended it. I trust this friend's taste, so I bought the DVD. My wife and I sat down to watch it without knowing what it was. I thought it was the funniest movie I've seen in a long time, mostly because I saw the truth in satire. I highly recommend this movie to all my friends. <br /> <br /> This is not a movie for everyone. Some people will see rude humor and aura of stupidity, and will find Idiocracy as one of the most stupid movies they have ever seen. What these people do not seem to understand is that the gross humor is there, not to amuse the public, but to show what will please the morons of tomorrow. <br /> <br /> Luke Wilson is well chosen for "average Joe." It is primarily there to be a chorus for the biting commentary on the company that is spreading throughout the film. Most of the fun things are in the background so it's interesting to see them a few times. What makes the film even more funny and scary is that I see elements in everyday life, in people I meet or in the media. Then I go back to look at Idiocracy and realize how good it is. <br /> <br /> The few people who have seen and enjoyed this film can be part of an elite club. I'm going to see an advertisement for a product with a revolutionary new ingredient and turn to my wife to say, "It contains electrolytes!" She knows exactly what I'm saying.
