I read the other reviews here about this movie before watching it. If you have read them, you will know that they are almost all negative. I really do not understand that. I admit that it is much too long (it takes about half an hour of cutting to accelerate a little). The music is often inappropriate. But the good performance of Ford and Thomas are enough to wear it. With all his celebrity as a movie star, I had forgotten that Harrison Ford can really play! This role of a man who has defined himself from a lie is remarkable. I think it's quite credible that he wants to get all the details to see what was real and what was a disappointment. Thomas is always wonderful and that's no exception. His initial denial leading to confusion and then inner calm is enormous. This film will never be on the list of best films, but it is not so serious. I'm happy to have waited to see it on video, but it's worth it to pay $ 3 or $ 4.
