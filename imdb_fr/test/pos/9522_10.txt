I have always loved French films because I think they are filled with emotion and meaning compared to Americans. This film is a jewel. <br /> <br /> From the wedding, which is so much fun that you just want to join them and at the end, where the kids in the family tell us who is with whom is extremely funny. Catherine Deneuve is just so hot and so good that it's quite possible for a young man to fall in love with her, and Vincen Lindon is perfect for that role. The best scene (except the wedding party) is in the family reunion where Antoine gets angry and shouts his feelings to Lea in front of the family. It's a pity that I was able to buy this film in French and not in English (so I have to learn French to be able to watch it) !!
