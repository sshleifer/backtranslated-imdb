This comedy short from Stan Laurel is a pretty little parody of the movie BLOOD AND SAND by Valentino. If you've seen BLOOD AND SAND, you'll probably enjoy this movie and laugh at scenes that make fun of the movie Valentino. However, if you have not seen this movie and watched this movie, you probably will not be impressed - even though I really liked the title cards, the word "bull" has been used many times in a very funny way. <Br /> <br /> Stanly plays "Vaselino", a bullfighter who seems rather confused and wins only because the bulls seem too lazy and not aggressive. Even the bull at the end of the film that killed ten men is obviously just a domesticated bull. <br /> <br /> This is not a fantastic movie, but a cute and harmless movie.
