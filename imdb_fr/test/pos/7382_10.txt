in a time of predictable movies, where violence, romance and cheap melodrama abound, it is delightfully surprising to find such a strange film. the plot itself is compelling and the actors are excellent, especially Alan Rickman. If you want to watch a movie that does not give all the answers before asking the questions, a movie that will surprise you (for good or bad), Dark Harbor is for you. And if you're not convinced, believe me, Alan Rickman's performance is worth it ... especially at the end, ladies ...
