This film is not limited to the eye. If you are looking for a revolutionary originality or an easy comedy, you will be disappointed. But for 90 minutes of entertainment, that's fine. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is neat and precise. The sex scenes, which a comment qualifies as free, are anything but na√Øve - each gesture contributes to the development of the characters. <br /> <br /> Yes, some of the main characters are not adorable human beings. But the film makes an honest effort to show their interactions in an honest light, without being sensational (at least not for the urban standards of the early 21st century). And there are many very fun moments.
