Ok, of course, this movie is a little hokey. It's hard to take comic characters and insert them into movies with any credibility (Dolph Lundgren in the role of The Punisher, do you mind?), But that's very difficult. I have never read comics, but it does not really matter, I suppose. I judge a film primarily on its merits, not on the fact that it faithfully repeats someone else's idea. (Unless it's a true story film that requires at least a few attempts at truth and precision.) So why am I going to give this film a high enough rating? Because he tries. He tries very hard. In my book, this makes it an honest attempt at an entertaining film. <br /> <br /> Many films have been shot mainly on the subject of vampires. It seems that everyone has their point of view on the tradition of vampires, be it the cross, the money, the garlic, the aversion to the sun, it does not matter. Some of these ideas are included here. The story is familiar ... a group of vampires conspires to conquer the world, with one person (mainly) on their way. Blade (Wesley Snipes) lives for the sole purpose of destroying the vampire masses, who are slowly but surely entering the world and sharing it with humanity. For the most part, the human race is blind to the fact that vampires exist all around them. Vampires have even brought pets, vampires, and vampires to show how worthy they are to be "transformed." <br /> <br /> Now that I think about it, many of the elements in this film are similar to Roddy Piper's film script, They Live. A hidden enemy, a hidden group of people plotting against them, the fight to save human beings ... all that exists in Blade too. <br /> <br /> The acting game is not the best here. Snipes is at best only slightly better than some of his other roles; Bushe Wright, a newcomer, is not so bad; Kris Kristofferson is forgettable as a Blade accompanist (he is to Blade what Chip is to The Punisher). Stephen Dorff does the best job of all the casting here, as a vampire "head" that you just love to hate. <br /> <br /> I do not know, but I just loved the special effects of this movie. From rave soaked in vampire-like blood, to the inevitable fight in the film's finale, the special effects are not bad. There is certainly enough blood and blood to circulate, but after all, it's a vampire movie, right? The different shapes and types of weapons used by Blade are quite unique and are generally not used in contemporary action movies. Snipes has more talent with a decked sword than with, for example, a machine gun. In addition, there is so much more to think about fighting with a blade than to blow someone. (Unless, of course, you're Indiana Jones.) <br /> <br /> Overall, it's not the best action movie ever, but it's not bad either thing. As a bonus, the score and the soundtrack are also very nice. Tell me, in which other films can you hear a great drum'n'bass like Source Direct or Photek ?! <br /> <br /> My rating: 8/10
