And with these words, one of the big film advertising campaigns is coming to an end. "Garbo Talks" and she uttered these words in her first sound film, an adaptation of Eugene O'Neil's play, Anna Christie. <br /> <br /> Unlike some other players and studios, MGM made sure to find the right vehicle for Greta Garbo. Many players who were doing well in the universal medium of the silent film would lose their career because of walkie-talkies. Their heavy native accents would interfere, some did not know English. <br /> <br /> It's no coincidence that Anna Christie was chosen for Garbo. First, it is written by one of the leading American playwrights. This is the kind of literary property that would have seduced her. Secondly, since the lead role was Swedish, the accent could be explained. Finally, many of the problems of the first conversations had been resolved, even though Anna Christie was still using the title cards. <br /> <br /> Like most of O'Neil's work, the action is short, but long and deep. characterization. The story takes place on the New York waterfront where Garbo as Anna came to live with her father George Marion. Marion fled to sea years ago when Anna was a baby and Marion abandoned his wife. Anna had to do everything in her power to survive in the adult world, including prostitution. <br /> <br /> Of course, Marion is happy to see her. He even throws Marie Dressler, the old woman by the water's edge. with for years to make room for his flesh and blood. Of course, Marion and Garbo both have problems adapting, which is not easy when they host a sailor played by Charles Bickford who likes Garbo. <br /> <br /> Marion repeats her role since the beginning of Broadway's original production. Anna's role on stage was directed by Pauline Lord. Anna Christie played 177 performances during the 1921-1922 season on Broadway. This is one of O'Neil's best-known works and one that is frequently repeated. <br /> <br /> Of course, Garbo's performance with perfect diction, even with a Swedish accent, has been hailed and his future in sound films assured. Greta Garbo has been nominated for the Academy Award for best actress and the film has also been nominated for Clarence Brown as Best Director and William Daniels for Cinematography. Daniels should especially congratulate himself on the way he photographed the waterfront scenes. And Brown created the mood around the water's edge where the film is shot. <br /> <br /> Eugene O'Neil's work is timeless, so Anna Christie, despite the many pitfalls of early sound movies, does not date from that of many movies of that era do. Garbo also shows that she understands the subtlety needed to work in sound support. Anna Christie is a classic, all around.
