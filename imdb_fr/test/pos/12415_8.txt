Two college buddies - one a stuck nerd, the other a rude bastard - embark on a road trip across the country. On the way, they meet a wicked vehicle that looks like an army tank combined with a monster truck, trying to overturn their car. They escape, but further enraged the mysterious and dangerous driver when one of them flees the upper trap when he is stopped to rest. Later, they catch a sexy hitchhiker who ends up being involved in a life-threatening situation. MONSTER MAN is an extremely entertaining horror comedy that contains suspenseful moments and bloody moments. The two main characters and their constant quarrel are fun to watch for themselves and the ending takes a turn similar to that of the TCM which was very well done. Absolutely worth checking.
