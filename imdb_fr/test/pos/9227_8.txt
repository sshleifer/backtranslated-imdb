Rainbow Brite and Star Stealer are not meant for people born before 1980 or after 1989. Most of them would not appreciate the good things that are the cartoons of the 80s. The fact that Rainbow Brite was transformed in film is a guilty pleasure for many of us who remember to have watched the TV show at the time. Admittedly, most dialogues are quite amusing and silly, and the plot is non-existent to useless, but it's still a very cool movie.
