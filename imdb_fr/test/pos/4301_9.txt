It was one of the worst episodes of Columbo I saw. However, I'm only in the second season. <br /> <br /> The typical activities of Columbo are both fun and irritating. His cigar ashes causing him trouble have already been seen, and he still identifies one way or another with the murderer - in this case, the kitchen, while the scene of the television series is distracted of the main theme. <br /> <Also unexplained was also why the brother at the beginning of the show was cutting some of the mixer's wires. The reason was never explained and was useless. But the part that I disliked the most was the death of the future bride. This has never been explained and this is the main reason why I give this episode a low note.
