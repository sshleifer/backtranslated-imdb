If you want to see a real thriller, rent this !!! This is not the director or screenwriter of "Scream", it does not present actors "TV" overpaid and overpaid who pose as "stars", and it is not a dummy with special effects. Instead, you will get a first-rate sound, pissed off, very loud (in the violence) but exciting.
