Yes, this movie was just hilarious and the acting was great. Except that Shelley Winters did not have a strong German accent, but no matter, because she is hardly in the movie. So, if you are a fan of her, beware! The two main stars of this film are Laurence Harvey and Julie Harris. Before this movie, I only saw Miss Harris in East of Eden with James Dean and I had an audio tape from The Glass Menagerie that she had toured with Monty Clift and Jessica Tandy. I did not know how she was in this role and BOY, she impressed me How was she marty I love ham! ;-) Mr. Harvey, it tickled my imagination! I am now a fan of Laurence Harvey! This hair !!! * crack * OMG! It looks almost like Burt Lancasters, this messy crazy look, it does not get any better than that. He is young and so innocent in this film. NOW! It's definitely in my top ten! :) I'm SO glad to have found a copy that belongs to me! Unfortunately, this movie is out of print and very hard to find on video :( <br /> <br /> Btw, pay attention to the scene of the hotel room at the hospital !!!!! This is one of the best places! Or when Mr. Harvey convinced himself that he was sick and that Kick, you know how doctors do with this little rubber hammer ;-) Well, he does it himself and his leg kicks and he kicks at the table * squeaks * Look at the look on his face, so innocent !!! I can not describe it, but to all those who say that it can not do very well and to the other comments of cockamamie, see this movie and you will see what GREAT actor it really was. You will be upset! If you're not, I'm afraid I can not do anything for you, you're hopeless. ;-)
