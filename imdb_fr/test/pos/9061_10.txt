Who did you think a suicide could be treated in a palpable way by everyone? I saw the movie at SXSW at its prime minister and it turned out that it was by far the best movie out there. Yes, it's weird, but it makes sense in the world created by the filmmaker (Michael Parness). If you did not laugh (most people did), then you do not understand anything and it's a shame. It is particularly interesting to note that Guillermo Diaz as Hector steals many scenes and that the chemistry between Natasha Lyonne and David Krumholtz is intense. The film recalls Harold and Maude, but not really. It takes a weird twist, and they all make sense in this completely disordered world in which we all live. then, and what was great, was to hear that these are the same reasons I thought in my mind as to why things were going on. I do not think you can say a lot of negative things about the film, unless you do not understand it. I think I got it and it seemed that almost everyone did it too. The film is called suicidal comedy, but it has a lot of heart, a lot of laughter and a lot of hope, but it does not fear the horrors of suicide either. A nice little movie that should get attention when it comes out, which should happen as soon as possible.
