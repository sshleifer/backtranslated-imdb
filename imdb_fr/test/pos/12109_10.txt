It is a film about the music currently played in Istanbul. Istanbul was the center of the two superpowers of the Old World, the Byzantine Empire and the Ottoman Empire. Today, it is a megalopolis of nearly 10 million. It is therefore not surprising that a lot of music is played in Istanbul, with a wide variety of voices, styles and influences from around the world. It's Turkish music, of course, and I'm fascinated by Turkish music since I bought my first record a long time ago. The film presents different singers, instrumentalists and bands. The musicians' comments are a good illustration of the music played and the social context of modern Turkey. For me, the most interesting comments are from Orhan Gencebay. In addition, the film presents urban landscapes mainly from Istanbul, which is very pleasant to watch. <br /> <br /> "Crossing the Bridge" is listed as a documentary and includes minority music, for example. Kurds and Roma. Other important topics are omitted, such as Turkish jazz or the music of Armenians and Greeks. <br /> <br /> This film is highly recommended for music and culture lovers from Turkey, the Balkans, the Eastern Mediterranean and the Middle East. It can also be worthwhile for those who are keenly interested in the overall effects of musical styles such as Rock and Roll or Hip Hop.
