After traveling the world, I realized that Australia really lacked something that other countries have: history. <br /> <br /> Fortunately or unfortunately, Australia was not established as a result of war, it does not have war and most of its political history is rather ..... boring! Nothing "big" marked a turning point in Australia's history ... until the resignation of the Whitlam government by Australia's Governor General John Kerr. <br /> <br /> For those who are Australian, you can ignore this paragraph and move on to the next. It's for the benefit of curious non-Australians! Australia was colonized by the British. Over time, it became clear that Australia was able to fend for itself. As a result, the UK has allowed Australia to create its own parliaments, laws, courts, etc. Australia's law and policy would no longer be provided directly by the British; Australia would rather be led by Australians on their own, even though courts, precedents, parliament, etc., are largely inspired by the British system. This change has been codified in the Australian Constitution. Despite the fact that the constitution legally establishes Australian governments, legislative procedures, courts (except those who are curious - no bill of rights), there are two sections "pro-crown" which have been included and which remain to this day. These are more or less regarded as the "reserve powers of the Crown (King / Queen of Great Britain)". The first group of sections is the creation of the office of the Governor General. In short, the governor general is considered the chief representative of the Queen in Australia and is described as the "executive" branch of the Australian government. When a piece of legislation is passed by the Australian Parliament, the constitution states that it becomes law only when it is signed by the governor general. As such, the Governor General is considered by some to be nothing more than a rubber stamper exercising an archaic and useless constitutional function on behalf of the Crown. Theoretically, the Governor General may refuse to sign a law passed by the Australian Parliament if he deems it useful. For example, if Parliament passed a law allowing the police to shoot down any Australian over 50 (hypothetically of course), the GG could refuse to sign it and not become the law of the land. However, this power is theoretical and has (to date) never been exercised. By "convention" (which is the buzzword of the events that led to the dismissal), the Governor General is practically at the request of the Australian Government. Therefore, if the government passes a law and the Prime Minister instructs the Governor General to: sign it, he will almost always do so without asking questions. In fact, by "convention", the governor general acts in accordance with the advice given to him by the prime minister at the time (and the prime minister alone). The second aspect is section 64 of the Constitution, which states that government ministers exercise their functions at the discretion of the Governor General. Now, the events of 1975 - covered in this film - have set a precedent for this particular article: if the governor general is somehow "dissatisfied" with the government and / or the prime minister, it would appear that this article allows him to legally sack the government (what happened in 1975 ... hence the title of the film "the dismissal".) "Can we please pleasure" can it be interpreted as "the absolute right of dismissal" is a This was a contentious issue, although this led to rather heated exchanges between Australians at the time - all the more so as the Governor General was not elected by the Australian people. <br /> <br /> Now that this background aspect is far away, let's go back to the movie discussion. It was well done. The pace was patient, but did not hang around at all. The drama was well contained and very realistic. He did not dramatize the events and, more importantly, he did not present his point of view from a political point of view. On the contrary, I felt it was fair and balanced, even though the conclusion of the text before the credits indicates that the filmmakers probably did not approve of the Governor General's decision to overthrow the Whitlam government. But I would not describe the film as a whole as a bias in one way or the other. <br /> <br /> As for precision, it was almost perfect. The filmmakers certainly did their homework and obviously read the books and writings of all the major players involved. A number of more specific details were somewhat ignored, largely because they took a long time explaining and had little impact on the events of 1975, so I forgive them for that. In addition, I think it was hard to recreate the public sentiment of this post-Vietnam period, but Noyce did well. <br /> <br /> Finally, I was delighted that the film tried to do both sides without becoming analytical, obsessive or critical. In addition, all of the issues we talked about, such as the Connor Pipeline, were very relevant to the story. The filmmakers understood that their job was to tell the story of the events that led to the dismissal and not to present political support or opposition with regard to policies and viewpoints. It was good because it meant that the film could not be accused of distorting the politics of one of the parties. <br /> <br /> Referral is probably the most incredible part of Australia's political history in its short life. I'm glad he was crystallized in celluloid. An essential viewing for any Australian.
