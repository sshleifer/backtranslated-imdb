A really great and touching movie. Female melodrama at its best, with a lot of comedy: great dialogues, characters and writing. Any woman can understand the story because it's a classic: you're in love with "Mr. Right" but he's not interested in you until a guy who looks completely wrong comes in and you fall madly in love. But of course, it's not so simplistic. The characters are real and all the performances are perfect. The film is hilarious too, every scene breaks society. I would recommend this film to anyone who loves a well written script of humor and melodrama. You can relate to each character and the plot moves in unexpected directions. A big underrated movie.
