It was the first time Chaplin had spoken, and the results are mixed. The film is a scathing satire of Hitler and Mussolini, their acolytes and their fanatical lifestyle, especially with regard to the persecution of the Jews. It was bold and futuristic for 1940 and it must have shaken many people. <br /> <br /> The comparison with Chaplin's previous work is quite pale in comparison. The sweet and amusing style of his silences, in my opinion, is far superior to his first talker. There are many meaningless bits lying around. If it had been silent, it probably would not have happened. <br /> <br /> I find that one of the funniest moments is that of the musical barber and the dance of the globe. One of the most moving moments is obviously the speech delivered at the end. <br /> <br /> The Great Dictator is an effective and sometimes moving film that is integral to the story of Chaplin and his film. It's flawed, but Chaplin is in great shape.
