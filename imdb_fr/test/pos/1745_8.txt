While Disney is THE animation studio for 70 years, their supremacy has always been rivaled. When writing this review in 2009, for example, companies such as Dreamworks and (to a lesser extent) Warner Brothers and Ardman, offered animated films that could challenge Disney's dominance. At the beginning, at the peak of the late '30s and early' 40s, when Disney hosted film banquets like Snow White, Dumbo and Fantasia, the contest was organized by brothers Dave and Max Fleischer. Despite the release of two very commendable films, they never grabbed the market. many attribute their fall to the commercial failure of Bug Goes To Town, published the same week as the Pearl Harbor attack (which gave the American public something more significant to think than to go to the movies to watch a cartoon!) the film faded into relative obscurity is a travesty. <br /> <br /> In a garden patch overgrown, a group of insects is in danger. Humans use the land as a shortcut, throwing their trash, their cigars and other dangers, directly over the homes of insects. Mr Bumble (owner of the honey shop) (voiced by Jack Mercer) fears that the future is dark and wonders how he will ever be able to raise his daughter Honey (voiced by Pauline Loth) in a safer environment. Bagley C. Beetle (voiced by Tedd Pierce), an extremely unscrupulous creature, offers to give her a safer place to live if she accepts marriage, but Honey is much more interested in her childhood love, her ever-joyful love and optimistic Hoppity (voiced by Stan Freed). Hoppity thinks everything is about to be solved for the better, but it remains ridiculous when Bagley Beetle and his two comical acolytes manipulate the crisis in order to give them a sneaky end. In the end, as their plot becomes the base of a new skyscraper, the bugs give Hoppity confidence, as they rely on him to guide them to a new home, away from the destructive influence of humans. <BR /> <br /> What really works in this movie is the delightful characterization ?? all the bugs are intelligently developed and designed to attract the maximum audience. The evil executioners swat the fly and smack the mosquito (hilarious names, if you stop to think about it) are particularly memorable. The narration is equally admirable. Even the youngest children can appreciate this story, while skillfully conveying a message to older audiences about the impact of human carelessness on wildlife survival. The time has inevitably dated certain aspects of the film and, when viewed, the public must accept (and forgive) these occasional signs of age and general wear and tear. But all in all, Mr. Bug Goes To Town is an accomplished, funny and neat animation, with a message worthy of initiation.
