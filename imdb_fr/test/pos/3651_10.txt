Sit down and let the director Bharatbala lead us on a visual and sensual journey of the spirit and spirit of India. When was the last time you could say that you really enjoyed a movie? This film has rhythm and moves us in directions that may only exist in India. If you did not want to visit India, this movie will surely make you want to visit it now. This film has dancers, a hunting scene and the mafia involved. But there are many more. Thank you, Bharatbala, for telling us a story that is so vivid and wonderful. I loved the end. We women do not want illusions in life, we want reality. P.S. I was Carolyn's friend at the Sonoma Film Festival and I met you briefly. Good luck in your distribution efforts and I'm talking about the movie as a storm.
