This movie is great, I really enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> This film is about a cat mom named Dutchess and his 3 kittens.T Dutchess and the kittens love the music.They have to practice the piano every day.But the butler named Edgar tries to kidnap Dutchess and his kittens, he tries to make them sleep. But he fails. The Dutch women meet a cat named Thomas O Maily. Thomas falls in love with Dutchess. Cats start to sing. With the song, everyone wants to be a cat. Thomas likes music like other cats. Thomas and Dutchess really like each other. <br /> <br /> I liked this movie and I like cats!
