I love a cute and sincere movie with a happy ending. This film could be considered a drama, about two characters realizing true love, but the story is so touching and sweet that in my mind it's a romance. While the acting is not great (it's not the 10) but they do the job, and they do not do too much (thank goodness) more they are cute, but the story is powerful and just adorable (some of your thoughts will suffocate) !!!!!! It's an excellent watch for a love story, but if you're homophobic, STAY AWAY! for everyone, I loved the movie, it's so sweet! I felt it was a retreat on a smaller scale ... but with a happy ending .... so enjoy !!
