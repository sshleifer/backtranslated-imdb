A respectable royal rumble event <br /> <br /> 1. Edge against Shawn Michaels <br /> <br /> 7.5 / 10 A very good start to the match ... The performance of the Edge's heel was sublime, as at the roar .. 2. Undertaker vs Heidenreich CASKET MATCH <br /> 7/10 a lot of people hated this rivalry although i like it, i thought heidenreich was playing really good character. the match was not extraordinary in the excitement until kane and snitcky got involved. They are gradually improving. <br /> <br /> 3. Kurt Angle vs. Big Show vs. JBL (WWE FIELD) WWE TITLE MATCH <br /> 7.5 / 10 a surprisingly good match because there was only one player really exciting to this title. ..very good match for the title ... good pace ... although predictable end. but all the matches for the royal rumble title are not predictable. <br /> <br /> 4. Triple H (WORLD TITLE) vs Randy Orton WORLD TITLE GAME <br /> 6.5 / 10 In fact, it's not very good for the guys involved, has too many dry plates, Orson sells his shock surprisingly, but ends with an anti climax. <br /> <br /> 5. ROYAL RUMBLE EVENT ... in the other games, there were some segments ... two that were really cool ... cena striking on Christian's ticket number 30 and Guerrero. the event was good. 7/10 would have got a 9 if it had won, but unfortunately, my greatest batista foe wins (WHAT CAN I UNDERSTAND WHY?) ..Vince goes down and takes a fall and the whole arena bursts of laughter.
