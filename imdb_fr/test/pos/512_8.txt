Wesley Snipes is best interpreted as Blade, a half-vampire man known as the daywalker. He has all his strength and his only weakness is the thirst for blood. Since teaming up with Whistler (Kris Kristofferson), he has been chasing vampires who have been living among us for centuries. he intends to awaken the god of blood and take control of the world. <br /> <br /> This film is well edited, written and directed; to ensure that the viewer has an exciting experience from start to finish. Blade is full of subtle combat sequences and dialogues, Blade is certainly more of an action game than horror, but it is quite effective. <br /> <br /> 8/10
