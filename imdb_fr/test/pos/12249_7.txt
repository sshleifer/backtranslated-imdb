I did not really see many movies with Holly Hunter, but seeing her in Broadcast News was a pleasant surprise. It's a hard-nosed journalist, Jane Craig, who has devoted all her time to television. His colleague Aaron Altman has been carrying his torch for a long time without saying anything. The love triangle is completed by Tom Grunnick. He is the slightly distant ex-sportscaster who is the new journalist. For Jane, he symbolizes everything he does not like in news reporting - making it fun, not serious business. To her surprise, Jane feels attracted to Tom. <br /> <br /> Holly Hunter makes an excellent performance as a perky journalist. But I do not really see how she finds so charming his new colleague, Tom. It's something with them that prevents us from getting closer to him personally. Albert Brooks is almost as impressive, he gives himself thoroughly as a professional who gives more than 100% of his work but does not receive as much in return. In fact, for a moment, I thought it was Steve Guttenberg of Police Academy (1984). It has some funny lines and if it was a photo of Meg Ryan, it would be called a romantic comedy. <br /> <br /> In two hours, some scenes could have been mounted or completely left out, for example. The journey of Jane and Aaron in Central America. In addition, I am a supporter of happy ending and I preferred a different ending to a simple meeting between them three years later.
