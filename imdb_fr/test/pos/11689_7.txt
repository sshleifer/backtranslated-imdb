Sensational. At first, I wondered who wrote these things! How difficult is this choice between a man who offers you and your children riches, respectability and security opposed to a husband who offers you only oppression, abuse, degradation and poverty. However, our choices are not always as clear as one might think. Indeed, the rich gentleman was all that a woman could hope for and yet ... the attraction of her husband, his sexual desire for him was almost overwhelming. What to do, what to do ?? As a spectator, you have become as confused and misguided as she is. Anyway, what I really came to tell about this site was my admiration for the Engish voice, I thought, although it is actually the voice of an Irish singer in the movie . As I look at him, I find out that this is Glen Hansard, whom I had never heard of before that day. What a find. I am so grateful. Wow, what a voice! What a day! Thank you BIFF!
