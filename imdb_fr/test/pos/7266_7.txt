A very watchable film, which was eagerly awaited after seeing the trailer several times. <br /> <br /> Everything is superb, given the ridiculous efforts of the upper middle class erased to stand out from mediocrity, The film brilliantly captures the spirit of the eighteenth century for the wild beasts of the lower class who are just trying to keep your head above the dirt. <br /> <br /> Jonny Lee Miller plays Maclean extremely well, although the role does not exactly stretch it. , and Robert Carlyle seems a little spoiled by Plunkett, Miller's big hangman. <br /> <br /> The real star of the series was undoubtedly Ken Stott, who plays Mr. Chance (a sort of police chief of 1740) with a devilish joy that sets him apart from the rest of the cast. <br /> <br /> A great movie, and anyone who loves the color and style of Peter Greenaway's films will love the look of this scene, although the intricacy of the plot becomes Apparently before the 2 o'clock have not passed. <br /> <br /> It's worth seeing.
