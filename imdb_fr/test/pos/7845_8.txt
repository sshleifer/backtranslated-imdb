The Beguiled is one of those films seen in the career of a director and / or actor who ends up playing better than expected. The same year that Clint Eastwood and Don Siegel collaborated on Dirty Harry, they also collaborated on this little psycho-sexual drama taking place in Confederation during the American Civil War era. It's almost a 180 of what Harry had for the public. Here is a film that goes unnoticed and has a relatively low budget, which is almost no deal compared to Dirty Harry. It's also a story where Eastwood is not surrounded by a world full of dangerous men but women who, despite their first appearances, have darker sides. And there is even romance between some of the most difficult and complex scenes. But in this kind of setting to make the film, Siegel has a little more freedom to do things with the style of the photo that goes to something more European; I'm thinking here and there at Polanski's work in the 60s. It works pretty well even with the initial doubt that these two figures of male cinema (Eastwood Evidence and Siegel having created his niche in B-Black and low-budget thrillers) ) can extract material that could possibly be made for. a Lifetime movie. <br /> <br /> It was also captivating and really dark here and there to see Eastwood's performance working with these girls. He's doing something a bit subversive in his performance by keeping Eastwood's type of machismo - if there's such a thing close to his clich√© film image - taking a step ahead of that little school for them. young women sometimes and not others. Seeing Eastwood in a performance like this, as with Play Misty for Me (Eastwood's other work of 1971), shows how cool it is to be able to act credibly with very good actresses. In particular, here are the four main female characters, of different ages and varied attractions for their "Yankee" man. If the work of Siegel at the direction of all actors has its strong moments in the first half, it's really once the story has crossed halfway the path of the sequence of dreams (less success than the director does it could) that the real juicy scenes start to take. This is the best Siegel has achieved in a dramatic way, pushing the psychological and emotional limits of unexpected scenes. <br /> <br /> It's a difficult film, without these praises, because it does not paint anyone. too respectable, only the character of Hallie, the slave in service played by Mae Mercer, is sort of separated from what happens between the too curious women and McBurney. On top of that, Eastood plays a role that is and is not what it is generally perceived at the time of the true years of his film training. He is an anti-hero here, who was his trademark of Westerns and other thrillers he was doing at the time. But unlike those movies, he's not really in a mode where he's "bigger than life," to put it in a way, because he's both a deserter and a womanizer, a deceiver and a cunning even in his most charming and affable moments. If this is not one of his best acting roles, difficult to compose given his catalog, this is a work that deserves the detour for fans who might want to see another face of him. This is a credit to him, but also for his collaborations with Siegel, who both took risks in Hollywood.
