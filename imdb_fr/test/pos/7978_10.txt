It's a cute little movie that provides pretty much what it promises - good entertainment. After all, when a movie proclaims that it features the best SASS shooters, you must understand that it is not a possible candidate for the Oscar for the "Best Film". These guys are shooters, not actors. Your next clue is that the film does not hold the spotlight, neither Nicholas Cage nor Jennifer Aniston, that is, you should not expect to see the most fashionable names of the moment. It was supposed to be a very old-fashioned entertainment and in that respect, it's just as good as many of the old "flatterers" I've seen over the years. <br /> <br /> So much you get with "Hell To Pay"? You get 100 minutes of good old entertainment. You have the chance to see stars of recent years, who act pretty well as they did at their best but a little older. You can see good SASS shooters in lead roles and some SASS hams in the background. It was very fun for me to see people with whom I kill, visit home and who are my good friends and who are able to do something that many people have never dreamed of - they are really honest god movie. They do something that many aspiring actors and aspiring shooters will never have the chance to do and I think that alone is worth seeing. <br /> <br /> Of course, not everyone is a SASS member and I've seen a lot of fun and humor that could be missed by others, but it's still a lot of fun old-fashioned, and frankly, there are LOTS of movies in the theater right now that I would not give a penny to see, so keep the money to go to "Brokeback Mountain", get "Hell to Pay" "and watch real cowboys have fun.
