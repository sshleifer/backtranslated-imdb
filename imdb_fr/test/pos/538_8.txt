Susan Sarandon. She made this film for me. I have never liked it more than in this movie. She really acted like she was Adele August. I can appreciate actors and actresses who leave their personality and create a truly credible character. <br /> <br /> Natalie Portman, in the role of Ann August, contributed to the creation of the ideal antagonist as their characters unfolded throughout the film. The film was about them, so the other characters were peripheral. <br /> <br /> I've given eight notes to this movie, but Susan got a score of ten from me because of her performance. In terms of love movies, Beaches and Terms of Endearment have had a bigger impact on me than this movie, but I highly recommend it.
