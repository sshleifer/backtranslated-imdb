I just saw this movie 2 days ago. A very interesting look at people and our world around the world of wine. I have no particular interest in wine and yet, I found it very informative. The director gave me the impression that he has the ability to show people what they are. Although he exposes a lot of things that lie beneath the surface, he manages not to take a stand and leave that to the viewer. He shows great compassion for people (and dogs) and compassion, and lets people tell their story while exposing what they do not want to say. <br /> <br /> The film shows us where our world goes, what are the benefits and what is the heavy price we pay. It is a film about the love of wine and its desire to make it big, personal and global, its character and its formula. <br /> <br /> The real stars of the people for me are the older winemakers disillusioned with the world and themselves. <br /> <br /> It takes a while to get used to hectic camera movements and editing, but it's worth it. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
