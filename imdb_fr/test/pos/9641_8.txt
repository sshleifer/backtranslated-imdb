Robert Montgomery and Robert Young are outstanding as a pair of young submarine officers stationed in Italy during the First World War. The dialogue is extremely entertaining and Jimmy Durante is hilarious as the ship's cook, "Ptomaine". The character of Walter Huston is a source of inspiration as captain of the submarine, a stellar example of officer and gentleman. One of the most interesting aspects of this film was the level of technology displayed on the battle scenes. I was surprised to see how much the technology of the First World War was similar to the one displayed 25 years later, during the Second World War. The basic human nature has been described as very similar to modern times, and far from the conservatism I thought existed in the past called "innocent". Overall, I felt that the actors, characters, action scenes and story vision described in this film were excellent.
