This film is beautiful in many ways: the plot, the depth of the characters, the breathtaking photography and acting, scenes of battles in the kolossale (no infographic here, only thousands of people). Someone said that the story had something to do with the tragedies of Sheakespeare. I also find some links with the tradition of Greek tragedy. <br /> <br /> The emperor, who has acted in an extraordinary way, struggles between power and love, but he is obliged (for the greater good, for the will of his ancestors) to choose power (and loneliness, hatred of his subjects and his parents) as destiny. Like Creon in Antigone, he was a guy well before he became emperor. Once the power is acquired, he must be pitiless and cruel (with innocent children, his mother, his father, etc.) to defend and develop the empire. Locked by power, he becomes a monster. Overall, Emperor Qin is a majestic figure of Greek tragedy. <br /> <br /> The assassin moves in a different direction: pure evil to heroism and morality. Even this character is forced towards his destiny by love and by his new ethics. This character is also truly unforgettable. <br /> <br /> Lady Zhao, a wonderful Gong Li, is a flawless morality, neither power nor love or hatred. She is morality against power, in a way like Antigone. His conspiracies (for and against the emperor) always have a moral justification. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, a wonderful film.
