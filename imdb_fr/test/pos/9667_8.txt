Romanian cinema is little known in Romania. No director from Romania has attracted the attention of the international public, as have other Eastern European countries such as Hungary, Czechoslovakia or Yugoslavia. One of the few great directors of Romanian cinema is Lucian Pintilie, who made a great film 35 years ago, "Reconstituirea" - quickly eliminated from the circuit by communist censorship. After this film, still a reference for Romanian cinema, Pintilie was not allowed to freely create in Romania before the fall of the communist regime in 1989. <br /> <br /> 'Furia' reminds me of the Pintilie film 35 years ago. The title means "The Rage" and I do not see why the distributors have chosen to translate it differently. This is a lost generation. While in Pintilie's classic, the evil resides in the oppression and lies of the communist regime, young people here have to deal with the emergence of the subculture and the moral grime that filled the void left by the totalitarian. rule. The end is tragic and painfully awaited. <br /> <br /> The film is well done and the acting is good. Without too much complexity, he manages to create an emotional connection between the characters and the viewer. We could say that some situations look like "8 Miles" or "The Fast and Furious" - but look at the date of production! This film was made at the same time, if not before the Western peers. If this is the first film by director Dan Munteanu, as IMDB says, this is a first remarkable film. In any case, a good movie can compete and sell well in the Western market. <br /> <br /> There is hope for a new generation of Romanian films that, with a little luck and good distribution, will take its place in the international film scene. <br /> <br /> 8/10 at my personal level.
