All I can say is that I was expecting a film wick and that "Blur" surprised me positively. Very beautiful teen movie. All these situations are normal in school life, so all I can say is that all this reminded me of my school time and that sometimes it's good to watch this kind of movies because we entertain and we bring back to those golden years, when we were. Young. Similarly, make us think better about how we should understand our children, because previously we were as if they wanted to be in the present.Try this movie and you will be very happy. At the same time, you have the guarantee that your time has not been lost.
