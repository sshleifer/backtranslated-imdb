Mullholland Drive proves once again that David Lynch is the master of cinematic expression. Last night, during the screening, I attended a brilliant addition to the history of cinema. The performances are astounding, the score mesmerizing and the photography fascinating. David's ability to integrate the many elements of filmmaking into a unique and stunning cinematic experience is unmatched. Looking at Mullholland Drive, I could not help but realize that with David Lynch in this world, we are truly blessed. Cinema is also blessed because, in David Lynch's films, it is shown that a man's vision can be achieved with amazing results. We realize that blockbusters are not the only way. We realize that a true cinematographic artist has a chance in this world and that we are truly blessed.
