I first saw this film as a video. Even on a television screen, the views were impressive. Seen on the big screen in all its glory, he had to amaze people. <br /> <br /> As one or two other comments have pointed out, the story of the early pioneers and their way of solving terrain problems etc on the Oregon Road is as authentic as any movie. This shows that it is totally useless to take liberties with the truth - which today's filmmakers should take into account - the reality is enough. <br /> <br /> The intrigue rests on the struggle of the man against the elements and hostile the natives. Secondary intrigues are few and simple. But the basic plot is enough. Elsewhere, I examined Paramount's rival on the big track, Fighting Caravans. Despite a more sophisticated plot and better actors, Fighting Caravans lacks breathtaking scenes. <br /> <br /> The Big Trail should be a mandatory viewing.
