There are few movies that have massive amount of non-stop ninja action like Ninja III: The Domination. It's a story of love, redemption and revenge, but it's mostly a story of people being overthrown and killed for no reason. If you're looking for a movie where a ninja goes crazy and takes all kinds of people to their graves just because he's a ninja and he can do it, that's the movie he's going to show you. need. I do not see comparable films, because no movie is so impressive. Wait, oh, have you ever seen the thing with two heads? There is a part of that in which the main thing is to drive a motorcycle and about a million cars of cops chasing them, but they keep crashing and that is not BECAUSE YOU CAN NOT ACCESS THIS CHANCE! Well, it's kind of like Ninja III. I highly recommend this movie especially if you like the following things: Ninjas, Swords, Lucinda Dickie's Breakin 'and Breakin' 2: Boogaloo Electric, video games about being a bouncer at a bar, ambiguous love stories and underdeveloped or "good" ninjas.
