*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** It's easy to understand why the script of this movie won an Oscar. At least during the first half. My head was spinning from all the sharp lines running at full speed. Noel Coward plays a New York publisher ("Why do not you publish books you like?" - "What? And corrupt the public?") Who seduces and manipulates his many hangers. Then he dies in a plane crash and the story turns into a strange takeoff of the Flying Dutchman in which Coward has to find someone who really cries before his soul can rest in peace. Very nice until it becomes weird. Seen at the Cinefest of Syracuse in March 2003.
