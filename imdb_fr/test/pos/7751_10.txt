I do not have words to really describe this series. <br /> <br /> The basic idea of ​​this concept (a very hyperactive girl with a very eccentric personality who ends up tipping a team of nonsense into her own rendering of the world, which after all was a creation of Haruhi because it wants a world with extraterrestrials, espers and time travelers) is a breath of fresh air in a world populated by repetitive animated series and non-innovative TV shows. <br /> <br /> The characters are well developed and you will end up loving them, some less than others. The word to describe the animation work does not exist, because "excellent" would be really insufficient to describe how it happened. There are many fun situations that can make you smile or make you think. Do not fall under the impression of the first episode, because this is only the tip of the iceberg, because the novels are not yet known. <br /> <br /> The only problem is the lack of chronological order in the episodes, but you can solve this problem, right? <br /> <br /> Conclusion: Unquestionably, one of the best series of 2006.
