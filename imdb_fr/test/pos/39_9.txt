Since I met the Divine Mrs. Merkerson as a sex therapist in Spike Lee, "She has everything you need", I was sold in the film of this actress extremely talented but terribly unknown. She received an Emmy for her performance here and claiming that she is well deserved is a masterpiece of underestimation. <br /> <br /> Here, she simply shines as THE guiding force and the hand in her community. It was particularly poignant for me because I grew up at the same time. The details of the production were phenomenal and evoked unforgettable memories of life and times of the 50's and 60's and of women like Mrs. Merkerson. She was accompanied thoroughly and skillfully by a very hot casting with performances that we would enjoy again and again. I first saw the name of Macy Gray in the credits and I went awry. His performance was so good that I did not even recognize it until about a third of the course. I am particularly proud of the obvious care given to the details to create an impression and appearance of another beautiful era of African-American culture, done with great taste. <br /> <br /> Another very interesting aspect is the realization of the project. less affected by the racial fabric of the time, but infinitely more sensitive to the richness of the characters and the emotional diversity they provide, to illustrate that, ultimately, these are the choices we make and the extent to which we assume responsibility for it. <br /> <br /> This is a dignified and elegant presentation of African American life, destined to become a classic. You owe it to yourself to have this document in your collection. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend it.
