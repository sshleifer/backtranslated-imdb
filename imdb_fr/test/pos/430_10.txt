To keep it as simple as possible. It's a very good show. It's well written and the distribution is fantastic. It's not loaded with blood and guts. And around a disgraced policeman and his relationship with his ex-wife, his son, his ex-partner (Andr√© Braugher), his childhood friend became a priest (George Dzunzda), and finally the person who gets caught by chance this episode. Are you likely to find something like this happening in your city? NO. Is it still a good story YES? And it's good to see a man presented as a good father despite his faults. Watch more than one (2-3) and you will understand why many of us are hooked on this show. And thanks to David Morse for making this character so interesting. Another good job!
