I enjoyed that for two reasons. The emotional entanglement was sometimes confusing and imperfectly resolved, but the combination of news footage with the story of the film was often compelling. The other thing I liked was the representation of the werewolves, the Nazi fanatics who continued the fight after the official surrender. I do not know of any other film that deals with them. They murdered Burgomaster Oppenhoff of Aachen on Palm Sunday 1945, for example, and created problems for occupation. The film therefore challenges the saner version of victory and occupation with some cruel realities. The "human problems" are presented not through the characters, but through the historical reality that gripped those who had survived Hitler - both conquered and victorious.
