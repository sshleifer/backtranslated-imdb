THE RED CIRCLE is a very good film, although it suffers a bit, because there have already been similar films. In too many ways, the film is reminiscent of previous blockbusters, such as RIFIFI, GRAND SLAM and many others. So, while director Melville and the actors did a great job, it looks like a case of déjà vu. Because of that, I struggled to give a higher score to this excellent movie. <br /> <br /> The unusual aspect of the film is the way the scammers gather. Instead of the usual means, Vogel escapes from prison and meets Corey, a career criminal released from prison! Both are a good match, but their parallel work on much of the film until they met was a smart touch. Aside from that, as expected, much of the film deals with the minute details of crime planning and execution. I also liked the way the film showed the scammers so cold and detached - something that is relatively common in French crime movies but was rare in American movies until the last few years. <br /> <br /> Overall, extremely well designed and worthy to see ... if you do not mind that it sounds a bit repetitive, you'll see good acting, direction and a lot of great voltage.
