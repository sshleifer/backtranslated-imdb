It's another one of those films that I remember staying late to watch TV, scared me, at the age of 12, and then condemned me to an obsessive life for movies. horror. It is a BIG film and a living proof of the reality of effects before CGI. <br /> <br /> Installed on an isolated base in Antarctica, this version almost seems to take over where the original version (The Thing From Another World) came to a halt. US scientists discover a decimated Norwegian base, several kilometers away. Everyone is dead, and only the half-burned remains of an unidentifiable thing left to smolder outside the complex could offer answers to what might have happened. The Thing is brought back to the American base and, too late, scientists realize that it is alive and deadly. The Thing thaws and disappears, not only to kill anyone and everything that passes through it, but also to absorb them, becoming himself and whoever he wants. The film then turns into a brilliant piece of paranoia. Everyone is suspicious, anyone can be the Thing and nobody trusts anyone anymore. Gone are the strength and security found when humans come together despite their differences to fight a monster. The group is divided and fear reigns supreme. Who is the thing? <br /> <br /> The gore effects here are absolutely amazing and realistic. I could have done without the dog's head cracking like a banana peel, but it's just the animal lover in me: kill all the humans you want, but leave the kittens and puppies alone . Mental health and reason disintegrate quickly, one by one, humans being taken care of by the extraterrestrial. The power of this film lies in its paranoia and although I liked the original version, I prefer this one; the real threat lies in it and scares it all the more because it is invisible and easily detectable. The anger is huge and the results are horrible. <br /> <br /> This is one of the best Carpenters movies, with The Fog and Halloween. All actors give strong and realistic performances and the special effects are so powerful that they present themselves as their own main character. This film has something to offer to any amateur of the horror genre. Do not miss it.
