This is my favorite kung-fu movie. It has a very authentic flavor, seasoned with an ominous musical score (of traditional Chinese instruments, I think), and wonderfully overexpressed melodramatic moments contrasting with a deeply affected comedy. Indeed, while trying to create their own "western" genre (cowboy movie), the Chinese have concocted a brand new animal marked by the fight of kung fu and its associated sound effects. <br /> <br /> The story of Five Fingers of Death is simple, a story of revenge (for the murder of a loved one) and the pursuit of the main character to master the "iron fist technique" which will allow him to exercise a sacred vengeance on his enemies. There is even a love interest, although the clumsy and polite type (found in most Chinese movies of the period). The end result is, however, excellent and much more authentic than any Bruce Lee film.
