If you had asked me how was the movie throughout the film, I would have told you it was great! However, I left the theater with a feeling of dissatisfaction. After thinking a bit, I think the problem was the rhythm of the end. I think the majority of the film moved quite slowly, then the end grew very fast. So, I would say that the end left me disappointed. <br /> <br /> I thought the characters were well developed. Costner and Kutcher have described their roles very well. Yes! Ashton Kutcher can act! In addition, the different relationships between the characters seemed very real. Moreover, I thought that the different intrigues were well developed. Overall, it was a good movie and I would recommend seeing it. <br /> <br /> In conclusion: good characters, great plot, poorly written / poorly edited. Again, go see it !!!
