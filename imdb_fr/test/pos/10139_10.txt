Spoilers !!! To understand what really happened, you must first be a warrior, stay alive in a real war, think offline, analytically, critically and nonlinearly. Otherwise, you will come to false conclusions that Major Gray was an idiotic or unstable person. The truth is something completely different. He was a convinced veteran and Captain O'Malley could only kill to kill him. It was his exit. He chose it. He was not a man who will retire. If you have never been to the front line, you can not understand it. He intentionally prepares his own suicide. First, he seduced Mary Jane, then deliberately played idiotic, then pleaded - closing the incident in front of witnesses (to protect her later, after doing what he would like her to do if she had to stand trial), then handing over to his son to ensure that he could load his weapon later), came that night, loaded his weapon, woke her up, put her gun in her hands, acted like he attacked it, after firing a first time, he raised the knife and shouted "One kill" so that he shot him again and before he died, he put his knife as if he was trying to take it back after the first shot. He also gave him a message with his latest cry. "After the first murder, everything will change in your mind and destroy your life.This is the only way for me to die as a man, but being killed by someone I love is my choice and my only prerogative , war and the army, is not what you thought so far, grow up finally and save your life until you can. " She left military life at the end. She understood it well. And he did not die in vain. The man who helped him to prepare all this and then to complete the trial and its outcome was Colonel Sam Doran with the help of Lieutenant Tim Macy. Macy did not know what was really happening and what the result would be, but did what he was supposed to do. He took pictures of Mary Jane and Major Gray by order of Colonel Sam Doran, who gave the order because Major Gray had asked him to do so. After refusing to leave the army (which Colonel Doran had asked him to do), Colonel Doran had convinced the prosecutor to charge him with premeditated murder (he knew she could not be found guilty) at the time. instead of murder (there was a possibility of being convicted). with pictures taken. Col.Doran also repressed incidents involving the plaintiffs in order to prevent the prosecutor from having doubts about a premeditated murder charge, but revealed during the trial what greatly influenced the jury. I have no doubt about the outcome of this trial. Why did Colonel Doran do that? Because he will do everything Major Gray asks him to do. Why? Because he saved his life on a battlefield. Why Mary Jane chose to go to trial? Because she was a person of integrity, a principle. And that's why Major Gray chose her. Someone must be deserving, honorable. Keeping the secret on what really happened that night, she also proves her honor. <br /> <br /> Miroslav
