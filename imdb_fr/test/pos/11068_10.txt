Ingrid Bergman (Cl√©o Dulaine) has never been so beautiful. Gary Cooper in the role of "Cleent", perfectly interpreted as a laconic Texan who knows that this girl is not good. When both eyes will be seen on the French market, we know that this match will be full of sparks. When they walk in his garden in his restored house in the French Quarter and the theme of love plays, it is a dream for all romantics. <br /> <br /> The costumes are lovely; the decoration of the decor makes you wish that the "neighborhood" be like that. And that Saratoga always had this hotel with the big veranda with all the old gadgets chatting. <br /> <br /> Edna Ferbers' novel tells the story of a vengeance for old wrongs and quarrels that led the railroads into the early days of this industry. <br /> <br /> In the scenes of Saratoga, Florence Bates, as a great lady, steals every scene. <br /> <br /> But this is the scene where Cleo confronts the little lawyer who represents it Parents from New Orleans sent to buy it, a magical moment in the film. After Cleo defeats him in the negotiations, he looks at her with envy and says "can I say - you are very beautiful". And Cleo with a happy, mean smile says, "Yes, is not it lucky?" You want to shout "YES" !!! <br /> <br /> One of my favorite romantic movies of all time.
