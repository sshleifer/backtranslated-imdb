For a feature film, the plot follows closely the story - or at least the historical gossip. But then, the Chinese, who know the story very well by seeing it portrayed many times, will never tolerate it otherwise. The attention to detail is wonderful, especially for anyone who has read Sima Qian's story in the Records of the Historian. Jing Ke, according to Sima Qian, would have effectively tried to end Qin Shi Huang's life at the request of the Crown Prince of Yan before unification. Sima Qian explicitly mentions both General Fan's head and the dagger wrapped around the map, as well as the dagger thrown into the brass column. Although Jing Ke is described as a stranger to swordplay, he is not the invincible warrior described by Chen Kaige. Jing Ke is indeed the weakest link in this movie. In reality (again, according to Sima Qian), he was a big drinker and postponed his visit to Qin as long as possible, spending a lot of time with the ladies of Yan before the crown prince finally ordered him to leave. . In short, he was a human being and did not look forward to death, although he was willing to accept it. Chen Kaige's Jing Ke is afraid of death, but not his. He is the classic killer turned pacifist disillusioned. His love (or perhaps simply his affection) for a woman and the pity for several hundred children buried alive by Zheng (not even two thousand years of hostile Confucian historians have claimed that Qin Shi Huang had acted from so, although there is a legend burying 460 Confucians at their neck and then beheading them) is enough to kill this old assassin again. The melodrama is not convincing and the character ends up being just boring. Playing here is not bad, although not very interesting considering the character. As for Lady Zhou, in all the many stories I've heard about Qin Shi Huang, she never showed up. Anyway, Gong Li is famous enough that the Americans have heard about her (thanks to Zhang Yimou) and there must be a love interest, so here it is. It is unfortunate that his performance is almost as woody as that of Jing Ke's character. She did much better (in Qiu Ju for example); Here she barely manages the presence. But all this is trivial compared to the extraordinary interpretation of Li Xuejian as Zheng himself. Qin Shi Huang is for the Chinese rather what the Satan of Milton is for us: accepted as a villain, but noble. Qin Shi Huang's achievements have been awe-inspiring for two thousand years now, and Li captures his frightening will without compromising his humanity. Li's performance is sufficient, but the scope of the film is great although the photography is deliberately dull. It seems old. The score is adequate, it does not move almost, although it is very suitable for action. Although I only saw it once, I think Chen Kaige should be given more credit for the work of his camera than other critics have allowed him to do. Opening credits are intoxicating. If five stars is quite average, I gave three more for the game of Li Xuejian and Chen Kaige as an actor, writer and director.
