I am a Maharashtrian, a teenager living in the 21st century, and it is obvious that I am not very interested in Bollywood, let alone Marathi movies. Yet, when I watched Shwaas, it left me with a unique feeling that only an extremely effective film can generate. <br /> <br /> It is a fact that, like most Indian films, the film has its true and complete effect only if seen in its original language. Much of the emotion and meaning of the film is embedded in its Marathi dialogues, which, as difficult as they are tried, can not be translated effectively into English. a grandparent and a child. And that does justice to this strong bond. Dialogues such as "mazha parsha pan laakhat ek aahe" (my parshah is also one in a million) reinforce emotions. Anyone who has watched the grandparent-child relationship closely will be able to relate to the situation described in the film. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's definitely worth watching. It's a film that has deeply marked me. I will surely recommend it to anyone!
