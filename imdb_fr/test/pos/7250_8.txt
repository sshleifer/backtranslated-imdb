Plunkett and Macleane is an entertaining, fast and refreshing movie. Refreshing because, unlike most period films, it does not strive to give the public a history lesson or to preach pompously - indeed, historical accuracy is almost ignored. This film does not take itself too seriously and seeks to entertain rather than enlighten. Plunkett and Macleane take place in the 18th century, but the director Jake Scott proposes a version of the 90s. There is action, sex and swearing profusely and, in the inevitable scene of the ball, the aristocracy dances on disco rhythms. Jonny Lee Miller and Robert Carlyle are brilliant, as always, and the rest of the cast, including Alan Cumming as a fop flirt, is also very entertaining. The film is visually spectacular in places and is a mix of comedy, action and drama, with a love interest provided by Liv Tyler with a fragile English accent. In short, if you are looking for a few hours of entertainment, this movie is for you. It will not make you think, but it could make you smile.
