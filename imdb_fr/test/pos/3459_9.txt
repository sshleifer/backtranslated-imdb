This is by far one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. Top 20 of my life. I laughed more than I have since Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy and I cried more than I saw The Notebook. If you are looking for a touching movie without the dark edge, this is it. It's real and powerful. See it and you will not regret it. I was reluctant at first and only watched it because I had to do a school project on speech disorders. But this movie is so much more than that. It's about life, free and independent of how the world would hold you. It is about the disabilities that each of us has to stop us from seeing ourselves and what we miss, but to let everything else get in the way.
