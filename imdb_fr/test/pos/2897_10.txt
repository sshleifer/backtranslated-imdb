This DVD will be treated with indifference by millions of rock music fans around the world, because Rush is not cool. It is unfortunate that Rush had to overcome the sneering contempt of the majority of North American and British music reporters over the course of their 30 years of existence, depriving many people of the opportunity to be part of a real group. well represented here and what catalog of songs it is! We have the seminal "2112", the magical "The Trees" and the lyrical "Tom Sawyer" interspersed with energetic and stimulating tracks from the genre of their latest album "Vapor Trails". The musicality is almost flawless, the show is spectacular and the Brazilian fans are just crazy (at one point, they sing with an instrumental!) Each member of the group plays at a level that defies the true craftsmen performing the art. If you doubt, try the instruments "Villa Strangiato" or "The Rhythm Method" for the size - and yes, the latter is a drum solo (you have to see it to believe it). <br /> <br /> Sound and visual production values ​​are very high, as it suits the Rush experience and you also get a documentary and multi-angle set pieces. <br /> <br /> This is an amazing performance and tribute to Canadian rockers and all serious classic rock fans should own a copy.
