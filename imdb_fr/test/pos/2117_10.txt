My mother and I went to Fort Worth Premiere primarily to see George Strait, but we finally got a chance to see the movie in preview at Bass Hall. What a beautiful and beautiful film that not only portrays the beautiful landscape of Texas, but also a beautiful story of well-being. It was well written, directed and produced and my mother and I loved it from start to finish! Thank you Jay for giving us the opportunity to participate in the premiere of this wonderful movie. It was a night we will never forget. As if seeing the movie was not enough, we also had the chance to sit 4 rows in front of my favorite singer, George Strait !! Thanks thanks thanks!! Keep up the good work and thanks again! <br /> <br /> Debbie McClendon & Maureen Daugherty Ft. Worth, TX
