If you're going to watch this movie because Michael Caine or Michael Gambon are involved, then do not worry, it's not their typical role, although I've found Gambon Fantastic. Look for Dylan Moran instead. I'm a fan of everything I've seen and it's no exception. I did not even know he could play, but even the characters he's supposed to pass on, which I found completely believable, is impressive considering that the public knows they're fake. <br /> <br /> The plot is great and, even if it's not constant, laughter along the way is full of other charms. An excellent movie for people with a good sense of humor.
