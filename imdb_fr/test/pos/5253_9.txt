I had my son for the weekend and my parents called me and told me they wanted to meet us both at the movies. When I got there, my mother said that she really wanted to see "The Women" and asked if my son and I were worried because it was labeled as a girl movie. I reluctantly agreed that it would be another First Wives Club movie. I must say that I was very surprised to find myself really enjoying the film from the opening scene to the credits. It was a superb production and the actors were perfect in their roles. My son and I found ourselves laughing all through the movie and we are happy to have seen it. This is an excellent movie for Saturday afternoon and I highly recommend it to everyone, men or women.
