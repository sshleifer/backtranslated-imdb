As many critics have observed, this film is deeply dark. The director who reminds me the most is John Landis (yes, go ahead and shout out that I'm a farmer). Arcand has the gift of exploring frivolous things in a dark, gray way, then turning around and exploring the horrors of life with a light touch. <br /> <br /> The cast is without exception above average. Thomas Gibson, as David, is remarkable as a morose, self-deceiving center around which other characters evolve. He speaks a good nihilist, but his actions reflect more love in his character than he wants to recognize. Gibson was already a powerful and subtle actor in 1993. It was hard to watch him and see Greg Montgomery, not to mention the Hotchner agent of criminal minds. <br /> <br /> Maybe not the best scene, but the one I enjoy most often, my "rewind scene" is the section in which Candy is waiting for a visitor, and a non-invited person after another comes to the door. As Candy's interpersonal environment swings more and more out of control, David becomes more and more bouncier, more insightful and more enthusiastic, like a lean "Tigger" of Generation X.
