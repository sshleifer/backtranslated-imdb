In 1965, producer Kevin McLory - who owns some of Bond's cinematic rights - is associated with EON Productions (Harry Saltzman and Albert Broccoli) for the production of "Thunderball," the fourth film in the 007 franchise. sure Sean Connery. <br /> <br /> In 1982, McLory wins a legal battle and can produce an "independent" film on Bond. "Never Say Never Again" (NSNA) is one of two "unofficial" 007 films shot outside EON (the other is the 1967 comedy, "Casino Royale"). NSNA is a remake of "Thunderball" and features Bond's original film, Sean Connery, who returns to the role after many years of absence. <br /> <br /> The film comes out a few months after "Octopussy" with Roger Moore, the 13th episode of the EON series. At the time, the press called it "The War of Obligations" ... The two films met a great success in 1983, even if "Octopussy" earns more money at the box office. <br /> <br /> NSNA is a luxury movie made by excellent technicians - the director, Irvin Kershner, who directed "The Empire Strikes Back", Douglas Slocombe - the chronograph of "Raiders of the Ark" lost "- and the writer Lorenzo Semple Jr - who wrote" The three days of the Condor "... <br /> <br /> The distribution is excellent with Connery, Kim Basinger then relatively unknown, Barbara Carrera, Klaus Maria Brandauer, Max Von Sydow, Edward Fox ... <br /> <br /> all that the film remains inferior to the original "Thunderball". It lacks many fundamental ingredients to become a real movie Bond: there is no traditional sequence of canons, nor the "James Bond theme", M and Q are not played by traditional actors ... C ' is a copyright reason: EON is only allowed to use these elements. In short, NSNA lacks the classic movie mood 007. <br /> <br /> By the way, the film is exciting and enjoyable. Brandauer is a very good villain and the women (Basinger and Carrera) are sensual and beautiful. But the main highlight is Sean Connery! He's a wonderful guy, he's older, but he's looking better and more beautiful here than in "Diamonds are forever," his last portrayal of the British spy before NSNA.
