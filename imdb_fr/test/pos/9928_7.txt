Betty plays the role of dubbed in a production of Verdi's Macbeth who is asked to continue when the diva is injured in a car accident. However, in the great tradition of "The Scottish Play", the production seems fraught with pitfalls, the least of which is a madman who cuts the crew. Unfortunately for Betty, the murderer seems to have special projects for her ... <br /> <br /> This is one of many Argento's breathtaking films, mostly in the context of photography extraordinary made by the great cameraman Ronnie Taylor. I did not measure it, but I think about two-thirds of the film's plans involve either pots, carts, tracings or cranes - the impressive amount of camera movement is amazing and makes the film ten times more exciting than a standard. thriller. The images are wild and dizzying: close-ups of the heroine are forced to open with nails, a hovering plane around an opera from the point of view of a raven, shots of the brain of the killer wriggling, a bullet fired through a peephole, a chain swallowed from the trachea of ​​a victim. Conceptually, it's just amazing and could only be realized by this director. The film is not without flaws though; the actors are at best variable - Marsillach and Barberini are a little shaky (and its dubbing in the English version is appalling, even by Italian standards), although Nicolodi, a regular Argento, is fun and Charleson gives a performance thoughtful in a role that a bit autobiographical (a horror director very much criticized for his remoteness and his confidence in the technique). The material is a nice three-way mix of The Phantom Of The Opera, Shakespeare and Slasher, scripted by Argento and his regular collaborator, Franco Ferrini, with many suspects and the usual disdain of boring presentation scenes to explain what is really happening. . Full of all kinds of different music - Brian Eno, Claudio Simonetti, Bill Wyman, Puccini and of course, Verdi. The scenes of the magnificent opera were shot at the Teatro Regio in Parma. For a strange reason, the British impression of this film has the alternative title Terror At The Opera.
