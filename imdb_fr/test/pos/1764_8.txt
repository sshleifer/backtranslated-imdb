Like all the older films, this "film" is very short: it lasts about a minute! So, because of its brevity, it's not really possible to compare it to more modern movies. But for his time, it's actually a very remarkable film. This is largely due to the fact that the prints were painted by hand. Annabelle appears in red and other colors just as she does her amazing dance. I actually saw two different versions - one where it is red and another where it changes color. I think the red on the DVD "The great train flight and other primary works" is the best of them. The dance itself is very hypnotic and very much like an outstanding performance. And, unlike other movies of the day of a minute (or less), this one is a movie I can see many times - it's just that which is visually appealing and weird. <br /> <br /> If you want to see it online, you are a 36 second version on Google Video (type "serpentine dance").
