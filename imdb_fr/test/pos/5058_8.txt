While going to see Rendition, I was expecting an exciting film on a controversial topic with renowned actors. I was not expecting a film so captivating, exciting, poetic and sad that took me from the beginning and did not let me go, even after I left the theater. A tip for those who have not seen it yet, do not let your politics stop you from enjoying (or not appreciating) this movie. Take it for what it is. I saw it with my conservative Jewish family (I am the black sheep, the pseudo-liberal student) and thought they would write it as a "liberal propaganda". Instead, they said it was a great movie with great performances (they like to make movie reviews). <br /> <br /> It's sad that a film like this must be marketed by its Oscar-nominated actors, while leaving Sarsgaard, still underestimated, and new talent like the excellent Metwally. The whole cast gave good performances, some of them stand out much more than others; My only problem was that a lot of things were happening that did not leave much time on the screen for each of the characters. In fact, I felt as if the "sub-plot" with Fatima and Khalid was as important on the screen as Anwar's share in the story. <br /> <br /> The characters all have the potential to fall into stereotypes, but the actors do enough work to give them depth with the little time they have on the screen. Streep is really great as a heartless senator, and although I do not want to see the actress in such a terrible role, it's impossible not to believe her. Gyllenhaal, who will probably be one of the Oscar pawns for this film, sometimes seems a little uncertain in his role. He tries to portray his inner conflict, but in general, it is as if he has forgotten his lines or did not know how he should feel. Sarsgaard gave an excellent performance. his unforgettable confrontation with Streep is without a doubt one of the best parts of the film. Metwally, again, has been great and I hope to see it in other mainstream movies. Too bad that Gyllenhaal was probably named before him. Yigal Naor, as shown on IMDb, has already made some films, but he is a newcomer to me. He, along with Mohammed Khouas and Zineb Oukach, all gave great performances. <br /> <br /> The story of Fatima and Khalid has not received credit in the commercials, but it brings a sad humanity to this story. The story was interesting because I was trying to really connect the two stories until they were clearly told in the end. I read comments here that said the love story was useless, but I disagree. I think this clearly shows another aspect of the controversial issue and humanity in general. Khalid was the real terrorist, but he did it to avenge his brother, and even though he is responsible for the attack, you see a human side through the story with Fatima. It's not that I think we should feel bad about the terrorists, but I think the theme "we are all people" was very relevant. <br /> <br /> Whatever your feelings about terrorism, politics, etc. theater. The bottom line is that it's an interesting story with a message we all need to hear.
