The film is a pleasure to watch, not only for the intrigue, which is captivating, but also for the superb performances of the actors, Deneuve and Belmondo. Although considered a "flop" on its first outing, it has become a critical hit and it's clear why. Deneuve's actor style suited the film perfectly. she constantly gives the impression of holding or hiding something, and her character in this film is. I will not spoil it by saying what, although it is disclosed soon enough. Belmondo is adorable like tobacco tobacco quite naive but in love. I would recommend this film to all fans of Truffaut or Deneuve. It's a brilliant Hitchcockian-style thriller with exciting twists and interesting relationships and characters that flourish like the movie. The film lasts about 2 hours, so you feel like you're not sold in the open. Deneuve steals the show in this film, and it is clear that at the time of filming, Truffaut was very much in love with her. A must see for any filmmaker or moviefan. 10/10
