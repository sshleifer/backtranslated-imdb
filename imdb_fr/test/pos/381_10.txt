Looking at Alfred Hitchcock's career, there is never cause to be surprised how such a brilliant and visionary man could be denied enough recognition for his film industry revolutionary. This is probably the sign of Hitchcock's advance, still pushing the envelope, and never slipping with a film shot for the sole purpose of being entertaining, but always with a deeper and more poignant motivation. Strangers on a Train, one of Hitchcock's first underestimated successes, is a perfect example. A funny and suspenseful story, even if it's been seen more than 50 years later, certainly, but it was built with so much care and intelligence. in film technique. <br /> <br /> Without doubt one of the pioneers of "thriller thrillers", Strangers on a Train may seem slightly dated in some ways, but it retains all the superbly worked tension that in 1951 (if slightly less shocking). The brilliant use of cinematography and light, as well as quick and neat editing are the characteristics that really distinguish the film, highlighting all possible tensions and holding the attention of the public, even in the slowest scenes. If there ever was a doubt about what was a very talented filmmaker, Hitchcock, just watching five minutes of Strangers on a Train should be enough to disavow such feelings; each plan is carefully chosen and constructed, all of which serve to advance the story in a particularly innovative way. Unfortunately, certain moments in history are sufficiently inappropriate to divert our attention from the superb cinematography and editing. Bruno is able to get down to the bottom of a sewer grate, it's just amazing. a stereotypical old man crawling under a carousel out of control gives an involuntary comic relief in what is supposed to be the most tense and appealing scene in the film. These are only brief moments, but they are enough to stand out as being painfully weak in an otherwise stellar movie. <br /> <br /> But what really distinguishes Strangers on Train is the premise of history. While last-minute Hollywood movies run the risk of descending inevitably further and further into the turgid cliché after the cliché, it is wonderfully refreshing to see a 50-year-old film with a premise that seems truly intelligent and original. Of course, it's quite simple, but the concept of "killing exchanges" is simply a concept that would not be possible in today's movies, which makes it all the more fun to watch; the shiny scenario of the film keeps the action at a fast pace while providing us with wonderfully memorable sequences. One can not help but notice the deeper themes to which Hitchcock alludes, especially the concept of "darkness in the heart of humanity", demonstrated by the elderly ladies fascinated and exalted by the prospect of murder, as well as by Bruno's casual attitude. towards death. Hitch also works in many moments of black humor (Bruno blows up a child's balloon with his priceless cigarette), and with irony, performing suspenseful scenes in merry and casual environments, such as iconic carnival scenes, to create an even stranger atmosphere. . It may be a suspense thriller, yes, but it would be simply inexcusable to neglect the brain hidden beneath it. <br /> <br /> The antagonistic figure of Bruno (tried to the perverse perfection by Robert Walker, unfortunately in his last role in the film, but easily stealing the film from his very talented teammates) is undoubtedly what makes the difference on a train so memorable, because the character is a marvel to see. Here, we have a naughty figure simply superbly designed, all the more intriguing by its ordinary and modest appearance. Rather than screaming madly and thwarting the hero every moment, Bruno is a calm, controlled and psychotic disorder. He speaks of murder with such flippancy, while keeping a passionate gleam in his eyes when he discusses different ways of killing people. Bruno could seem to represent the "Id", as Freud would say, the inner, darker and uninhibited aspects of humanity. This contrasts interestingly with Guy Haines, his hero, and with his bland and uninteresting appearance, almost as if we wanted to make it clear that evil was much more interesting and attractive than constantly seeking to do what is right. <br /> <br /> Yet, despite this implicit message, Hitch still deforms our emotions enough so that we get hooked for Guy at every turn and applaud every new hurdle he's forced to overcome. The talent of actor Farley Granger testifies that, despite the villain of Robert Walker who easily steals the show, the hero of Granger always looks nice and deserves our support, even if he is the prey of a character much less convincing. Ruth Roman, who manages to overcome the cliché and become a more complex and complex romantic figure, offers superb support. Kasey Rogers surprisingly interprets Guy's first hedonistic and manipulative woman, and Patricia Hitchcock proves that she is talented to be simply "the director's daughter". The superb cast (led by a simply wonderful Walker) really brings the film to life, adding so much more to it than Hitchcock's breathtaking style. <br /> <br /> In total, Strangers on a Train may seem a little too dated for some viewers, but the fact that the film is modern and appealing to the contemporary audience seems surprising given its release there is a half a century. . Once again, Hitchcock proves his unparalleled mastery of cinematic tension and technique, and the astonishingly original and enjoyable feature of the film is worth watching. Highly recommended for anyone wishing to embark on a brilliant but extremely entertaining cinematic experience! <br /> <br /> -9/10
