A very interesting addition to the Scandinavian surrealist collection. Recommended viewing for those who love their complicated movies. My interpretation of the strange "end" would be that Andreas' journey ends in hell. He does not like the emptiness of purgatory directed by the consumer; a kind of "living" but not progressing, that is to say, not being able to go anywhere - even the subways of the city do not stop at the stations. It has a subway system, as you should be able to travel, freedom, escape, but you can never board these trains. He fails to reach a scented sensory paradise and ends up continuing his bus trip to his final destination. The old Nordic version of hell (Hades, NOT the hell of the earthly city) does not burn as much as the British version, its cold, its cold, the country of Niflheim (country of cold and fog). This seems to be the place where Andreas ends up, having just failed to reach Heaven through this tunnel.
