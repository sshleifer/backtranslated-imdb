When a saboteur detonates a controversial government research laboratory, two lab animals are released in a small community in Washington state. One is a dog with unusual intelligence. The other is an "outside experimental mammal" or "OXCOM". Due to reasons explained later in the film, the oxcom hates the dog and therefore tries to kill him. Watchers concerns the accidental involvement of Travis Cornell (Corey Haim), his mother Nora (Barbara Williams) and his girlfriend Tracey (Lala Sloatman) with the dog and oxcom, as two agents of the Organization of National Security, Lem Johnson (Michael Ironside) and Cliff (Blu Mankuma), find them. <br /> <br /> Many comments were made about Watchers, which is very different from Dean Koontz's book that serves as a launching pad for the film. It is true. But that should not affect your rating. If you want the book, read it. Judge the film on its own merits, not how it fits the book. Bill Freed and Damian Lee, the screenwriter, are as many artists as Koontz (it's not a comparison of quality, it's an assertion that they are all artists). The same goes for director Jon Hess. Their job as filmmakers is not to slavishly follow the book as if it were a screenplay. They adapt the book, as artists, to create a unique work of art. It's based on the book. Not identical to that. You have to relax your preconceptions / expectations when watching the movie, as you will experience a work you do not know yet, even if you've read Koontz's novel. <br /> <br /> So, is Watchers a good movie? It's pretty good, not great. Good enough to win a "B" or a 8. Hess starts off with one of the most filmed explosions I've ever seen. Unfortunately, he travels a little later, while we listen to a very thick jargonistic exhibition. After this scene, Watchers may become a cliché of the 1980s movie when we meet Travis and Tracey for the first time. <br /> <br /> The cliché turn is a continually threatened trend. But this is only a bias. More often than not, Hess is able to transcend a cleared territory with a number of interesting twists: Travis and Tracey are both from single-parent families, their genres being reversed. Both have unique and mature relationships with their parents. Although it's a horror movie, one of the main goals is a cute and clever dog, and it often looks as much like an adventure film as a horror movie, a thriller or science fiction, all genres combined. Hess has a lot of characters, some of whom are late in the game. Yet, the movie is never confusing, and no character feels like he's in the dust - all the wires are tied to the end . The structure is also complex in that there are two main villains, the second becoming less obviously ill-intentioned as the film progresses, until a turn accompanied by brutal violence make an antagonist clearer. Shortly after, Hess leaves us a moment of doubt with the other antagonist. <br /> <br /> The biggest defect in my eyes is a dreaded problem, common in horror movies since at least the 1980s - "the attack". the scenes are turned too dark, too close, too blurry, and they are edited too hectic. It is extremely difficult to say what is happening, which dissipates most of the tensions of scenes that should be a highlight. One of Hess's motivations for style, and this is the typical justification for this problem, was to fear that the creature would appear to be humorous and / or fictional rather than frightening and suspenseful. In my opinion, presenting the audience with dizzying blur is not a satisfactory solution. We do not see the creature's costume / make-up until the end of the movie. It was good enough for better shot and mounted attack scenes to take the film to at least 9. 9. Whatever the degree of correspondence between the novel and the film, Watchers presents a captivating story. using intelligent and seductive characters. It's often a biting nail and the horror scenes are wilder than you would expect, if not just gore (though there is a lot of blood in some scenes). Observers tend to be underestimated because of misconceptions about the role of the film when it comes to adapting the literature - do not leave it or reject it in an abstract way based on an idea false.
