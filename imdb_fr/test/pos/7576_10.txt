Glenn Close is back as Sarah Plain and Tall, a woman who keeps a family together despite good and bad times. The acting is superb - Christopher Walken (exceptionally not phantasmagorical) since her husband delivers again a performance of the first order. It's good to see young Christopher Bell grow up; Too bad we did not see much Anna (Lexi Randall, also a few years old), but the new addition to the Witting family (played by Emily Osment) was very well received. And finally, Jack Palance, as long-lost patriarch Witting, is as beautiful as ever.
