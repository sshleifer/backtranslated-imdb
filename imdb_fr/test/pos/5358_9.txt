Wallace and Gromit are the main characters of some of the best cartoons ever made. The great mix of visual humor and clay makes "A Grand Day Out", "The Wrong Trousers" and "A Close Shave", one of the best animated pictures ever on television. Winner of several Oscars and many other awards, Nick Park has become a very popular man in the UK, but his impact on the United States has not been significant. After the third short film by Wallace and Gromit, there was all this speculation about a feature film by Wallace and Gromit, yet nothing had happened in years. Then, in 2000, instead of a feature film by Wallace and Gromit, we get Nick Park's other brilliant clay film, Chicken Run, which has been nominated for the best picture at the Academy Awards. It is perhaps the success of this film that finally pushed Park to finally work on a project of Wallace and Gromit. <br /> <br /> 5 years later (this kind of movie takes a long time, you know) and a lot of anticipation, Wallace and Gromit finally hit the big screen. Despite the rather weak trailers and marketing campaign, this film is keeping its promises in many ways. This film will be a delight for children and parents. Wallace and Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Bunny is one of the few films that is perfect for both children and adults. This rather difficult technique is the one that only Pixar has already developed and that DreamWorks has had a lot of trouble doing lately. Despite the DreamWorks logo on the poster, this film comes mainly from the very creative staff of Aardman Animations. <br /> <br /> Wallace and Gromit are the first to be seen running a business that protects the crops of city dwellers from ruins, which apparently had been racing around and in large numbers lately. Their business earned them the respect of the people of the city because a gigantic vegetable competition was rapidly approaching and the crops needed protection. Complications arise when Wallace tries to manipulate the rabbits so they do not appreciate the vegetables, then sets off an excellent eating machine in the area. It is up to Wallace and Gromit to find the gigantic animal and prevent it from gnawing through gardens and its approval by townspeople. To add to that, Wallace wants to impress Lady Tottington, who has also attracted the attention of a posh suitor named Victor. A simple plot, of course, but there's more to it than what you see, get ready for some fun surprises, like the other Wallace and Gromit cartoons. <br /> <br /> In animated films with little dialogue, it is the animation that must set the tone and mood of the film. Despite the fact that it only takes five years to produce 85 minutes of film, the gain is fantastic. There is a huge amount of detail that requires more than one visualization to be noticed. Even more incredible than the detailed and almost flawless animation is the truly unspeakable amount of visual humor put into the film. Whether it's a shot creatively placed or normal labels placed in the most funny position possible, or that it is the rabbits, so adorable, who are constantly shown in the film, the humor Curse of the Were-Rabbit comes mainly from watching the movie. himself and catch all the references before it's too late. Imagine the movie Madagascar, with the exception of fun references to pop culture and better animation. <br /> <br /> The casting was great, although in a little dialogue, it was not so important. Again, Peter Sallis does a fantastic job as Wallace, although in this movie there was no outstanding quote that could be used at any time (The Wrong Trousers: "It's the wrong Gromit pants and they went wrong! "). Ralph Fiennes does a great job as a villain, Victor and Helena Bonham Carter (nicknamed the main mad of the cult movie "Fight Club") lend him his lovely voice as she plays the role of Wallace's love. While nothing could match the final chase in "The Wrong Trousers," Curse of the Ware-Rabbit contained many action scenes, including a fantastic chase scene between Gromit and Victor's nasty dog. Finally, rabbits really steal the show at times. Whether it's their cute expressions, their funny moves or howling, the movie's bunnies even take part of the glory of the main stars. The funniest rabbit of the movie is the "cursed" rabbit itself. Until the end of the film, he made the audience laugh. <br /> <br /> In summary: Although not as memorable as "The Wrong Trousers", this film is as good and entertaining as Chicken Run.In contrast to almost every film that comes out this year, the The movie does not hang out at all, it's only 85 minutes long, but it's so much fun and fun that it will let everyone watch it for more, there's very little trouble with the movie; was a pure delight to watch.This film is a total contrast between raw, decent and vulgar, decent and vulgar films, which yielded a surprising amount of money earlier this year (40-year-old Virgin, Wedding Crashers and Sin City), as well as for families and those who want some harmless entertainment This is a good thing Highly recommended, this is the best animation movie of this year and one of the best we have seen this decade Wallace and Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit: A Pleasure r completely harmless from the second to the first 5.100 seconds.
