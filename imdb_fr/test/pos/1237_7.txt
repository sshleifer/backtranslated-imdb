Adapted from Sam Shepard's play, this film retains many elements of play, such as a relatively fixed frame (a 50s roadside motel in the Southwest) and extensive and intriguing dialogues. A "May" woman is hunted by a man "Eddie" (played by Sam Shepard). She tries to hide in the motel, but he finds her. The film explores the story of their relationship, mostly since their childhood, which led them to this point. It is very easy to feel sympathy for the characters and to understand that their current dysfunctional relationship is the result of past events beyond their control. We mainly watch them fighting, putting on makeup, fighting, putting on makeup, and so on. One of the images that comes to mind is Eddie holding May over her shoulder, kicking and screaming her, taking her somewhere she would not want to go to. a less known artist "Sandy Rogers". She has that country doll voice that almost sneers at certain moments of the album! This is the kind of movie that will stay in a part of your brain / soul. In other words, go see it!
