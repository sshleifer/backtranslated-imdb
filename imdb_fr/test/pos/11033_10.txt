This film is one of the best memories of my childhood. Having always loved tigers, my mother took me to see him. <br /> <br /> It's absolutely amazing. It's one of those movies that will leave you with a lasting impression. The image of tigers running in the snow with everything it sprays is still in my head for about 25 years, few films have succeeded. As other reviewers have said, the photography is beautiful. A must see. I am also looking for the film for a while, without any luck. :-( Check regularly on Amazon reveals nothing, not even on the list.If anyone knows a source, contact me or send a message here.
