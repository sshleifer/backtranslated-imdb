I remember seeing this movie when I was 13 and fell in love with it. I was a big fan of the movie and the characters I loved. My favorite character was Stacey (Heidi Holicker), because she made me laugh when she was not interested in Fred (Cameron Dye) who loved her so much and I hoped that in the end they would meet then her boring boyfriend , Ralphie (Christopher Murray) because he did not know and was hanging around with his friends. I like casting and story. I still like the role when Fred tries to get together with Stacey and I always remember when he chased her around the car. But it was so good. I will always remember cherishing this in my adolescence. Now that I'm 33 and I took my copy on DVD, I can not wait to see it.
