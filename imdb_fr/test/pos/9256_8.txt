This is the last episode we deserved. At the end of the last season, there was an atmosphere of "continuous life", which was far from being the summary that this realistic series deserved. Although this is not a happy series, this series has always made it think (something rare on television), and it is not an exception. "Is death justified by reasoning? "Does morality reflect society or is society shaped by the morality chosen by the few people in power?" "What is a just death and can it exist? All these questions, and many others, are asked every week by the writers of this show and this is their final thesis. Beautiful action game, beautiful writing, superb camera work, brilliant editing, clean direction. If you saw the show and missed it when it first aired, wait for a copy. If you have never watched the show when it aired, it will be all by itself, but it may be difficult to try to follow all the characters and what they refer to in their various pasts. For those of us who have been frequent viewers of the series over the past two seasons, this is a very satisfying viewing experience.
