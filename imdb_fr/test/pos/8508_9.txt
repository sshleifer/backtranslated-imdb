Yes, let's settle this before we start: * This is the one Sean Connery came back to in 1983 after we had Roger Moore. * This is Connery's latest movie. * And YES it's a (sort of) remake of Thunderball, but rather a movie inspired by it. If all of your Bond purists think I'm going to have controversy, you're right. Bond is one of the best movie series of all time, but that does not mean that a series should last forever. I think it's one of two movies where they could have done a huge service and ended the Bond saga. Not yet offended? Then I'll continue ... Hey, if you think I'm indifferent to Bond's movies, you're wrong. I grew up with my mother being obsessed with them. At any time, Bond and his antics would be on TV. The rules of the bonds, and 'Never Say Never Again' (directed by Irvin's 'Empire Strikes Back' Kershner) is one of the best. It may not be 'Goldfinger' or 'From Russia ...' and may not have been entrusted to the same production house as all the others (which is why they refuse to accept it !? But it's still standing head and shoulders above Brosnan's recent releases ... (if you did not spit on the screen, read on). CHARACTERIZATION!!!!! Something that so many blockbusters forget these days, but it's essential to tell a good story. "Never" played a superb hand by treating 007 as if he had aged since "Dr. No," he "gets along a bit" and so has to do things like go to a health farm - a direct order from "M" (!) Yes, if you have not seen this movie, I will not give too much information about the plot, because A) Charges occur and B) Obviously, I want you to see it yourself Do not be put off by my 'old Bond' revelation, Connery still has some great board pieces to charge, swim, hit, accelerate, smash and smudge.The man is a legend and this movie is one of his most enjoyable outings as a Bond.High tech gadgets galore, big bad guys and excellent secondary distribution (including a fantastic Rowan Atkinson cameo) raise this movie well above expectations of the public. <br /> <br /> It could have been Bond's last film and it would have been a party Remember, playing with the secret agent on the way to retirement was a refreshing stroke of genius - the last scene sums up things perfectly for the series ... ... but we always had more, and more, and more , and a more Moore. Nevertheless, if you want to know what "Fatima Blush" is, get this movie. Then you can at least claim that 007 spent his last moments as a sneaky secret agent, in the arms of Kim Basinger, and smiled at Mr. Bean. (P.S. * This other movie that I think could have finished everything? The serious "License to Kill"
