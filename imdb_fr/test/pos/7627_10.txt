The last dinosaur is a film that is fun and exciting. He managed to do both. <br /> <br /> Maston is a big game hunter who hunts big game. Owning a company, he plans to go on an expedition with a group of people, including a photographer named Frankie, a Japanese scientist, a company employee named Chuck and an African man who helped him on many safaris, Bun Ta. . The goal is to study what is thought to be Tyrannosaurus Rex, a dinosaur that killed the last expedition in the region. They will visit this prehistoric zone by taking a drill called Polar Bore. Once in the area, they quickly find the Tyrannosaurus, which Maston tries to shoot, but his weapon is blocked. Chuck immediately feels that Maston wants to hunt the dinosaur to add to his "Stuffed Animals" collection. While they were gone, Tyrannosaurus invaded their camp and kept the borer away from the palm tree. Upon his return, the group realizes that he may be in the area longer than expected and Maston declares that he will kill the Tyrannosaurus. <br /> <br /> The story is excellent for a sci-fi movie. Drilling in a prehistoric area is something that could really happen. The landscape is beautiful and it looks like a place where dinosaurs could still reside. <br /> <br /> I also liked the characters in this movie. Maston is the typical big hunter who wants to get everything that could kill a trophy. Bun Ta was also great. It was played by former NBA member Luther Rackley, who really looks like an African tracker. Jackie is the typical woman who poses problems to the group and does not seem to belong to nature. Chuck is the former Maston employee who sees his boss change when he is in the wild with him. <br /> <br /> The Tyrannosaurus of this movie is one of the best of a movie. He stands a little too high like Godzilla and he hangs his tail, so he's a guy in a suit. But the costume looks good, especially the head and tail, and the Tyrannosaurus is beautiful and very scary. I have seen many other movies where dinosaur costumes seem even worse. Tyrannosaurus in this film sometimes emits a roar that resembles that of Godzilla and other times, like King Kong's "King Kong Escapes" and "King Kong vs. Godzilla". SO a great Tyrannosaurus. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of action in The Last Dinosaur. It should be noted an excellent fight between Tyrannosaurus and Triceratops. Also a big scene where Bun Ta tries to launch the Tyrannosaurus. There are other great parts that I will not give. You must see for yourself. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to everyone. Look at it and you will not be disappointed.
