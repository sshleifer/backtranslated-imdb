It's a very strange series with Dean Learner. I really did not understand the guests. I knew they were not serious, but we did not really know if they really were them because ... I guess I'm just so stupid. I do not know if this is considered a spoiler, but the guests are not real like in Ali G or anything, they are played by one man or so I believe. I love the serious look he's wearing. It's like this program that was on a Sunday morning that I forgot the name of lol. I also love his costume and his mustache. It's pretty hot. He is insensitive, which is one of the funniest qualities. I also like the way it has sub-sections of the program. It makes you look more authentic.
