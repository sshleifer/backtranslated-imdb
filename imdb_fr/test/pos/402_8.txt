"Who-dun-it", better than the average of the Second World War, starring Warner Baxter, a former gangster suffering from amnesia and again a psychiatrist known as Robert Ordway, who helps both the police and the criminals to continue. Crime Doctor's Courage is the fourth in the series of ten and also involves a victim who could have mental problems. The link with "courage" is not particularly clear. <br /> <br /> This entry is about the death of Fortune hunter Gordon Carson, whose two women lived in mysterious circumstances and who died in a locked room that looked like a suicide. Dr. Ordway calls himself a murderer. Hillary Brooke plays the widow Kathleen Carson, involved in Anthony Caruso - a mysterious Spanish dancer whose act includes her sister who disappears on stage. As a mystery novelist, Jerome Cowan is a good actor in a supporting role, as is Lloyd Corrigan, who is a crime aficionado. <br /> <br /> Frightening houses with creaky doors, coffins in the cellar and suspects who have never been seen by day add to the air of suspense. The decor of the dance sequence is quite elaborate and the ballet music is very good. The staging, the production design and the photography stand out. Outdoor shots and costumes suggest greater wealth than is normally found in the average "B" crime thriller. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
