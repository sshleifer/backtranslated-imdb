"River's Edge" is a David Lynch-inspired film that tells the story of a group of teenagers who are aware of the murder committed by one of their friends, but no one has done anything for a long time. time. Thanks to the leading actors Crispin Glover and Dennis Hopper, we can forgive the average actors of this film. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a young boy, Tim (Joshua John Miller), who passes a doll from a bridge (murder # 1). Tim hears someone screaming. When he looks up, he sees Samson (Daniel Roebuck) standing on the bank of the river with the bare naked body of his girlfriend behind him (assassination # 2). Samson ends up showing the body to his friends. All are horrified, not only because of the murder, but also because the victim, Jamie (Danyi Deats), was a friend of theirs. Despite all this, no one goes to the police. You may think it's unrealistic, but that's what happened in the real story. If you know the story of Alpha Dog (2006), you'll know the same thing happened there. Through all this, Layne (Crispin Glover) is working to protect Samson, although no one (including Samson) seems to care about keeping him safe. Over time, we learn that Feck (Dennis Hopper), a middle-aged man who sells drugs to local teenagers, has already killed a woman before (murder # 3). From there, things start to get closer to Samson and his friends and eventually everything is revealed, but not as you would like. <br /> <br /> In the film, we learn three murders, each with a reason, a different reaction and a different effect on the people involved. When Tim drops his younger sister's doll from the bridge, we are never informed of her motives. However, we see the reaction of the younger sister. She cries and screams while her mother consoles her. Later, his older brother, Matt (Keanu Reeves), helps him to put a cross in the yard in memory of his doll. The murder of Jamie is a horror for everyone (except Samson who is indifferent to the whole situation and when Layne asks him why he did it, Samson answers: "She was talking shit"), but they do not sob not and do not scream, run away and continue their lives trying to forget what had happened. In Feck's situation, he did not kill his girlfriend out of hatred. We never really know why he killed her, but we can see that Feck is not proud of what he did. He even mentions that he is sorry and that she loved him. From there we see the different ways in which we can be touched by death. In the film, it's easy for us to identify with teenagers because they do not know how they feel, or what they should feel about the death of their friend. In the same way, we, the audience, do not know how to feel, because we do not know Jamie. We are obviously saddened by the death and realize that Samson should be arrested, but we are not very attached to Jamie as an individual. <br /> <br /> There are several similarities between "River's Edge" and "Twin Peaks". (1990-1991), especially in the general atmosphere of the film. I wonder if Mark Frost and David Lynch were thinking of "River's Edge" when creating their series. After all, Tim Hunter directed three episodes of "Twin Peaks". <br /> <br /> Crispin Glover's performance as hyperactive and unrestrained Layne is an Oscar-winning performance. Always in a hurry and always anxious to prevent Samson from being caught, Layne is an intense character who seems to be at the speed. If you've seen Crispin Glover in any movie, you know it can provide a line like no other. It's always a pleasure to watch him play. The other great performance of "River's Edge" is Dennis Hopper. His portrayal of Feck, the locked drug dealer with one leg and an inflatable doll he's talking to, named Elly, reminded me of a softer, more humorous version of Frank Booth, the character of Hopper in David's movie Lynch, "Blue Velvet" (1986). <br /> <br /> River's Edge is an excellent film and I think it shows us how easy it is to be apathetic when in reality we have to intervene and denounce the evils of the world.
