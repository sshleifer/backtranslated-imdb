What you saw in BULLITT and THE FRENCH CONNECTION is nothing compared to what you have here. The chase lasts about 15 minutes and is the best you can see. This film has become a classic crime drama of the heyday of the filmmaking of the 70s. It is a realistic and realistic portrait of the streets of New York. Featuring one of the wisest guys ever on the screen, Tony Lo Bianco's behavior in this film is cool like ice cream. He scams his own associates and suggests that the police are responsible. His childhood friend, Roy Scheider, is a street detective who is astonished at the disappearances of the underworld. You can say that Lo Bianco enjoys the game throughout the film. Sometimes, however, the film becomes dull, but when you want to give it up, something important happens that takes you inside. Don Ellis's score sets the tone for New York's cold gray winter and, to top it off, my man, Joe Spinell, appears in a leading role as Toredano, the garage mechanic. <br /> <br /> Score, 7 stars out of 10
