and I think it's a good thing. I have never been a fan of Rosalind Russell, although the original was my favorite RR movie. But I love Bette and I was glad to hear that. <br /> <br /> As for the rest of the production, I think it was a little less than the original movie. Mazeppa was one of my favorite minor characters in the original. His raspy voice on the blackboard slammed, "HEY, it takes a lot more than no talent to be a strippah!" and although I miss it, I was happy to see that the producers had the courage not to make carbon copies. <br /> <br /> I also liked the fact that large parts of this movie were shot as if you were Watching a scene, it feels like you're at the theater, not just at the movies. <br /> <br /> I also think that what I liked in this production is that there seems to be a little less repetition of the song "Let me entertain you", which becomes completely annoying after about the fifth time you hear it.
