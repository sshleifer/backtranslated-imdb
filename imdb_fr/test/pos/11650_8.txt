It was the most stimulating film on capital punishment in history! He refused to appear unilateral and the emotions felt during the story are as real as possible. This movie had one of the most religious (and I use that term in a good way) a compassionate religious character of all time! This film made me go out to find and read the book (which is rare for me). Sister Helen exercised a spiritual rather than a religious tone (which is also rare). And he introduced both sides to the question so that people on both sides who watched the movie did not feel that one point was left out. And we have to thank the director for that. This is not an entertainment movie. But it's a film that conveys a message that can reach the heart of your heart. I can not think of another film like this.
