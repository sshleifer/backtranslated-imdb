After watching the premiere of Talk Show with Spike Feresten, I took a moment to really think: wow, there are good shows after 12 other than SNL and I was also sad to see that it only lasted 30 minutes. His great writing skills have helped this show overcome a series of shortages of money and help. Electronic Lincoln was hilarious and I really think it will be a good Dark Horse talk show. <br /> <br /> I am very happy with the way he handled the situation and gave Andy Richtor good lines in which to work. As you suspected, it was a bit fragile, but for this type of time slot, it was very good. <br /> <br /> All in all, if you are not someone who likes weeds or even if you are and you do not have something more important to do than look at this superb play and have fun doing it.
