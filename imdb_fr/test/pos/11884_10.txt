This film is a good example of why the Shaw Brothers are among the best directors (probably the best in the Kung Fu category). The film is well paced, the story is excellent and intriguing, and although the humor may not be in your face, it is nested in the interactions of the characters. Once the story is built and the characters begin to assess the situation, the entire tower collapses into one of the best fight scenes (the Hung Gar tiger, crane and crab are very present). There is even a scene that mocks Western social events of the 18th century and ends with intelligent and entertaining fights. The film ends with a moment of surprise, but if you're a Shaw Brothers fan, you'll understand that cheese is just a garnish and not the main course of the movie.
