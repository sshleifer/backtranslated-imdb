Like NIGHT STALKER, then X-FILES, the series sets up a fantastic situation and the main characters have to solve the problem. Unlike these, the heroes did not stay with an empty bag at the end. They usually had tangible results. It was also pointed out that the "good guys" were in a dirty profession and sometimes had to pull off unpleasant things. Imagination, spirit, acting that does not always take very seriously ... I miss it. One of the reasons is that I have a hard time thinking about too many programs - aside from BANACEK - which has been very successful in catching the viewers and getting their attention right off the bat. Writers excelled in creating extremely improbable, even downright impossible situations, to which the characters had to find an explanation. explanations that often took 90 degrees turned to the unexpected but still made sense. In addition, I agree with another reviewer that Anabelle's character was a little underused, but when she was on screen, it was not just for the pleasure of the eyes. She was quite competent and stood up to both men when she realized that her argument justified it. A rarity at this time. Sullivan? If he was not in the department, he would work for the KGB or the CIA. He is that kind of cold-efficient, ruthless guy. He knows how the world works and realizes what needs to be done to get the job done. King? It's clearly a game for him. The one where he excels and for which he discusses ideas for detective / spy novels, which he writes as his "real" ostensible work. It is probably the most fun to watch a three, although they have all their moments and often too. I agree that the eventual derivative series featuring only his character lacked the interest of the original.
