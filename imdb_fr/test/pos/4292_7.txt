An old man rides a bike on a village road when a car comes out of nowhere, hits it dead and keeps driving. The rest of the film is dedicated to finding out who hit him, why he was touched and what consequences this murder will have on the rest of the village. Separate Lies is a very British movie. I do not say that car crime is a particularly British phenomenon, but everyone's reaction to this tragedy is very British. Tom Wilkinson plays James Manning, a hardworking and respectable citizen who has a "stiff on the upper lip" attitude to tragedy. His wife Anne (Emily Watson), who is twenty years younger than her husband, is more emotional, more impulsive and more prone to drama. <br /> <br /> The man who really spices life in this sleepy village is playboy billionaire William Bule, played by a deliciously devilish Rupert Everett (the American public will always remember him as the Julia Roberts' gay friend who completely stole all the scenes from My Best Friend's wedding). In Separate Lies, Everett is cruel, cold and selfish, but he is an absolute blast on the screen. No, it's not exciting to have a movie title (Separate Lies?) How did they end up with that lame, forgettable title? Did not they just have a marketing team? they now make sure that people see this movie?), but beyond the title, there is a heartbreaking drama about the power of forgiveness.
