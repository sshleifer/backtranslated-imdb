A man arrives in a strange, beautiful and sterile city where no one feels any emotion and is no longer passionate about interior architecture. The essential resemblance of his days is reminiscent of "the day of the marmot"; the strange passages inside and outside this world are more reminiscent of "being John Malkovich". But, in reality, it's a Scandinavian film, a satire of self that also has a Scandinavian style: the tone is austere and even the most fantastic scenes are played right, which allows you to laugh at the absurdity. In my opinion, the combination is not quite a success: there is not enough sincere laughter to offset the difficulties of taking the drama as a pure drama. It's certainly original. My problem is perhaps that the world that is satirizing him is not the one I recognize. Maybe I should go to Scandanavia!
