I saw this movie for the first time in the early 90's and immediately fell in love with it. Eric Benjamin and his wife Paula shot the 1981 movie "Saturday 14" in 1981 before shooting it in 1983. I think they work pretty well together, this movie made me laugh a few times. He also has a young molly ringwald, who will go later in the late 1980s to make movies like Pretty in Pink and Sixteen Candles. It is amusing to look at her a little younger. not seen by many people..I do not even think that the average movie fan has ever heard of this movie.But when I stumbled upon it, I was glad I did. I gave this film 10 out of 10 stars as I think is a fun movie that the whole family can enjoy. Finally, I would like to say that it is not available on DVD, so I bought a VHS copy on eBay, so if you're interested, you can probably find one on this one. From $ 20 to $ 30, but I got myself for $ 12. I wish they published this DVD.
