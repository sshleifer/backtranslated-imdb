One of the most sublime American masterpieces, Morrissey opens the film by sexualizing Dallesandro, mouth open snoring on a pillow. We wonder, has he just taken heroin? We just see her face, then, flash, her body, flash, her naked back. I can not think of another film that used this form of flash-blip editing so well to create a hypnotic and drugged atmosphere, a montage method that works both as a stimulus and a style. After this introduction, when Dallesandro opens his mouth, his accent is discordant - we expect him to be a kind of androgynous with a soft voice; instead, he has the voice of a street thug - Morrissey is uncomfortable to let our assumptions go unchecked. The long opening is very sexy and playful - it's a combination of martial disturbances, fascinating Dallesandro kissing lips, and morning sexual surges; everything is fine together, if not always harmoniously, then emotionally realistic. <br /> <br /> What I drew from this is identical to the one I got from "Les 400 coups" when I saw it for the first time - this is like a sequel to a twenty years of this story. There is a sense of camaraderie between the flesh sellers and the buyers; When Dallesandro walks down the street in search of men (to finance the abortion of his wife), one feels the feeling of a secret handshake while the boys make agreements with each other. I've never found that boring, even if nothing happens - nothing happens brilliantly, the boys hang around like they do, waiting for turns. The main thing that Dallesandro discovers is fascinating to look at, using Greek descriptions and touching only his back, a form of aesthetic worship of the body on the part of man. It's also terribly funny ("I do not talk to an empty bed, do I?"). This is one of the most revealing scenes in the film - in any movie, I think; certainly any film dealing with sex and sex for sale. When Dallesandro's eyes look red and swollen, we can not tell if it's because he's drunk, ashamed, embarrassed or anything. <br /> <br /> The conversations in the film are cut off - it does not matter. (The film is silent in some of the most poignant and beautiful scenes you can ever experience.) Yet when Morrissey chooses to include one, the way he includes it (we copy it somehow), it's surprising, like a conversation between Dallesandro and a beginner - and none of them ever mentioned the word "gay" or "hustler". What follows is a scene where we listen to a pair of transvestites while Dallesandro is repaired - this is just after explaining to the beginner that he "gets used to" work. <br /> <br /> Dallesandro is a subject worthy of attention. paid to him, both by his clients and Morrissey. He is less than effective as an actor, in the sense of acting as an interpreter, but until he reveals something that is incredible - it's someone we want to immediately feel but we go through his experiences, with all their complexities, and we're forced to try to know him. It's the kind of blank slate that catches our attention, but fails to hold up. And of course, it's incredibly striking - forgetting everything else, it's a testament to the beauty of the male body, Dallesandro's beautiful torso and permanently erect nipples. <br /> <br /> The film has a devastating scene, but all you can not control otherwise - a girl says she was raped, and her only self-defense is to say that if the rapist had only asked to have sex, had courted her, he would have got a better layman. It's upsetting. The film has feelings for everyone, but even better than that, it's not just nice, it's actually trying to help us understand human beings - and never dictate what we're supposed to understand. He does not despise or glorify the characters in the film. It's a feeling of inclusion when you see Joe's arm around a transvestite. When he reads a letter (he talks about not having passed the eighth grade at a given moment), he is quite charming, while he stops on a word ... then says "woteva" and continues . <br /> <br /> You can learn something deeper from the interaction between Dallesandro and one of his clients in terms of heterosexual relationships than any case study. Here we have the boy who smiles (his upper lip disappears as he does) when a veteran of about thirty years, a gymnastic bunny, runs his hand through his hair; it's a scene that seems very deep, this adult man sharing something with a younger version of himself - it's not two homosexual men together, or a homosexual man paying a straight man, it's something other than you can not put your finger on; sexuality issues are off topic. (Never before had a pimple been so affectionate.) After sharing something emotionally (though with Dallesandro, since he's here for the money, you never see why he's here; he is never sincere, which is perhaps his most disarming quality), "So ... can you help me?" The man says well. "I'm not talking about my pants!" 10/10
