It was the film that finally pushed me to register with IMDb so that I could vote for (and comment on) this one. I only very recently enjoy the well-produced "war" movies, and it's one of the most thoughtful I've seen. <br /> <br /> "Amazing" is the word that comes to mind when I think of this visual experience. My husband and I watched this movie last night for the first time. It moves slowly while being exciting at the same time (it is not a contradiction). This story in the hands of Hollywood could have become another time waster in Top Gun, action packed. <br /> <br /> The two main actors who play Frantisek and Karel have done wonderfully well; and Krystof Hadek is a very "pretty" boy without seeming to exaggerate or exploit this fact. Regarding Hadek's ability and appearance, my husband said (tongue-in-cheek), "Well, it's not Tom Cruise." I replied, "Thank God!" If you enjoy the beautiful and sober game, see this one.
