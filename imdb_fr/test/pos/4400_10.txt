Having seen most of the previous films of the Coen brothers, I was expecting something different and slightly off-center. OBWAT is certainly those things, but he also has a big heart like ... well ... big like the Mississippi. This is one of the most enjoyable films to appear in recent years, intelligent, well-designed, intelligent and superbly interpreted. <br /> <br /> The characters are delivered in their multiple hues by a group of wonderful actors. George Clooney convinced me completely with his look and his Clark Gable-ish character. After only seeing him in Three Kings and his cameo Thin Red Line, I am now a fan. More comedy please, George. <br /> <br /> John Tuturro and Tim Blake Nelson, Nelson's assistants. If ever "The Simpsons" is turned into a movie, then it must be natural to play Cletus, the lazy manna. I do not think there is a performance that is not excellent on the part of the cast. My favorite is Stephen Root, blind in the radio station. <br /> <br /> An excellent traditional music, a Clooney jiggy dance that I'm trying to learn and a feeling of depression from the southern United States reinforced by Sepia Photography makes it the best movie I've ever seen. have seen so far this century. The only drawback of this film is that it almost sent me to buy the soundtrack, the DVD and a DVD player to read it ... it's so good! <br /> <br />
