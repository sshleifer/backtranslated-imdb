I just saw this movie for the second time with my 8 year old daughter and I remembered why we loved it the first time. All those people who say that it is bad are too critical and tense! It's just a little entertaining film, it's not supposed to change the world. I thought all the actors had done a good job with their characters. (Except for Jeremy Jordan as a guy - it was a fly that seemed seriously in need of soap and shampoo.) If HE is supposed to be the sexy dude of their school, then they have thin loaves.

Molly Shannon is always entertaining and Leelee Sobieski did a great job as Some parts were really painful to watch, reminding me of high school, although luckily I did not make fun of myself, it made me feel bad for those who did it, movies like this are really My daughter made several comments about the cruelty of some students and the fact that it was wrong, this film is good for everyone and a good way to spend 2 hours. vou I want to see a little light film with a happy ending and for which you do not have to think much, so that's really a consideration.
