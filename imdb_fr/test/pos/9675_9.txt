> This show is the biggest thing out of America since the> Simpsons. Not only does he have thousands of new ideas, but he is controversial (see the Jewish joke, season 1, episode 1) and he is not afraid to "uncheck" people. However, the great minds of Fox have canceled it, as well as Greg the Bunny and Futurama, so be sure to buy the Season 1> box while you still can. It will be the best money you have ever spent. It's definitely a show that gets better as you watch it, because at the beginning, constant flashbacks can become a bit awkward and do not always seem to fit the story. However, after a few episodes, you realize how brilliant it is, and how much it compares to any other program currently being broadcast.
