My wife and I watched this wonderful movie tonight because we will watch Russian dolls tomorrow and the first is important to watch before the second. <br /> <br /> We both loved the Spaniah apartment and we will be happy to follow certain characters. through the first years of their lives - now in St. Pertersburg, Russia. We were both slightly identified with the rough frame of the story because we were students, Florence Italy for us, so the screenplay was not completely foreign to our early lives. Our life was vastly different, but as in this film, every time you associate young people who are going through the same stages of life as all the people in the developed world, they will experience just about the same situations in life. <br /> <br /> The collection of people and the personal difficulties they encountered were universal and that is where lies the beauty of this film and probably its sequence that I will see tomorrow. As I was writing, the characters and situations are all familiar to us so we can enjoy living their lives for a while. This must be one of the great strengths of the film: to allow the spectator to live vicariously the emotional upheavals of the people involved while staying away. The spectator can, through this distance, make fun of himself by saying: "I would not have done something so stupid" or "I would have avoided this trap". Maybe that's why we go to the movies.
