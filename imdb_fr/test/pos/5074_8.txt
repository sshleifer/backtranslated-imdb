Consider this as an extreme form of detention without trial. Without commenting and taking sides with US foreign policy, the process of "extraordinary rendition" is to bring people suspected of terrorist activities to a foreign country, as opposed to extradition if you so wish. a place where torture is not a crime, but a means. unlawful information. Instead of dying the ground with the blood of potentially innocent parties, you do it on foreign lands where such tactics are accepted interrogation techniques. <br /> <br /> Of course, given the severity of a person's tactics and attempts to destroy, sometimes you get what you want once you've overcome resistance, or nothing, or worse yet, a confession simply because your mind has been broken to the point that the subject will agree with everything you say. It's an ugly process, and what better way to do it when you're the champion of human rights, allowing you to use whatever means you need to protect more lives, at a time when information is key to the fight against terrorism, and to do so in a country where the record of rights is probably debatable. <br /> <br /> The rendering is Syriana this year, although, in the perspective of the new year, we have a number of political thriller candidates to win this crown. , with Rendition First, followed by Robert Redford's Lions for Lambs, with Tom Cruise and Meryl Streep (again, but on the other side of the fence), and The Kingdom with Jamie Foxx and Jennifer Garner, well that it would probably be more action-oriented. Directed by Gavin Hood, who played at Tsotsi and will lead the new spin-off of Wolverine, Rendition is a decent thriller with a first-rate cast, in a story that has proven itself: the separation, which offers many differences Anwar El-Ibrahimi (Omar Metwally), a chemical engineer, is on his way home from Corrine Whitman (Meryl Streep), the highest-ranking CIA company. . In a detention center outside the United States, Douglas Freeman (oh so prophetic) of the CIA analyst at Jake Gyllenhaal embarks on his first-ever interrogation, no doubt in a position he is not is not registered. Back home, a very pregnant woman, Reese Whitherspoon, searches frantically for answers to the disappearance of her husband and seeks the assistance of ex-flame, Alan Smith (Peter Sarsgaard), since he works for Senator Hawkins ( Alan Arkin). Throwing in J.K. Sinmmons, an investigation into a terrorist plot and a nascent forbidden love story between Fatima (Zineb Oukach) and Khalid (Moa Khouas), you have plenty to do in a busy photo. <br /> <br /> Given many shots, places, delays and other similar elements, Rendition has not at all confused, and it is a clever manipulation of the material, never quick to judge, which presents ideas and ideas from both sides of the equation. Each character has his own agenda and the unveiling of this agenda commits enough to not annoy you or confuse you. And the best part of all this is how, really, they bend to self-preservation in different forms, and ultimately, in various loss-at-loss situations, unfortunately. It also left you guessing - did he do it or not, and did he constantly play with your mind to know if Anwar deserved what he was getting. He used an extremely clever trick that I did not see happen until it was too late (that's the credit that ensues), although he succumbed to the usual stereotypes of terrorist activists and without spending a lot of time to explore their motivations. . <br /> <br /> Perhaps it has not found the need, given the number of films already touching on this subject (Paradise Now, Day Night, Night, Syriana same). Although it turned out to be rather one-dimensional (a personal tragedy of attaching bombs to become a suicide bomber), I felt that Rendition was right to provide no sweet and sweet end, that this fight against a negative and destructive ideology would is not something special. This can be tackled in a two-hour film, and I'm glad it helped to avoid such improbabilities in fairy tales. <br /> <br /> What we have instead is a well-crafted narrative that lays the groundwork for rendering, and is likely to spark discussion once the lights come on at which camp do you belong - do you support sustaining intense pain during interrogation? Yes or no? This is the quintessential question of our time. Yes or no? (OK, I'm already ready for Lions against lambs!)
