OK ... it's time for a joke I think. It's been two years since I submitted my original comments by renting this very popular football comedy ... and the damn thing has still not been converted to video or DVD (or even repeated on TV!). !) !!!!! <br /> <br /> Does anyone know why not? Was there a BBC error in which the original copy was deleted / lost / deleted? <br /> <br /> Listen well to ITV - put it back in DVD now !!! Do you even know how funny this program was? "Mike Bassett" looks as bad as the current Spurs team. <br /> <br /> Rant over. For the time being.
