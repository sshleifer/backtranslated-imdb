I must say that some of the other critics of this film I read show very little understanding of this one or the original TV series from which it came. Dad's army was a sitcom and therefore had a sense of humor and is therefore forced to put a smile on the face of the dire situation. However, the series contained many serious messages such as the 'Branded' episode about fanaticism and ignorance attached to conscientious objectors. The film was faithful to the series and just looked like a prolonged episode. So I'm afraid the critic who claimed that Columbia was improving humor was absolutely wrong and let's face it - the BBC sitcoms of that period beat everything that came out of America. Moreover, the comments referring to the propaganda were completely irrelevant. Homeguards were people considered to be unfit for front-line service who still wanted to serve. They were very courageous men who knew that they had been sentenced to death as soon as they registered because Hitler had announced that all who would do it would be executed if Great Britain was invaded. Thank you for allowing me to make things clear, because it is always good to talk and comment on what has been seen rather than to go back as and when, I think.
