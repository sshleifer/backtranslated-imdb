I have to watch this film in my French class as part of "French culture". I thought the way the film was filmed and the editing was really good, but mostly it was entertaining, especially the guy who played Wendy's brother. The scenario was also very good, credible and adventurous. <br /> <br /> Favorite Part: When William makes fun of German studying and how he reproduces flies! :) <br /> <br /> My French is not very good but with the subtitles, I could very well understand what was happening. <br /> <br /> SEE!
