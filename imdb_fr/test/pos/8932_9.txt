I saw this movie on a Sunday night and I must say there is no better way to end the weekend. I am totally satisfied with the humor and the warm charm of this film. It just leaves me in a good mood. To watch this film is to have a good time and keep a feeling of warmth. <br /> <br /> The film offers a very bright black and British humor and a feeling of freshness for me. You really like the story and the characters. Brenda Blethyn is so great. I do not know exactly why. She is too old to be in love with me and too young to be my mother. But I feel really comfortable when she appears in the movie. <br /> <br /> Some may say that the story was lean and predictable. But who cares? There must be a happy ending, dancing in the sun! Are the characters stereotypes or cutouts? I do not know better I do not care! I just loved them and loved to watch them. <br /> <br /> In addition, I must say that I do not usually like romantic comedies. But this one is remarkable: a black comedy with a heart of gold !!
