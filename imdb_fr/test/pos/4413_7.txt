Snap, crackle, pop! The discordant sound of each change of angle of the camera. Not to mention white lightning and cut ends of almost all spoken sentences. What were they doing in the editing room? Or could it be that this approach was intentional? Surely not. What can it serve? Despite all its technical shortcomings, this is an interesting movie about a day in the life of Joe, a hustler, determined to earn $ 200 for his wife's pregnant girlfriend. Joe Dallesandro is remarkable as a relaxed, passive and laid-back young man, ready to let his interlocutor speak while he listens with a distant look in his eyes. <br /> <br /> The story is lean and fragmentary and reflects the uncertain life of a man who relies on casual street sex to support his young wife and baby. One thing is certain, Joe is not prevented from undressing for sex or posing for an artist. This is understandable because he has a beautiful face and a body just as beautiful. <br /> <br /> There is a scene in the movie that is remarkably effective. There is no sound, no dialogue. Joe Stark Naked is squatting on the floor feeding his little baby with cake crumbs. There is a beautiful serenity and tenderness captured in these quiet moments. <br /> <br /> Another scene of fun interest is one in which Joe desperately asks for a $ 100 loan to a gym friend, coming to the point of asking for a very diverted approach. <br /> <br /> Joe tries to seem interested, but hesitates in his conversation when an artist gives him a non-stop summary of Greek and Roman art. This is a preliminary for another occasion when Joe undresses and presents himself as the disc launcher in a true classic style. <br /> <br /> At the end of the movie, we feel like we've gotten to know Joe well. After all, he discovered more than his soul.
