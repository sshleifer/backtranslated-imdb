I loved this film. Beautiful realistic battle pictures for a touching and authentic story and thing. The serene and discreet manner of the main character, Franta, makes him very friendly. The human relations in the story seemed so typical and possible of what one could expect in wartime. The link between Franta and Carel shows the loyalty that war comrades can have for each other and this is often described in books and interviews with veterans. The subtitles do not detract from history and actually serve to highlight the problems that Czech pilots had in the RAF. The post-war narrative recalls that for many, the suffering of the Second World War did not stop in 1945, especially in the countries occupied by Russia. Cinematography was also very good. I wish I could see it on the big screen.
