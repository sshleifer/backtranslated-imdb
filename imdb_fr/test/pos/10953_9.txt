slow but intelligent movement. you pass as if you had lived. filled with ideas provoking the art race Ideas and being cool. What strikes me the most is the ideas about the rock'n'roll lifestyle. <br /> <br /> all performances have been improvised, I repeat. ALL PERFORMANCES ARE IMPROVISED, it sounds like a gadget, but that's not what makes these characters real and similar to those with which you are hooked. It's also an amazing thing when you think about the strength of the character in this movie. from the beginning of the sequence of titles, he immediately established Ben as an outcast by his way of moving in the crowd. <br /> <br /> Ok, it breaks down if you are a person who lives the jazz / rocker lifestyle of cool you will like that if you are smart and understand the good cinema of total crap you will like it and if you are both then it could be your favorite <br /> <br /> but if you have none, then you will probably think it's boring and say it does not follow "a line "and write a shitty review like Ben_Cheshire
