I remember the release of this movie and I watched it several times in VHS. I was so happy when it was finally released on DVD. I was hoping for a widescreen, but when I wanted, I would take what was available. I like the way they used color in the movie, the outdoor scenes are so alive with the color. The trees are the greenest I have ever seen. Most of the film was shot in Stillwater, Minnesota, a beautiful city on the St. Croix River. They must have really spotted the filming locations because they did a great job. The story is well written and directed. I would say it's one of Peter Horton's best. I am also surprised that Andrew Dintenfass (the director of photography) did not do more. He did an incredible job. Interim play also notes up there. It's amazing to see two actors from such a young age release this type of film. Annabella Sciorra did a great job as a mother of Dexter. Who would not want her as a mother?
