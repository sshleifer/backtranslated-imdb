Isabelle Huppert represents a talented piano teacher, posed, unfriendly and distant in public, and bitter towards her students. In private, she is invaded by violence and frustration and her sex life is lonely and perverse. She lives with her domineering mother, who obsessively pushes her to be noticed (and thus to progress in life) as a talented pianist. The key to the characters of mother and daughter is "obsession". These characters can no longer change their impulses more than a rabbit caught by the headlights can not avoid death. <br /> <br /> The piano teacher meets a young, attractive and talented pianist who attracts him from the beginning. They establish a relationship in the most unconventional way, but from the start, it expresses perverse and violent terms that it must inflict on it, which makes it sick enough to want to end the relationship before it is really started. > The film binds to the main female role. Isabelle Huppert surprises with a brutal and totally convincing performance as a piano teacher. She deftly shows a woman attracted by beauty and perversion, but her violence is nourished by her perverse drives. As such a character-oriented movie, you know it would not work as well if it did not work. <br /> <br /> It's powerful, intelligently played and intelligently and sensitively, adapted from the novel. The camera work is also suitable for the film. There is what I can only think of calling, shots in which the director holds a scene and forces the gaze to wander. This is done extremely effectively against a blank bathroom wall and demonstrates the mastery of the director. <br /> <br /> Expect to be disturbed and disgusted by this film. But, be brave - have the courage to go see him. It's a very private look at a person's life, but do not expect to be entertained in the Hollywood sense ... there's no car chase in this movie!
