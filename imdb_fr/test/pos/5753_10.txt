My God, it's funny. Yes, it's childish in the extreme, but also quite spiritual ("Here's the page with all the wines on it." "It's a little early for us, I'm afraid.") And the sequences of fight are incomparable. Despite what you've heard, the laughter continues at a surprisingly generous pace. The comical abilities of Rik Mayall and Adrian Edmondson help keep the movie completely funny. wipe every drop of comedy from the script. I can only compare this to "Fear and Disgust in Las Vegas" - you find this hysterical film end to end or not at all; the same thing applies here. It's probably the funniest British movie since "Withnail and I", but saying it's an acquired taste is a euphemism.
