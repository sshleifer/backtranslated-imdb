With an opening segment that mimics the music and cinematography of Todd Haynes' Safe (1995), David Lynch uses the dream, the myth and distorted notions of reality to tell the fractured story of an actress / waitress. Missing Hollywood, Diane Selwyn, by fame and her own demons and obsessed by Camilla Rhodes, fianc√©e by renowned director Adam Kesher. <br /> <br /> The film actually takes place in Diane's drugged head; we are witnessing his crazy distortions, his achievements, his regrets, his obsessions and his fears. Using the dream narrative as a way to present two notions of conflicting reality, Lynch does not simplify the opposition between reality and fantasy, but actively entangles them. The last 45 minutes are as dreamlike as before. and the disturbing atmosphere of detached ambiguity and another world still reigns, breaking the seemingly secure distinction between reality and dream that we expect to see in films about nightmares and dreams. <br /> Lynch's film borrows from many old and new films, but is ultimately a one-of-a-kind film with the exception of the director's Lost Highway and Blue Velvet. It constantly invites the viewer to interpret what is seen, not only intuitively but also intellectually. Still, it's not as pretentious as one could have imagined because Lynch makes us sympathize with the protagonist despite his murderous deeds - something that was lacking in all his other films except Straight Story . He does so by presenting Diane's dream alter-ego, Betty, as a Canadian farm girl in good health and destined for fame. Lynch also presents an intriguing story that affirms and negates the same way. Are Camilla and Diane really lovers or just friends? Who is the blue lady? What does it mean? Who is behind Winkies? What is the meaning of the decaying corpse at Sierra Bonita? Does Aunt Ruth really exist? Is silence an abstraction of hell or perhaps a self-referential interpretation of the fictional status of the film? Lynch is not ready to answer all the questions she asks, but instead chooses to present her "love story in the city of dreams" in the form of a set of interrelated abstractions and motifs. <br /> <br /> The acting is excellent, especially Naomi Watts as Diane Selwyn / Betty, who has yet to overshadow this performance. Laura Harring has the essential Hayworthesque charm as Camilla / Rita, while Adam Theroux in Adam brings unbridled arrogance and paranoid aggression sublimated to her role. It was amazing and a serious injustice that none of them was even nominated for an Academy Award. <br /> <br /> It's a film that needs to be seen and analyzed closely. The mystery at the heart of the film remains in the hands of Lynch, but the only fun is to find coherent ideas in the labyrinth of apparent incongruities he presents. On closer inspection, we discover a puzzle, perhaps even an incomplete puzzle that teases us with closure, but denies the imaginary fullness of narrative coherence. In the end, this is Lynch's key movie.
