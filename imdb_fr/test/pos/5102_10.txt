I saw this film when it came out and I did not know what to expect exactly. What followed the Opening was one of the most enjoyable experiences I've had in the movies. A lush score of songs and music by Briton Leslie Bricusse (of Dr. Doolittle & Wilie Wonka and the glory of the Chocolate Factory, which has also left its mark on the Broadway music scene), performed by the incomparable John Williams . There is not a bad song in the whole movie. In addition to the most exquisite filming locations I have ever seen in a movie. Not to mention the performance of Peter O'Toole, Oscar nominee, and the performance just as strong, in my opinion, the wonderful Petula Clark. Now, since Peter is not of the same caliber as Petula, he still manages to sell his songs to the public and that's after all. This is a faithful adaptation of James Hilton's excellent book, which deserves to be preserved for future generations. I recommend this film to the family, although most men consider it a "chick" movie. But if you like a very good musical, then this movie is for you. But know that a box of Kleenex standby is just as important as popcorn for your enjoyment.
