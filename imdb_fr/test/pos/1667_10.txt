To get a job like this in Rififi (for example, The Score and his opinions), you have to have nerves of steel. This one requires it and apparently commands it. Jules Dassin is the master. <br /> <br /> I was always on the edge of my seat. It deserves to be better known, even if it was not at the time of its release in 1954, because, supposedly, the director was on the blacklist of the Hollywood hypocrite of his time. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this film to anyone who does not have the pleasure of seeing it. <br /> <br /> I can not give him enough stars.
