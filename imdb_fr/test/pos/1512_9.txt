Fulci is one of my favorite Italian directors splashing. He is also a very good storyteller mixing horror, supernatural and psychedelic themes. This film was really his last big story before making disappointments such as "Voices From Beyond". The story is simple since Fulci himself plays a horror director. After years of filming splattering and bloody films, it seems that Fulci is beginning to suffer a crisis in which he begins to hallucinate about the massacre of people. He decides to see a psychiatrist who only aggravates the situation when he convinces Fulci that he is killing people. <br /> <br /> Fulci used scenes from several pictures at about the same time. I do not think he made these films, but certainly produced them. Some of these films are "Massacre" directed by Andrea Bianchi (Graveyard), "Touch of Death" directed by Fulci, "The Murders Secret" and I can not remember the rest of the movies. <br /> <br /> Nightmare Concert is a very underrated movie, even by Fulci fans. But I loved this movie and have seen it many times before. It's unfortunate that Fulci did not have the chance to do something worthwhile, but it's still a good movie and I recommend it to all fans of Fulci, whether they like it or not. 9/10 stars
