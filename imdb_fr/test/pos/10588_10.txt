The movie was fantastic. If you're a fan of cky videos from Bams, Jackass or his show Viva la Bam, you can not help but love him. I have some friends who are not fans who have appreciated, and others who thought it was not so great. Those who did not like it were mostly friends, they did not like the rude humor that made the movie so funny. I'm pretty sure that the entire film was shot in the hometown of Bams, which includes a lot of its regularly visited places. The cast of is composed of all his cky friends and pals, as well as great pro skaters. The soundtrack is phenomenal, with the music of HIM. In my opinion, Haggard has it all. A great plot, characters you will not see anywhere else. A lot of humor, good music and a distribution dedicated to the project.
