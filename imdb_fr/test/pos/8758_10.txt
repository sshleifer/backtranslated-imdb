Four stories about the drug trade in Europe mingle over this six-part mini-series. In Germany, a businessman is arrested for drug trafficking and his wife is trying to save her family by pursuing the illegal trade of her husband. Meanwhile, the British Home Secretary is traveling to Pakistan to negotiate an aid program that he hopes will prevent drug trafficking from that country. Despite this, her own daughter succumbs to heroin addiction, thus tearing apart their family. This is the mini-series on which the American film and the miniseries were based. The original is far superior to his two descendants. The poverty and despair of the Third World are very well described. It's brutal, uncompromising and brutal.
