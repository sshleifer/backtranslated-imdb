A pleasant film, without a doubt, and very evocative of its time and this very particular stage of the rites of passage of any boy. But I must say that after reading the very positive reviews here, I was a little disappointed. The period was captured, but the plot was desperately thin. All of this revolves around the most flagrant part of the misinterpretation of the history of school plays. The idea that a charlatan charlatan is ever chosen to play not only one of three star towers, but a leg runner, is laughable. And without that, nada. Secondary intrigues had no relation to the main plot. They could all be deleted in their entirety without decisively affecting the main story, which surely suggests a fundamental flaw. When all your subplots look like padding, you know that a central idea is going beyond its limits. Nevertheless, it is a benign film with its heart in the right place, there are good performances, and you just have the feeling that everyone involved felt deflated during the "final cut"! This good feeling permeates the film. And that must count for something. A very bad movie. 7 out of 10
