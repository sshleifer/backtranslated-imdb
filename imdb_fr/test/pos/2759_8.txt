This game is very good for the n64. You can skate like Tony Hawk, Bob Burnquist, Steve Caballero, Kareem Campell, Eric Koston, Bucky Lasek, Rune Glifberg, Andrew Reynolds, Elissa Steamer, Jamie Thomas, Rodney Mullen, Chad Muska and maybe some other skaters. The game does not have Mike V or Bam Margera. Dang! In any case, the gameplay is great. The School II level is a very good level with a lot to do. In Career mode, you collect SKATE, earn money, get high scores and various other things in 2 minutes. There is a skater, which is pretty cool. I created a skater named Butt Mulligan, a black with an afro and a board for girls. There's a park editor, cool predefined parks, free skateboarding and a unique session where you skate for 2 minutes and get a score. You can watch reruns, which is always cool. Each skater has two styles: A and B. The graphics are not very good. Well, they are good for an N64 game. I would like to have a controller pack to be able to save my data. Overall, this game is great. I give him an 8/10 for n64. But with the GBA version, it's as fun as the n64 version, but hard to control. I give him a 7/10 for GBA. So go to a place that still sells N64 games and take a copy There are also versions for PS1.
