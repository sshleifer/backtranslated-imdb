Never felt like I was a child, I loved this movie. I have always been a fan of Joseph Mazzello. the kid had pure talent both in this movie and in Jurassic Park. I was looking for DVD or VHS to buy at a store near my home. I can not find it. I hope it will go on DVD! good anyway a good movie. If anyone knows where I can find this, please contact me at wrp24@adelphia.net. Plus, can anyone really explain what happened with Bobby? Was it real or was it wrong and was it an imaginary friend and an escape? lol I am clueless. my favorite part was definitely the place where they made the monster juice and spread it all over the kitchen. It was funny but also sad because of what happens to Bobby because of the mess .. I would have liked to see the boyfriends face because he played his role quite well. I think the mother was a great actress, I think her name is Lorraine Bracco or something like that, well. That's it, please contact me <br /> <br /> wrp24
