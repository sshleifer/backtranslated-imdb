After seeing the "oh so much acclaimed" Fargo and thinking it was nothing more than average, I wondered if it would be a good idea to rent another "masterpiece" from Coen. This time, I was much less disappointed than by Fargo and I must say that the credit is largely due to the good jokes and the good interpretation of George Clooney. Well done, Mr. Clooney, do more of these movies and less 'Perfect Stormish' movies. You can play and you have shown it here. <br /> <br /> 7 of 10
