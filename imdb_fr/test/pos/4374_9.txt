This is unfortunately the last recorded HBO concert by Carlin, a series that has lasted more than 30 years. Although it may not be his "best" job, it's great, fun and thought-provoking. This recording is also a little different from most of his other shows: he's a bit longer than most of his other shows. <br /> <br /> Throughout his long, prolific and influential career, Carlin has moved from observational humor and fart jokes to a more "humanitarian" point of view of society and culture. His interest in the English language and the euphemisms increases over the years and culminates in this performance. However, I would argue that his audio book "When will Jesus bring pork chops?" shows at best his deepest spirit regarding language, euphemisms and the collapse of our values. It's Bad For Ya is indicative of his long transformation from comedian to writer. <br /> <br /> If you are offended by foul language or denigration of the church, you are probably not going to like one of the material Pug speeches. However, if you like to be mentally stimulated and can tolerate language and blasphemy, you will probably enjoy this concert a lot.
