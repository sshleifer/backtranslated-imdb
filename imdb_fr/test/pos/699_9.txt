Glenn Ford is hired by Edger Buchanan, a twisted and thrifty bank owner, to organize a false theft while the banker hides the real loot. In the absence of Ford, the two are more likely to relax with a happy second choice, leaving Ford on the hook for killings he did not commit. <br /> <br /> The first color feature of Columbia Pictures, The Desperadoes, is fantastic. with sets and costumes made to take full advantage of the Technicolor process, which showcases a host of well-staged Western shows. <br /> <br /> It's the irresistible association of a young Glenn Ford (third, but essentially star) and The first, Randolph Scott, directs an incredible cast of great actors in colorful roles, including Edger Buchanan, a stage thief, in which he plays the role of a nice but slightly naughty little fool who does not look as stupid as he looks and has some memorable retorts. A rather complex scenario effectively mixes incredible action sequences, melodrama and comedy, well done by Charles Vidor. This is one of the greatest westerns of the 1940s and is highly recommended.
