honestly .. this show warms my heart, I watch it every day about the fox family and now that the new season has started, I'm even more hooked than before .. the characters are so well developed and their relationships are so real .. i would recommend this show to all women, all mothers and all girls. The Lorelei are chatting very quickly with witty girls who will really inspire you. The show is sometimes hysterical and never too serious, but serious enough that it is completely dependent. It's an hour that's a plus, because you can never have enough Gilmore! even in one hour .. Emily and Richard Gilmore are KICKS (Loralie's parents, Rory's grandparents), they are moderately wealthy parents. Emily, president of the DAR, and Richard, a well-known lawyer and the elders of Yale st .. in the footsteps of her grandparents and that could not make them happier, of course, the mother of Rory is so proud of her but all her life worked to challenge her parents and Rory going to Yale did not help her on her trip, but believe me, every episode she gets closer;)
