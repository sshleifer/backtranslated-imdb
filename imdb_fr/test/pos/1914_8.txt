Dolelemite (1975) is a cult classic. Lead Rudy Ray Moore as a pimp superhero who wants to go the wrong way while challenging the man along the way. He has two enemies, no good Willie Green and the shady mayor. Watch Dolemite kick, punch, slap and draw on the screen. What is the name of the man? Dolemite! <br /> <br /> Interesting film that paved the way for a generation of rappers and performers. To sell more albums from his party, Rudy Ray Moore shot several cheap movies in the seventies. Self-produced and marketed, it was aimed at a specific audience. Some people call it blacksploitation others call it garbage, I call it entertaining. Dolemite was followed by the sequel to The Human Tornado and Dolemite's direct return to video 25 years later. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended, a real cult! <br /> <br /> Footnotes, if the movie was properly cached on the video, you would not see the boomers. Dolemite was cut to receive an R-rating.
