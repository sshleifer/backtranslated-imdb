It's just that. Chucky 1 was good. Chucky 2 was better. Chucky 3 sucked. Now, the 4th of the series that is, in my opinion, the best of the series. Jennifer Tilly was just great in this movie. For the dolls, they were better than a few actors that come to mind (Freddie Prince Jr, for example) and more fun than many comedies I've seen in the past. <br /> <br /> The plot was not great, but I really did not care. Just to see Chucky and Tiffany bickering and fighting. And the end leaves the field open for a 5th sequel (which I hear is in preparation). Idle Hands is taking its first steps next week and seems like another horror comedy, but I doubt it will prevail over this one.
