Our family and friends really enjoyed this movie. The theme was well treated by the director with excellent performances by Shabana Azmi, Konkana Sen and well supported by the good performances of other actors. The culmination was well built but for the end that was far from being described as "good". We are still trying to understand what the director was trying to convey? Were they running out of ideas or was the end going beyond ordinary moviegoers' understanding? A better end would have created a lasting impression on the audience and increased the number of spectators. This should not, however, take away the credit due to Konkana and Shabana Azmi for building relationships with the characters!
