I saw this film many years ago and hated it absolutely. I could not wait for it to end and I would be out, but there was a girl sleeping on my shoulder. You know what? I have never forgotten this movie, and more, I would say it continues to haunt me with his images and his music over the years. How many movies I cried and laughed in the movie theater, then forgot as soon as I walked into the street, like ... you see, I can not even think of one! More rare are the films like Death in Venice that penetrate your consciousness and transform into the sea. The French like to say that cinema is an art, and films like this one prove that they are right. I give him 10 stars, from the 3 that I gave the night I saw him.
