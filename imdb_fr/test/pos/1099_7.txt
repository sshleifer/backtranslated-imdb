It was a good movie. There was an interesting scenario, which was performed pretty well in the last part of the film. The scenario reminded me a little of the City of God. But this one is done in a more pleasant way in comparison. There was what I really liked: a touch of surrealism. A pretty interesting cinematography (through the wooden camera). I'm not sure it's culturally correct, but it definitely expands your vision of South Africa. The actors were good (for beginners, most of them anyway), I especially liked the character of Estelle, who made this film very pleasant. What is interesting is that it brings you to ask questions about your own life. Do you really do what you really like? Or do you agree to the norm, the conventionalism that surrounds you? Well worth a look.
