one of the best and most inspiring films on a different culture I've seen in years. tragic and touching. worth a look. maybe a few times. We all know how brutal children can be. I know my personal experience and that of my brothers when I was a child and this film was put forward. Perfectly! The kite race is amazing and I have to research the validity of this event. even if it is done in CGI it's still incredible and very interesting. Maneuvering a kite like this with a single rope seems impossible, but they make it believable. Anyway, this movie has many twists, I'm sure, probably easy to understand, but they hit me before I could. which makes a good movie for me! When you determine the movie in its entirety during the first 10 minutes, it ruins it. but it does it so well that it's hard to guess even when it happens ... I'm a guy and I do not mind saying that tears flowed more than a moment in this movie.
