I thought it was the most interesting movie JCVD ​​has done for a long time. I loved his character and the whole thing with the rabbit gave a different tone to this movie. In my humble opinion, JCDV may be really moving forward. A little lighter, obvious tributes to other films, mixed with great fights ... I would like to see more this style of film from him. One of the other posters thought the bar scene was a Desperado scam. I immediately saw the connection of R. Rodriguez too, but I thought it was very intelligent and it made me want to see the film again to look for more subtle clues from other films. JCVD Rocks !! <br /> <br /> Other stuff after reading other reviews: <br /> <br /> No music in the fight against dungeons? At first, I did not like that either at first, but then I thought it was interesting because it made me feel a little uncomfortable by giving us something we did not think. It seems more real. <br /> <br /> I'm always kidding when filmmakers cry like 2-year-olds that their film was "stolen" in the studio. Administrators are paid to do a job. The studio is the boss and they want the product they want. Very few filmmakers have an absolute final cut on a movie. In this case, JCVD ​​is THE talent and the only reason anyone who watches this movie. I'm sure he had a movie he was happy with. I have a parent who works in a post office and knew a little history. PRESUMABLY, the director worked and delivered his version of the film. Everyone who saw it said it was a disaster ... then JCVD ​​and the studio reissued the film. This thing happens all the time. He also saw the final cup (which he claims he did not see) and his ego "delicate genius" was badly bruised because they hated his cup. If this director was smart, he should have taken the credit of it, which would have been his best.
