This film was very interesting to me, almost a film in a movie, about a very whimsical director who cleverly persuades an actress and an actor (who hate each other) to produce a sexual chemistry on film. The director is faced with an obstacle shootout as she tries to make sure that the two individuals behave well on film. Sex is Comedy is more than a comedy, full of odd and uncomfortable moments. The film also addresses the instinctive psychological and innate behavior of men and women in the sometimes controversial sexual act. I loved this film, the character played by Jeanne by the beautiful Anne Parillaud plays wonderfully on the screen as you share her struggle to produce a work of cinematic art.
