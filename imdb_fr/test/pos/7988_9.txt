When I rented Batman Returns for the first time, I immediately thought it would be less than exceptional. I mean, Jack Nicholson was definitely the best part of the premiere, so without him, how could there be a good movie? Simple, throw in Danny DeVito. <br /> <br /> Batman Returns is a movie probably darker than Batman. There are more villains here, less real black comedy in many aspects, and more staggering problems. However, the music is similar to the first if it is not darker. The landscape is much more depressing than the first, every detail until the time of the year. This film follows the same comic style format that we had come to love in the first Batman. <br /> <br /> Let's move on to performances now. Michael Keaton happily returns as Batman / Bruce Wayne. He was great in the first movie, and just as much in this sequel. There was not enough time in front of the screen for Keaton to be Batman, need MORE! Danny DeVito played The Penguin with the most grueling, disgusting, adorable, edgy, nasty, sad and pathetic film that has ever deserved a superhero movie. You hate it so much, but you feel so bad at the same time. And that explains it down to the smallest detail, which makes it all the more confrontational. Michelle Pfeiffer was excellent as Catwoman / Selina Kyle. Two completely different personalities in one. In fact, she has also received a fair amount of stories. Christopher Walken did not disappoint as Max Shreck, the egoistic, judgmental and selfish CEO of the electricity company. Fortunately, Michael Gough is also back as a friendly Alfred, and he was just as good here. Pat Hingle is also back as Gordon, although I feel he has never been in the limelight. <br /> <br /> With many twists and intrigues secondary, Batman Returns will please all fans of the original. <Br /> <br /> 9/10
