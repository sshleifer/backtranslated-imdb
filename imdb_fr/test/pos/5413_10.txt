This film is a powerful commentary on family life in North America today. The story is so well built, it almost feels like it's happening across the street! If you are in any way connected to your family and community, this movie will grab you and drive you to Travis' home without allowing you to leave until the credits are complete. <br /> <br /> Our imaginary heroes, through a multitude of innocent circumstances, often unintentionally, take us on the path of pain, confusion and isolation. The Travis family, after a terrible tragedy, invites each one of us. father, mother, brother and sister, in their respective lives to share their experience in a set of dynamic circumstances that simply do not stop. We see all the above and possibly the joy of the powerful performances of the main actors and the rest of the cast, making this film an absolute treasure for moviegoers. <br /> <br /> In a movie as good as that, it's usually hard to find anything special, but Sigourney Weaver's portrait of Sandy Travis was remarkable. I would be surprised if others do not recognize it as such. <br /> <br /> Clearly a 10. Well done!
