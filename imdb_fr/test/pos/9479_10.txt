If you like Cagney, you'll love this movie. He claims American integrity at all costs, personal or social. Cagney plays at the head of weights and measures in New York. Cagney comes up against dishonest politicians, the undercover criminal, a prominent philanthropist and simple grocers who add a few ounces at the price of a chicken. The chicken scene is hilarious where Cagney finds a weight placed in the bird's cavity by an unsuspecting butcher. The hen is flummoxed around the store in a hilarious scene about who controls the "proofs". If you like old phones, there are interesting scenes of dials, telephones and even strange telephone cables. Compared to many movies shot today, this is pure entertainment, it includes a mystery with comedy and a message that honesty should above all be the guiding principle of humanity. Made in a simpler time, it reflects a world we can not find today. Fashion (including hats) and automobiles all play an important visual role in the definition of this little film.
