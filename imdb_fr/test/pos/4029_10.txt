Always loved "DOA", 1950, which starred Edmond O'Brien and was very curious about this movie. Dennis Quaid (Dexter Cornell) was a teacher who loved his wife and finally discovered that she had an affair with one of her students. Dexter is involved with Meg Ryan (Sydney Fuller), who was a student in his high school class and at the same time had a big crush on him and ended up having a one-night conversation and loved him deeply in some ways. Dexter learns that he received a drink that had bad contents and that would cause him a lot of health problems! If you like Dennis Quaid and you like Meg Ryan, you'll love watching this movie, Meg gave a great performance and kept this picture worth watching!
