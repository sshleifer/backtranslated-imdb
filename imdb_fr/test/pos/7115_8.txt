This sullen and scary horror movie begins on a cliff-top castle overlooking the sea, a beautiful setting, while a vampire bat arrives and slips to a sleeping doctor (Onslow Stevens). The bat turns into a man known as Baron Latos, actually Count Dracula (John Carradine). He asks Dr. Edelmann for help in curing his vampirism. Finally, the good doctor also wants to help his nurse assistant (Jane Adams), Wolf Man (Lon Chaney) and Frankenstein's monster (Glenn Strange). But Dracula's trickery contaminates the doctor's blood and he himself becomes a Jekyll / Hyde vampire. It is a little better than the "Frankenstein House" of the previous year, because it is less episodic and visually more exciting. Dracula tries to attract the second nurse (Martha O'Driscoll) to her world, where she first plays "Moonlight Sonata" on the piano, which soon gives way to terrifying music. Director Erle Kenton uses Expressionist shadows and disturbing music to frame many sequences, including a wonderful editing sequence that the studio frequently uses in its horror functions. Two interpreters are to note: Stevens, with his wonderful voice, is at first sympathetic, then threatening in a convincing way. Adams, his beautiful face contrasting alarmingly with his twisted body, shows great pathos and great sympathy. Everything ends with a slamming climax, typical of the 1940s universal horror, a bit abrupt, with images borrowed from "The Ghost of Frankenstein" (1942). I hope Universal will release it soon on DVD (it was not left in their Double-Feature versions).
