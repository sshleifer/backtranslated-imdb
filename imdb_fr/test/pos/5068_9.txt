Very good political thriller about the aftermath of terrorism and the use of political torture to achieve its goals by driving out terrorists. <br /> <br /> The story is closely linked to that where two families are affected by the terrorist attacks. <BR/> <br /> This is one of Meryl Streep's best roles in years. She plays a cold, calculating and cunning director of the CIA who allows these things to happen. She has graduated from George Bush-Dick Cheney's counterterrorism school. If her role had been expanded, Miss Streep would certainly have earned a prize at the time of the Oscars. <br /> <br /> Jake Gyllenhaal is our hero. A CIA agent who really can not understand what's going on. <br /> <br /> We have a terrorist who has a heart and who costs him his life in a well-made and fast-paced film. <br /> <Alan Arkin appears briefly in the role of an accomplice senator. Mr. Arkin seems to be getting better with age.
