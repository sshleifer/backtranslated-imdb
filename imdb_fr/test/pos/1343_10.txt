One of the best memories of my childhood. Should be on DVD. He captured everything we grew up with in the seventies - peace, sweetness, floral power and excellent acoustic music. The two hosts, Carol and Paula, were the definitive hippies peacenik, with long hair, peasant blouses and stockings (they looked like Katherine Ross (ala "The Graduate") and Ali McGraw (ala "Love Story" ), respectively.) <br /> <br /> They made us happy with the daisy jokes "chucklepatch", taught us to be nice through conversations with the Crotchedy Garden squirrel and entertained us with the music of their guitar. They were the best, and Carol was also Sandy's original in the original production of "Grease" (cool). <br /> <br /> This show should be part of a time capsule that would also include Yellow Submarine "," Arrow to the Sun "and Marlo Thomas'," Free to be ... you and me. ", As well as" Sunshine "and" The Point ". <br /> <br /> And finally, but not least, this theme song," See you soon, see you soon, I hope you had a good time , ah ah, happy to be able to say good morning, hope we can see you again, see ya, more, I'm glad you could stay a moment, ah ah, hope we meet again, see you soon .
