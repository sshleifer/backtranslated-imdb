I had to see this on television when it first aired a few decades ago. I thought it was great at the time, and as I remember so much, maybe I was right. While living in London and the surrounding area, I can not call myself a Londoner and I do not know it at all. Who is it, other than taxi drivers? Once the viewer understands the premise; that there is here a group of men who are trying to learn what is apparently incomprehensible and reach the status of demi-gods, the rest is pure joy. The characters are well contrasted, their family relationships are also diverse and therefore affected differently by the events of the film. Do not think it's a documentary - it's pure drama and The Knowledge is one of the characters. I have never seen anything like this movie before or since. Look at this!
