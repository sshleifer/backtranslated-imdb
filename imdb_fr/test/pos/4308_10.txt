"Müllers Büro" is a film that many people will watch and enjoy until the end, while others stop watching it within five minutes. It's a parody of crime movies with all the twists and turns; the action takes place only at night in the dark corners of a city that resembles Batman's Gotham City (look closely at the streets, buildings, police car chasing criminals, etc.). It is also a parody of musicals with very funny characters such as the secretary of Müller and the lover of Vitasek (the assistant playing the actor Müller) who do their best to sing without much success. the characters have their own presence in the film, like the decadent Blue Box (there is a real club with this name in Vienna) where you can see a sailor hitting a girl in the background, Müller's apartment with the black paint smeared on the walls and the dirty kitchen, Müller's desk with the soft picture of his assistant, etc. <br /> <br /> The humorous moments in the film are numerous and include a kind of humor "flat in the face" such as Müller fart in The face of his assistant, the prostitute charging Müller to pay extra for his orgasm, the ridiculous outfits of Montana thugs, etc.
