This film has been in my memory for years as one of the best television mysteries I've ever seen. The acting is superb. I have seen it twice and I am still puzzled in some places. I would like to have a copy to play some parts over and over again. I am interested in buying a copy of this movie, but I can not find it anywhere. I wonder if anyone has any suggestions for finding it? I have tried e-bay, Amazon.com, Internet searches and I am completely frustrated. I did not see it on Turner Classic Movies, nor on American Movie Classics, and I even sent leaflets into our community to ask if anyone had a copy.
