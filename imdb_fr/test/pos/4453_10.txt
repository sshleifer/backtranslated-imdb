The cult director Lucio Fulci is probably best known for his bloody zombie movies of the 1980s which earned him his legitimate reputation as "godfather of Gore". Fulci's greatest full-length film, however, dates back to 1972 and, while resolutely violent and violent, is not as gory as many of his other films. "No If Sevizia A Paperino" aka. 1972's "Do not Torture A Duckling" is not only Fulci's greatest film, but the alluring and inspiring Giallo is one of the highlights of the genre. The breathtaking atmosphere and the tantalizing suspense, the great Sizilian decor, the fascinating history, the brilliant performances or the intense moments of shock - I do not know what to praise from this ingenious Giallo! "Do not Torture A Duckling" offers cinematic perfection in every respect, making it an absolute masterpiece of Italian horror cinema. <br /> <br /> Unlike the other Gialli, they are not seductive beauty queens who are killed by one, but the little boys who are victims of a killer on the run. There are bodies of little boys in rural Sicily. While the police are desperately searching for the killer, the little town is full of strange people and the townspeople are shouting for a culprit ... <br /> <br /> The film is stunning and uncompromising from the beginning, with a dark, sandy atmosphere and constantly tense who has not yet found an equal. The performances are among the best of Italian horror cinema. Tomas Milian (one of my favorite actors of all time) is excellent in the lead, as a journalist Andrea Martinelli who investigates crimes. The sexy Barbara Bouchet offers both a feast for the eyes and a brilliant performance. Irene Papas and Florinda Bolkan, both brilliant in their role, also perform outstanding performances. The beautiful score of Rice Ortolani brilliantly intensifies the suspense and the atmosphere. The film is ingeniously shot in fascinating Sicilian landscapes. Although less gory than many other Fulci films, this film is decidedly brutal and uncompromising, with some terribly brutal scenes. <br /> <br /> "Do not torture a duckling" has all the awesome Horror you need. It's not as easy to obtain as most of Fulci's other films, but I'm sure this research will pay off. Any horror fan MUST see what I prefer as a personal favorite, and I highly recommend any movie lover not to miss it. A masterpiece!
