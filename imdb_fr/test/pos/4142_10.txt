The story of Buddy Holly opens with a photo of a yellow neon moon on the roof of an ice rink in 1956 in Lubbock, Texas. At the beginning of the credits, the camera descends from the moon to the parking lot, the ice rink, the concessions and the ice rink to a small bandstand where a small group checks the sound. Welles and Scorcese would both enjoy. It looks like Buddy Holly's spectacled face as he grabs concentration as he grabs the helmet and speaks to a man who broadcasts this group on the radio. <br /> <br /> Young Gary Busey plays Buddy Holly and his performance is essential. It must somehow show Holly's passion for her music so that the movie works. It's a story of rock and roll without coke lines pursued with heroin shots and a fifth of whiskey. It is not a man with many women to choose from in a lush tragedy scandalized by sex. It's a movie about a nice Texas boy who respects his parents and goes to church. He has had the same girlfriend for 5 years and fell in love with rock and roll. Busey finds this spark and ignites, his passion is clear and contagious. He really plays guitar in the movie and sings, he's not superimposed on Holly's recordings. Busey was a young man in Hollywood in the seventies, a troubled actor and as much or more a struggling rock musician. Thus, he gives an excellent performance, because even if he is not Buddy Holly, he finds himself in a similar situation. <br /> <br /> His first song is the old Paul's classic, "Mockingbird Hill", and he has the tone of the country to succeed him. Then, a child claims bop and his two teammates (the Crickets were actually 3 guys, but the reduction of the size of the board works well for the limited story of the film). The kids love it and the parents hate it. The mobile rink DJ records it and the movie is released later in New York without Buddy Holly even knowing it has been recorded. This leads to the funniest scene of a film filled with humorous moments. A beefy Buffalo disc jockey calls Buddy home. The DJ plays "It'll be the day" for 12 hours and 24 hours. Cops hit the barricaded door of the station. Holly is confused, but when the dust settles, he is quite happy. He tells the boys, and their meteoric rise begins. Dan Stroud as drummer and Charles Martin Smith as bassist nicely complement the group and have good chemistry with each other. There are problems but not exaggerated dramas that are found in most rock biopics (all?). The film does not manipulate you either. Your emotions skyrocket, but they are not manipulated. When the Crickets enter the Apollo scene in Harlem, the first white band to play, then embark on an electrifying performance of "Oh Boy" and win the audience, my rock-and-roll loving donkey choked and cried . Then Busey and the boys make "It's so Easy" sound more funky and melancholy than I would have thought possible. <br /> <br /> Anyone with a superficial knowledge of Buddy Holly's story will know where this movie ends. Holly died in a plane crash with Richie Valens and the Big Bopper far too young. As the public knows, the film is so well written, directed and played with love that we almost immediately forget it. The film does not talk about his death, but about his life and his place in the history of rock and roll. The film ends with his last performance and it's a good fifteen minutes of Busey, owned by the ghost of Buddy Holly. I was happy to hear him finish on "Not Fade Away", my favorite of his songs. The movie freezes before the end credits with information about the crash of the plane, but I barely noticed it. I still thought about the quality of this last song.
