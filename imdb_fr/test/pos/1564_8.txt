A beautiful performance of Emily Grace! I stumbled upon this film as I scanned my satellite lists and was curious about the plot summary of my satellite service provider. I was amused and had a lot of compassion for the character "Alice" played by Emily Grace. The story had left me guessing what was going to happen to Alice and was not predictable. The general story was refreshing and featured great twists for the supporting characters. The end of the story ended in a fairly fair way. I will buy this DVD to add to my library. I am a new fan of Emily Grace and I hope to see more of her performances.
