I saw it in 1993 on a VHS tape, but I could not find it from any source. It is a very dark and uncompromising look at the last days of the Japanese army in the Philippines. Anyone interested in the Pacific War would do well to watch this film and see how the other party fought. What I can say is quite accurate and illustrates the ease with which men can fall into complete barbarism. I understand that the Japanese army was completely cut off from all supplies in the Philippines in 1945, so there is no doubt that many of the terrible incidents described here have occurred. I may not have been able to identify with the characters in the film, but I appreciate their humanity and their struggle to survive. If I had to draw up a list of the ten greatest war films, this film would be included. See if you can get it.
