I watched all the doctors who were listened to by my local PBS station (I was introduced to the doctor by John Pertwee), as well as "camera copies" of the doctor sent to America by British fans to their American counterparts . . I had a good time with the show, but it never seemed to be serious - I mean as seriously as a science fiction show about a time traveler. I went to CON, did the piece of costume (Doctor # 5.6 and Tegan were my costume characters), I loved it. so everything stopped suddenly. The program's policy and lack of interest and funding turned the 25-year-old doctor into an ethos. <br /> <br /> When I heard that the science fiction channel had taken over the new doctor, my first thought was, "Cool, now my 11 year old son can see what I chatted on all these years and know what a TARDIS "(I have several phone booths and TARDIS of different sizes around the house) Do not expect the excellent quality of the story, the development of the character and the f / x. I had to say the least - happy. for the first time, I found a doctor who was not a curmudgeon, a clown, a fop, a welted head, a cat or a jerk. Christopher Eccleston is by far the most credible doctor to date. Now, calm down Tom Baker's fans! Do not get me wrong, I loved almost every doctor and his quirks, but Christopher gave the doctor something he had never had before - real credibility. I'm just sad that he decided against another season. I will try David Tennant like any other doctor, but now the bar has risen ... <br /> <br /> The rules of the bad wolf !!!!! <br /> <br /> Update 2008 - I love David Tennant! My generation remembers their character "mod", the generation of my son can take care of it and gestapo fashion can relax! he is a little more human than christopher, but not as humas as other old doctors. I miss Pink, I dig Martha, and what were they thinking with Donna noble!?!? it's always the best lap on TV
