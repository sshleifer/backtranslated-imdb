Tiny Tweet and Sly the Sneak are locked in cages for a train ride to who knows where. Swinging Tweety begins to scream an unbearable song as soon as the train leaves the station, so hopefully Puddy Tad will have it this time. Sly tries some fun tricks, but the lack of a sports driver puts the bird in a safer place in the luggage. The next attempt of the cat is to find it in the coal oven of the steam engine. And the hunt is launched. Of course, there is also a bulldog, and the stupid Sly can not keep his big mouth shut. <br /> <br /> Then, the persistent pussy tries the old stacking of the suitcases (twice), which produces a gain. Tex Avery would be proud. Unfortunately for Sylvester, this bulldog seems to be everywhere. He even displays a talent for changing his form and producing huge clubs from his back pocket. Even Sylvester's ability to overtake a high-speed train can not save him several times in a row because he is ejected from the Silver Streak style. Arriving at Granny's (Gower Gulch, population 86), the cat's last attempt is to disguise himself. But you know what happens to men in dress, they always attract more attention than expected. <br /> <br /> 7 of 10
