Mulholland Drive, David Lynch's ninth feature film, is a deeply touching story about betrayal and jealousy. On the contrary, it brutally opposes our ambitions and our hopes to the often bitter truth. Every image of this movie has importance and links to other parts and to themselves at the same time. Nothing seems to be what it seems to be at the beginning and you end up with a real headache when you end up trying to collect the pieces. It is a film that does not compromise and that does not fail to fully handle the shape and language of the camera difficult, as it could have been the case with Lost Highway. <br /> <br /> Although we clearly recognize the classic Lynchian motifs and the film remains very original, even in the light of a Lynch film. Lost Highway marks a new way of telling a story. generated an unconventional way to define emotions on the screen. With Mulholland Drive, Lynch not only managed to control this technique, but pushed it to new levels by making it much more complex and multidimensional. In doing so, he creates a framework of different layers in time and the human mind. In a press conference on the Cannes Film Festival 2001, David Lynch said that the pursuit of perfection at best could give a result where the whole is greater than the sum of the parts. Talking about such synergies becomes very relevant to Dr. Mulholland where the different sequences and many details contribute to the total; Dream landscapes and parallels intertwine to create history. In some arts, beauty lies in its simplicity. This is not the case with Mulholland Drive, and has never been with Lynch. It is the complexity that colors and builds the worlds created by Lynch, the same complexity that characterizes the real world. <br /> <br /> It's never forced like, in my opinion, for example Memento, using an original method of communicating with viewers. By comparing Mulholland Drive to other films, I think it proves that David Lynch is a master of what he does and bridges the gap between art and filmmaking in a way that nobody never done. Compared to Alejandro Jodorowsky or the contemporary Matthew Barney, I think Lynch manages more clearly not to let the artist dominate the filmmaker or, more likely, David Lynch understands and performs better film making as art. <br /> Understanding the plot is not easy, but the way Lynch uses sound, perspective, timeline and form paints a work of art so dark and so scary that she sometimes seems more realistic than real life. Lynch's cinema is often, and certainly in Mulholland Drive, a burst of human emotion. Working with emotions is a delicate job that requires understanding and depth. As Lynch says, "A little too much, and the emotion goes away, a little too much, and it does not happen." At Mulholland Drive, David Lynch has no problem balancing that. Lynch's portraits cover all kinds of dimensions and take different directions, creating incredibly realistic characters and situations. Watching Mulholland Drive is a journey through the subconscious. It is a true and naked film with an indisputable artistic value. That's why I love Mulholland Drive and what led to the pinnacle of film history. The ultimate movie.
