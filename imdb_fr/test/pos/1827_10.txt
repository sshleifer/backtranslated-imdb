Normally, I do not look at romantic comedy of this kind, and I will perhaps do it later after seeing Reverting to Me. The plot was simple and no secret after the advertisement. You do not have to be Einstein to guess what will happen after the first 15 minutes. What you can do is relax and let the actors take you to a world where chemistry abounds and where the good guys win and you can just laugh and have a good time. I LOVE this movie .... and have the DVD on order!
