Ali G's character works brilliantly within the confines of a comedy show, but as a film he does not work the same way. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong - it's a very funny movie, full of witty and witty dialogues, that beautifully caricature the modern British chav, while offering the viewer a hilarious, though unrealistic, story. <br /> <br /> A problem with this film is that the screenplay and the content are either fantastically brilliant, or it's embarrassing to watch. When I say embarrassing, I do not mean embarrassing embarrassment to the board or the supplements, but you'd rather not have it included in the final cup. An example is the inclusion of a video clip at the end of the film, on the theme "That's how we do it". Every time I watch the movie, I stop the DVD when it says the end and leave it as it is. <br /> <br /> Overall, Ali G Indahouse is a good movie that is worth watching several times. The scenario is nice to a certain extent, and there is no problem to act. However, refinement is the key word here. <br /> <br /> Ali G is a better TV show. Borat is a better movie.
