This DVD usually sells for about $ 20. I would not pay so much for the DVD if I had known what I was getting, but whatever, it's a very good record. It displays the knot in all its splendor, with excerpts from their concerts ... playing Surfacing, Wait and Bleed and Scissors, including the "Spit it Out" video, apparently banned from MTV. <br /> <br /> Slipknot, for those who do not know it, is essentially a symphony of the damned: nine masked men who show total chaos on stage, with machine gun drums, a guitar and voices that tear you away the face want more. For those who have never seen Slipknot before, I can not really recommend this DVD ... probably on eBay or Amazon so you can get a better deal. <br /> <br /> A short, although well presented show of the knot. <br /> <br /> Seven out of ten.
