Dolemite is one of the best movies featuring a pimp as a hero, who removes it, while dating with the most talented women that the ghetto must provide. Do not forget that these women know karate and are good foxy ladies. <br /> <br /> SPOILER - the final fight scene is pretty crazy, with Dolemite tearing at Willy Green's heart. Make sure your copy is not filed. <br /> <br /> In addition, there is a cast full of innovative and brilliant characters such as Hamburger Pimp, Reverend, Mayor, Queen Bee and others. The clothes are great, and the sets are full of 70s style. There are some mistakes in the production, such as the appearance of accidental humbuckers, among other things, but that adds to the charm and laughter . <br /> <br /> I would recommend drinking a 6-pack before and during this movie, and keeping the places and the man away from there.
