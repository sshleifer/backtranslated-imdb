Historians of cinema have talked a lot about ancient epics that have interested many filmmakers since the beginning of cinema. The pioneers of these epics, especially biblical, were D.W Griffith with his "mother of all epics" INTOLERANCE (1916) and Cecil B DeMille with his flair for magnificent shows, costumes and sumptuous scenes. Who can forget his TEN COMMANDMENTS (1923, 1956) or THE SIGN OF THE CROSS (1932)? Nevertheless, here is another epic made in the 1950s, directed by Michael Curtiz and based on the novel by Mika Waltari, "The Egyptian". Michael Curtiz, already famous for his classic CASABLANCA (1941), marvelously manages to adapt his film to the audience of the time, to bring out the most important ideas and facts of the thick novel and to recreate the lifestyle of the Egyptians one of the most astonishing periods, under the reign of Akhnaton. <br /> <br /> The first and most important thing for me in this film is the psychological development of the main character played by Edmund Purdom. Sinuhe, raised in a simple family by his in-laws, becomes a doctor. All his life, he keeps asking a question "why?" and seek the answer. The seductive love he finds in a courtesan Nefer (Bella Darvi) leads to financial and spiritual disaster. He has to repair the errors by working hard at the House of Death and starts building his reputation from scratch. First, he thinks the only cure is revenge. However, in the long run, he realizes that "an eye for an eye" is not a solution. Finally, what comes before him in very strange circumstances is the temptation to be a pharaoh. Nevertheless, there is a moment when he finds the answer to his questions that touched him throughout his life ... The story of the main character, although based on the book, is so interesting psychologically that anyone open-minded should take this aspect into account in the film. movie. The psychological struggle of the main character is intensified by his time, when, probably for the first time, the power of the sword clashed with the power of thought. <br /> <br /> Curtiz's film also preserves A rule that all films of his time have kept: a large distribution and sumptuous decorations. There are mainly British actors and actresses who give very good performances. How is it possible not to mention the pillar of the ancient epic, Victor Mature. This time, it is not Demetrius, Hannibal or Samson, but Horemheb - a fighter, a lover, finally a pharaoh. Jean Simmons appears in a very delicate role of Merit, a woman who has always loved Sinuhe, but it was too late to realize it. Peter Ustinov, probably the most famous for his superb performance as Nero in QUO VADIS? Three years ago, Kaptah, a friend of Sinuhe, did a great job. The royalty of the film is also played by two great actors, Gene Tierney and Michael Wilding. Tierney is excellent as cold, eager to power Baketamon, Pharaoh's sister. Wilding gives a wonderful performance as "crazy" Akhnaton. When I was at the Louvre Museum in Paris and saw the original face of Akhnaton engraved in stone, he looked a lot like the actor in the film. Bella Darvi, an actress born in Poland, is a memorable memorable Nefer courtesan. And there is another actress who appears only in a scene but it is difficult to forget, Judith Evelyn as Taia, the mother of Pharaoh. That voice, those eyes! <br /> <br /> The sets are beautiful. The director recreated the most likely image of the open-air temple of Aaton, the worshiped god of the Egyptians during the reign of Amenhotep IV. I also liked the scene of the first entry of Pharaoh. What glorious image that always remains in his memory !!! However, there is also something that I would like to bring to the attention of everyone interested in seeing the film. The Egyptian looks like other epics in many ways, but it also stands out as a unique film. There are very few films that use marvelously different curiosities than in ancient times. Reference is made to the iron used primarily by the Hetites. It is also the only film about ancient Egypt that speaks openly about the Egyptians' wonderful healing abilities. This shows in a memorable way the contrasts of lifestyles, especially the moment of the death of a slave who nobody cares about, followed by the announcement and consequently the generalized mourning that followed the death of Pharaoh. Finally, "The Egyptian" shows a historical fact: there were other nations than the Jews (before Christ) where the spirit of God shone in certain human hearts. However, the only difference was that he did not survive as long as the Jews, because he had no solid foundation. The death scene of Akhnaton brings you so many biblical and Christian values ​​that you might think you are watching a religious film. <br /> <br /> All in all, I highly recommend Michael Curtiz's film. It's an excellent multi-level production: an entertainment for epic fans, a marvelous performance admiration for movie fans, a soul feast for spiritual people. Finally, it is a beautiful story of extraordinary things that happened thirteen centuries before the birth of Jesus Christ.
