Leslie Carbaga's excellent book on the Fleishers tells the whole story of the great move of their Florida animation unit by the Fleischer, and their ejection by Paramount. <br /> <br /> Mr. Bug Goes to Town did not destroy the pioneering animation pioneers with Paramount, although this is often said so, and it was the favorite version of the story of Paramount. According to Carbaga, the big studio wanted more than anything to put his gloves in the animation studio and dispel the image of the brothers who were bickering. Mr. Bug provided them with the pretext to do that. --The sad closing of a great original and innovative chapter of American animation. <br /> <br /> I also wanted to say that the film actually made its debut on December 4, 1941 and not on December 7. In any case, the national atmosphere harms the success of the film. But another part of the legend of this little troubled film is that he was killed with the misfortune of being in theaters at the same time. Dumbo (released October 23, 1941) was still doing good business during the holidays. I did not do any house number research, but I would say that Dumbo's simultaneous presence in the theaters probably had an impact on Mr. Bug. Cinema broke all records at this time, and blockbuster movies could be strong in movie theaters for months. - Something unimaginable in these days usually brief and fast on DVD.
