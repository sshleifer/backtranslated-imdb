Barbara Stanwyck probably did not think about it, but it's a relief to see her wearing a darker hairstyle (if not a wig) than the one she had to wear in "Double Indemnity". 'last year. This film, while the first "noir film" and a great full movie, gave him a great role, but oh, this hair. Here she is more chic and certainly not a femme fatale, but she is certainly a woman of the 40s. She gets used to life without men since most of them are at war, and as a chronicler to success, Martha Stewart, she writes a welcoming column in which she describes her country house as a camera that describes what she really is. We meet her boss, Sydney Greenstreet, who does not know at all that she lives in the lie, and when he makes his way for Christmas, she has to find a husband (Reginald Gardiner) and a baby. before we can say "Jingle Bells". Hungarian chef S.Z. Sakall steps in to help and finds herself face to face with Ireland's Una O'Connor. "It's not Goulash, it's an Irish stew." Sakall simply picks up the paprika, pours out most of it and says, "Now it's goulash," which completely changes what she prepared for lunch. Then, when it comes to flapjacks, he flips over and takes the shovel. For years, some friends and I will use this line every time pancakes pop up in a conversation. "I'm not rocking, I'm scooping!" She does not even want to overthrow one for Greenstreet, saying, "I never returned to myself." O'Connor may be pissed off when she screams in some movies, but here she is delightfully kind and her association with Sakall is very charming. <br /> <br /> It's obvious in the romance department that Reginald Gardiner is not Barbara Stanwyck's cup of tea, especially when she meets the handsome Dennis Morgan, a little confused when bathing the baby , who eats soap, which worries Stanwyck. He should suspect something instantly, but does not do it. But it does not matter. The film is so charming with the snow-filled countryside scenery, an abundance of rocking chairs and a dog running towards them as the sled goes up. Living in New York after 25 years in Los Angeles after growing up in a small town in western New York, I missed that kind of Christmas. Although Central Park is beautiful after the first snow and the Christmas tree at Rockefeller Center is exsquisite, there is something to do with a field covered with snowy trees and an occasional glimpse of deer, rabbits or other wild life. <br /> <br /> This is an excellent holiday movie that can also bring the spirit of Christmas out of season and marry another Barbara Stanwyck's Christmas movie, "Remember the Night", a subtle jewel. valued. Add the big Christmas town of "Meet John Doe" and you may have found one of the busiest stars of the holiday movie.
