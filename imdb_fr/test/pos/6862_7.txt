I found the film pretty good for what I was waiting for. Although I'm tired, because I'm afraid of needles for the injection, I was expecting somehow to their arrival. So, if you do not like the needles, the blood, the human body and a little medical pleasure, hand over this film and rent another one. As the other user said, I was also happy with the German attempt at a slasher movie. I am an American who has just moved to Germany to stay in a family and has seen that lying on a shelf. I love psychological thrillers, and I would say that goes in that direction. A character falls into the scene and feels misinterpreted. While trying to make their way and find the truth about a situation, things get a bit sticky and others are not sure they are on the right track. So, throughout the movie, you will not know which of the anatomy you could see and which turns around the next turn.
