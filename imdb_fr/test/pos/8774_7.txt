All in all, it's a funny and strange movie. Do not try to make sense of it. The story has more holes than a computer could follow, but Robert Cummings and a troupe of minor characters are rather amusing to look at in this "fugitive" story. <br /> <br /> Unlike popular television In 1993, the fugitive is not looking for an armed man, but a Nazi saboteur with two arms called "Frank Fry". Cummings ("Barry Kane") is blamed when a defense factory explodes in Los Angeles and goes in search of the man who did it (Fry) to clear his name. <br /> <br /> The first 40 minutes or so are very tense and interesting. Then, Priscilla Lane ("Pat Martin") enters the story and begins to get bogged down with a sinister dialogue. Director Alfred Hitchcock often did this with his female characters, to the point that I wonder if he had any idea of ​​how a woman spoke. Lane's character was a bit lame. <br /> <br /> In fact, the villains played by Otto Kruger ("Charles Tobin") and Norman Lloyd ("Frank Fry") were the best, in my opinion .... .. just fascinating. Kruger's play and dialogue were particularly good. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen this movie but have seen Hitchcock's famous movie "North By Northwest", you'll laugh at the end and really enjoy it. Instead of a climactic scene at Mount Rushmore, here we have 10 last minute memorable moments at State Of Liberty. As usual, Hitchcock camera angles are excellent and fun to watch.
