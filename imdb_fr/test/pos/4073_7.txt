I did not go to see this movie, but I was pleasantly surprised by the team of Robert De Niro and Eddie Murphy. It was a fast-paced film and the hour and a half was passing quickly. It will certainly win no Oscar but it was a change of pace for Mr. De Niro. He is good at comedy. Overall, I appreciated.
