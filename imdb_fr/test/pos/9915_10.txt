"The Devil in the Dark" is William Shatner's favorite episode. It's also one of my favorite episodes. The program is purely Star Trek because it addresses one of the main themes of the series: respect for other forms of life. I do not think we can have a clearer example of one of the most interesting ideas in the series. In this episode, Kirk and his team face a monster that kills minors on a distant planet. History is an excuse to explore the human right to destroy creatures that are a vital part of the environment. Current concerns about environmental causes make the show more relevant than ever before. It is extremely well written and brilliantly interpreted by our beloved cast. A memorable sequence implies that Spock joins the spirit of the monster. A lot of tension between Spock and Kirk (they want to solve the problem using different methods) adds to the fun. Shatner and Leonard Nimoy do some of their best work here.
