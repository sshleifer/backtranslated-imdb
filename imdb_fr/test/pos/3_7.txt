How many movies can you think of when you see a movie like this? I can not count them, but it seemed that the filmmakers were trying to give me a clue. It reminded me so often of other movies that it was becoming a big distraction. One of the memorable lines borrowed comes from a 2003 film - Day After Tomorrow. A single line in itself is not so bad, but this film borrows so much from so many films that it becomes a risk. <br /> <br /> BUT ... <br /> <br /> See the movie! Despite its disadvantages, there is enough to make it interesting and perhaps make it look smart. By borrowing so much from other movies, it never goes above. In fact, you will probably find yourself closing the hatches and facing the storm. Why? Costner and Kutcher played their characters very well. I have never been a fan of Kutcher and I almost abandoned him in The Guardian, but he did well. Costner wears the film wonderfully with the best of Costner's ability. I do not think Mrs. Robinson had anything to do with her success. <br /> <br /> The actors all around played their role well. I had no problem with any of them at the end. But some of these characters have been used too much. <br /> <br /> From now on, I can only complain, so I'm saving you the wear. Enjoy the movie, the parts that work, work well enough to keep your head out of the water. Do not expect a smooth ride. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10 but almost 6.
