The last time I arrived here, I think there was not more than one comment. I am very happy that more people were surprised by this film, and even more so by the fact that you were digging it all too. I caught it on Christmas night 2004 and found myself unable to switch channels on my TV, even though it was an Asian movie - and I'm sad but really used to leaving no chance at any Hollywood products . That's what I did that night and I deeply thank God. I have not been able to release this film from my system since - not that I tried or wanted to do it - and it always amazes me - in an extremely grateful way - that such a wonderful and beautiful experience If you have the opportunity, go see this movie, buy it or rent it as it should, or watch it. . I guarantee that it will affect you. I'm out of time, but I'm far from having finished my evaluation here, so I'll be back as soon as possible.
