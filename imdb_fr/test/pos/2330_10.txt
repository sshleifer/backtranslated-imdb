LCDR Tom Dodge, although he has a reputation among renegade and nonconformist submariners (* notes to reader: Maverick does not mean "Tom Cruise." Maverick means "maverick".), Is in reality an intelligence officer vice-admiral of his underwater fleet. The Vice Admiral worries about our old friends, the Russians organizing yard sales with their old diesel fleets. Countries like Libya, North Korea or Iraq would like to get their hands on this baby and slip a nuclear warhead into the port of Norfolk or Mayport, Florida. And that was 6 to 7 years before 9/11. <br /> <br /> The admiral entrusts Dodge with the command of an immobile World War II diesel submarine, and organizes an exercise against the surface fleet and the USS ORLANDO. from the line fast attack under. Dodge takes control and, in no time, eliminates bad news. .. uh, I mean his adorable group of weird submariners as warriors. Although he is tattooed on his penis "welcome aboard", he is a competent and fair commander, he does not choose favorites and he delegates authority in a responsible manner. The US NAVY could not have offered a more refined recruiting propaganda than this jewel undervalued by the most beautiful creator of the "Police Academy".
