Apart from the plane, I do not think I have ever laughed so much about a film of my life. <br /> <br /> I like football like crazy, but I tend to hate almost every song and every movie about football, they tend to be unrealistic. This was not the case. <br /> <br /> I watched it once, it was more than 2 years ago and it was brilliant. Everyone I know loved it. I remember the gay physio, the slope inclined at an angle of about 45 degrees and "Shoes" (a player so named because he has already shown in training in a new pair of shoes). Brilliant, that's what happens in park football. <br /> <br /> A final 10/10. If someone from the television industry reads this, considering all the crap you repeat on English TV, please make sense to show it again (and the Muppets while you're there). Does anyone also know if this has been shown on BBC or ITV? I think it was ITV, so it's worth asking if they plan to show it again. They should do.
