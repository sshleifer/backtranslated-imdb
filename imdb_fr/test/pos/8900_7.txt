I was a big fan of Asterix comics when I was a kid and I watched them all. I never heard of this movie when it came out but I watched it with my kids last night. I remembered the comic book enough to know that a lot of things had been added to the movie's story. I thought some of the changes were a little tacky (like the nephew's "modern" dance and the viking chief's daughter - almost everything about it), but I found it quite amusing. More importantly, seeing the reactions of my children confirmed it, confirmed that the film appealed to its target audience. As a family film, it works better than the other Asterix titles I've seen. Many of the names that did not appear in the book I found had the same appeal as those that were. All in all, it's a nice family movie, whether you're an asterix fan or not.
