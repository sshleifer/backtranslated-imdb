A brief history of time is not just a documentary on the beginning and the end of the universal and the reality as we know it, it is a story about the man and the genius known as the Stephen Hawking's name. It is his story that reflects the history of time and change throughout the history of the universal. The style of the documentary style / editing interviews begins and ends with a quick fade to black. The documentary gives you a strange feeling: this is the point of view of Stephen Hawking and not the eye of the camera. The execution time is just over an hour. It's a short story, but again, we could talk about it for days and days. An interesting and proud story.
