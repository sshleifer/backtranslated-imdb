Stuey Unger was a legend in the card game. he was quoted in an interview as saying, "One day, I guess it's possible that someone is a better No Limit Hold'em player than I. I doubt it, but it could happen. I swear I do not see how anyone could play gin better than me. "There is a gin rummy scene in this movie that is so incredible that you could have put it in" X-Men " as a showcase of the mutant power of a superhero. how incredible this man was. <br /> <br /> I have some minor problems with this movie. As dark as this film is, Stuey's real life was darker. todd brunson, poker professional, said: "In the last World Series of Poker, Bob Stupak, Mike Sexton and I had a drink and talked about Stu, Mike told us he could barely talk, did not he? She had not been showered for weeks and her fingers were tense, burned in black by a crack pipe. "In the movie, michael imperioli looked way too healthy to stay in the last years of her life. When Stuey won his last victory, he looked like a skeleton, but let's face it, this production lacked both time and "deniro" to make this type of transformation. My other problem was that I would like there to be more poker, with real hands and situations. Of course, this could have annoyed the average poker enthusiast, but it would have been nice for the hard drives. Too bad the movie does not last 6 hours or more. <br /> <br /> I watched the movie with 3 non-poker players and they all really enjoyed it. just as you do not have to be a former colonial army member to take advantage of Gibson's "patriot", you do not have to be a poker player to see this gem. can not wait for the DVD.
