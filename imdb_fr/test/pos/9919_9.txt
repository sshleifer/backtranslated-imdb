Title: Opera (1987) Director: Dario Argento Performers: Cristina Masillach, Ian Charleson, Urbano Barberini, Daria Nicolodi Criticism: The only other Argento film I've seen is Suspiria, which really blew me away with its style, its colors and its sinister history. . I then decided to leave with Opera because I was told it was one of his best. Dude, I think I'll find out what will eventually be one of my favorite horror directors. <br /> <br /> The opera tells the story of a young opera singer who had her great chance when the main star of a terrifying modern opera launches Mc Beth is hit by a car. Betty is the lining so she has to do the role herself. Too bad for her, there is a psychopath after her that makes him watch the brutal murders of his friends and colleagues. <br /> <br /> Wow, I heard good things about this movie here, but I was not prepared for that. the level of grandeur that this film would lead me to. Yes, the film has its flaws, which I'll come back to later. But most of the time, the movie blew me away. <br /> <br /> First of all, this film is not as full of colors as Suspiria. I expected it to be a little suspiria in this department, but no, to my surprise, it had its own appearance. The film is somehow devoid of color. There are a lot of colors in some scenes (like the masterful kitchen / diner sequence) where Argento fills the screen with lush greens and blues, but the film usually has a greyish, black tone all along that he has his own look. <br /> <br /> The real stars of this show are incredibly well orchestrated death sequences. Sensational. Each death scene was like a work of art. Beauty in destruction. These are not just typical hack and slash death sequences, these deaths have been carefully crafted to shock and make the most of their situations. Loved every second, there is a lot of blood and chaos here, but with style. I will not spoil them. <br /> <br /> Then there is the direction. Dude, there are really original and beautiful pictures on this one. I loved the inventive use of the camera on this one. You thought Tarantinos had shot in Kill Bill, vol. 1 the bullet coming out of the rifle chamber was original? This is the movie from which he came out! I honestly believe that Tarantino was strongly influenced by this film with some scenes from Kill Bill Vol. 1. Heck in the making-of, he mentions that the whole scene with Beatrix at the hospital and Elle Driver coming to kill her was influenced by the Italian Giallos, and here my friends are the proof. Anyway, aside from Tarantino's references, this movie contains incredible shots, like those scenes of crows flying through the opera crowd ... beautiful things. And one of the main reasons why Argentos has become one of my favorites. <br /> <br /> Most of the actors played, but the best was by far Cristina Marsillach in the role of the young opera singer tortured Betty. The looks in his eyes while the murders were committed were excellent. The rest of the cast was a little stiff and stiff, but nothing would dissuade your enjoyment of the movie. <br /> <br /> There are very few things I do not like in this movie. First, the logic was thrown out the window in some scenes. Especially those involving Bettys reactions after she saw the murders. It seems to me that for a very long time she only talked about her business without telling anyone. Not even the police. I mean, if you see someone brutally murdering a loved one in front of your eyes ... you're not just moving away from the murder scene and continuing your life. Someone would have linked her to the murders. She could even have become suspicious herself ... but no. Also the end is a little anti climactic. It will have to be seen to understand, but the way the film ended seemed a little useless, it was as if it could have ended earlier. It would not have felt so superfluous. But this is the case, it's not really a big problem for me since I enjoy the rest of this beautiful film. <br /> <br /> I still have a lot of Argento territory to cover ... but I am devouring every step of the way as if I were eating a plate of the most expensive caviar. This guy really good. I think his films are works of art and I only saw two! I can not wait to discover the rest of his films. Argento, you the man! <br /> <br /> Rating: 41/2 out of 5
