It's probably the funniest thing I've ever seen - from start to finish, it was perfect for timing, atmosphere, punch lines, background music, fight sequences and all other possible aspects you can think of. To be quite honest, I find this movie as funny as their sitcom (Rik & Ade) "Bottom" - maybe even funnier. I laugh constantly throughout the film and I can only recommend to see this movie ... However, if you look at it without knowing (or love?) The type of comedy that Rik Mayall and Ade Edmondson have already done, you do not may not believe it funny. all - but I can not REALLY understand those who do not like it - THIS IS FOLKS OF HUMOR !!! (People get hit with frying pans, guys wearing red rubber underwear, green vomit filling the halls, guys getting busted and getting fucked take candlesticks in your eyes - HOW can it not be funny?
