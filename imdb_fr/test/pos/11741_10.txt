War correspondent William Holden separates, falling in love with the beautiful Eurasian doctor Jessica Jones in the beautiful landscape of Hong Kong. The cinematography is beautiful because they meet on a hill overlooking Hong Kong. The story deals with racial tensions, the frowning society about mixed relationships and extra-marital relationships. But what I like is the strong character of the heroine described by Jessica Jones, a Eurasian doctor, who remains humble and firm in her altruistic mission and remains faithful to her love. Despite this, she gets fired at her hospital for making a mistake with a married man while gossiping in the high ranks. One day, William Holden is called to the Korean War he covers, then that day, he receives the news of his disappearance. The end, of course, is tragic, I cried when she went to their hill. It was a very beautiful story of unhappy love. This eliminates all chances, the fact that she got fired from her job, and that his wife did not grant her a divorce, yet their great love persevered - they lived a great love despite everything. Personally, I do not believe in extra-marital relationships and think that he should not have started something when he was related to someone else and should not have allowed it to happen , but despite that, a really beautiful movie. I think the heroine has eclipsed the hero. Jessica Jones is sensual and gave a wonderful performance although I find it strange not to have hired a real Asian actress or a person with Asian blood. I agree with a reviewer, Jessica Jones overflows with sexuality when she lies down and looks up at William Holden who speaks calmly but his eyes say she is coming to take me now. <br /> <br /> I find it unfortunate that most of the great films were made before my birth, it seems that many Hollywood movies lack depth, interesting acts of play and depend entirely on stunts and scenes of heavy sex. It's really one of the biggest unhappy love stories in movies.
