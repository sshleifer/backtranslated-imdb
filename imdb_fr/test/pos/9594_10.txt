I have it on VHS, but it's not a great copy because I've watched it 2 or 3 times a year since 1999. I'm also worried that "his house" is throwing it into the annual VHS purge. <br /> <My brother and I (the end of the '30s) are still reporting in this fantastic show Tim Healys Lucky Cup hat and telling the apprentice that you can not do anything about it (shoot, pass etc.) and it turns out to be Peter Beardsley. As a fan of Leeds, I have to laugh at the empty record on Bostock before the final of the cup (or was it said "S ** t?") <br /> <br /> The reason I came online today is that I want it for Christmas so ITV please take it out on DVD Come on The UnderFelt Men !!
