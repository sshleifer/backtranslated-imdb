Babs Johnson (Divine) lives in a trailer with his son Crackers, his daughter Cotton and his mother Edie (Edie Massey). She is competing with a couple named Connie and Raymond Marbles (Mink Stole, David Lochary) to be named the dirtiest person ever. The film shows their attempts to surpass themselves. <br /> <br /> This movie is really not for everyone. It is an assault of bad taste closer to your face. Crackers have sex with a woman with a chicken living between them while her sister is watching; the marbles pick up hitch-hikers, impregnate them, chain them to the basement and sell the babies to lesbian couples; Divine and family have a party that includes cannibalism and so on. It's disgusting but, in a way, not unassailable. It's so exciting and so unexplored about it that it's rather fascinating. As director John Waters would say, bad taste is well done. It's also fun to watch - the acting is so miserable (especially from Massey) that you watch it in disbelief. A friend burst out laughing at how bad Massey was (she improved in the following pictures). <br /> <br /> This is NOT for people who are easily offended. Even if he is over 30, it is ALWAYS shocking. However, if you have an open mind and can adopt extreme behavior, this is a must. The only part that was really too much is what Divine does in the end.
