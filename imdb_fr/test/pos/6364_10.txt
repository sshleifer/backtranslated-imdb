Does anyone know why this movie is called the trip on the couch? I was just watching and I still do not know why this title was chosen. The movie was very funny and it's probably my favorite performance of Dan Aykroyd. He even beats his performance of Ghostbusters. I had never heard of the movie until I saw it at a Sears store. I read the back and found that it sounded good, so I bought and when I finally had the opportunity to look at it, I thought it was better than what I m 'expected. I wish the comedies that were released recently were written, and that there is nothing sad to happen and that the bad things that happen are also fun parts if someone else feels like that and would like to read a comedy script for a movie that does not present a sad situation, email me at killer2511@hotmail.com
