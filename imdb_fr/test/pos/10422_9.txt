Wow, I probably saw a lot of Kelli McCarty this summer. I did not know that this woman had made so many softcore movies in the last three years. It's like I see a future softcore star blossom in front of me, like Michelle Hall did a few years ago. <br /> <br /> "Passion's Peak" is the third quality film I saw Kelli McCarty, with "Girl for Girl" and "House of Love" being the others. "Desire and Deception" agreed, but it was not spectacular. There are critics in this review, so read only if you wish. <br /> <br /> The story begins with Christina (Kelli McCarty) moving away from the big city and mountains. She inherited a house from her beloved grandmother's house and plans to turn it into a mountain lodge. Even before she can do her business, a woman named Kim (uncredited in this film, but rather aggressive) begins to bring in guests. Now she needs to get the house back in shape quickly - it's Chip (Bobby Johnston), a childhood friend, who comes to the rescue. Chip helps him put the house in working order. She hires two slackers from the area to work in her lodge: Chip's sister, Bait (Samantha McConnell), and her sexual friend Hank. <br /> <br /> Guests are now starting to arrive. The first to arrive are Eric and Linda (Flower), two stereotypical advocates focused on money. Linda and Eric argue a lot over a dinner midway through the movie that leads them to a breakup. sad things there. Then there's romance novelist Sophia, played by the goddess of movie B, Monique Parent. She's using this stupid alias Scarlet Johansing again, and she looks very professional this time - with blond hair, of course. It would not be Monique if she did not have at least one scene in which she plays with herself and she forces, during one of the sex scenes of Eric and Linda. <br /> <br /> James and Shene (Devinn Lane) --Yes, the porn star Devinn Lane) also presents for a weekend getaway. Unbeknownst to Shene, James and Christina have a story. James and Christina used to go out with them, but Christina broke off the conversation to get to that mountain lodge. James approaches the box to recover Christina, but his plan turns against him. Christina passes the beans to Shene, which causes him to go down and go to the local bar to undress for the locals. Shene ends up in the sleeping bag of the now single Eric and they leave together. Bait realizes that she wants more than sex with Hank and Christine finds true love with Chip, and Sophia takes the opportunity to write in her next love story. <br /> <br /> In fact, if you ask me, all this film was like a novel. I do not know if the screenwriter wanted this effect, but I had that impression. Sophia had some of the best replicas of this film, expressing the idea that it was an action novel. She seems to enjoy all the fights and backstrokes that are going on. <br /> <br /> Let's move on to sex now. There was a good amount, and it was the usual bump-and-grind thing. Monique made a lot of moans in her two sex scenes. This film has been praised by the public, and the story will hold the public interest between the scenes of sex. <br /> <br /> Women: A- (Monique was just Monique, of all the softcore actresses I've seen more years, she's the best actress, in my opinion, she can really play and be sexy, that's why she clings to the front row of my top 10 Skinemax Kelli McCarty knows better than softcore movies the soap opera "Passions" I do not know why she does not do more. was a backdrop for the most part in a limited role, Samantha McConnell continues to impress me and Devinn Lane is another hardcore actress in the softcore world and doing a decent half job.) > <br /> Sex: B (It was good, but not dramatically spectacular, a lot of moans, do not look at the R-rated version, trust me ... most of the good stuff came out. the uncut version.) <br /> <br /> History: B (A solid story I throw in an "Ooh, the building inspector v to make us close "an artificial plot towards the end that spoils things. The underlying story between Christina and James was nice, and Sophia's dialogue, full of metaphors and images usually found in romance novels, was a nice touch.) <br /> <br /> > Overall: B + (I found this movie This is not a Softcore Hall-Of-Famer surfing like "Girl for Girl", but it's a respectable addition to the Skinemax collection.)
