It is an exceptional crime thriller, with excellent distribution. The most popular and popular actors of Spanish-language cinema over the last two decades, Victoria Abril and Federico Luppi, team up in one of the best Spanish-language crime thrillers of 2004-2005. <br /> <br /> The film begins by focusing on about thirty something Ernesto (Ernesto Alterio), an elegant, attractive and smooth thief who has learned from childhood friend Gitano, and more recently from Manco, an old, crooked crook. Manco presents Ernesto to Federico (Federico Luppi), a methodical robber as elegant, but more astute and experienced - the best of his class. <br /> <br /> The only known weakness of Federico is Pilar (Victoria Abril), his former mistress and partner. She suddenly appears and offers her former lover a fabulous scam ploy, a large-scale crime, which will eventually require the help of Ernesto, Manco and Gitano, among others. <br /> <br /> The scenario is full. surprising twists and turns, especially towards the end of the film. One of the criticisms I've heard a lot about the movie is that there are too many conspiracy twists in the end, but I do not agree. The film captivates the audience so much that all unexpected events are not too much to follow. In fact, that's what makes the film exceptional. I highly recommend it.
