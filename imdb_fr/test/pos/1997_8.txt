I watched the movie several times. And what I mean is the only thing that made this movie stand high is the incredible performance of Burak Altay, absolutely nothing. Not even this stupid model named Deniz Akkaya and some of these popular names sometimes in the movie ... Burak is really very talented. I saw some work that he did and did. Even if it's a kind of horror movie, he's doing really good work in comedy films and also in dramas. I bet most of you have all seen Asmali Konak the movie and the TV series. Those two would go for example ... All I'm going to tell you is that you'd better watch Burak's new works, you'll see. Keep the good job my brother, a lot of love ..
