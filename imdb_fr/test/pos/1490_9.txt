Rowan Atkinson delivers an unforgettable performance in the role of Mr. Bean, the helpless, who never goes far without his teddy bear. Mr. Bean's appeal is largely his childish behavior and innocence. We do not know if he came from the sky or from another planet. He is the kind of strange character that you can not invent easily. He is often alone and accustomed. He has difficulty communicating by word, which may explain why we sometimes only hear his grunts. There are other characters who speak to him and he answers. The character of Mr. Bean is a mystery and always is. He lives alone and does the unthinkable when he can do what is right. Mr. Bean is rather a strange man who does not care much. Rather, he lives a simple life with his yellow car and teddy bear and hopes to get to work on time.
