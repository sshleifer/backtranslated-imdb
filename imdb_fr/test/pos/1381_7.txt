The score '7' is not necessarily a smear - this film was made with a small budget - but within the limits of its limits. <br /> <br /> A typical potted boiler plot - A ship carrying a prisoner is Destroyed in space, people and prisoners escape into pods, land on an unknown planet where their presence awakens some thing. It follows a lot of ammunition. <br /> <br /> The special effects have been spared and properly realized, focusing on future technology with displays and holographic controls instead of relying on bulky and cheap plastic accessories. In addition, the rhythm of the story has been moved without allowing the viewer to be bored when he begins to separate things. <br /> <br /> I consider this one as a light movie on Saturday afternoon. You can get up and hit the fridge without hanging it and it will still be nice. Better yet, your girlfriend can talk throughout the conversation without hurting your pleasure - and she will be happy: after all, she has to talk to you! It's THIS TYPE of movie. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the story has few holes after hitting the planet, but hey, it's an action movie Guns 'n' Ammo. Consistent stories are not necessarily needed as long as you have beer and fries in hand. So do not put yourself in a brain cramp at the end.
