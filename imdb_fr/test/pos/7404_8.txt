Sometimes good things happen by accident. <br /> <br /> I had never heard of "Silverwing" until the end of 2005: I was reverting channels and I found something on Toon Disney with bats in a sawmill attacked by owls. . I did not know at all what it was, but I was motivated to stay tuned - it was hard to wait for an advertisement to know what it was called! <br /> <br /> One aspect of my plot was the eyes of bats - first of all, they did not use the popular convention of giving bats "extra fingers" there where their thumb claws are supposed to be. They have rather palms like human hands, but the fingers are longer and have layers of skin between them. <br /> <br /> Faces too - they look like human beings (in fact, at one point, I wondered if they had ever been human but were turned into bats). Usually, I do not like that in cartoon animals, but it worked here - the story is a human story, even if it's about bats and other animals (a bit like the Lion King). <br /> <br /> What I saw on TV were the last two parts of the "trilogy". I had missed the very beginning of the first one, "Towers of Fire" (the second one in total), but I've seen them all for the most part. However, I found myself wanting to understand what was happening because the first part had not been started and I would not have understood it anyway. <br /> <br /> But I saw that it was based on a book. by Kenneth Oppel. How lucky I listened and rated - I was very disappointed to learn that the series was NOT AVAILABLE! It was not even done recently that it made sense not to find it again. <br /> <br /> However, I found not only the Silverwing book, but also both Sunwing and Firewing suites. When I read the first book, I asked myself, "Is that it?" Not only because a lot of what is in the series is not in this book, but even if I had not seen the animated version, the book Silverwing (if not a good story) does not end as long as it s 'stopped. Only one knot is attached - Shade and Marina join the Silverwing colony at Hibernaculum. <br /> <br /> In fact, Silverwing and Sunwing should have (in my opinion) been published in one volume because they make for a complete story together, but not separately. <br /> <br /> In fact, the animated version picks up some elements of Sunwing (eg, Orestes, lifting the ban on seeing the sun) and others completely original. It's not perfect, but it's really nice. I appreciate both versions of the Silverwing saga. <br /> <br /> That's why I'm glad it's finally available in June. It was a long time coming and it was worth the wait.
