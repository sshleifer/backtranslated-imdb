The only thing we can say about RUNNING OUT OF TIME is that it's an extremely smart movie. It is interesting to note that the screenwriters of the film are French, which perhaps explains the "unconventional" atmosphere of the film, because it does not really correspond to what is commonly called "Hong Kong cinema". <br /> <br /> The film is about a thief who plans to take revenge on some criminals by being helped by an equally intelligent policeman. But first he must convince the officer to join his personal crusade and thus begins a series of games in which the thief embodies the policeman in his plan. <br /> <br /> A pretty smart movie. <br /> <br /> 7 of 10 <br /> <br /> (go to www.nixflix.com for a more detailed review of this film or full reviews of other foreign films)
