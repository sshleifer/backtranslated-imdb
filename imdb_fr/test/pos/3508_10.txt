I remember that BBC1 showed this movie years ago. I found it on video a few years ago and have watched it again. The film, although slow and slightly strange (the mountaineers look very strange), the atmosphere was strangely effective. This is one of my favorite slasher movies and I do not know where to find a full version. Currently deleted everywhere (except in the United States where it was accidentally put on a horror compilation!). It's too bad you can not get this movie because it was supposed to be seen. Wrong turn (the recent film produced by Stan Winston) owes a lot to Just Before Dawn. One of the best slasher movies of the 80s and deserves to be seen by a wider audience.
