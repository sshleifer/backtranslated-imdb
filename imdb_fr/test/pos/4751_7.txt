The Seven-Ups is a good and captivating film. It's filled with credible performances by Scheider, LaBianco and an effective scary performance by Richard Lynch - although most characters are tough. The development of the character does not evolve on the screen at all. We only know that the good ones are the good ones and the bad ones are the bad ones. Deviating from the norm of crime, The Seven-Ups manages to throw Scheider and his team in the middle of a building plot, in a unique writing. The film is showcased at New York filming locations and an excellent choreographed car chase. The only drawback of the movie is the slightly confusing plot at first. They give little evidence to the viewer that the abducted men are tied to the crowd (until later in the film). Had someone blindly started watching the movie can be slightly confused about the story. Otherwise, The Seven-Ups is a nice time filled with testosterone.
