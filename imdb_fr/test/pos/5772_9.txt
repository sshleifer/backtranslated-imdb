This wacky movie rivals Ghost and Mr. Chicken as one of Don Knott's finest films. Knotts is an accountant for a podunk town hall that is good for scamming citizens. They dismiss the "three competent accountants and keep the mute" (Knotts is of course the mute). When his cohort of waste pickers accidentally empties the wrong bin, Knotts finds himself wrapped up in a strange trap set by the city council. Some of the fun moments in the movie include the Bowling Alley Restroom scene and the graveyard scene is absolutely hilarious. Typical Knotts, the nervous ninny act is well used and, as usual, it is surrounded by many actors of crazy characters of the sixties. Actors such as Frank Welker and Pitt Herbert add to the chaos. As you might expect, Knotts is armed with a big car, a pretty girl and has no idea what he's doing. Fun for everyone, especially lovers of nostalgia, but just about everyone will love it.
