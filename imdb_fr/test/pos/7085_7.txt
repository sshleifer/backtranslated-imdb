"One True Thing" places Zellweger in the middle of a family crisis as an adult journalist who returns home to care for her dying mother (Streep). Dark and stomping, the film examines the adult child's reactions to the adult vision of his parents, which turn out to be something less than the ideal she grew up as a child. An excellent study of character and a production of finds with few mistakes, "OTT" offers three great performances of a trio of great actors and some plaintive reflections on life and death.
