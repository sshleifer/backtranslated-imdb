The story is about a worker (Ann Sothern) who has a rather thoughtless boyfriend (Paul Kelly). This boyfriend is so busy trying to start his own business that he misses appointments again and again or arrives late. The final straw is when Sothern has a birthday and Kelly says he's too busy to take her outside to celebrate. So, not wanting to stay at home, she leaves blindly with what turns out to be a very rich young man (Neil Hamilton). The sparks fly, but it becomes so obvious after Sothern has broken his relationship with Kelly: the new boyfriend Hamilton is a guy "love them and leave them". It is not too difficult to predict how all this will ultimately be solved - suffice it to say that in the end everything is going well. <br /> <br /> This is a very small, very modest film from Columbia Pictures - with a relatively small budget as well as second-rate stars. This is clearly a "movie B" despite the small roles played by Mickey Rooney and Jane Darwell - because the two were not yet famous. Now, that does not mean that they are bad actors or that the production is not good. In fact, given the values ​​of production, this is a pretty amazing movie because everything seems to work so well, despite a fairly ordinary and somewhat predictable plot. It's because the actors and the director have worked really well to tell the story. Moreover, the writers managed to humanize the characters and to worry about them. The end, in particular, is really soft and my tear ducts were practically flowing! Because of these factors, the film wins 7 out of 10.
