This is one of many techno-phobic movies that sprouted like mushrooms in the mid-90s, after the spread of the Internet. <br /> <br /> Hollywood films have always managed to "beautify" the illustrated scenes, to give them a better and more attractive appearance. The same thing happens when Hollywood tries to show us advanced technologies. The result of these attempts varies from very far-fetched and ridiculous (see Hackers (1995), Johnny Mnemonic (1995), etc.) to quite realistic realism (see Sneakers (1992)). <br /> <br /> "The Net" is somewhere between these extremes. Grinding, we can end up with many technical inconsistencies and in many cases where the situation seems to be much more "sexy" and graphic than in reality (as usually happens in movies). <However, by simply neglecting them, the viewer is left with a film that is solid and entertaining enough. The characters and actors are convincing, and the film does a good job keeping you in your place until the end. The plot is correct (fairly classic, really - based on the good old paranoid design, but with a cutting-edge technological advantage), and quite compelling (again, regardless of technical issues). The development of the plot is a little slow, however, and from time to time you can anticipate some supposedly surprising turnings in the plot. <br /> <br /> The bonus here is Sandra Bullock, the pretty little girl who does quite easily, apparently), also represents a solid act. You can really feel his character - his despair, his emotions. <br /> <br /> In the end, the film is entertaining and interesting, its rate oscillates between 7 and 10 on my scale. It's worth renting a video library, or even watching movies. Whether to buy or not, it's up to you.
