Extremely cynical, sarcastic and intense, mocking and imitating the style of Pulp Fiction and stylized gangster movies, Thursday is a thrilling, confusing and hilarious film. A surprisingly eclectic mix of extravagant characters and strangely amusing situations, this day in the life of an armed man who tries to go all right proves to be a valuable addition to the film series that attempts to emulate the genius of Tarantino Pulp Fiction, a masterpiece with dark humor. <br /> <br /> Nick (Aaron Eckhardt) stops at Casey's house (Thomas Jane) to remember the good old days. A former executioner of drug traffickers, Casey has since turned into an architect, married a successful businesswoman (Paula Marshall) and is now considering adopting a child. Nick, who still has links to the gangster gangster, leaves a drug-filled briefcase at Casey's house while he borrows his car to do some errands. an unfinished business. Disgusted and irritated by the introduction of drugs into his home, Casey throws them all into the kitchen sink. It was then, one at a time, that Nick's accomplices, who hit Rastafarian drug messengers and crooked policemen, would all knock on the door for the disturbing Casey, who was about to have an amazing Thursday. <br /> <br /> The movie begins with a hilarious sequence at a gas station in which Nick searches for the best deal for a cup of coffee. After thinking about the size of the cup to get, a fiasco bursts with the cashier when he asks for a free cake at the snack bar and uses a $ 50 bill to pay. The situation is bloody and brilliantly comical, the situation only gets worse when a police officer intervenes and finds himself caught in the most unusual circumstances. This opening segment creates the perfect mood for the rest of the film, which never takes itself too seriously and includes outrageous characters who seem aware of their own existence in this silly gangster movie. <br /> The film is divided into segments according to various events and times of the day. This effect is very similar to Pulp Fiction, which is a similar chapter, although Thursday is not bothered by the chronological order, with the exception of the occasional flashback. Also like Tarantino, the music beautifully introduces each scene and each character. Strangely humorous creatures, such as the hit-man Jamaican pizza delivery man who hits the phone and shares his hashish, and Paulina Porizkova's narcissist Dallas, who tries to rape Casey, add humor to every event, whatever their horror and fascination. the coincidences are. When Mickey Rourke's twisted and cautious policeman Kasarov, Mickey Rourke's twisted and cautious policeman, is presented, the neat layout and intricate layout are perfectly assembled, and Casey's delicate situation becomes even more audacious and commendable. <br /> <br /> Decidedly, a pulp fiction of violence, spiritual dialogue and extremely frightening antagonists, Thursday did things right, but other attempts at tribute may go far enough to suggest a scam. A flashback sequence showing Casey catching villains and wearing a hairstyle that exactly matches that of John Travolta in Pulp Fiction is easily a step away. <br /> <br /> - Mike Massie, www.MoviePulse.net
