From director Billy Wilder (Double Indemnity, The Seven Year Itch, Some like it hot), I can see that it is an under-shown and underrated movie, to see. This is the biographical story of Charles Augustus 'Slim' Lindbergh (James Stewart) who, in 1927, wanted to be the first man to fly solo from New York, crossing the Atlantic Ocean, to reach Paris, in a small cockpit. The first half hour or whatever sees Lindbergh get permission to do so, and the construction of the plane, named "The Spirit of St. Louis", and making all the necessary preparations. So of course, the rest sees his perilous journey through it, overcoming fatigue, near-fuel loss and moments of loss of direction, but he has succeeded. With Murray Hamilton in Bud Gurney, Patricia Smith in Mirror Girl, Bartlett Robinson in Benjamin Frank Mahoney, Robert Cornthwaite in Harry Knight, Sheila Bond as a model / dancer, Marc Connelly in Father Hussman, Arthur Space in Donald Hall, Harlan Warde in Boedecker and Dabbs Greer as Goldsborough. Apparently, Lindbergh was a little younger, so Stewart was a little too old to play, but again, you can not think of anyone else who could do better. It's a spiritual and emotional drama, with Stewart (as always) fantastic, an excellent score by Frank Waxman and a good direction from Wilder, a little-known gem. He was named Oscar for Best Special Effects (the only award ever). James Stewart was number 12 of the 100 biggest stars of the cinema, he was number 3 of the 100 years, 100 stars - Men and he was number 13 of the greatest actor in the world. Very well!
