I bought my first Zep album in 1974 (at age 17) and have become addicted ever since. This DVD has now taken a place of choice in my music collection. It is not often that a group can boast of four virtuosos in its formation, but here we can. Each member made their own contribution to the group, but on the stage together, the electricity generated was more important than the 4 people. This masterpiece covers the entire career of the band, from Led Zep 1 to Coda, and this DVD is beautifully described, with each concert showing how the band has grown bigger and bigger over the years. Recently, my copy has disappeared, but I'm happy to say that it was found in my 17-year-old son's room, while the new generation discovers how awesome these guys were. This is a must for anyone with an appreciation for rock music. Long live Led Zeppelin.
