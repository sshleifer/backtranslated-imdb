Although cartoons and / or references to people or things in the entertainment industry or even product brands are generally the subject of choice in shorts like this, they are not used here in quantity. Most individual gags are rather generic. As I will give you some examples, there will be spoilers below: <br /> <br /> There are only three (well, technically four - there is a quick one at the very end of the cartoon ) that I have spotted, which is a little weak for this type of short film, although it is a featured character with a good amount of activity. These are Jack Benny (like Jack Bunny), Leopold Stowkowski and the inimitable Ned Sparks (as a crab on a chance, chances are pretty good that, if a crab was involved in a Warner Brothers shorts in the years 1930-1940, the caricature would be Ned Sparks). There are also references to Billy Rose's Aquacade and a riff on a radio character called "Henry Aldrich" (Coming, mother!), A play on Superman (Superguy here) and the villain is a flight on "King Kong ". That's all for that kind of gag. <br /> <br /> The products themselves are for the most part generic and gags are more sets of basic items in unusual situations, such as turtles coming out of soup cans to attack the villain as tanks. , cans of tomato soup making "cans", gingerbreads that turn into paratroopers, using paper tissues for parachutes, etc. At this point, the director and although his best work is not far from his best work, do not sneeze. This short film is in Looney Tunes Golden Collection, Volume 3, which is an excellent set that I highly recommend. itself is also recommended.
