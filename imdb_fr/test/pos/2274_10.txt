In Everything Is Illuminated, Elijah Wood plays Jonathan Foer, a Jewish American looking for the woman who saved his grandfather during the Second World War. In a sense, the woman who saved all her family. <br /> <br /> It's a touching story about someone who lives on a seemingly hopeless journey. A stranger in a foreign country so to speak. Jonathan is not quite ready for this adventure, he stands out as a sore thumb in Ukraine (he would probably stand out like a sore thumb anywhere). But what he discovers is much more than he had planned. This movie will make you laugh and make you cry. Elijah Wood is really good in this movie, based on Jonathan Safran Foer's novel. <br /> <br /> From someone I've spoken to, this movie is a bit different from the book. A book I collect is really good. Nevertheless, it is a good movie, there is something for everyone and I really enjoyed it. Can anyone say Oscar?
