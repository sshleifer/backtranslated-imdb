Life was going well for New York artist Ted Kramer. He had a good job and a loving wife. No, actually, his wife did not like it so much, because when Ted came home late from work that night, his wife, Joanna, had a packed suitcase and headed for the door. He tried to stop her, but she had just entered the elevator and was coming out of Ted's life. In addition to his job, he must now look after the house and their 6 year old son, Billy; Ted assured his boss that the departure of his wife would not affect his performance at work. This, however, affected his performance as a father. It exploded when Billy reversed the punch on his client work! Some time later, Ted and Billy received a letter from Joanna, and it was obvious from her letter that she would not be coming back. Ted was helpless. Well, he was coming home late from work for his birthday, which hurt him. <br /> <br /> One day, Ted was late for work and his boss shouted after missing a very important client meeting. When he got home, he shouted at Billy for ice cream during dinner. Then later he told Billy that the break between Joanna and him was perhaps his fault, not Billy's; Ted invited a good friend, Phyllis Bernard, that night. Well, Billy saw a naked woman for the first time. When Ted took Billy to the park the next day, he fell off the jungle gym and landed in front of him in his toy plane. Ted literally took him to the hospital where they had to administer stitches. After that, life started to take a negative spiral for Ted. Then one day, he received a call from none other than Joanna! They met in a corner cafe. At first, they have a nice conversation, then Joanna informs her that she has come back to get her son and take her with her. Ted did not want it and left. Life got worse for Ted when his boss, Jim O'Connor, invited him to lunch and kicked him off. Not only that, but Joanna chose to sue for Billy's custody, and without a job, Ted had no chance to win. He hired himself a lawyer, John Shaunessy, who paid $ 15,000. And that's IF they win. <br /> <br /> Ted has also been able to find a new job. It was actually a step back from what he had done with a considerable salary cut, but he accepted with great determination. Finally, the date of the hearing, January 9, 1980, arrived. Atkins J. presiding. Joanna spoke and Shaunessy asked her why she left Ted, her other relationships and their failures. The next day, Ted went to the bar and Joanna's lawyer made him really grilling like a cheeseburger. Ted's girlfriend, Margaret, also spoke and she really did not help. Well, the judge took the time to think and of course, one day, Shaunessy informs Ted that he lost. Joanna has sole custody of Billy. How typical! Always rule in favor of the mother. Well, Ted and Billy were just devastated by the separation. They had a goodbye in tears when suddenly Joanna stopped. She and Ted have a little conversation and well, rather than just giving the end, let me assure everyone that everything is going well for everyone! <br /> <br /> It was a very good movie. Dustin Hoffman was very good. He has earned this Academy Award. I also saw him in Hook, Meet the Fockers and Rain Man, for which he also won an Oscar. Meryl Streep was good. She also had an Oscar. Justin Henry was good too, so where was his appointment? I guess it was the Academy's policy not to give an Oscar to kids, but it was lifted when Haley Joel Osment arrived. This film has a great drama, a light comedy and is very subtle. It holds your attention well. I watched Rain Man on the TCM TV channel the other night, then it happened afterwards and I could not help but watch. And that's what you should do. If you like Dustin Hoffman or Meryl Streep or movies like that, then I recommend Kramer against Kramer! A captivating film about the pains of two divorced parents arguing over their child. I liked Ted's little talk about advocating for mothers all the time. What made sex a good parent? In fact, that's how they have the child. But seriously, he's right. Why always rule in favor of the mother because she is a woman? Also in the cast, George Coe, Howard Duff, died in 1990, and Howland Chamberlain, died in 1984. Watch rookie JoBeth Williams in the nudity in the hallway. Anyway, see Kramer vs Kramer today !!! Good movie !! <br /> <br /> -
