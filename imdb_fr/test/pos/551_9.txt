Natile Portman and Susan Sarandon play against each other like a symphony in this story about the story of a girl sentenced to life as the daughter of one of the craziest women you will ever meet. Sarandon has this ability, call it talent if you want, to play some of the most offbeat characters and put their humanity at the forefront of any film she makes. As the mother of this brilliant girl and muteness beyond her years, Sarandon alternates between being a mother and being a child with the ease of a classical dancer. More importantly, she does it with force and brilliance without compromising Portman's portrayal of the girl. The question is always asked when we deconstruct the plot of the film, which changes? This film certainly talks about the girl, but if you look closely at the dreams and sacrifices that mom makes you understand, she understands that she changes at the same rate as her daughter. I'm willing to bet that all spectators change as well. The mark of the beautiful drama
