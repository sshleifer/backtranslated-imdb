From the first to the last scene of the film, the director Visconti excels in his art, insofar as he is assured that the film will remain a cultural treasure for God alone. It's a perfection - as a film, that is to say, but the story has some minor flaws. <br /> <br /> Thomas Mann's novel is also a perfect work of art, so it's impossible to integrate it into another medium. Visconti follows the story pretty much, and only when he allows himself to deviate slightly does the transition falter. And regardless of the quality of the landscape, the tension in the air between the characters, the hundreds of subtle signals and allegories, the almost unbearably high service of Mahler's music - and yet, the tiny anomalies of the plot disturb me. <br /> <br /> Maybe I'm just a victim of man's desire to do evil without blemish. Nevertheless, I will give an example that I consider crucial. <br /> <br /> WARNING: SPOILERS <br /> <br /> In Mann's story, Aschenbach eats strawberries that probably contain the disease that will kill him. , having abandoned his frustrated pursuit of the boy Tadzio in Venice. Unable to catch a pleasure, he settles for another - which poisons him. It's very subtle in the book, but it's there. The fruit defended, so to speak, but rather a sign that he abandons life itself. <br /> <br /> In Visconti's film, he also eats strawberries, but in a rather insignificant scene at the edge of the beach. The hunt in Venice ends in a much more melodramatic way. It works, too, but lacks subtlety and symbolism on many levels, which gives food for thought. <br /> <br /> But everything is forgiven, when the film allows us to enjoy beautiful landscapes, faces and constellations, and certainly as many other symbols that we can eventually digest - the last gesture of Tadzio, standing in the water, constituting the final as sublime and mysterious.
