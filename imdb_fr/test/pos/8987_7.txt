This film begins as a T'n'A university film, but becomes rather ugly after the main character's sister has been raped by a biker gang driving a van. It has a good rhythm and James Van Patten does a very good job in this duty-free film from Canon. It's the first movie I've ever seen at Parkway Drive-in here in Toronto. The main feature was "Alphabet City", and "Young Warriors" was added. Of the two films, "Young Warriors" was far more entertaining and memorable. If you're a fan of explosive and violent movies, this one would make a great addition to any collection.
