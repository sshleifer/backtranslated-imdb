It kept me on the edge of my seat. The story has some holes, but his tension, his director is constantly questioning its principle, is simply fascinating. <br /> <br /> José Coronado and Adriana Ozores are two of the best Spanish actors (see La vida mancha and Héctor) and they are a happy couple in the upper middle class. Underneath all, the truth is that the whole life of Coronado is a lie. He is not an economist, he has never been to university or does not work in the reserve of the Spanish central bank, as everyone believes. We have some ideas about how he kept appearances or did it, and even if he is not very plausible, he is still credible. <br /> <br /> The internal functioning of the scam is shown intermittently, but is credible because Coronado is a source of assurance and assertiveness. He does not only believe in the scam, he also believes in the premise of the film, and therefore he wears it. <br /> <br /> Of course, this puts to the test the belief that a woman would not know the inner workings of a marriage's finances for almost 10 years, but again, since it is supposed to to be a brilliant economist. <br /> <br /> It was said, in a nationalistic tone, that the film was not "distinctly Spanish", as if it was a litmus test for a good movie. Certainly, no castanets or strange cabbins in this one, just a tense thriller. You will want to know how this story ends once you start watching.
