This is my favorite Columbo. Martin Landau (excellent!) Plays twins, one of whom may have committed murder. This Columbo is unusual because the usual murder scene at first gives you no idea who did it! Peter Falk is as usual in this episode written by Steven Bochco (who also wrote "Murder by the Book", my second favorite episode). The following actors are very nice, especially Julie Newmar (very underestimated) and Jeanette Nolan, the hostess Columbo continues to upset. The surname of Martin Landau's characters is "Paris". It was the surname of Leonard Nimoy's character in Mission Impossible. Coincidence? Or a Steven Bochco joke?
