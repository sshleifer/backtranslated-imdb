It was fine, except for two things I will mention at the end. The animation is excellent, underlined by Nick Park and the trademark of the exaggerated teething of the characters, which make you laugh almost every time you see someone. The color was so beautiful. <br /> <br /> The best part of the movie, however, is the comedy's intelligence. It's another one of those animated movies in which there is so much to see and hear in each picture that it would take a lot of viewing to capture all the gags. It's just an odd, exaggerated look at the intruder "Wallace" and his silent and intelligent "Gromit" dog. On the way, it stings the heads of people who get excited about their kitchen gardens, which resembles the way obsessed dog lovers were portrayed in "Best Of Show". Today's movies, whether animated or not: 1 - give the film clerk a real idiot; 2 - exaggerate the final action scene with the predictable result, but exaggeratedly. Other than that, it's still a very fun movie that should make a lot of people laugh and a movie to enjoy many times.
