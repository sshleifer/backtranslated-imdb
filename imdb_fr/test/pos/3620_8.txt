Obviously, it is done cheaply to take advantage of the famous "Mandingo", this piece crassly imploring a curse beautifully Italian rancid Italian sexploitation that really pours on the sordid things with a laudable lack of taste and restraint: the arrogant white family who owns and operates a sumptuous slave plantations spend most of their time on the screen engaging in hanky panky and their various slaves. The director Mario Penzauti and the screenwriter Tecla Romanelli swarm this foul excess of crackling: we have an odious rape, an interracial copulation (a white lady makes love with a muscular black stallion while he is tied to a cross), a copious woman nakedness, brutal lashings, vile degradation, a lot of dark sex and a tragic and twisted ending that mixes elements of incest, murder and half-breeds in a questionable attempt to make a statement about the awful inhumanity of the 'slavery. Special thanks go to the crazy brunette actress Paola D'Egidio, whose vigorous and uninhibited portrayal of the wicked wicked depraved and lascivious Rhonda positively burns the screen. Moreover, Marcello Giombini's brilliant and thrilling score is striking. The rather careful cinematography of Maurizo Centini is also the case. A perfectly saturated piece of sticky oozing.
