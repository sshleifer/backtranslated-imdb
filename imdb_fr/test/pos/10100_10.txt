Many horror fans complain that horror has barely progressed in the last twenty years. I was inclined to accept this until the arrival of Asian horror movies, trend certainly dull. However, he produced true classics, and A Tale Of Two Sisters is, for me at least, an exceptional film and perhaps the best horror film in a long time. <br /> <br /> Based vaguely on a Korean tale, it tells the sad story of two sisters suffering from mental disorders and residing with their father and their mother-in-law. After experiencing some problems on their first night at home, they decide to stay together and deny their mother-in-law access to their loved ones. The tension is rising and there is the inevitable slamming. But what happens after that requires more than a pair of eyes, because the story takes several twists and fears become more emotional and real. In the end, you may need a few moments to absorb all this and restore it to your mind, but it is precisely this horror-mystery couple that exceeds the definitions of these genres and makes it an instant classic. One to watch again and again, if only to solve the problem.
