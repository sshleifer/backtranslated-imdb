I just got it and it's a great movie !! I liked it! Although the voice of Jane Brightons at first is so annoying because of her suspenders, she does not open her mouth panicked ... but you have to watch it because it's a great movie! the things he says here are so funny and extremely cute !! and I'm sure Aaron would probably say some things in real life because I do not know, it just seems like that !! ha ha ha there's a part in the movie that's really funny ... it's Jane's little sister who meets him ... but I can not tell you what's going on because I just have to leave you see for yourself !! I went to see Aaron's concert n and it was so much fun !! n he felt so good ha ha ... I still can not believe that I met him !!! I have pictures if someone wants to see them !! Steph
