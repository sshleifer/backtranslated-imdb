Seeing this film reminded me of memories of September 11th. The first thing I remember that morning was seeing television footage of a plane flying in a large building, and my immediate thought was, "Must be a taste of a new Tom Clancy movie." <br /> <br /> It was not a Tom Clancy movie. It certainly was not a British version of "The Sum Of All Fears". The film or novel typical of Tom Clancy has a relatively small cast, a linear plot and usually a resolution. This movie had neither one nor the other. Of course, what I saw directly on the screen was a small cast, a plot and a vague resolution, but, like 9/11, the fact was that the reality was so much bigger and more complex. <br /> <br /> I work in systems planning, and the reality of the disaster preparedness exercise, and the disaster itself, is painfully obvious. It is impossible to prepare for such a disaster and it will no longer be possible to face this situation when that happens. <br /> <br /> The argument between the police (the preparation is insufficient) and the politicians (To give a gas mask to everybody on the tube would cause the panic), to the constant announcements of the loudspeakers ( you are not risking your health, but do not go home before decontaminating yourself), and (do not eat, drink, or smoke before decontaminating yourself), I was on the edge throughout the movie . Not the slightest desire to channel the surf. <br /> <br /> This film lasts 90 minutes. It could have been double and not yet shown all the details possible. Instead, he left enough unspoken to allow each of us to imagine the details, each in his own way. It made it so much more real to me than any Tom Clancy movie. <br /> <br /> I lived in London once, and right next to Edgeware Road. And I took the train from Waterloo Station several times. Looking at Dirty War, I kept telling myself that this is only fiction. At the moment. <br /> <br /> If Allah and Jehovah so wish, this film will remain a fiction and, in 20 or 30 years, my nephews may watch this film and remember the beginning of the 21st century and the panic we Feel too much. . I hope, to the same extent that I feel at the moment, when I saw memories of the cold war with the bad communist regime of the mid-twentieth century and that we remember the exercises "Drop and Cover" at school .
