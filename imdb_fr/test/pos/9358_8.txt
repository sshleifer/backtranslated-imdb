"Crossfire" is a deservedly famous 1947 black that is a mystery of murder with a strong message. It stars Robert Young, Robert Mitchum, Robert Ryan, Sam Levene and Gloria Grahame, and is strongly led by Edward Dmytryk. We witness the murder in the shadows at the beginning, and for the rest of the film, Young, as detective Finlay, in charge of the case, seeks to determine which of the three soldiers is responsible for the death, and what is also important. , Why. The victim, Samuels Sam (Sam Levene) is a person that soldiers meet in a bar. they go up to his apartment to continue their visit and Samuels ends up being dead. <br /> <br /> I do not know for 1947, but seeing "Crossfire" today, we know who did it and why to the minute see the suspects. I do not suppose it was so obvious at the time, because these actors had just started. Nevertheless, the film has a lot of punch with its powerful acting, its good direction, its violence and its ruthless anti-Semitic language. <br /> <br /> The characters are very clear, including that of Gloria Grahame in a small woman who meets Mitchell (George Cooper), one of the suspicious soldiers, in a bar and can provide an alibi. The great performance in the film belongs to Robert Ryan, but everyone is excellent. Robert Young is particularly effective as a tough but smart police detective. Mitchum is very friendly as a soldier trying to help his confused friend, Mitchell, a lonely man who does not know if he still has feelings for his wife. <br /> <br /> Really excellent and must see.
