WrestleMania 6 took place on April 1, 1990 at the SkyDome in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. <br /> <br /> Match 1: Rick Martel vs. Koko B. Ware - For what it was, a very solid opening match. Koko has always been quite popular with fans, and by that time, Martel was still becoming a talented heel. In the end, Martel is able to win the victory in a nice, non-memorable match. <br /> <br /> Match 2: The Colossal Connection (Andre The Giant & Haku) (c) (with Bobby 'The Brain' Heenan) vs. Demolition (Ax & Smash) for the WWF Team Championship - À At this point, André's health was really horrible, so his performance was not that great. The crowd is 100% Pro Demolition in this match. In the end, Haku is pinned and we have new team champions. After the match, Andre exposes Haku and Heenan and faces what will become his last WrestleMania. <br /> <br /> Match 3: Earthquack vs. Hercules - Very short match. The big, dominant heels were very popular at the time. TEAR. to both men in the match. John Tenta (earthquake) happened not so long ago and so with Hercules. In the end, the earthquake assures the victory to Hercules. <br /> <br /> Match 4: Mr. Perfect vs. Brutus "The Barber" Beefcake - The first very good match of the night. TEAR. to Curt Henning (Mr. Perfect). Really strong back and forth action of these two talented guys. In the end, Brutus won with the support of his fans during the match. <br /> <br /> Match 5: Roddy Piper 'Rowdy' vs. Bad News Brown - Not a technical classic, but rather decent fight for WrestleMania. Piper fate half black / half white in what is considerably a classic moment. In the end, the two guys fight for the double without any winner. <br /> <br /> Match 6: The Hart Foundation vs. The Bolsheviks - Full Squash Match. The Hart Foundation gets an easy victory. Match 7: The Barbarian vs. Tito Santana - Bobby Heenan's "Heenan Family" is getting better in this match as The Barbarian wins the victory against Tito Santana. Not memorable, but good to go back and look years later. <br /> <br /> Match 8: Randy Savage & Sensational Sherri vs. Dusty Rhodes & Sapphire - Great team match between the sexes. Dusty Rhodes wears uncomfortable polka dot outfit in the ring. In the end, Rhodes and Sapphire win the victory over "The Macho King" and the Sensational Queen Sherri. <br /> <br /> Match 9: The Rockers vs. The Orient Express - Surprisingly, another team match. The tag fight was so much better during this period. A young Shawn Michaels and his partner Marty Jannetty compete against the Orient Express. <br /> <br /> Match 10: Dino Bravo against Jim Duggan - Duggan reacts decently, despite his American Patriot trick. Bravo, a member of Jimmy Hart's band, arrives in the ring with Hart and Earthquake. Although he has the support, Duggan wins. <br /> <br /> Match 11: "The million dollar man" Ted DiBiase (c) against Jake 'The Snake' Roberts for the Million Dollar Championship - The first major event of the night. Roberts was extremely finished with the fans. The match was pretty good for what it was. DiBiase is able to win a win over Roberts. But Roberts ends up owning DiBiase's money and giving it away. <br /> <br /> Match 12: The Big Boss Man vs. Akeem (with Slick) - The sad attempt of One Man Gang to be an African dream named Akeem. A really short match that needed more time to develop as a match. Boss Man wins with a slam. <br /> <br /> Match 13: Jimmy "Superfly" Snuka vs. Rick Rude - Heenan enters the ring with Rude for this game. Snuka, it never really went well at WrestleMania. He always seemed to be on the losing side. After just five minutes, Rude wins Snuka. <br /> <br /> Match 14: Hulk Hogan, WWF Champion, Intercontinental World Champion The Ultimate Warrior - Nicknamed "The Ultimate Challenge", we offer exciting promotions to both men earlier in the night. The match was actually very good, as people tend to think that Hogan can not fight. Many nearby falls that have really attracted the crowd and people watching at home. In the end, Warrior wins the victory over Hogan and wins both titles. Hulk Hogan suffered his first defeat at WrestleMania.
