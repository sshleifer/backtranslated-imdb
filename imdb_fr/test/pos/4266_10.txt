It's a movie that everyone living in Sweden should watch. The film shows the political riots that took place in Gothenburg in 2001 from a new angle. It includes interviews with people who have been sentenced, where these people have the first chance, after the riots, to tell their story and explain why they think the world can be a better place to live. and be part of. I react emotionally when I see this because I feel so angry about the way these people were treated during the riots but also after the riots. because it really makes you think: is it possible? In Sweden, a democracy in 2001?
