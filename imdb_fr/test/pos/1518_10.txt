All simply magnificent. One of the best minds - uh ... screws - in existence. Rickman and Stowe both play their part in this story of a writer of children's books who - maybe? - wrote a subversive tract. Moscow could learn some of the torture techniques described in this film. They could also do worse than hire Alan Rickman. Five out of five stars and currently (1-20-2000) # 2 on my list of the 100 best movies of all time.
