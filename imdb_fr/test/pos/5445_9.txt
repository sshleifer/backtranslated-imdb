I completely disagree with the other comments! Me too, I saw this film at the beginning of a projection and I found it quite pleasant. Robin Williams is in great shape. True, the tone is familiar, but it's Williams of Good Morning Vietnam: smart, funny, about. After too many dark turns, Williams has finally returned to what he does best. Supporting actors give great performances, especially Laura Linney and Chris Walken. Chris plays himself, as usual, but as "agent" of the next president, he was a delight every time on the screen. Lewis Black plays only himself, but he is wonderfully well used here. There is also a fun tour of Jeff Goldblum. The film is also more than what the trailer suggests. The film is funny, but it's not pure comedy as suggested. There is a thriller line, which everyone should seriously consider, especially if you pay attention to the newspaper.
