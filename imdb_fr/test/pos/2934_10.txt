"Americans Next Top Model" is the best reality show! I had fun 99.9% of the time watching it. I kept my eyes open all the time. (well, I blinked) It can be sad, funny or addictive (mostly addictive) "America's Next Top Model" made me want to have more and that's about the goal. It's also on more than one channel. Sometimes it's on MTV, but it's not always the case. I hope this will attract more fans and become a hit series! It's great for just about any age so everyone can enjoy it! :) <br /> <br /> Also, if you've ever watched the show, have not you noticed that Tyra has a different hairstyle every time in the Judges Room? She will have a short and curly week, then long and right the following week.
