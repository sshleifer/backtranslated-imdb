Finally, a gangster movie is worth watching! <br /> <br /> Jennifer Tily should be nominated for her role as murderous and deadly woman! <br /> <br /> Gangster Mayhem! <br /> <br /> Jennifer Tily is so beautiful and so bad in this movie. <br /> <br /> I was shocked to find Faye Dunaway still alive! The actors in this film are so adapted to their roles. <br /> <br /> A really cool soundtrack passes by and you are immersed in the Spanish soul of this film. <br /> <br /> The story is original, deep and poetic. <br /> <br /> This film has a lot of substance and never rests. <br /> <br /> The Spanish strip of fire just lit all the fire. <br /> <br /> Damian Chapa is a joy to watch and a movie Star. <br /> <br /> Sit back and enjoy the walk.
