"Family Guy" is probably the most amazing sitcom ever produced. He brews relentlessly everything he can think of, from television series to family series. Best of all, it's one of the few TV shows today that's really fun. <br /> <br /> The show revolves around the Griffins: Peter, the obese father whose stratagems are limited by his lack of intelligence. Lois, the mother who is more or less the head of the family, even if Peter considers himself as such. Chris, the teenage fat son who has as little brains as his father. Meg, the black sheep of the family that jokes everyone. Stewie, the baby who plans to kill his mother and conquer the world. And Brian, the family dog, who is often the voice of reason but is often corrupt. <br /> <br /> "The guy" uses many tactics to make the audience laugh. The most remarkable are the frequent cuts that distort what has just been said. They are effective because of the impeccable timing and the way they unfold. "Family Guy" uses parodies to get humor too, most often from 80s TV shows. What really makes the series so great is that a person does not have to be familiar with what she simulates. I'm sure it would help, but the material is pretty funny in itself. But the show does not stop there. Not only does he parody almost everything, but he blocks his own periodontics! The show is filled with offbeat humor. The only reason people are not very upset about the show is probably because it makes fun of all races, genders and generalities. There is nothing sacred here, and nothing and nothing is safe from the satirical blows of "Family Guy". <br /> <br /> The composition of musical numbers in a film takes a lot of time and effort, and is very risky. But "Family Guy" contains very good songs. All well written and interpreted, and of course, they are hilarious (perhaps the most famous, "The Freakin 'FCC" is both catchy and hysterical as it hits the evaluation board where it hurts). <br /> <br /> The vocal characterizations are exact on the money. Seth McFarlane is extremely talented. He provides the voices for Peter, Brian (who is his own natural voice) and Stewie. Not only are the voices coherent and creative, but they can change their tone at will. It seems that they have been pronounced by three different actors. Alex Borstein brings Lois a perfect nasal print for the character. Seth Green is unrecognizable as Chris (if I had not watched IMDb, I would never have known it was him). Lacey Chabert created Meg's character and, although she was good, Mila Kunis really raised the character with her high-pitched voice. Kunis gives Meg a new, more specific advantage she did not have with Chabert. <br /> <br /> "Family Guy" has been compared to "The Simpsons" and that's quite understandable (and not just because they are produced by FOX). Both are satires of blue-collar life, and although "The Simpsons" is good, "Family Guy" contains are sharper. The show is absolutely without fear. There is no real sacred cow. The program suffers from disabilities (physical and mental), ethnicities, TV shows and movies, celebrities, politicians, religions (especially Catholicism), addictions and drug addiction, Sexual humor of all kinds (including the S & M), and others that are without any description. Everything that "Family Guy" throws on the public does not work, but overall, the show is always fun and often hilarious. <br /> <br /> If there is any problem with "Family Guy", it's just that the jokes keep spinning. way too long sometimes. Especially with the "awkward moment" jokes, the sequences are stretched so long that not only does it stop becoming funny, but it becomes so annoying (and long) that a fast forward button is justified. These can be effective between 10 and 15 seconds, but the series sometimes exceeds them beyond two minutes. It could be argued that the series rewrites its rules according to the plot, and this is often the case (for example, Brian often behaves like a person, but he always acts like a dog when the story requires it). But that's not a problem, because the series still works. <br /> <br /> Some people have claimed that the series has stopped being funny. Although I agree that it is not as nervous as before, I think the fault lies with FOX, and not with McFarlane and his crew. The show was created by FOX, but after mediocre ratings and public participation, it was canceled. However, DVD sales were sufficient to be captured by Adult Swim. The show is an immediate success and is back bought by FOX. However, because the series is so important right now, FOX is afraid to let the screenwriters experiment and try new things. Although it's funny, the humor is not so fresh and nervous. <br /> <br /> Do not miss this show. It's awesome.
