Great Charlie Chaplin comedy. I've seen 4 major Chaplin movies (Gold Rush, City Lights, Modern Times and The Great Dictator), and I think it's easily the funniest of the four. This movie made me laugh more than almost everyone else I've ever seen. According to the very first disclaimer ("Any similarity between the dictator and the owner of the barber is pure coincidence"), the film is a laugh with a mixture of verbal humor and great. And at the same time, Chaplin succeeds in portraying the evils of totalitarian persecution. Maybe a little short on the end and the topic of the topic, but easily a 9 out of 10 for me.
