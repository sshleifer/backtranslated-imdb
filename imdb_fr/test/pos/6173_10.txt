A magnificent film, cleverly shot in the detail of the time of the war and (considering it takes place during the Second World War) with minimal violence. <br /> <br /> A small distribution revolves around the occupation of Czechoslovakia, the separation of their loved ones at the departure of the pilots for England (the separation of the spaniel will touch the hearts), scenes of spitting, love, friendship and betrayal. The theme of betrayal is omnipresent in the film, from the betrayal of love to the betrayal of friendship, to the betrayal shown by the communist regime to former RAF pilots of the post-war period. <br /> Especially since it is so factually accurate. I would recommend it to everyone.
