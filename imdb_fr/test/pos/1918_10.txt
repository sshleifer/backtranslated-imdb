Well done documentary about a sailing race, mental health and the loss of both. <br /> <br /> I remembered reading Sir Francis Chichester's story about his trip around the world as I watched this film in high school. what an adventure it was. <br /> <br /> Deep water tells an equally fascinating story. <br /> <br /> It takes a special person and an excellent navigator to organize a nonstop world tour ... alone. <br /> <br /> This film does a great job demonstrating that. <br /> <br /> I like to sail and my brother runs the J-30. <br /> <br /> but I could never accomplish such a feat.
