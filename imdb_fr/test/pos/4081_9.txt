As a merchant ex-sailor, the film was of great interest to me: I personally took part in a clandestine search outside Kingston, Jamaica, where a person was found. We managed to land it because we were within territorial limits. On another boat, I was on the stowaway that was found and we could not land anywhere because of passport / nationality issues. In fact, he stayed one year as an almost "honorary" crew member and worked for his gift. Africa is notorious for clandestine vans. There is a big scene at the beginning of the film when the bulk carrier enters the African port: its size is the best. The crew arrives for a small sexual intercourse and an intoxication. Until then normal. The tragedy begins when the stowaways enter the vast cavernous holds of the ship. Joss Ackland is brilliant as captain with a drinking problem being harassed by his right Nemesis Suchet as a representative of the company on board. The search for stowaways is classic, but we did not have rifles. I question the use of firearms in this film. This ship seemed to have a vast arsenal. In my experience, firearms at sea are extremely limited because of customs regulations. It is also strange to have a dog on board. Anti-rabies laws, especially in Europe, severely limit the transportation of animals. Anyway, Pertwee is as bright as his embittered companion. The horror that follows the discovery of the victims is unbearable: the dark metallic background of the ships holds and the feeling that there is no place to hide adds to the drama. Some cargo crew members are not involved in the killings and those who get involved are gradually sucked into a world of violence where there is no way to escape. The pursuit of the ship, especially the scenes of the room machines, are "at the edge of the seat": the feeling of extreme claustrophobia abounds. The sensation of metal pressing and death being no more than a cannon. The film is brutal: my girlfriend had to stop watching during the shooting and filming scenes. Although this happens, Suchet, from the comfort of his well-appointed cabin, will get drunk unconsciously from the 3 decks below. It's a film under tension, with flaws, but the real message is that we can all be sucked into such violence. Slowly and surely. Think of the train drivers who took Jews to Auschwitz, the clerks who worked out the train schedule. I still remember someone who visited the Dachau concentration camp at the end of the war and said that one of the South American guards had a bird table in front of the camp's crematorium. This film is like this: ordinary people suddenly find themselves in a world of unstoppable violence!
