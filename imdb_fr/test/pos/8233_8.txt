This one is a very solid Randolph Scott Western. He plays Bat Masterson and goes to the Kansas Liberal to clear the city. He befriends Robert Ryan, who played a very direct role. Only after that did Robert Ryan start playing much darker roles. In fact, in 1947, Randolph Scott shot another film that was not a western and never did westerns until his retirement in 1962. This film has a good rhythm and rises regularly until its peak. I can not say more, it would give the plot. Make sure to see this one. 8/10
