In fact, I discovered Favela Rising via the IMDb website. I am particularly interested in Afro-Brazilian culture and films. Favela Rising is one of those jewels that gives a new meaning to human transformation. Beautifully documented and filmed by Jeff Zimbalist and Matt Mochary, this is the story of Anderson Sa, a former drug dealer from Rio De Janeiro who, after the deaths of family members and friends, becomes a Christ, like Malcolm X and Ghandi. Her formed AfroReggae, a grassroots cultural movement that uses Afro-Brazilian hiphop, capoeira drumming (Afro-Brazilian martial arts) and other forms of art to turn desperate and often angry youth into a loving person, alive, viable and caring. > <br /> A few years ago, I remember attending the screening of Cidade De Deus (City of God) and leaving the theater completely numb. The images were dark and yet amazing and you could not leave the eyes of the eye. I remember how hopeless the situations in the favelas were and how decadent society was because of the negligence of governments. How drug trafficking was a way of life, how slum citizens were indifferent because death was daily. Like City Of God, Anderson Sa recounts how the inhabitants of the favelas have also been desensitized. He talks about the corruption of the police and how the communities were so immobilized by drugs and gangs that you could not visit family members from other favelas that you had to meet in a neutral place. AfroReggae, the popular movement of City of God, offers solutions to anger, desperation. <br /> <br /> There was a part of the documentary in which Anderson, in the spirit of a preacher, invited young AfroReggae. This blas√© youth was so marked by the survival and the violence of every day. Their models were drug traffickers and that's what they wanted. Anderson then said that drug traffickers do not live very long. There was of course some reluctance, but five months later, he managed to convince some of the youth to join AfroReggae. <br /> <br /> The images of Favela Rising are unheard of. It's clear to me that Jeff Zimbalist and Matt Mochary are not only great narrators, but also visual artists. It is a documentary to see absolutely! This documentary contains truly magical and transforming moments. I do not want to spoil them for you. I want you to see it yourself. Talk about this wonderful movie to your friends, academics, youth counselors and family members. This will make you love the world and our children. <br /> <br /> I would give him eleven stars!
