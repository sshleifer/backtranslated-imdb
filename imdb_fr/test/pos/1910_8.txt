Dolemite is a blaxploitation film about Dolemite and her army of kung-fu killer women, led by Queen Bee. He is fighting to get his club, The Total Experience, from Willie Green using their kung fu skills and devotion to him. I liked this film because of the spiritual dialogue and the use of Rudy Ray Moore's ability to preach to his nursery rhymes.
