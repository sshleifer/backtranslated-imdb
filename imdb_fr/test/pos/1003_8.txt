So, keira knightly is in ... So, automatically, we compare this film to the certificate. Apart from the fact that this film is also in time of war and that its appearance is uncontrollable, these films are totally different. <br /> <br /> Actors work well, I think one good thing is that there is no memorable person, they are a team. <br /> <br /> If you want a movie in which things are happening, that's why, advise another one, because his story is about human interactions and their damaged physical through their experiences and the connections that unite their lives. <br /> <br /> This film has an authentic interaction, perfect break moments that hold your breath. No, it's not exciting, but it's exciting if you can empathize with these characters. At times, I wondered if this film could have been better as a play than as a movie. We expect a lot of films because everything is possible, but with the theater, we allow interaction and rely on our convictions. <br /> <br /> There are problems if you are looking for a blockbuster, if you are not looking for anything. and allow the film to take you, to move, to allow you to forget these stars and not to judge them as actors, but to let them become people, you will be really moved. <br /> <br /> GO! ! Try!
