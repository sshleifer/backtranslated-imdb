Terrific is a short movie starring Mary Astor as an energetic company struggling to become a struggling paper company, but when the owner has to sell for health reasons, she offers a system that allows employees to 'buy the business with a foolish salesman (Robert Ames) as "front", even if it is the brain. <br /> <br /> Of course, he is a great success and she becomes the executive secretary, while continuing to lead everything and give him lessons. She loves drugs, but he never manages to have fun with a string of bimbos. She is pursued by a married but separated man, Ricardo Cortez, who is not free. But when a citizen of society catches Ames, everything goes to hell. <br /> <br /> Astor is simply beautiful as a smart woman who almost makes a big mistake after losing her man. Ames is good as the jolt (but what does she see in him?), And Cortez is good but does not have much to do. Kitty Kelly is good as the girlfriend, Dolores. Charles Sellon is the original owner, Cather Dale Owen is the daughter of the company and Edna Murphy is funny like Daisy. <br /> <br /> Worth the detour.
