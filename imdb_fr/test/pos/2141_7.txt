I've been a fan of Heaven's Gate since it was first published. I have seen it at least half a dozen times and have long considered it a masterpiece. It is with enthusiasm and anticipation that I went to see the cup of the restored director. <br /> <br /> To my surprise, I was disappointed to see her again and since then I have reviewed my estimate of the film. Heaven's Gate touches on greatness in places, but on the whole, it lacks the thematic and narrative coherence and the passionate urgency of a real great film. <br /> <br /> First of all, two technical problems: the sound quality is diffused throughout the film, curling the inaudibility at times. Part of this, perhaps, is intentional - a way to mimic the chaos and confusion of the story as it unfolds. But at key moments, it's impossible to record what the characters say. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is also diffuse. The images lack sharpness and detail. The result is a certain grain and a lack of pictorial clarity that succeeds in blurring the foreground and the background. <br /> <br /> Structurally, the story is always distorted, as if Cimino could not decide. the effect it is after. He wanted an epic, for sure. But a pastoral or dramatic epic? The film is uncomfortable and unconvincing between styles and perhaps even genres. It reminded me sometimes of "Days of Heaven" or even "Elvira Madigan" by Terrence Malick, in its slow rhythm and elegant painting scenes. At other times, it may turn into a robust "western", closer to the "Wild Bunch". In fact, this last film is an instructive point of reference for the evaluation of "Heaven's Gate" because it shares the same concern of the same period and uses a similar tone of ambivalent nostalgia for a darker and more heroic America. <br /> <br /> This structural and thematic uncertainty is not facilitated by the mediocre quality of the script, which often sounds forced and painful. The result is an inauthentic sense of the period discourse. <br /> <br /> The quasi-grandeur of the door of paradise resides in its centerpieces. The roller skating sequence, in particular, is incredibly beautiful, one of the most evocative scenes ever filmed. <br /> <br /> Another play that works very well in terms of the unifying theme, ambience and setting occurs when Kristofferson and Huppert go to the lake aboard the new platform and she wash while taking a nap in the shade. The slow rhythm, the evocative music and the monumental decorations combine in this scene to convincingly represent the love story that may well be at the heart of the film - and that could have been his saving grace if he were pursued from more convincing way. <br /> <br /> Some critics have complained about the length of the film. That in itself does not bother me. A good movie can not be long enough. The restored minutes are essential to restore the motivation and characterization of the cut-out version, and they are full of pictorial interests. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the main glory of Heaven's Gate lies in the evocative soundtrack. The repeated waltz pattern and its different notes (full band, guitar, solo violin, etc.) give a bewitching quality to the foreground action and establish a thematic coherence that is missing in the narrative itself. <br /> <br /> Despite its obviousness. defects, including the lack of a compelling story, gives the film a sense of grandeur. We leave the cinema with a sad sense of greatness missed and a wish that Cimino can see the film again - with the wisdom of time and recoil, to right what is wrong.
