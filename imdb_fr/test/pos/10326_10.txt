The entire civilized world now knows that this is where Emil Sitka says his immortal "Hold on, inseparable." But Shemp Howard, a music teacher, steals the show. Watch him lecture Dee Green as she breaks the "Voices of Spring". Watch Shemp shave in front of a mirror suspended from the ceiling by a string. Watch him be fooled by Christine McIntyre. Look at it and you will laugh and learn. Moe is not left either. Watch him as he tries to get a woman to sit on a bear trap. Larry, as usual, is the Zen master of the reaction. All in all, one of the best Stooge shorts. You will not find a weak moment.
