Anyone who has worked in a hospital or medical facility should appreciate this film. The plot is absolutely wild but entertaining from start to finish. The acting is superb. George C. Scott is a brilliant doctor but a class A failure as husband, father. Diana Riggs, a sex symbol from the 1960s and 1970s (from The Avengers), saves him on his own. The surrounding distribution is superb and the dialogue quite amusing. I think I enjoyed the movie more by watching it on the 4th, 5th or 6th. the time because I caught a lot more of the richness of the dialogue and the interaction of the characters. It's worth it to see again and again. You simply will not want to register at a hospital in the near future.
