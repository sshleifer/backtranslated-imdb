First, those with a weak heart should absolutely avoid this film. Even those, like me, who are insensitive to most violent graphic and sexual acts in movies should be wary. I'm not telling you to deviate from the film, but know that what you are about to see is a worrying matter. It's certainly not a nice film to watch, but nothing is displayed on the screen in a way that's shocking. But I must admit that when I watched the movie a second time, I had to move on to the next chapter when the "razor blade scene" was put in place. <br /> <br /> The main character is one of the most unpleasant sympathetic characters I can think of, but we begin to better understand the humanity of his character later in the second act of the film. In one scene, she stuffs broken glass into her student's jacket pocket after being unhappy with her seemingly unsatisfactory performance and getting nervous in front of an audience. The student goes in her pocket and screams in pain as she looks at her hand stained with blood. Beside the scene of the razor blade, it disturbed me the most. The student's mother is not much more friendly than she is. When she learns that her daughter will not be able to play, she talks about it as if she had also injured her hand, one of those spoiled mothers who was trying to torture her daughter to become an oversized girl . <br /> <br /> Although the film intrigued me and aroused my interest in large part, I felt the need to be better explained about the character of Isabelle Huppert. When a woman is fascinated by sadomasochistic porn movies and she adopts this behavior herself, you want to understand the root of the problem. The film establishes that she desperately wants to be loved. So why this hateful attitude towards everyone? Why does she receive the sexual pleasure of pain? <br /> <br /> The acting is great and I liked the bright and stylish lighting. Overall, it's not a movie I would recommend if you're in the mood for entertainment, but as I said, it's very intriguing. And I'm sure if I looked at it several more times, I could spot some subtleties that will further illuminate certain aspects of the film that I did not understand at first. <br /> <br /> My score: 7 (out of 10)
