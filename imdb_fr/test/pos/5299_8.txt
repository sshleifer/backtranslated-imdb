I recently watched this movie and decided to comment on it. <br /> <br /> The best way to watch this movie is not to expect what you've seen in the past with Miyazaki. Miyazaki is well known for his work on Spirited away and Howl's moving castle. good for Western viewers anyway. Both films were quite similar but at the same time completely different. However, Ponyo is a totally different type of story and animation. <br /> <br /> The story follows "Ponyo", a fish that has the face of a girl. After Ponyo runs from her house to the bottom of the sea, she discovers a whole new world that she never knew she existed and new problems too, when she was almost caught by a fishing boat she was saved by a five-year-old. boy known as Sousuke. <br /> <br /> The story then follows the two and the pure friendship between a boy and a fish. Can Ponyo really stay with Sousuke forever? <br /> <br /> I think the film was inspired by "The little mermaid" and looks like "Tonari no Totoro" <br /> <br /> the movie is very short and you have very little time to learn about the characters in this movie. But the characters are a fish and a little boy, so how much do you hope to learn about them? the film is set to what seems to be 3 days, I think that's why the movie is so short. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed watching this movie and I hope you enjoy this movie too
