I have always loved the animated ducks for some reason: Duck Tales, Darkwing Duck, Daffy Duck, Donald Duck. Although none of them are as disturbed as Duckman. Originally broadcast between 1994 and 1997, Duckman lasted a total of 70 episodes, but could easily have lasted forever without becoming out of date. <br /> <br /> The main character is a world-debugged slob. He is a private detective, a widower, a thug, an alcoholic, a sex maniac, a murderer, a (fill the void). You name it, Duckman did it. But who can blame him for being a bullet in the air when the world he lives in is so crazy, scandalous and simply absurd? Eric Tiberius Duckman (voiced by the maniac Jason Alexander) could carry the whole series all by himself, but when surrounded by a group of eccentric secondary characters, just know that the troubles are just waiting to explode at every opportunity. My favorite must be Willibald Feivel Cornfed (or just Cornfed Pig), Duckman's amazingly impassive companion, seemingly talented and very talented for everything, and perpetually unaware of the infinite vices and incompetence of his partner. <br /> <br /> The typical scenario will involve a bizarre case in which he will inevitably pass or turn around his extremely dysfunctional household, though occasionally King Chicken (Tim Curry), Duckman's arch-enemy, forms a kind of professor moriarty-shaped poultry scheme in revenge for being bullied in high school. <br /> <br /> Since I was a teenager, it's my absolute favorite animation show, better than the Simpsons, Family Guy and even King of the Hill. Nothing will ever go beyond it. There never was and there will never be anything like Duckman. The level of satire, observation and writing humor is so acute that it is deadly and the animation is performed in this unique style of Klasky / Csupo (anyone who has ever seen Rugrats will understand). It is a wonderful world, very imaginative and wild, with a black atmosphere and a feeling of the 1940s. <br /> <br /> You can never have too much of this bird.
