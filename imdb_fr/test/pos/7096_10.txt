The reason I think this film is fabulous is that it has so many layers of emotion. From the script and the fabulous acting, you can say that there is a story behind all the existing feelings. You understand why characters take certain actions and why they do not do others. You can feel sympathy, joy, love and sorrow for everyone at the same time. You see humanity at its best and at worst. You can relate to the characters because even though you may have never been in their exact situation, you have never seen the qualities and flaws they have in themselves. To a certain extent, this film leaves you perplexed, but in the end, it is explained and you feel a certain peace and understanding not only in you, but also for the characters. I will say that I have never cried so much in my life, nor shot so much. I implore you to watch this film and take its meaning to heart. That there is only one true thing and that is ... love.
