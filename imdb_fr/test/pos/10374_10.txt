Aunt Cora had always been tactless and her well-bred family ignored the remark she made after the burial of her brother Richard: "He was murdered, is not it?" They remembered it the next day, when Cora was brutally murdered with a hatchet ... <br /> <br /> For some reason, this year's POIROT films are far from being faithful to original book. I was disappointed with the changes to CARDS ON THE TABLE-- my favorite Poirot book. After the funeral is my second favorite book of Poirot, and I was afraid that the story was destroyed. It was not! The film was almost faithful page after page, to the mobile of the killer! All the actors were wonderful, but my favorite is Monica Dolan, who is a wonderful interpreter of Miss Gilchrist, the companion of the late aunt Cora. Without a doubt the best Poirot movie of all time!
