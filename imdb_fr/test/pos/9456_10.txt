When I saw the first glimpse for this, I almost lost consciousness by excitement. I have long been a fan of Twelfth Night, he turned me to Shakespeare. Having a modern adaptation is a dream come true. My anticipation was not disappointed. <br /> <br /> The plot follows roughly the initial scenario and it means: complicated! I do not even want to try to connect it, the summer plot will probably cover the basics. Just imagine having a girl claiming to be a guy at a boarding school and imagine all the possible situations that would create. I will not even stop to question the plausibility of such a plot; the reality is NOT the essence of the film. <br /> <br /> The story of what it IS is absolutely hilarious. Almost every scene conforms to the comic configuration. Congratulations to the writers, director and actors of this count. <br /> <br /> Amanda Bynes is the star of this film and she wears it beautifully. She is super cute, not a fox and can make an irreproachable comedy. I admire him so much for not having played in his films or in public life, as so many starlets do today. I am happy that there is at least one decent young actress in Hollywood. OK, I'm not in my soap box ... <br/> <br /> Channing Tatum, yeah he's hot and built like a frivolous gorilla, but he really makes me laugh! My favorite scenes in the whole movie are those where he tries to converse with Olivia by talking first about cheese, then about his training program. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast did not fail to happen either, with wonderful additions to the characters in the forms of the inanimate debutante mother and Monique, the classic evil girlfriend. <br /> <br /> Overall, there is a lot of fun, lots of laughs and a very attractive cast. Maybe not at the same level as the original, but it beats modern versions of other pieces, including the much vaunted 10 things I hate about you.
