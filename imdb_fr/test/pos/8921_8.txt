OK, some plot points may be a bit obvious, but it's an interesting idea that leads to a close end. The acting is particularly strong, especially Lachy Hulme, who plays one of the main characters in this set. It certainly has a presence on the screen and is interesting to watch. It has a small budget feel that works for the kind of thriller / horror of the kind to which Four Jacks belongs. The film does not try to take itself seriously, which adds to the overall charm. The character of Phil (Dave Serrafin) must be one of the most annoying characters seen on the screen since Rupert Pupkin / King of Comedy. It's worth adding to a stack of DVDs on weekends.
