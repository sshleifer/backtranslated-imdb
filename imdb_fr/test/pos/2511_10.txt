I usually do not like romantic movies, but I really like this movie. The story is really touching and the ending is very appropriate. I feel that I really care about a lot of characters from this movie. I feel that I can feel their feelings. While most romantic movies always make me feel detached and bored, this one makes me feel completely involved, starting with the Capshaw scene that runs along the beach with Scott to the final scene. I want to rate this movie 11 out of 10, because I want to give an extra point for the end. The actor part is very strong. Kate Capshaw has a good opportunity to show her talent. Although I'm not impressed by Scott in Dead Man on Campus, this movie completely changes my point of view on him. He is so irresistibly charming here. Geraldine McEwan is still great. <br /> <br /> This film may not be as good, complex, deep or as believable as other films that deal with the same type of relationship, such as "The School of Flesh" or "Post coitum, sad animal", but "The Love Letter" can always be proud of itself, as it sheds a different light on this type of relationship. And this difference makes this film eminently enjoyable. Being ambitious and relying on the charm of small stars, Dreamworks, this time, my dream comes true.
