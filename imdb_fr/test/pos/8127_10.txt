I really enjoyed watching this movie for the first time a few years ago and every time it is rebroadcast somewhere (which happily happens from time to time on European cable TV), I feel the same thing, I'm moved, entertained and I end up wishing there were more movies like this one. <br /> <br /> All this concerns Leo (Kevin McKidd) and his group of friends living in downtown London. Leo is a gay guy who follows a friend in a hilarious group of New Age men. and falls in love with straight guy Brendon, played by the dashing James Purefoy, who turns out not so straight. The equally great characters are Tom Hollander and Hugo Weaving, whose script alone deserves to watch the film. Simon Callow, as leader of the men's group, has achieved a performance as exceptional as ever. But it's really hard to pick people here because each character, Jennifer Ehle's, Julie Graham's, and Harriet Walter's, are extremely talented actors. Even Kevin McKidd may look a little pale compared to his co-actors but this benefits his character a little moderate. <br /> <br /> The idea behind this film is simple: there is only black and white, classifications are difficult and do not always stand the test of time. <br /> <br /> Leo identifies as gay but ends up falling for a woman who turns out to be his teenage lover and Brendon's girlfriend. Brendon starts straight, but learns that gay is perhaps more than an option for him and that being bisexual may not be so bad after all. Darren and Jeremy (Hollander and Weaving) are gay and love it. Even the straight people in the movie, like Leo's roommate Angie, get their fair share of love and fun moments right up to the end of the movie. The comedy excerpts (especially Tom Hollander who is just hilarious) are funny and precise and the emotions are credible, as confusing as they may seem from reading this summary. <br /> <br /> What I like in this film is its really positive notion. Whether you're gay, straight, bisexual or just not sure, this movie leaves you feeling that it's OK to NOT be sure and that "not being sure" could be a good thing to live with too! Sexuality is fluidly depicted in this film and none of the main characters seems to have a real problem, apart from all the gay / heterosexual camp fights that are sometimes nurtured in other homosexual-themed movies. I can only agree totally with the subtext of the film, that what you feel certain one day, when you think you identify as gay, straight, whatever, may be very different from a other. I have never seen (what to call it?) Bisexuality or perhaps simply the absence of the necessary distinction between sexual and sexual classification, presented so warmly and so realistically. <br /> <br /> This film dares to go where few movies, gay or straight, do not play on labels or a stereotypical assumption of sex and rely on that. This goes further and assumes that there may be a sex life after well-known classifications and I think the times are more than ready for that and that other movies are exploring postmodern themes like this one! <br /> <br /> And for all those who do not care about that, damn it, it's a funny comedy to watch rainy Saturday night with popcorn on the hands. Try it! <br /> <br /> I loved it!
