The movie was great and everything, but there were a lot of mistakes in the "football" scenes, I wonder if any of the guys who were working on the movie had ever seen a football match before ...? First of all, I do not understand how she wanted to try for the boys team? In football, boys and girls can not play in the same team and these are the rules of FIFA. And do not get me started on who, when they discovered she was actually a girl, they let her continue playing ... !! Second, players can not paint their faces with colors or play like that. Once again, FIFA does not apply mine. <br /> <br /> and do not get me started in the way they scored their goals, it was ridiculous and completely unrealistic. and all the players seemed not to know Jack about football. <br /> <br /> and when the Duke was coaching Alto, why did they focus only on shooting and dribbling. or did she shoot her only problem ?! And why on earth were all the wall posters in their rooms meant for Chelse players ?! do not they like other players from other teams? it was like it was the only team they knew ...! but other than that, the movie was good and I enjoyed the rest, just the training and the game scenes were unrealistic for me. they really should have consulted someone about them ...!
