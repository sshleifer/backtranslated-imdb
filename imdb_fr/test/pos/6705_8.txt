One thing that some people forget in the big science fiction is that it predicts part of the future. If I remember correctly, no other theatrical movie predicted that a disaster would occur when the Space Shuttle went to study Halley's Comet. Some differences were as follows: the "Churchill" (the shuttle in the film) was actually heading for the comet, the "Challenger" was in low Earth orbit; The "Churchill" was simply burned inside, while the "Challenger" exploded - the vampires had to return to earth. A great similarity (and it's still bad luck!) Had mixed men / women crews - Halley's comet legend and disaster continue! <br /> <br /> Other than that, there is not much to say about this film that was not said before. As a space / sci-fi / horror / sex movie, it has not brought anything new, but as in all great dishes, it's the combination that counts. And, taken together, it was a very original and satisfying combination. <br /> <br /> I only wish that Mathilda May follow her victims through another part of the body!
