What a great mini-series. The original TRAFFIK completely robbed me of everything that was happening. Much more attractive than the American remake, the original movie TRAFFIK has an astonishing cast of lesser-known actors for a North American audience. Juliette Binoche is the mostly recognizable actress who plays a drug addict teenager girl from a government official. But this film is not under the sign of the power of the stars (although I liked the American version, I had the impression that it was attenuated by the famous Americans in the photo). <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I saw the American version before I found the original BBC mini-series. Of course, there were no image filters, lush places and famous stars / directors. However, the grain and grime of Europe (throughout the world of drugs) perfectly complements the sense of imminent danger that permeates throughout this film. The problems, such as relieving addicts of drugs by giving them more, the weak anti-drug campaign and the resistance of foreign governments to help destroy their own drug addicts, make TRAFFIK daring, immersive and horrible at the same time. time! <br /> <br /> The really amazing parts of the film all come from Pakistan. My God, I never understood how much the problem was really solved in Europe ... even everywhere! For real education on drug problems, beyond their effects on the human body, you have to look at both this version and the American version. Each shows a very clear and undeniable fact. These countries, which are leaders in the eyes of the world, have a culture that has led to death and suffering for many. <br /> <br /> Drugs are worse than war. They work in the shadows, the dark secrets of any "prosperous" society.
