The tunes are the best aspect of this TV movie, which has above-average production values, but a very superficial and slightly modified biography. Dramatizes Richard's discovery of "We've just started" and Karen's marriage is noticeably disturbing (the "Superstar" edit was a good idea), leaving aside the disagreement with Neil Sedaka, the contribution of Tony Peluso's solos etc. is sweet in her character Karen, but that does not include the tomboyish sides and gutsier of the real personality of the carpenter. Anderson is in great shape as a creative and enterprising Richard, and Fletcher leaves his mark as a loving but dominant Agnes. The most haunting moment of the original broadcast is the use of "Goodbye to Love" in the background of an advertisement displaying a hotline for anorexia.
