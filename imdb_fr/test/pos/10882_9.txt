This game is not exactly the best N64 game of all time. Of course, it's good, but only when there are 4 players. Without 4 players, the only fun thing to do is to take remote mines and see how many people you can kill. But half of this game are levels where you have to save Natalya. You will have to limit your use of remote mines to these levels, and that becomes quite boring. The graphics do not exactly reach the level of Super Mario 64 or even Mario Kart 64. And if you speak very well in multiplayer in a shooter in the 1st person, you have to use Perfect Dark. At least you can play in "multiplayer" yourself.
