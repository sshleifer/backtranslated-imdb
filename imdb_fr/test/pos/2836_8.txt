This film, released in 1951, contains the usual elements of westerns released in the 50s; the cavalry needing to protect the territory of a killing band of Indians, an officer determined to carry out this task and the men with him presenting various defects of character that he must merge to form a coherent unit. This small band must cling to a fort located near the Indian village until the arrival of reinforcements. The Indians know very well that the small group is underutilized and could be eliminated before help arrives. A major difference for this movie, "Only the Valiant", lies in the fact that it tries to reproduce the usual scenario, while transmitting the message that duty is a paramount concern that must be shared by all, even if they do not do it. I do not accept this accusation. <br /> <br /> Gregory Peck embodies the tight-lipped captain of the troop who must prevent the Indians from bursting on the territory. The horsemen whom he takes with him to the little outpost are the remains of the troop at the fort; in turn, they have problems or weaknesses that lead them to wonder if the captain did not eliminate them because of their general lack of devotion to a cause. Eventually, the captain and the small group confront the enemies and, at the same time, everyone faces their own defect. The cast includes Western pillars such as Ward Bond, Gig Young, Neville Brand, Lon Chaney, Jr. and Warner Anderson. <br /> <br /> A layer of film, and a good solid western for fans of this genre.
