For me, "Late Chrysanthemums" was interesting, not only because it was my first film on Naruse that I completely enjoyed, but also because it was technically as modern and innovative as the one I saw in his thirties. That does not mean an innovative montage as Godard would present it with "Breathless" in 1959, but quite the opposite. <br /> <br /> The editing was as fluid as in the best Hollywood movies of the 30s / 40s, but at the same time incredibly about the way he told his story. Unlike them, he never deliberately accented anything or tried to make himself "invisible", but, with cinematography, I feel like traveling on a gentle stream, constantly feeling the waves beneath me, like a slight helping hand or the almost imperceptible cradling of a cradle. In this sense, the film was comparable to the work of Ozu and Mizoguchi, but in an even more subtle way. <br /> <br /> What was so modern is that the editing seemed to be almost a character in itself, similar to the remarkable camera-work in Dreyer's Ordet (1954) or Vredens dag (1943), which we reveals a deeper understanding of the film and its characters rather than simply showing them. <br /> <br /> I think Naruse's editing and cinematography are the most interesting aspects of his films, raising the meaning of stories beyond the obvious. The wonderful settings and settings should not be forgotten either! I found the story itself pretty conventional. <br /> <br /> The narration and its characters were presented in a very interesting way and I thought that the first half of the film featured a delicately ingenious spectrum of emotions. and interrelationships. Unfortunately, the second half of the film and its resolution were rather didactic and formulated in relation to the editing (although it would have been perfectly adapted to any other film - less complex -). In a way, I had the impression that he was failing a bit trying to dissolve the many layers he had woven. Maybe he should have kept them intact. This criticism may seem a little harsh to the viewer of this film, especially since the procedure is still reminiscent of how Ozu treated the plot in his films. Unfortunately, I still do not feel that Naruse was able to elevate the story and its characters in the conclusions of his films in an equally sublime way. The best efforts I have seen so far - Ukigumo (Floating Clouds / 1955) and Midaregumo (Scattered Clouds / 1967) - supported the energy he had built throughout the story, while delivering poignant and resonant endings. <br /> <br /> This is already more than most filmmakers can do, and in my opinion, they constitute the basis of a real mastery of cinematographic support. In this respect, and given the resonance of the last two films I saw him, he may have already become one of my favorites. <br /> <br /> The only problem I have right now, c I'll see more of his movies on the big screen.
