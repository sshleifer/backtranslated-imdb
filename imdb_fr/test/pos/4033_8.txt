Okay, this movie may not have won Oscars, but it's not a bad movie. The original "D.O.A." is definitely a better movie, but that does not mean that this movie is bad. <br /> <br /> The film stars in one of his leading roles, Dennis Quaid, when he became really famous, after "The Right Stuff" made him a star and a very nice Meg Ryan when she was still pretty famous. <br /> <br /> This is more of an "update" of the 1950 film than a remake, since the scenery is different and the characters too, are different. The plot is pretty much the same thing. A man (this time professor of English at the University of Texas in Austin) is poisoned and he has only 24 hours left to find out who poisoned him and why. Meg Ryan plays a young student trying to help him. Jane Kaczmarek plays the woman separated from Quaid in a discreet but intense performance; she steals all the scenes in which she is. Daniel Stern (also in a leading role before "Home Alone" makes him famous) plays Quaid's colleague. Charlotte Rampling also plays a supporting role. <br /> <br /> The whole cast is awesome; The film is elegant, with a fast pace that lets you guess until the end. <br /> <br /> I think it's a film that must certainly be seen as a thriller and as a modern version of a classic movie.
