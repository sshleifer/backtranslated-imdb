I recently came across this show as the ABC family was organizing a one-day marathon before the premiere of season 2. I remember seeing previews for the show in 2007, and I thought it would be short-lived, and not very well written, because it was on ABC Family. <br /> <br /> Never doubt an ABC family show! This show surprised me in the best way possible. Not only is the show well written, the scenarios are realistic, fun and enjoyable. I was expecting a lot of discussion about relationships, something like, "This guy came out with that girl who dumped me for this kid ... etc" But this show is anything but! The characters are attractive and you really feel a connection between all. There is a lot of chemistry between the actors, and they can really give you the impression that everything is happening under your eyes. <br /> <br /> Do not doubt this show, it's really nice to watch .. and become addicted;)
