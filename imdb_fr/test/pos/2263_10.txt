I saw this movie for the first time on an Alaska Airlines flight and have since seen it twice. It's simply - and it's simply - one of the best movies in years. I ended up after the first visit, but a little confused about what had happened. After seeing him again a few weeks later, things started to take shape. It was not confusing, just deep. In fact, the depth of the film may not be appreciated for a long time. For example, I realized that after my third viewing, Sammy Davis Jr Jr (the grandfather's dog) is more than a pet - she may be the replacement for his deceased wife. Witness how fiercely he protects her. There is a symbolism in abundance, and none of it is Sapphic or indulgent, but real. The adventure of their journey keeps the story in perpetual motion, and even when they arrive, you do not really know if it was really the destination. The adventure continues as the film progresses, and I understand that the destination was just a point of passage. The soundtrack is fun, the scenery captivating - and both are resolutely east-facing. I could go on and on about the deeper meanings in the movie, but I'm not quite sure I've discovered all the nuances. Plus, it's more fun to tease them yourself. Although any movie can be, "Everything Is Illuminated" has turned out to be a good wine that softens over time. I highly recommend seeing it - twice.
