Ignore the bad reviews here, this movie is awesome! "Just Before Dawn" is a great example of what can be done in a movie with a minimal budget if you have a dedicated team, a decent screenplay and a good movie idea. This is very fun. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed it a lot more than most other 80s slashers, because the killer is really unique. "Wrong Turn" tore off this fierce film! There is a lot of blood and fears. My girlfriend was panicked and she looks at almost everything with me and does not flinch. <br /> <br /> I would say that "Just before dawn" is the best slasher of the early 80's on the market. I really appreciated. <br /> <br /> 8 children out of 10, children.
