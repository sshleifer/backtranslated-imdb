I think it was Fran√ßois Truffaut who said that the best films involve either the joy of making movies or the agony of making movies. This film is certainly of the first type. Tromeo and Juliet are a pleasure to watch from beginning to end. The zany zeal that feeds this Shakespearian shenanigan is infectious. I do not think I've laughed so much since seeing Monty Python and the Holy Grail. It's that good!
