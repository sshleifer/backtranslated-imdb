Hilary was great like Julie and Pat was once again gorgeous like Mr. Miyagi, but there should have been more references to the other three movies! I mean, come on! First of all, where is Daniel! Miyagi makes a brief mention of him and that's it. Daniel was his best friend and should have at least made an appearance in the film. He could have helped Miyagi train Julie-San! On the other hand, the music remained faithful to the film, with a few more instruments (Fretless Bass) to accompany the wonderful Pan-Flute! It does not look like a karate kid movie unless you hear that pan flute! Thanks Zamfir! Overall, a decent movie though! We miss you Noriyuki!
