So far, only the first episode has been aired and lesbian sex scenes have caused a lot of excitement. But for those who have the trouble to look beyond, they will find an incredibly beautiful love story that, in this episode, ended with a shocking climax / cliffhanger. I found the story so powerful that I was inspired by reading the novel on which this fantastic series is based.
