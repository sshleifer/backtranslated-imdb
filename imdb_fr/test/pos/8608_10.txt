The opening of Imamura's masterpiece avoids mere sensationalism by describing the incredibly horrible events of August 6, 1945, during which 90% of Hiroshima and tens of thousands of lives were annihilated in an instant. Instead, Imamura emphasizes the unprecedented strangeness of the disaster, focusing on images as dreadful as the diabolical mushroom cloud weighing silently in the distance and the black rain that splashes on the face of a beautiful young woman. The rest of the film traces the consequences of this latest incident, bringing the atomic holocaust and its consequences (more than 100,000 people dead poisoned by radiation) to the intelligible level of the fate of Yasuko (Yoshiko Tanaka) and his small "community linked by the bomb. "<br /> <br /> The survivors aspire to normalcy and continuity, including trying to find a suitable marriage for Yasuko, but the imminent possibility of radiation sickness radiates every aspect of their life. life. Yasuko's potential suitors, of course, fear a young woman, no matter how seductive, who could suddenly fall ill and die. True love, when it finally appears, does so in an unexpected and ambiguous way. We remain to ask ourselves whether love through the classrooms is more a sign of Yasuko's status as "damaged goods" or of a common humanity, highlighted by difficult circumstances, which transcends class divisions. <br /> <br /> the sober classical style intensifies the impact, the eloquent and evocative interior shots reminding us that Imamura began his career as an assistant to the great Ozu. The mastery of Imamura is evident, for example in the combined scenes of Yasuko's bath, the first highlighting his pretty back and legs, the second the fall of his hair. The shots are almost like book ends to the narrative's trajectory, distilling its tragic essence. The documentary realism of the film is repeatedly violated for expressive purposes, particularly in a scene exposing the troubled inner life of a veteran in shock. The score of the renowned avant-garde composer Toru Takemitsu and the superb black-and-white photographs contribute greatly to the dark atmosphere of the film. When, in the final shot, the uncle of Yasuko (Kazuo Kitamura), the terse narrator of the film, views the empty sky as a rainbow as a sign of hope and regeneration, the black and white images suddenly become so poignant that they are almost unbearable. Few Japanese films (or elsewhere) could be compared to the great Japanese humanist masterpieces of the fifties. This film is one of them. When I finished watching the movie for the first time, I was stunned, unable to move for at least five minutes, overwhelmed by the emotions that a great tragedy should inspire: terror and pity.
