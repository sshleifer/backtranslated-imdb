I personally found the movie awesome. I had it pre-order for a month and had watched it twice the day I had received it in the mail, and many times since .. Yes, the time that passes may be a bit long, but the rest of the film clearly compensates that. All the actors were in the casting, but the acting was just for each role. The plot itself is just ... haggard! There is no other way to describe it. Who makes a movie about someone who fades? ??? BAM, who is it? Genius. Simply genius. Two inches up. I would be honored to work with him every day, at any time, on anything.
