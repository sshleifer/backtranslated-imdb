It's a great little movie, full of characters and interesting situations. Although not in the same class as some of the best-known films of his day, he remains extremely visible and memorable. The scene where Zachary Scott, sitting in a bus, casually steals the airman's needle from the lapel of a coat thrown on the seat next to him is fantastic. That nicely defines his character - a guy who is so low that he is going to give something of inestimable value to a veteran, whom he will use as an accessory in his various charades. He lies easily if the situation demands it and captivates the women of the Fenchurch home with his irresistible charm and murderous smile. <br /> <br /> I could not help but wonder if this film was made to capitalize on the success of Mildred Pierce. Scott and Bruce Bennett have teamed up again, and Faye Emerson looks a little like Joan Crawford, with her bony face structure and large eyes. In addition, the character of Mona Freeman is reminiscent of the odious Veda Mildred Pierce. <br /> <br /> I agree with a previous comment that the end of the film was too striking, with the convenient fall over a cliff for "Ronnie Mason", the character of Zachary Scott. In addition, in one of the final scenes, we see Mona Freeman, a fat girl, reunited with the boyfriend she had previously scorned for Zachary Scott, older and smoother. I think the script should have asked that she be punished for her behavior and cruelty to her sister, instead of treating her as a typical adolescent episode. But these are minor flaws in an otherwise enjoyable and well done movie.
