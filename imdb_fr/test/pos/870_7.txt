Despite the romantic illusion and everything, Louis continues to love his enigmatic wife. <br /> <br /> This film is a splendid drama, full of betrayals, deceptions, murders, robberies and Hitchcockian suspense. Good performances of Jean Paul Belmondo as a young owner of a cigarette company that seems determined to fall in love with a femme fatale and a wonderful Catherine Deneuve as a suspicious heroine. The film received several references to American cinema, but Truffaut (400 shots) was a fervent spectator, such as: Johnny Guitar, Jim Colorado, Bogart and Hitchcock. The American version has been cut off for many minutes and deserves urgent restoration and remixing. Inspired by Cornell Woolrich's novel "Waltz into darkness" (rear window and Alfred Hitchcock scriptwriter), he was also adapted to Truffaut's "The Bride Wore the Black". by Antoine Duhamel, usual musician of Truffaut. This is one of the best of his suspense movies with "Farenheit 451 and Shoot the piano player". Redone by a lower version of Michael Christofer (2001) with Antonio Banderas, Angelina Jolie and Jack Thompson, full of erotic scenes and lush.
