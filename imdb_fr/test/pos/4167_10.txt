A surprisingly awesome comic in the same league as Batman: TAS and his ilk, I loved it in my youth and I was able to see it again, a superb voice of Tim Curry, Richard Moll, Tony Jay and Maurice LaMarche various roles. The only problem I had was that Rob Paulsons' voice sounded a little too old for the main character, but it did not matter, because the stories were great and the fact that it all ended well. Some people say it was an evasion, but I found it refreshing compared to many series that leave everything in suspense. I hope that one day they released this series on DVD, unfortunately at a time when DVDs were not yet widespread and the cartoon was probably only used to sell a particular type of toy, which I do not have never found attractive despite the entertaining cartoon.
