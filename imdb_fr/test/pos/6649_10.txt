How is it possible to love and not love the same movie? <br /> <br /> The plot is very similar to Jody Foster's in Sommersby, but she's not that good. Nicole was great ... Jude was adequate. They did not give him many lines ... is there any reason for that? In general, he is a very good actor. She is so elegant, her character is so rustic. One wonders what they see in each other. <br /> <br /> The romantic love of two people only succeeded in Lady Chatterly's Lover. <br /> <br /> I think the blindness comes from the fact that the film is too long. They could have told the story in two hours. <br /> <br /> The story is good. Good location, good filming. The actors of the character were great.
