I can not express how wonderful it was. From time to time, you see a film that sticks to your skin. "You Are Alone" is this movie (for me). The film is constantly in my head and in my heart. Every day, I replay the scenes mentally, I analyze them and I look back, as if I saw him for the first time. <br /> <br /> There is nothing I did not like in the movie. Soundtrack incredible !!! The end was perfect. Very moving while stirring !!! It was fascinating and captivating. <br /> <br /> I loved Jessica Bohl and her performance was the most beautiful I ever attended. I admired the strength of Brittany (what a strong woman). <br /> <br /> The slogan is "When your darkest moments come to life". We never know what we are capable of doing. Everyone says, "I would never do that, when we have no idea what we would do in a given situation. We are very capable of everything and this film dive directly into this subject. The honesty of the film is perhaps my absolute favorite part. <br /> <br /> Thank you Gorman Becherd for this perfect piece of art !!!!
