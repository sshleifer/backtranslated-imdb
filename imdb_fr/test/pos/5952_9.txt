OSS 117 was fun from start to finish. <br /> <br /> It's hard to define why a movie touches you or does not connect you or not, and I'm not going to try to analyze a comedy as perfect, so politically incorrect that even academic papers should him to be dedicated :)! <br /> <br /> Here, everything is old-fashioned, women's clothes (sigh!), from Mambo dance to "song of heroes" ... ("Bambino" sounds like an Italian) canzonetta sung in. .. arabic :)!). <br /> <br /> Hubert is physically imposing, but silly as a devil. Of all the 007's, he looks like Sean Connery, but he's definitely nicer because he's ... stupid, talks all the time, laughs, laughs, even has homo-erotic fantasies and rumors are circulating about him . In short, as an anti-hero, he switches :)! Sometimes he just raises his eyebrows or frowns, and that's all it takes to make you laugh. <br /> <br /> Bérénice Bejo is the real queen of the film. Graceful, treacherous but with ideals. Aure Atika, on the contrary, is reduced to a sort of femme fatale. It's surprising to see this "sexy bomb", you. <br /> <br /> You simply can not compare it to "Austin Powers"! I agree with Amazon's D. Hartley (Seattle, WA) about respect for gender. <br /> <br /> What is your favorite scene? One of my favorite scenes is the "Chicken fight" with the masked villain. But what is really perfect is when we talk at the cocktail with his contacts, how they mumble all platitudes with confidence ... This scene alone gives full value to the comic genre.
