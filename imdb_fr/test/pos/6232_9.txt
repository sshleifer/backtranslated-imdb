Perhaps one of the first slasher movies released after Halloween (though it's a Halloween Irving Yabalans), I must say that I honestly found that "Tourist Trap" was more scary and more fun. "Tourist Trap" is one of those remarkable treats that you find from time to time and that leaves you with the most pleasant feeling of surprise. It was your destiny, I tell you, but one night I was at my local Blockbuster (one or two months before the end of his activities) and I had nothing to get. Then I come across this movie, I think it looks like a laughable B-Movie, I rent it and bring it home, my boy was very scared. "Tourist Trap" is a bad movie, it definitely has hard times, but in the end you have a lot of fun with it to really worry about it. <br /> <br /> What impressed me in absolute terms most, and the things that made this movie one of the scariest I've seen, are the first-rate setting. A horror movie without a good decor is not very fun, not here. I love it I love it, it's like we can understand it, it's almost as if we had been there before. Which makes it more scary. Then come the characters, none of them is really stereotyped and they all have a real personality. For example, they are not fools, alcoholics, or even people obsessed with sex, they feel like normal young adults. Plus, they look pretty realistic, and then they have Chuck Connors. Mr. Slausen, whom we all appreciate, has a great performance, because once again he is so real that he feels like we love this kind of adorable grandfather. The last thing, and probably the most important, that makes this movie scary is how they blow us up (the audience) halfway to our seats and turn on the rights, for the right reasons. For example, most of the time, in horror movies, we simply jump because of a sudden change in the tone of the music, but in "Tourist Trap", get ready, that's not the case . With its perfect use of lighting, mannequins and strangeness, you feel completely scared. Plus, I like it because even though some things may seem exaggerated, some things might still happen to you. It's exactly what a horror movie that takes such a ridiculous must do is that we (the audience) do not feel safe and terrified. <br /> <br /> Overall, when it comes to major problems, I have none. Only, strangeness can sometimes become a little too strange. However, in the end, "Tourist Trap" occupies a place dear to my heart, to be one of the few horror movies to make me turn on the lights and feel uncomfortable traveling.
