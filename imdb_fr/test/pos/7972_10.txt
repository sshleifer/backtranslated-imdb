"Hell To Pay" is like the rebirth of the Classic Western ... it succeeds as a Western-style film that the whole family could see and looked a lot like the baby boomer movies that lived decades ago. The good ones are good and the bad guys are really bad! . Bo Svenson, Stella Stevens, Lee Majors, Andrew Prine (excellent in this movie), Tim Thomerson and James Drury are all excellent and it's fun to see them again. James Drury really shines in this one, maybe even better than his days like "The Virginian". In a way, "Hell To Pay" reminds me of these 60s films where famous actors of so many series make their appearance. If you are a certain age, Buck Taylor, Peter Brown, Denny Miller and William Smith are a "wow factor" because we rarely have the opportunity to see these icons nowadays. "Hell To Pay" features screen captions as well as new Hollywood names. Rachel Kimsey (Rebekah), whom I recently saw in "The Young and The Restless", and Kevin Kazakoff, who plays Kirby, a man tired of the war and shared between two wanting to live and let live or intervene to "do the good thing". William Gregory Lee is excellent in Chance, Kirby's mischievous and seductive brother. Katie Keane plays Rachel, Rebekah's sister, a woman who took the necessary steps to stay alive but gave up her pride. In a modest but memorable role, Jeff Davis plays the role of Mean Joe, a rather nasty old Confederate. I think we will see more of these good players in the future. "Hell To Pay" is a fun movie with a beautiful story to tell ?? grab the popcorn, we're heading west!
