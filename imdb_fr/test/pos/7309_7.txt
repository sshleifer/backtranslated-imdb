The film begins with a frumpy housewife (Norma Shearer) who discovers that her husband (Rod La Rocque) has cheated on her. Three years passed and apparently they divorced during those years because of infidelity. Oddly, meanwhile, La Rocque did not see Shearer or his two children when Shearer took them to Paris. <br /> <br /> Marie Dressler is a wealthy woman in society and she's invited a new and improved Norma to come to her house for the weekend - apparently to help Marie put an end to a nascent romance between her girl and La Rocque! Apparently, Norma is now a super-vampire and with her magical sex appeal, she can break the romance - and no one seems to realize that she and La Rocque were married. Several others are here for the weekend and right away, Norma is seduced by her sexy, carefree and sexy senses - and almost every man (including La Rocque) is captivated by her. Neither of them told anyone that he was married, but it is obvious that his ex-re wants the new and improved Norma! This film is a sophisticated comedy of mores among the most fortunate, similar in some respects to Jean Renoir's THE RULES OF THE GAME. Oddly enough, despite the severity of the Depression, such films about fairly rich people were quite popular, although many of us will probably find them a little too funny in places. However, fortunately, in LET US BE GAY, there are many cute and fun moments (especially towards the end when Marie Dressler shows her true colors). Even if it's not a good movie, it's a good movie and more than just a time-saver. My only real regret is not having loved the end. You'll just have to see it yourself - maybe you'll agree on the end, maybe you will not, but I'm sure you'll enjoy this smart movie.
