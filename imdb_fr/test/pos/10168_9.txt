Many critics seem to prefer the original version of The Man who knew too much, that I have not yet had the opportunity to visualize. In itself, the '56 version is a very well done movie. Hitchcock's film series from the mid to late 1950s (including "Rear Window", "Dial M For Murder", "Vertigo" and "To Catch A Thief", as well as this film) is one of my favorite periods his career. In The man who knew too much, Jimmy Stewart interferes as always in his role. Doris Day is very believable in the role of an atypical blonde Hitchcock. I thought there was nothing wrong with his performance. Her character may not have been written as loudly as the original, but she's certainly not reduced to the passive role, "Yes, honey," pretty thing on Jimmy Stewart's arm. <br /> <br /> There were really smart lines written for Hank (the son of the couple who was later kidnapped) in the opening scene of the bus - it's a pity that Christopher Olsen read them with so much Of wood. It is rare to see a good performance of a child actor in the 50's, however. Most of the other actors in this movie were very competent, including the assassin (played by Reggie Nalder). <br /> <br /> Some small touches that make this film hitchcockian: the use of non-English dialogues, especially French (something that Hitch did on a larger scale in "To Catch A Thief"); the use of Arabic music bodes in the hotel when the assassin appears; Stewart and Day talk in the church, singing their words on the tune of the song; the Albert Hall scene, specifically showing the musicians and the assassin's accomplice following the score, thus creating tension, as well as the percussionist preparing the cymbals; and finally the pistol of the assassin as it appears behind the curtain. It moves so slowly and accurately that it had to be done mechanically (an effect that Hitch also uses at the end of "Spellbound"). <br /> <br /> The man who knew too much, it's fun movie to watch. It's not as deep or as full of symbolism as some of his films ("Vertigo", "Strangers on a Train"), but it's still one of my five Hitchcock masterpieces.
