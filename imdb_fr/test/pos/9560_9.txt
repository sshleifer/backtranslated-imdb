It's one of the funniest movies I've seen in ages. I watched for about 20 minutes, slightly puzzled by what was happening. Then I started laughing and did not stop long after the movie ended. Such impassive satire is indeed rare. Christopher Guest has the sense of humor inherent in those who do not have a sense of humor (about 90% of white heterosexual men, to start with). As in "Waiting for Guffman", Guest invokes the imbecile importance of Central America for the wall. I can not wait for his next movie.
