This film recalls "Boys' n the Hood", "Menace to Society", "South Central" and others of its kind, and even shares actors with some of them. The "us against the law" mentality of the film is put forward by the all-black district in relation to the almost entirely white police force. Here, the cops are so bad that they look like caricatures and in one scene they even ambushed the boys as they were driving in a car they had just "released" from its owner. It's a bit like an old western western, but the contemporary decor makes it too real. <br /> <br /> The story focuses on the young Jason Petty and his friends, for whom the school is a drawback that is wasting time. their "real job" to stimulate cars. This is Newark, New Jersey, a city of the rust belt that employs fewer people but whose crime is notoriously high. In fact, the problem is so serious that all the police have written "Car Theft" on the back to show that an entire unit must be dedicated to this particular crime. <br /> <br /> The boys use a "Jim slim". "Enter joyously into cars and make joy, as if it were not serious.They only encounter real problems when the police ambush them.The vicious, the Nazi lieutenant has a vendetta against boys, not as human beings worthy of being redeemed, but as human targets, in fact, he recalls a little that sadistic Nazi officer from the Warsaw ghetto, who shot Jews for pleasure in the movie "Schindler's List" When the boys steal a police car in retaliation for the ambush, things go wrong as expected, they are severely beaten by the cops and Jason ends up in jail - clearly, they are "bad guys" ", who would steal your car in a minute, but the movie wants us to consider them anti-heroes, showing Jason protecting his sister and his friend by taking care of his grandmother.The movie let us ask ourselves that l side to take and for whom we feel more sad: the boys whose life is falling apart, the honest citizens whose cars are stolen left and right and who could be caught in the crossfire of a shootout the moment the city of Newark itself, whose law is betrayed by brutal and dead cops. <br /> <br /> Despite the exaggerated description of the latter, the film offers a realistic rendering of the ghetto, the protagonists and their families and the culture of car theft in a city where there seems to be only two career paths - law enforcement and crime. Strangely, the whole subject of the drug is never mentioned. <br /> <br /> Filmmakers (including producer Spike Lee) are obviously biased against the Newark police, which we hope are not as bad as they are described here. Nevertheless, they gave us another strong and touching story about downtown and black youth that went wrong. Sharron Corley is doing well like Jason.
