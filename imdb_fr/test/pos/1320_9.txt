There are very few films capable of telling such a complex story at so many levels, as well as Mishima: A Life in Four Chapters. One of the most difficult aspects of the story is the ability to go back without losing the rhythm of the film. This film does not just go back and fourth of the easiest, but it also goes through some of the greatest stories of Yukio Mishima. This film is better than any other point of view and is a joy to watch. Not to mention the incredible Philip Glass Soundtrack.
