I saw this documentary at the independent film festival Slamdance in 2005. This documentary is shot, directed and edited by a son (Craig) of his mother's one-year fight against cancer. Shot over the course of a year "Plus elle approximates", is a documentary in its truest form and gives you a glimpse of a family's fight against cancer. The viewer thus has an inner perspective on the effects of cancer. both on the family and on the individual throughout the process. I've never seen such an honest film, it's a powerful and raw film, and since it was not shot by a stranger, you get the real emotions of everyone involved. Many documentaries have been shot by a stranger, but the fact that this story is told by the son adds another level of emotion to the film, unlike all those I have seen on this subject. It's a touching story that everyone should see and be able to relate to. I highly recommend it.
