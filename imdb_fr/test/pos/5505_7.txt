A sick man, Carleton Hendricks (Dee Snider), sails in the lines of the teen cat as captain Howdy. He then poses as a teenager and invites other teens to his house to party. Instead, he knocks them up, undresses them, sews their mouths and tortures them (mainly with needles). He captures the cop's daughter Mike Gage (Kevin Gage). He finds it, stops it and is institutionalized. Four years later, he is released ... totally cured. But a mop for lynch (led in a funny way by Robert Englund) attacks and hangs it. He does not die but he cracks and Captain Howdy is back ... <br /> <br /> A horror movie very sick, disturbing, twisted. Captain Howdy loves pain and torture and tries to show children that he also kidnaps how to take advantage of it. The scenes of torture are not so explicit (you hear more than what you see), but what you see is very, very sick. There is no humor and the cries (stifled) of his victims seem far too real. I walked away from the television during most scenes. <br /> <br /> The acting game varies. Kevin Gage is not as good as the cop - he's not terrible but he could have been better. Dee Snider is very scary as Captain Howdy - his attack scenes are not pleasant. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's not your typical horror film. I probably will not see it again (this movie really hurts your skin), but I recommend it to all horror fans, at least those with big stomachs. I give him a 7.
