I can not say that this movie was hilarious, but I must have had a smile on my face all the time. I like that kind of darker comedy; "Very bad things", "8 heads in a sack" or "cold blood" <br /> <br /> The way the main character tries to cope with a murder is very fun to watch. For me it was not really a surprise to know what would be the end, but the way this end happened was. Another thing that stands out is how well they managed to engage the audience. The way Terry looks at us is hilarious, you can almost pretend that you are his accomplice.
