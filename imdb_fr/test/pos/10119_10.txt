Cuba Gooding Jr. is back! Jesus, he did a good job in this movie! I loved this film. It's one of those movies that make you want to run out and volunteer for a mission or whatever. Anyway, I would recommend to see this movie without waiting! Well worth the price of admission. And as for Cuba Gooding Jr., give him his next Oscar now !!!!!!!!!!!!!
