I saw this series in 1999 on London TV and was blown away. As another user commented - This is what I would have liked to see when I first looked at "Jurassic Park" - The life and death of dinosaurs in their natural habitat as a documentary. The computer graphics are very realistic and the diversity of dinosaurs and habitats presented also makes it very informative. <br /> <br /> The series takes everything we know about dinosaurs and adds a lot of good ideas about "what it could have been" to invent what looks like a documentary series. What I missed was a small bar chart constantly in a corner of the screen, ranging from "fiction" to "done" at the same time as the narration and images, because we often wonder how many enlightened riddles and pure fantasy. <br /> <br /> To some clues about facts and fiction, you have to see the "Making Of" 50 minutes, which is not only very informative about the CG process and the collection and taking in the knowledge of the palaeontologists in the series, but that is also very amusing (the dinosaurs smoke cigarettes and complain about CG animators). <br /> <br /> I strongly recommend watching this series before going to the next Disney Dinosaur movie or watching a Jurassic Park movie again (like). This will surely make you much more critical of these films. Disney trailers looked particularly bad.
