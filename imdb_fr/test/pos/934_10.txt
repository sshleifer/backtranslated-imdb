This film is not only the last piece of the Three Colors trilogy, but also the best of three and one of the best movies of the 90s. There is hardly a film as wise that requires humanity and respect for every human being. <br /> <br /> Valentine (Irene Jacob) lives in Geneva where she works as a model. Although she has a boyfriend, she seems to be rather lonely. One night, she had an accident and injured a dog who drove her to her owner, a retired man (Jean-Louis Trintignant), who is cynical and observes the phone calls from his neighbors. Disgusted by him, she can not leave and they find themselves. Two lonely souls meet and become friends and develop a deep love for each other. <br /> <br /> The story itself is too complex to be told completely. There is another connection between them, in a young man who represents both the judge and the true love of Valentine's Day. Their relationship is not limited to a simple friendship. <The actors are wonderful, Irene Jacob and Jean-Louis Trintignant develop a deep and genuine friendship. <br /> <br /> The subjects are of endless validity, Fraternity, not only in contact with each other, but also in respect of the right to privacy. Alarmingly, we seem to be losing more and more of this right, making films like this one even more important than they might have been in 1994. <br /> <br /> red is one of the strongest colors that exists, and represents the inner tumult. love, anger and passion. Used here as another protagonist, it brings unparalleled depth to the film. A masterpiece!
