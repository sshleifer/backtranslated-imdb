Jimmy (Heath Ledger) is given a simple job by Pando (Bryan Brown), a pillar king of the underworld, to hand over money to a particular address, but when no one goes off, Jimmy decides to take a dip at the beach to note that her clothes on the sand were damaged and that the $ 10,000 left. Jimmy calls Pando to tell him the problem, but he does not want to hear it. Pando and his boys do their best to locate Jimmy, which no longer means Jimmy if they get their hands on him. So now, Jimmy is hiding to organize a bank robbery to recover Pando's money. He will also meet the sweet innocent Alex (Rose Byrne) and together they will do a hell of a ride through Sydney's King Cross. <br /> <br /> "Two Hands" is simply a captivating choice. high film that is lively, exhilarating and incredibly fresh. What you have here is pretty much an urban gangster movie with a shady backdrop and violence in the mouth ?? how is it fresh that you ask? Well, because it takes us into the slums where Australian culture shines with criminals wearing flip-flops, footy shorts, fitted cars and a can of beer in their hands. and do not forget the sense of Australian humor, dry and sarcastic. You can say that it owes a lot to his inspirations such as "Pulp Fiction", "Goodfellas" (one of my favorites) and "Lock, stock and two tuxedo smoking" (barrels, smoking room and two smoking barrels) for his inspiration, but for me, he is always autonomous. The film presents a mix of light moments, but also a series of shocks, with unexpected shocks and a black humor that can be really disturbing. You just do not know what's coming and there is a nice touch of irony (especially the end) and good timing with his humor. A scene involving a bank robbery will put you in traps, I guarantee it. The story of the plot is actually a story of arrival at the age (or on the road that has not been borrowed), with a striking love story, then the gangster element to finish it. Most of the secondary intrigues were intelligently constructed and interconnected. Perhaps he could have disappeared without the supernatural element implicating Jimmy's deceased brother, but in the general context, the varied plot seems to fit in well. Intensive, natural and neat dialogues have filled the scandalously colorful script, with quick jabs in Australian slang / twang - I'm just dinkum! <br /> <br /> What really made the film is Pando's performance by Bryan Brown. He just gave his character a character so charismatic / naughty that when he was not on the screen, his presence was still felt. He gave his character two sides - one being a con, but the other is such a good guy. A young Rose Byrne shines with her nervously sweet / offbeat character, Alex. She was radiant and added a bubbly personality. Then you have Heath Ledger who is up to the naive Jimmy. Great actors involved with Susie Porter, Tom Long, David Field, Steve Vidler and Steve Le Marquand. We get such raw performances and we get fascinating characters, fun and believable. A pumping rock soundtrack bursting with Powderfinger and Alex Lloyd creates a cool vibe. The filming on King Cross, Sydney, also allowed the company to stand out and show the Australian way of life. Sliding camera towers superbly capture the backdrop of the city, especially the hectic nightlife. It was a film that, in the end, was totally satisfied with what I had. All in all, a fast-paced crime thriller that achieves what it intended to do ... a fun, clever roller coaster tour with thrills and thrills. <br /> <br /> I say, it's an Australian hit in "Lock", Stock and Two smoking cannel by director / writer Gregor Jordan in his first film, and if you meet him, do not hesitate to try the shot.
