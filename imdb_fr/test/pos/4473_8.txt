A film about the relationship between a man and a leopard that is very reminiscent of "The English Patient", to a scene similar to the one where Ralph Fiennes's character is wearing his lover's body through a desert cliff. In "A Passion in the Desert", the main character carries the leopard's body across a desert cliff, but in the opposite direction (calculated decision or unconscious contrast?). Historically developed from a very short story of Balzac, the film is not perfect, but a treat. The last shot will haunt me for weeks. (8 out of 10)
