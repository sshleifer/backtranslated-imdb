I saw FAREWELL TO HARRY at the Plaza Theater while in New York and was very impressed. The performance of William Hall Jr. is extraordinary. This is a movie for the classical viewer. The management of Garrett Bennett reminds me of the work of Barry Levinson and Robert Redford. The film seems to transcend the typical independent film. He has a soul and a visual power quite unique. I saw this with a small audience (400) who were captivated from the moment of the first credit to the last credit and even though I was not outside crying watering in the eyes ... <br /> <br />
