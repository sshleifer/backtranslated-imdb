It's the classic 80s humor. If you were a teenager in the 80s, it was a summer hit to see. It was a glimpse of these super stars now. This and Better Off Dead are fun and stupid movies to watch and enjoy. Everyone can admit that he had a crazy summer while he was a teenager. Even family and crazy friends love these characters. It was so much fun to get acquainted with some of these characters. The uncle who is crazy sitting on the radio every hour of the day is waiting for the victory, the grandmother who only loves his granddaughter and gave a bill to the children after dinner, the twin brothers who do not are not alike and who have met hoopz a lot of fun. It may not be a reward, but it's a fun movie to lose in an afternoon.
