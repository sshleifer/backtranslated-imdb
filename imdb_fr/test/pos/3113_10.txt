George Cuckor, known as a director of women, could not have hoped for two more beautiful and talented women for her latest film. It's a remake of Bette Davis' "Old Acquaintance", written by John Van Druten, this film is definitely dated, but still pretty. <br /> <br /> Bergen and Bisset shine like the best friends who compete for everything, but manage to remain friends Liz Hamilton (Bisset) is a "serious" writer, intellectual and elegant. She meets her best friend, Merry Noel, in an exclusive girls' school. They start a life of competitions not always friendly. Later in life, while Liz is a "promising" but blockbuster fiction writer, Merry decides to try her hand at writing, which infuriates her friend because of her casual approach to the job she takes. -be a little too seriously. <br /> <br /> Much to Liz's dismay, Merry's devious novels have it all, and finally, her old friend Liz judges her novel for the National Book Award. Bergen steals the show as a haughty best-selling writer trying to unite the broken pieces of his life in conjunction with his latest literary triumph, but alas, things are never so simple. <br /> <br /> Includes David Selby, whom you may remember as the tragic Quentin Collins of Dark Shadows, Hart Bochner and, of course, a deliciously young and mercurial Meg Ryan in his first cinematic role since his release soaps. <br /> <br /> Rich and Famous is catty, campy, witty and wise. It culminates in a New Year's fiasco that highlights the enduring nature of true friendship, and I never let a year go by without watching it on New Year's Eve. Look at it and you will see why.
