Although I'm not a fan of Michael Jackson, I like some of his first songs and some of Jackson 5 as well. "Thriller" is one of his best songs and it comes from the best album ever sold with the same title. As for the video, it's great, one of Michael's best, but also a very eccentric and strange person. <br /> <br /> There is a story behind this video, but it is so complex that I can not fully understand it. . It's weird. The most bizarre things are Jackson's transformation into a werewolf, his evil red eyes at the end (like a werewolf) and those dead dancing people. <br /> <br /> The video is very dark, thrilling, cold and original. There are great landscapes and settings. The music itself is full of life and rhythm, characteristic of the good old 80s pop. <br /> <br /> I love Vincent Price's monologue. He makes a beautiful narrative with his distinctive and unique voice and his devilish laugh in the end is great! My favorite videos of "King of Pop" are "Billie Jean" and "Do not stop until you have enough" (both of his best songs).
