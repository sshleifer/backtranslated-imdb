It's absolutely the best movie I've ever seen. At the age of 12, I got up late and watched the movie. It was on the American channel Up All Night by Gilbert Godfrey. I'll never forget. At the time, my friends and I were really struggling with different issues, some of them sexual. You know, the age of 12 is very rough and strange. It seems like you're stuck between being a little girl and being a young lady. This film really helped me answer a lot of questions. I now have a 12 year old daughter. I am looking for this film for a few years. If it ever comes out on DVD, I'll be the first to buy. I would recommend to any parent to watch this with their child when they reach this very rough and difficult age.
