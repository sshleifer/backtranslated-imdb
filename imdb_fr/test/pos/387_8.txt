Even if unrealistic events occurred at the end (for example, a cop fired with a weapon in a carousel where many innocent people could be killed), it was still an intense and enjoyable thriller, one of the best Alfred Hitchcock movies. Robert Walker is excellent as a freakish, really convincing, giving a fascinating performance almost too scary at the time. His co-star here, Farley Granger, is fine, but he's no match for Walker, either as a comedian or actor. This is the typical Hitchcock movie with strange camera angles, immoral themes, innocent troubles, and so on. Unlike many of his other films, I thought it was a story that moved quickly and had very few dull points. As a former tennis player, I enjoyed his great old-fashioned net play with good exchanges. Hitchcock's real daughter, Patricia, plays an interesting and unique minor character role. She did not just get the job because of her father; she can act. Also note: the DVD contains the British and American versions and the story has some differences. It is a classic film that is still referred to in modern movies, even in comedies such as "Throw Momma Off The Train".
