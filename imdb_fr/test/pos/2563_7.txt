The trailer for this movie is so much about the channel (of course, because it's so sensational) that it missed most of the film, which talks about a developing relationship, albeit rather simple, between Lazarus and Rae as they try to recover from their past pains with each other. <br /> <br /> Of course, with the assumption of a chained nymphomaniac, it is not surprising that the implicit sex is not lacking. However, at the base, Black Snake Moan is a basic story of redemption and the healing power of helping another person. Maybe it's just me though, but I think poor Lazare should have focused more on his story. He is a man who suffers after his wife has left him, but we never really see how helping Rae to resolve his past pains heals him too. It just means that it is. In fact, he embodies the wizard who helps the young Rae overcome his plague, through a large chain and bruises. <br /> <br /> I like the story, but I wish it was a little more uniform and I did not have to rely on the sensational. The side characters were pretty decent, though simple and I loved the music. The acting was good enough, although I can not be sure that Rae's character is totally believable. But it may only be my naivety. <br /> <br /> In the end, I liked the film, but I was not forced to do it. It may be because I am too critical, but the story seems a little too convenient to be totally credible. So, even though it seemed very cool, I could never really buy it. The chain was a little too exaggerated for me. Nevertheless, this can provide entertainment for those looking for dramatic stories of redemption with a picture of the blues. 7/10
