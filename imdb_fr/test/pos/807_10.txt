Excellent work, especially from the actress who played wife Gerda (Claire Price) and, of course, David Suchet. I really understood the reader's name, but that's not the question. The end, which I will not divulge (someone describes it to the board in response to someone else's question if it interests you). I found really sad. Despite Agatha Christie's reputation for writing cardboard characters, I found them really well balanced. <br /> <br /> The pace of the story was good and I liked seeing Sarah Miles in the role of Lucy and Edward Hardwicke believe in more than being a famous Dr. Watson.)) as her husband.
