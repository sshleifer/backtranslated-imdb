I like other reviews of this movie. They reflect my attitude. I'm a 70s guy, minus a disco and childish "Star Wars". This movie was nothing great except a hunting scene. That's why it was good, because it was hard, basic and economical. Roy Scheider directed the film, based on the team, the 7 Ups, which ensured the backup of Gene Hackman in "French Connection". The people who were there were credible and average, burned themselves by pouring coffee, showed fear in a hunting scene and lost it almost after a very close collision. <br /> <br /> Perhaps it would be easier to tell you what was missing. There were no sophisticated weapons, just basic revolvers and raw sawed weapons. There was no hard to worship like Tarantino. There was no nonsense of kung fu or samurai and no random shooting. There was no intelligent guy running a complicated ploy based on hundreds of things going on exactly as he expected, including the reactions of everyone else. The criminals were bad guys but they did not shoot people for fun. In fact, there were only three bodies. Something that the average film of these days would pass in the opening credits. This could be a G movie today! No cargo of orphaned children has been kidnapped, nor have the terrorists threatened to kill half of the city. There were no high-tech hijinks, nor the very moving or ingenious crimes themselves, the most sophisticated thing I saw was a Touch TAT wall phone. There was no subplot or fun character development. In addition, no sex or woman, with the exception of the wife of a gangster who shouted like the boyfriend that our hero was threatening. <br /> <br /> It's a small funeral director who exploited his relationship with the local crowd and the police to kidnap local gangsters for easy winnings. Funeral. Vito, was played by Tony Lo Bianco who did a great job, as well as Roy Schneider, Buddy at the head of the 7 Ups Police, which he informed and operated. What happened to Tony Lo Bianco, he looked like a Pacino shoe, beautiful and talented? What she had was a great backdrop for a simple crime story in New York. Dark and dehumanizing places without being a sociological study. There was a simple plot that involved this kidnapping plan where one of Buddy's cops had been accidentally involved, literally accidentally trained and then shot. As Buddy and his 7 recruits are a hot dog unit, the NYPD Brass and the gangsters thought he was involved, as the kidnappers pretended to be plainclothes cops to lure the gangsters into comply. Evidently, the perpetrators assumed that they had lawyers and the right to protect them from the normal police. Even the mobsters were smooth, old and ugly, no godfather godfather or soprano intimacy here. <br /> <br /> It's a good basic movie with a remarkable hunting scene between two 70s Pontiacs. Even the cars were simple and economical, not even a GTO or a Trans Am, like the acting game. and history. At the time of Batman, the film reminds us that less is better. It should be shown to screenwriters and filmmakers as a warning not to dazzle, amuse, then ultimately insult us with stunts, gadgets and clown psychotic behavior galore.
