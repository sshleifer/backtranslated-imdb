My friends and I watched the film last night in Austin during a screening for AGLIFF (a film festival). This film is one of the best I've seen this year. It was a great comedy - very original and sincere - and funny! Everyone in the audience was laughing all through the movie. Texas is a big state - with LOTS of small towns - and of course, many teenagers who have grown up as "fat girls". I know that many people will relate to this film on a personal level. Ashley Fink and Robin de Jesus were great - they were so awesome in roles, it felt like the script was written for them. And speaking of the script, it was very well written (very believable) and Ash is a great actor (his facial expressions alone made me laugh). It's an independent film - but do not be fooled ... it's a good movie! Seeing this work template from someone so young is really inspiring.
