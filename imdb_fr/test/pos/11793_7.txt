ALICE is the kind of movie they did in the '30s and' 40s. Never try to be an "event". Just wants to entertain. And it does it. Kiefer Sutherland surprised me. In a role that could be a clich√©, he made it real. The plot refers to Alice in Wonderland. A guy dressed in white goes through a hole and Kiefer falls one. Like ALICE, the plot turns, but with a freshness that you do not see in small movies. I loved the management, Sutherland, just a very fast and interesting movie.
