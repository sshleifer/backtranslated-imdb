Story of a strange love and a desire to fall. Poem about beauty and perfection, fear and touch. A slice of Visconti, Mahler and Mann. And an agonizes Venice. I do not know if it is a masterpiece, a poem or a director's reflection of the world. It's absolutely a "memento mori". and an exploration of illusion. An old mirror of limits, signs and delicacy of death. A journey into an old, nostalgic, cruel and beautiful space. "Death" is a copy of Orfeu's journey into the immediate reality. And the essence is music. Soft and sweet music, like honey or the fire of winter. Like every regret and every sorrow. As a refuge in deep solitude. Gustav is gay by accident. He is the seeker of the last form of the presence of God. Beauty, that beauty that gives the meaning of life, which is both sin and virtue, offers expectations and sufferings. He dies because he has the right to hope, to believe in the reality of the miracle and in his way. A victim? No way! Only Tadzio can give freedom as an insignificant sacrifice. Who saw the sun can hope to live in the same state?
