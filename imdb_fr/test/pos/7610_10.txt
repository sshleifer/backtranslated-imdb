I thought this movie was really great! One of Drew's best. I'm also a fan of Michael Vartan, so I thought he was very sexy in this movie. Why all the bad reviews. I would like to watch this movie again and again if I could. I also liked the end. This movie clearly showed a smile on my face! I was also surprised that James Franco and Jessica Alba are present. I love them both so I also highlighted this film. In the end, when Drew commented a lot on the truth, he really told the truth about what sometimes happens in high school. Once again, the movie was amazing. Defying a 10/10. I hope this comment has been very helpful to all IMDb readers.
