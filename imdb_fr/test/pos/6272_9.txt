This film must have been quietly released to another side of the world, perhaps even in English. I hope nobody has understood a word, there is nothing to understand anyway in this movie! Haahaa! Call me crazy, but I think it's one of the best movies of all time. Why should I reach this conclusion? Because it's my national pastime to sabotage horrible movies and this one claims it every minute! Once I became a fan of Myster Science Theater 3000, I had no doubt that they would find it somewhere and use it. Enough! The version they acquired was titled "Cave Dwellers" and used strange introductory images, even those of the movie (apparently, they were ashamed to use images of their own movie!). I can not say that I recommend buying this movie. Instead, I highly recommend getting the MST3K version. Sure to find it almost anywhere DVD MST3K are sold, do not miss them!
