This film is a tour de force by Julie Taymor who directs and directs the scenography and masks. No one approaches his imagination on the modern opera stage. Since the shooting of this film in 1992, she has had great success in filmmaking and musical comedy. One can only hope that she can be persuaded to return to the opera one day. I would like to see a ringing cycle led by her. The current Rheingold of Covent Garden has giants with oversized hands, like the characters in this film. The current butterfly at ENO uses Japanese puppets. Coincidence perhaps, or evidence that Taymor's influence is omnipresent. <br /> <br /> Taymar uses fantastic costumes, masks, puppets and origami birds to replicate the story of Oedipus on a stilt-like stage over a lake. Red ribbons are a recurring theme. They are used as an umbilical cord at the birth of Oedipus. They fall from their eyes after he's blinded himself. They are used breathtakingly and used to make a cross when the murder of Oedipus of his father is reproduced by puppets. <br /> <br /> Stravinsky's neoclassical opera-ballet enjoyed justified darkness until the film brought it to life. The music is uninspired but harmless and Philip Langridge, Jesse Norman and a very young Bryn Terfel make the most of it. The singers are quite immobile, according to Stravinsky's wishes. Min Tanaka is the Oedipal Dance of the Langridge Sangred Oedipus. This creates a bit of confusion towards the end when you dance. Oedipus moves his eyes to sing Oedipus. <br /> <br /> The booklet is in Latin, but do not worry if your Latin in high school is a little rusty. There is a useful narrator who presents and describes each scene in Japanese.
