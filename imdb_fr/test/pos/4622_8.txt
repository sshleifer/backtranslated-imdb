Many other viewers say it's not a good movie to watch because they feel it's not "realistic". How can he not be considered realistic. They feel that saying that the incest part is not easy to understand, that it is not common. I can guarantee you that you have met more people than you think who have had an act of incest. Many of them are not going to say it and they are mostly victims. In addition, many people are gay and are always closer, because no matter what they want, they know they will be ridiculed and eventually abandoned. And tell me, how many children did you go to high school with who ended up being pregnant or had an eating disorder? I bet a lot, and although pregnancy is not caused by incest most of the time, it's still easy to understand. Who can not understand being an outcast or being bullied? It happens all the time. and many viewers are probably concerned with their education, such as Marcus. being a stoner seems to be pretty common these days. so there are a lot of things to connect. But above all, whatever your popularity, you sometimes feel invisible or alone, not noticed or neglected, as the victim of a suicide, how not to have the feeling to be able to relate to the film? I find that the film may seem useless to others, but I would like to think that it is important. It's an interesting way to show that suicide is happening and to be aware of it. it comes from people who do not show their unhappy thoughts, it's very surprising. Sufferers sometimes commit suicide, but when you hear about suicide, those who guessed it usually think of the minds of most people. <br /> <br /> The end surprised me, I did not expect to be the girl who until the end, was especially an extra in the scenes, not even introduced. the story, even in its description, talks about 6 teenage lives, when it was 7 people. My only real disappointment is that it was not one of the characters we learned, it was at first film was useless to watch if the real victim is just a random chick. until I think more. it was perfectly logical to be a big surprise, since that's what suicides are. plus, who had to choose who one of the other students had more than one reason. <br /> <br /> Although this film has negative points, most movies have some, but I would recommend this film, as long as you can watch the tragic moments of suicide, violence and profanity shown in this film.
