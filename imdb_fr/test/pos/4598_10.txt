I do not know why there are no articles, posters or anything about this film because I just saw it and I found it AWESOME. I guess it's not for everyone because it's basically Kafka's "The Trial" and "Beevis and Butt-Head", which is a tough combination to swallow. Still, I thought it was great. If you want to see it because you want a suite at Office Space, you will probably be disappointed. But if you want to see one of the most brutal, bitterest and hilariously honest looks on the direction of our society, you will enjoy yourself. I just saw the opening night of the 20-hour show in Los Angeles and there were only 12 people in the theater, which means that the movie will probably be gone in a week. It's a shame because, in its own way, Idiocracy is one of the best satires to have known time. But again, it's making fun of the people who make up about 99% of the movie audience, so I guess it's no wonder the studio panicked and tried to dump it.
