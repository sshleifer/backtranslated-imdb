The movie 'Nightbreed' is one of the best horror movies I have ever seen. Overall, I'm not a big fan of horror movies, but this movie has something more atmospheric and different from any other horror movie I've ever seen. Many horror movies that I have seen and enjoyed watching, however, as they are based on horror, I know that the stories are unreal, they are fictional, so I can not take them all seriously. Nightbeed, on the other hand, is a unique kind of horror because it has a sense of realism that I've seen in very few other horror movies. <br /> <br /> This movie story about how a man is murdered and ends Living with the undead in an underground cemetery shelter with undead monsters is the kind of story that a person would have a dream of nightmare, it's a very unique and original scenario. Most of the horror movies I've seen are quite fake, but because Nightbreed was incredibly sophisticated and awesome with a great acting, especially Craig Sheffer (Aaron Boone), amazing special effects, Super lights and fantastic dialogue, I found that this movie had a sense of depth and maturity without any fake stupid horror parody, than what many other horror movies have. Nightbreed, in addition to being a horror, contains elements of thriller, romance and action all struck at once. If you have not seen this movie, I recommend watching it because I rate it 10/10.
