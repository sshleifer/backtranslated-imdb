For those who are too young to remember, or too old to be part of the "hype", Michael Jackson's fashion in the early 80's was at its peak - like the hype on Titanic, except that lets down. Every song, every video, every word that Michael said was important. Nothing like it had been seen since the heyday of The Beatles. <br /> <br /> I remember seeing this video for the first time, on a skating rink. Everyone stopped skating. There was no question of whether you were a Michael Jackson fan or not; you were. Everyone gathered around the projection screen and watched the video ... <br /> <br /> This is probably one of the longest music videos ever made and certainly the better. It is still ranked # 2 in MTV's top 100 annual videos (No. 1 is still the flavor of the month and, one way or another, all that was # 1 of all time is Past No. 2 to make room for the new No. 1. Go figure.), and Thriller has become a phenomenon in itself. <br /> <br /> If you have the opportunity, you have to watch the video; not just the excerpt shown on MTV or VH1. If necessary, look for Making of Thriller in a video rental store. Hey ... your parents probably made you watch pictures of the Beatles and Woodstock because "it was important" ... well, that's important too.
