Being cornish and having grown up with the history of tin mining, this movie is quite special to me. Filmed at various locations in and around Cornwall, it tells the story of two children who were trapped in a mine with a group of miners. <br /> <br /> The "Haunters" of the title refer to "Spriggins". - the ghosts of the minor miners who reside in the mine and who, it is said, would bring harm to all mine that is there. Events take place with an American who wants to invest in a local tin mine, but when the local kid Josh is distressed by the ghost sighting of a young boy, he and his American girlfriend decide to break into it the mystery of his death, culminating in the rescue of themselves and several miners from an almost certain death when a new well is opened and the Spiggins save them. <br /> <br /> Top quality film, although small budget and short, but worth the trip to Cornwall and / or the tin mines!
