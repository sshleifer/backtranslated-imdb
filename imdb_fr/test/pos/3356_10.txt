When I was engaged, my fiance and I went to adult bookstores. He was looking for his favorite magazines and sometimes a video that caught the eye. As much as I enjoyed one-on-one with him caused by the media, there has never been a video that I really enjoyed. I had only seen one other movie at the time when there was a satellite channel called XXX (which dealt with a particular case revealing a case) that actually had an appropriate plot and that was nice. All the others were grumbling, blowing, blowing and all the rest. There are not so many times that you can watch a blonde bimbo pretend "that". <br /> <br /> This film caught my eye, and I emigrated, allowing him to hang out in the store. He noticed (how hard it was? Smiles, I was actually interested in something, lol (!) In the video section!) And I came to buy the slightly used copy for me. We took it home and loved it. Here is a "Porn" with a plot. I was not sure it was even classified in the porn category, but I used the word vaguely. <br /> <br /> The librarian was a character I could relate to. Alice rejected the advances of her boyfriend. She was not comfortable with her own sexuality and prude in her comments. Bill left and she continued to record in the books. The white rabbit ran through the library (Lewis C., Lewis C.) and Alice, for the same reason that drove teenagers to run in the woods. when a manic chainsaw is behind them rather than to the populated areas, follows. This is the best way to advance the plot. Alice is in Wonderland. <br /> <br /> I hardly remember all the details, but I clearly remember swimming in the lake and how it had been "dried". I liked the way they found Humpty Dumpty Up, the size of the Mad Hatter member being on his hat to wear it proudly, and the brother-in-law team of Dum and Dee (which bothered me slightly - Then again, they could have been husband wife, but I could never say, no matter how many times I watched her). The woman on the knight who told Alice to leave and find her own knight (What is a pretty girl like you on a knight like this?). <br /> <br /> The part that really caught my eye when I looked about a year later was one of the cards (3 of hearts, I think) that looked exactly like the current woman my ex! We could not help but tease her about her role in the movie! The king of hearts was interesting, and the queen was even more so. Due to the opening of the forum, I can not go into details. Just say it was an "orgy" and we'll stop there! <br /> <br /> When we separated, I was allowed to take the video - he knew I liked it - but in the time that has passed since the loan was lost One day, I will find another copy. <br /> <br /> Btw, if anyone could tell me which list had been cut from the Amazon version, I would really appreciate it. <br /> <br /> I congratulate him wholeheartedly. recommend this movie to 18 years and older. It was sweet, sweet and really in the 70's, but I liked it a lot. <br /> <br /> ***** out of 5. D.
