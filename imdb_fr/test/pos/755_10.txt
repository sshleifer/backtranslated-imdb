Charlotte Beal arrives in a psychiatric hospital in an isolated country to become a full-time nurse. She is confronted by a motley group of madmen and a seemingly crazier supervisor. Is Dr. Masters all that she seems to be? <br /> <br /> DO NOT WATCH IN THE BASEMENT is one of the best low budget movies of its kind and the reason why people always belittle it is beyond me. The acting is excellent, my favorite performance being that of Betty Chandler in the role of Allyson the nymphomaniac. The chills are just jumping from the screen. You probably will not have to say "It's just a movie, it's just a movie", it's not that scary, but it should appeal to all horror fans who respect the kind of low-budget horror, which I do. It is very difficult to make a scary movie on a small budget and few are able to do it. AX is another cheap film that is despised. Perhaps people are so spoiled by the big budgets of recent movies that any movie that does not have great effects and / or is not considered a classic has no chance with an audience. But I think after seeing this film, people will see how important the kind of low budget horror is and this movie is a classic that stands out among the other nonsense.
