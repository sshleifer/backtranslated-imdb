Behind the nostalgic music, we see a young boy get off a train. He comes from Yugoslavia to meet his father, a man he has not seen for a decade. At the station, we meet the man. He never smiles. <br /> <br /> This is how we begin our journey in "Four Friends", Arthur Penn's powerful and amazing film. You can ask why I started my exam this way. This is how the video box describes the movie. You may have understood that the film would tell the story of the boy trying to get along with this man without emotion and that he would eventually take off his blanket and expose his kindness. <br /> <br /> bought that, I have a bridge that I want to sell you. You see, modern Hollywood would do this movie. Penn has always been an outsider and has never used typical clich√© stories. He always tells interesting stories about people (his credits include "Bonnie and Clyde", "The Chase", "Alice's Restaurant" and the underrated "Mickey One") and "Four Friends" is no exception. <br /> <br /> A typical Hollywood movie would be centered on the boy named Danilo. But Steve Tesich's script only focuses on that for about 4 minutes and then drops it. We meet adult Danilo, played by Craig Wasson (whom you can recognize from "Body Double" and "Nightmare on Elm Street 3") and his friends, Tom, David and the passionate Georgia. The film takes us into the sixties. Now, in a smaller film, events would receive attention. But in "Four Friends", these events occur, but Penn and Tesich is more interested in the study of the character than the plot and I think the film is better as well. We know the events. we do not need to dwell on them again. <br /> <br /> I know I did not describe the plot much, but I do not know if you can describe "Four friends". This is not one of those "high concept" movies that can be described in one sentence. It is a film of many atmospheres and textures. It is also a truly emotional experience. The last twenty minutes of this film moved me to tears. I'm not ashamed to admit it. Rarely does a film have such power that it can make me cry. The cast of actors is first rate, especially Craig Wasson, who seems to be one of the most underused players today. It's an emotional performance so difficult that Wasson succeeds. He should have received an Oscar for that. Jodi Thelen, who plays an even more difficult role than Wasson, is another great performance. But she handles it extremely well and gives Georgia a certain dignity that most Hollywood actresses would not want (they would be too scared to do it, they would be more concerned about the image than about giving a great performance; is not what to play). She also deserved an Oscar. <br /> <br /> "Four friends" was hardly encouraged in 1981. Maybe people just did not have the emotional capacity to handle it. And the clueless executives could not push him like another "American Graffiti" (it lacks the clutter of "Four Friends"). So they let him die. Too bad, because it's one of the best movies of the 1980s, a decade in which more and more smooth trash was created and where such art was homeless. I ask you to give this film a chance. <br /> <br /> **** on 4 stars
