The problem with this series is that it is too real. I'm looking at Amazon "Unbox" and I just finished episode 2, I hate, I absolutely hate, Fark, the head of the cell. I do not remember a TV series that has ever had that emotional impact. Remember the old slogan for horror movies "Keep telling yourself it's just a movie"? Well, I repeat to myself many times that this is his "only television". But of course, it's not just television? The possibility that a cell such as the one described here actually works in the United States is certainly within the realm of plausibility. This gives this program its vicious authenticity. And that's why I hate so much.
