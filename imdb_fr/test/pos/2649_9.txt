Dear readers, 2001: The Odyssey of Space is Kubrick at its best ... although I can not really say it, the Space Odyssey is his only film to date. But still, it's a good movie. Strange, but good. <br /> <br /> The film is in three acts, a bit like the novel ... which is not surprising since the author wrote the script. Anyway, we start with the simple but spectacular opening with the arrival of Altern Sparach Zarathustra on the speakers. Then comes the boring sequence beyond belief, Dawn of Man. Then there is the strange sequence 'Finding of the Monolith' on the Moon, played on Strauss's Blue Danube. Finally, spaceship and HAL scenes go crazy and deadly. After that, things went out and we have the sequence 'Entering the Monolith' which was MUCH too long and the ending was extremely strange. Even so, 2001: A space odyssey is a good movie. It's not Star Wars, Stargate, Terminator or The Abyss, but it's ripping. My compliments to the leader, Mr. Kubrick. <br /> <br /> Signed, the Constant DVD collector
