A good story, well interpreted with unexpected twists, for example. Vicious murder gangster Bryan Brown teaching his macram√© son. Although it works like an action drama where we hope that the good guy (Ledger) and his buddy succeed, he also has an ironic and hilarious black humor, for example bank robbers who become "winners" of the radio contest and their reaction, the revenge of the executioner, etc.
