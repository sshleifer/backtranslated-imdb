Two funeral directors in a Welsh village? English humor as opposed to this kind of things from across the Atlantic? How could I resist. My wife and I saw it on March 6 for our late Valentine's Day celebration and we both enjoyed good belly laughs. We were going to see another movie later, but decided not to do it because we wanted the movie experience to stay with us for the evening. <br /> <br /> The death scene of the last 20 minutes of the film is worth the wait. This raises issues rarely raised in the community, but I know three funeral directors and the humor is right in the budget. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended and congratulations to the authors. Without you, not all actors, directors and others have a job every Monday.
