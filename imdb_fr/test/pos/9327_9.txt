No matter what you think of Michael Jackson himself, you can not deny that this video is the most unique video of all time. There is no other video so close to "Thriller" The first time I saw that, it was at the age of 6 and it scared me. Now, I'm looking at her with a smile because I can now appreciate the wonder she is. I love this video and it will exist as long as the music videos exist. I think everyone should sit and watch when they are on and look back and see how great it was, especially for 1983.
