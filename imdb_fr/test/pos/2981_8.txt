My girlfriend and I saw this film during its initial release. The controversy surrounding the initial release (teen nudity, physical intimacy and unwanted pregnancy) was a topic that never touched our vision of the film. We were almost the same age as Paul and Michelle and we had many of the same intense and confusing emotions. We were too young to let ourselves be caught up in the simplistic acting game (sometimes) and the crazy (at times) emotional twists. This film told us in a way that an adult love story could never have had. I still remember sitting in the movies with my girlfriend and holding her hand while she cried during the tragic final scenes (syrupy albi).
