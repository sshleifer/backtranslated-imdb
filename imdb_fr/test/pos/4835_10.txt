I watched the premiere of "Path to Paradise" way back and I was stunned by that, a dramatic license and everything. I lived in New York (Brooklyn) a few years and I kept it in mind. Today, given the links with groups such as al-Qaeda, Hamas and Islamic Jihad, I see it as a warning not recognized by our government. For that, I blame our bureaucracy and our leaders. 9.11.01 was a new tactic to behead two of our branches of government and there is no excuse for our government to stop it, period. "Path to Paradise" was just a dramatic view of the 1993 snapshot, and no one cared. Today, nearly 3,000 deaths later and years later, we struggle to find an answer that will take several decades to resolve.
