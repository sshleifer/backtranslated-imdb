Better than I expected a film that was selling on the field of nymphomania and interracial servitude. The music is great and the cinematography focuses on turning Ricci into a trailer for Betty Paige and it works. Samuel L. has to shout a lot, for which he is good, as well as play a lot of blues guitar, which he looks cool to do. Even Justin Timberlake was decent as a mentally disturbed boyfriend. I have the impression that this material under anybody else would have been complete, but that I managed to be content to separate ourselves from barley from its strange little transgressive pastry niche, while remaining effective.
