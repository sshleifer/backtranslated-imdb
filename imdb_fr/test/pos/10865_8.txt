I started looking at it hoping for the worst, and I was happy to see that the film turned out to be nice, slightly confusing in places, like when they all started singing. It gave me the chance to see Daniel Wu in action for the first time, he's a better actor than I thought, he sometimes seemed a little out of place. I thought Purple Storm deserved the release of its Hong Kong legend, as it is different from most other Hong Kong films. It is about emotional struggles between a man and a loss of memory. it makes the movie a lot more interesting. Once you enter the movie, you will find that it keeps you hooked, as if you were missing a piece, so a lot of this movie would make sense, for example I missed a bit at first and I recommend it to all those who look at it they lack none. So I can say that this film was worth watching and a grateful surprise for me, that I enjoyed it.
