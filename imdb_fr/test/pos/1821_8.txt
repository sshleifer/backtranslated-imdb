I really liked this movie, it reminds me totally of my high school years. The soundtrack is great. I am a big fan of cage and it is my favorite movie in which it is located. I like the scenario, it's a story of total love, against all odds. I think anyone who graduated in the early eighties (1980-1984) should see the film. It really reminded me of high school memories.
