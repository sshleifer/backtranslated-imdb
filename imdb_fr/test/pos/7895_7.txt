"Joe" is one of those movies where, although you think everything is going well, you end up hitting yourself as if ... I can not come to an analogy. This showed not only that the long-standing idea of ​​American unity was debatable, but also in various aspects of our society. Melissa Compton (Susan Sarandon) is the child of the flower par excellence, while her father Bill (Dennis Patrick) is a clean leader. One day, Bill accidentally kills Melissa's boyfriend. Immediately after, Bill meets Joe Curran (Peter Boyle), an ultra-righteous and racist man with hard work. As a result, they end up associating more and more with the hippies, whom Bill finds unpleasant and that Joe hates outright. But ultimately, everything has extremely serious consequences. <br /> <br /> Certainly, some parts of the film date a little, but it is a good juxtaposition of the two camps of America during the Vietnam war. And rest assured, the residual effects of all that will probably never go away.
