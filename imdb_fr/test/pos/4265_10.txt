Sometimes mainstream media seem to be led by a group of brainless journalists. In this they listen to each other and report what others report. <br /> <br /> This documentary shows what can be found if additional efforts are made to account for something. <br /> <br /> True journalism should aim to give people different perspectives on what is happening so that they have a chance to create their own opinion. <br /> <br /> This documentary, as well as the main media reports, will help you do that. At least for me, he provided a lot of relevant information on the purpose / motivation behind the events of our current and global days at different political summits.
