I can see that the ratings for this movie are not so high for this movie, so I have to be in the minority for having liked this movie so much. Well, I'm right and everyone is wrong (I'm kidding). I guess I like that because I'm a professor of psychology and I really liked the character played by Ryan. Although he is really dangerous and very menacing, you can not hate him because he is obviously mentally ill and probably suffers from some kind of brain injury. And wow, Ryan did a very good job in describing this man! You feel really in love with Ida Lupino as he destroys his life. So with such an acting game and such a threat, why is the film rated relatively low? Well, probably because it's not quite credible, but it's fun and creative. Try and do not believe the score of 6.4 - it's much better than that!
