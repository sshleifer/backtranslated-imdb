On March 17, 1974, a man was found dead in the restroom of the Penn Station in Manhattan. Although well known, he can not be identified because he has erased the personal information contained in his passport and his body rests unclaimed at the city morgue for three days. It turned out to be the body of what many consider to be one of the greatest American architects of the twentieth century, Louis I. Kahn. He died at the age of 73, from India, where one of his largest projects, the Management Institute in Ahmedabad, was about to be completed. <br /> <br /> One of the most influential American architects of the post-war period. The architectural legacy of Louis Kahn includes the House of Parliament in Dhaka (Bangladesh), the Kimbell Art Museum in Forth Worth, the Yale Art Gallery, the Salk Institute in California and a kind of mobile "music boat" designed to give concerts in the ports of different cities around the world. <br /> <br /> Although celebrated as an architect, very little was known about his private life. In addition to his wife Esther and their daughter Sue Ann, two mistresses, Harriet Pattison and Anne Tyng, have left to mourn Kahn, along with their two children. The three families lived miles apart in the suburbs of Philadelphia, but their paths never crossed before the funeral. His son, Nathaniel, the director of this film, was then only 11 years old and had only a few memories of his father's weekly visits to Harriet Patterson, Nathaniel's mother in Philadelphia. Twenty-five years later, he began a journey to confront his father by visiting Kahn's buildings, talking with relatives and colleagues, and visiting places that played a role in Louis Kahn's life. <br /> <br /> The most moving confrontations occur when Nathaniel asks his mother, Louis Kahn's landscape architect and mistress, why she continued to play with his wife's second violin and never confronted him. that. Tears have run down her eyes, but she does not regret anything. "It was worth it." It is an intensely sad moment. She is obviously broken, treated as an outcast at her funeral, which she was forbidden to attend, it is almost as if she led a life replacement. All of this seems strangely unreal. Another interview with Edward Bacon, Kahn's architectural scam, responsible for rebuilding his native Philadelpia in the fifties and sixties, is almost a casualty on the spot, as he recalls unsavory ideas. from Kahn concerning architecture. His son, Nathaniel, listens uncomfortably when a very high-ranking Bacon howls with anger every time Kahn's name is mentioned. The final scene is reserved for Kahn's largest creation, the Capitol in Dhaka, Bangladesh. It took 23 years to realize this vast and extraordinary building of which the Bangladeshis are extremely proud. It is one of the few national symbols having a stature in this impoverished country. Some of the interviews with locals made me cry, especially when they learned that they were talking to God, his son, the architect! <br /> <br /> The film is a personal and personal journey. An account of the great architectural heritage of Kahn and concerns above all the realization of the film itself and the realization of the film in general. Perhaps Louis I. Kahn has weakened as a father, but these gaps in his personal life make it an even more interesting portrait in this extraordinary film. <br /> <br /> Camera Obscura --- 9/10
