I've always been a fan of this almost invisible filming of Gershwin's opera, since I last saw it in 1959. As many of you know, it was not available on video or on DVD. in fact, the Gershwin family sought to destroy all existing engravings. <br /> <br /> However, for some reason, marking the end of his opposition, the Gershwin family recently approved the projection of a collector's print at the Museum. moving image in Astoria, Queens. . <br /> <br /> The big screen printing in Technicolor was excellent! (Not perfect, but excellent.) The sound was exceptional, in stereo quality. People who saw this in its original version would not have seen a much better copy. (The program notes include the original Variety magazine, which warns that people might hesitate at the exorbitant ticket price of â‚¬ 3.50!) <br /> <br /> And as much as I originally liked it PORGY AND BESS was better than I remembered. It's just wonderful. Sidney Poitier as Porgy was at the moment when his career was just beginning to catch on fire and his charisma is shining. Dorothy Dandridge as Bess is spectacularly beautiful. Brock Peters as a Crown is aggressively masculine. Pearl Bailey in the role of Maria provides some comical moments, although her role is small. And Sammy Davis, Jr., as Sporting Life, steals all scenes in which he finds himself; he is particularly fascinating in his two big numbers: "It's not necessarily necessary" and "There's a boat that is Leavin 'Soon for New York". (The latter garnered applause during the screening I saw.) <br /> <br /> PORGY AND BESS is bound to take, but it does not matter if the staging is so beautiful that this one. The costumes are also remarkable. <br /> <br /> The sung voices of Sidney and Dorothy are doubled, but extremely. The exquisite "Summertime" is sung by Clara, performed by a young Diahann Carroll; his singing is also doubled. (In fact, only Pearl and Sammy make their own vocalizations.) <br /> <br /> The music is sublime, of course, but what really struck me this time is the emotion that Preminger was able to draw from the story. People sniffed in the audience several times - once, when Bess sang the magnificent "I Loves You Porgy". And I got a kick out of the audience laughing loudly at the lines in "This is not necessarily necessary." Could they have never heard this song before or never really listened to it? I think a lot of the emotional impact of this film is due to the performances of Poiter and Dandridge - you are motivated by their love for victory. <br /> <br /> A small problem with the duration of 136 minutes - one or two slow scenes, and a stereotypical scene, Amos-n-Andy, where Bess sees a puny lawyer to get Crown's divorce, even if she is not even married to him. (I would have cut that.) And the beginning is a bit confusing - the two characters in the title are awkwardly introduced - they are part of the movie before you realize who they are. <br /> <br /> And I do not think Preminger has used a single close-up throughout the film. Everything seems to have been shot in 3/4, which I suppose was his way of working with the big screen. <br /> <br /> PORGY AND BESS has always been a cult film for those of us who have seen it. , for those of us who liked the soundtrack, and for some of us who only heard about it. Hopefully they will find a way to republish it and put it on DVD. It deserves the widest possible audience.
