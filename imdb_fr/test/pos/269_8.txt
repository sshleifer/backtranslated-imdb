"First Suspect 4" pursues the exploits of the impenetrable and persistent detective of truth and justice, Superintendent Detective Jane Tennison; the first of three miniseries (PS4, PS5 and PS6) with the notable absence of the founding writer Lynda La Plante of the credits. Steeped in the same reality as in the first three series, the third series confronts Tennison with the forces of evil while facing the Middle Ages, loneliness, indiscretions, a host of personal and professional problems and resolutions. sometimes less than ideal. PS4 evokes two stories while PS5 and PS6 are unique episodes in which Tennison seeks justice for brutally injured people while waging a war against institutions willing to sacrifice the interests of its victims for those of a greater well. In other words, to win, Tennison must defeat both the evil forces and the good forces, making the gray PS series scenarios even grayer and the Tennison wars a matter of principle as well. than to find murderers. Very good material that only improves serial series. (B +)
