I went to the movies to see Claudine and I loved every minute of the cast and the soundtrack. Diahann Carroll has never been better than in this role. We saw Mrs. Carroll minimize her gaze just seeing her naked, smoking a cigarette, drinking beer and oh she cursed. Whenever this film was broadcast on television and I finally received the cable, I called my friends to watch it. Just the soundtrack of the very beginning of the movie is great, all thanks to Gladys Knight and the Pips. We have seen a black woman struggling to raise her children, facing a teenage pregnancy and daily life meeting a man whom she later learns is having problems herself. Finally, this film was rendered on DVD and deserves well.
