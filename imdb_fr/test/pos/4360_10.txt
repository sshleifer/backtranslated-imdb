Wow, it's a touching story! I first saw 'Rescue Dawn'. I did not like it. And now, I've seen the person, Dieter Dengler, to whom this story is told by Herzog. Very impressive. Dieter is a trained human being who has encountered the most opposite emotions in his life on this earth. What an extraordinary life this LED person has. His account of the capture of Lao Patet / Vietcong and therefore his suffering is horrible, but the most impressive is his incredible willingness to survive. How could he find this strength? Dieter tells us fluent sentences about his terrible ordeal during his captivity ... he is a great storyteller and Herzog does him justice that this good man deserves. <br /> In my opinion. 'Little Dieter needs to fly' says it all! , leaving nothing to the imagination, thus making 'Rescue dawn' a superfluous film. The horror is no more real than in the words of Dieter Dengler himself. He totally manages to paint the picture.
