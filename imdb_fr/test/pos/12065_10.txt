A hilarious show with so many great stories, that reflects the world of today as we know it, in such a fun way, it literally stole my laughter for other shows. I laughed so much that I did not find any other comic series. The unique confessions of each character is an original technique that makes the show funny and humorous. You may think that this is an average comedy show about family life. That's what I thought at first, but I discovered that it contains new and unique techniques that set it apart from any other average comedy show. Michael Rapaport is a star. I hope this show has not been canceled.
