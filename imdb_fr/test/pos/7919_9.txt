I think everyone who liked Eisentein's Ivan the Terrible films would appreciate this well-crafted movie. This film played as "Lord of the Ring: The Return of the King", but without special effect, but as good and better drama. <br /> <br /> We have the German, who dressed as KKK, conquered Novgorod of Russia. The Russian summoned Nevsky to fight the Germans to save Russia. Nikolai Cherkasov, who played Ivan in the films Ivan the Terrible, was charismatic as Nevsky. The first 10 minutes with which he managed the passage through Mongol were captivating. <br /> <br /> Several scenes were beautiful, even in black and white. The anticipation of the war did not require any dialogue of the type "how many enemies will be killed", etc. Except for a few speeches, the film can be played as a silent film. The battle scene can be likened to that of the birth of a nation. </ P> </ p> <p> <br /> <br /> The great musical score of Sergei Prokofiev is another strength of the film. The music gave an epic impression to the film in these scenes without dialogue.
