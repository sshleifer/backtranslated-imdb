If you like your sports movies talk about dignity and better values, it will work for you. Excessive in places? Of course, of course, and proud of it. It is the biggest and best carnival tour and should be appreciated as such. <br /> <br /> High production values, simple storytelling, with creative shots: it's not complex, it's a very nice and remarkably sweet film. It really looks like a Bill Paxton love job; and I bet his son understands that. <br /> <br /> The accumulation is slow enough to take full advantage of the conflicts, and the British against the Americans are treated with a degree of vaudevillian malice, but the dignity between two main transatlantic protagonists is still at foreground. I have some minor problems: the score wants to be James Horner but it is too exaggerated and there are too many close-ups and shots for 2005, but if you want a simple, decent and beautiful sports film, then it's <br /> <br /> So that's the thing, and I feel like I know my movie, but I love it more than Seabiscuit: which is a better movie, but Greatest Story is just Disney in the center and extremely enjoyable! Thank you, Bill.
