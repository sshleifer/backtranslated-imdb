My architect is a fantastic film about Nathaniel Kahn's quest through the legacy of his famous father, Louis Kahn, who has died since 1974. The film is slowly but perfectly constructed, and what begins with a seemingly lost identity crisis reveals a beautiful story disaster with a much deeper meaning regarding the importance of love, loss, family and perhaps most importantly, the work of our life. <br /> <br /> I had never heard of Louis Kahn before this movie, although I was vaguely familiar with some of his work. Thanks to the words (good and bad) from Louis Kahn's colleagues, you get a very good sense of what Nathaniel must have felt when memories are recalled and stories told. Sometimes it seemed like these people were telling Nathaniel how to feel about his father. Listening to each memory, my personal opinion of this man went from the beautiful to the horrible, sometimes in a moment, so you'll have a good idea of ​​the roller coaster that Nathaniel's emotions had to live through. <br /> The final sequence in Bangladesh totally made the film for me. The reverence that the people of Bangladesh spoke about the work of Louis Kahn has nicely made ends meet for me and, hopefully, for Nathaniel. <br /> <br /> I think Nathaniel Kahn finally found what he was looking for.
