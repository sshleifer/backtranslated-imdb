Only the British could make a film like this and make it so charming with taste! Betty (Brenda Blethyn) wants something more out of life, but she does not know what, when she realizes that she is in love with her childhood friend, Boris (Alfred Molina), who owns the salon funeral home. Meanwhile, an American funeral director (Christopher Walken) who "wants to put the fun back" in the funeral "moved into this small Welsh community with his assistant (Lee Evans) and wants to give Boris the courage of his money with a flashy funeral. (The funeral of Star Trek, anyone?) Brenda and Boris decide to stage Brenda's death and funeral with hilarious results - a very enjoyable movie - if you're a fan British comedies such as "Waking Ned Devine", you will love that.
