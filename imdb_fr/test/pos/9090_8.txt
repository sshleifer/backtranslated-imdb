Flatliners has all the ingredients of a good film by Joel Schumacher: intelligent and young characters, a breathtaking cinematography, a captivating story and excellent performances. It is a pleasure to escape but it is very well done and resonates with a positive spiritual message despite the disturbing precedents. <br /> <br /> Schumacher has the gift of spotting talented young actors, and the top five here have shifted things up (see list of actors). Their credible performances help raise this film well above average. Kiefer Sutherland shines in his role as a selfish medical student. <br /> <br /> Cinematography really stimulates the right side of the brain, which I love about Schumacher; its use of light and position creates images that stick. A disturbing nightmare atmosphere disturbs you when you watch the movie and haunts you when you go to bed - it reminds me of the Lost Boys. <br /> <br /> This is a film that takes a great place - curious students want to find out what happened after death and follow it successfully in a scary and captivating story of redemption. One of the best of Schumacher; highly recommended.
