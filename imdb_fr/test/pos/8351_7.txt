* little spoilers * <br /> <br /> You know, the animated point of Walt Disney Television Animation could just as well be called Walt Disney Sequel Animation. These suites range from excellent ("Beauty and the Beast: The Enchanted Christmas" and the fantastic "Lion King II: Pride of Simba") to the horrible ("The return of Jafar"). (This is, of course, my personal opinion.) Now, Disney brings us his latest sequel. "The adventure of Scamp", and even if it has flaws, it remains entertaining. <br /> <br /> The quality of the animation is not up to that of Disney Feature Animation; Yet the animators do a good job of bringing the characters to life. Lady and Tramp have not aged a day since 1955. Trusty still talks about his sense of smell and "Ol 'Reliable", and Jock still grieves. There is a nice fight between Tramp and a huge dog in the pound, and again, we are invited to a spaghetti dinner with two romantic heads (although it is highly doubtful that it becomes a classic scene like his predecessor.) /> <br /> I really do not like most songs (although Roger Bart and Susan Egan - the sung vocals of Scamp and Angel - sing very well their roles). Melissa Manchester and Norman Gimbel have both worked much better in the past. Danny Troob's score is ok, but nothing unforgettable. And some members of the Junkyard gang seem to be excess baggage; that is, they really do not do much. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, the work of the voice is very good. Although I do not like Jeff Bennett as a dog catcher, he is very good as a tramp. Chazz Palminteri does a good job as Buster, leader of the Junkyard gang, and Alyssa Milano gives what could be his best performance as Angel. Then there is Scamp (who is the spitting image of his father). He is expressed to PERFECTION by Scott Wolf. Wolf does a superb job showing Scamp's wild trail and his sweet side. <br /> <br /> In summary, although "Scamp's Adventure" is flawed, the viewing remains rather entertaining. I hope, however, that Walt Disney Television Animation will turn to more original media for their next releases. <br /> <br />
