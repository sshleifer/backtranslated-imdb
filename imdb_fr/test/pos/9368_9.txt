A film like Crossfire puts another film that is propagated in his social conscience, namely the recent film Crash, almost to shame. Not necessarily because one or the other puts forward his message of intolerance is more significantly rotten (although I would bet that Crash throws the hammer much stronger in comparison with that), but because of the way whose narrative and artifices never take on much importance. as with Crash. Perhaps it is not really necessary to compare the two, because Crossfire is deeply rooted in the vein of the film noir, as if it were old-fashioned. It was interesting to see what the director Edward Dmytryk said during the interview with the DVD, in which he mentioned that the budget allocated to photography was much lower (on purpose), so that we could spend more for actors and the schedule has very fast, fast pace. But then, what seems incredible in the picture is that one might think that it would take a lot of things to adjust the lighting. Just for a small scene, as when Robert Mitchum's Keeely was interviewed for the first time by Captain Robert Young, the contrasts of shadows in the room are exquisite. There are many other lighting configurations that go even further with so few brands, it's something essential in the field of the black period look. Just take a look at a picture of characters in a stairwell, the bars against each other, and see what I mean. <br /> <br /> But back to the essential part of the film: it's really a story that consists of A mystery of murder, but that the public does not take long to understand. It is more like something else in the mind and soul of a killer that would not be found in an ordinary crime picture, since there is really no "criminal" in the movie. There is a very calculated risk with that as the characters may be too thin to support the (valid) anti-Semitism message. But the direction given by Dmytryk to his main cast, accompanied by a really great scenario of John Paxton, stuffs the characters, the least for what they should have to not look too thin next to the message. And what would be then a black without a certain attitude to accompany him? Mitchum contributes to this, even in scenes like the one between Young and Young, where he is very much based on the situation of the moment of the story (that is, a detail in the plot), infusing a little sneaky spirit to dialogue. He may already be there in the lines, but he helps the character to have a good advantage for his scenes. <br /> <br /> There is also Robert Ryan, who excels in Montgomery as a man you know you do not know. I do not like it much at first, just through his behavior, but you're not totally sure either. Then, once it starts to be clearer - ironically from a subjective point of view of the suspect Mitchell (George Cooper) in Samuels' apartment, who will soon die - his performance becomes a tremendous balance: to be full of shit and also rather scary in his blind. It is a good performance when he is also opposed by Cooper, who has personal problems that he faces and who advances with regret and humility. It's really after the end of the film that we think a lot about this, however, and while you watch the film, it's more important to enter the dialogue and the unfolding of the scenes, and in the camera, sometimes austere and overwhelming, move actors, so the message is somehow secondary. Not that it is not important, especially for the period (coming from the Second World War), but years later, he sees the actors, even those who do not get the status of big brand like Gloria Grahame as Ginny (the femme fatale of the photo if she had had the time) and William Phipps in the role of Leroy (the "hick"), working very hard against each other who stick a lot in the compact scenario. <br /> <br /> Dmytryk is also very wise in choosing to limit the score. It's powerful too, because for very long periods we do not hear anything, and most of the time, when that happens, it's incidental to the character's environment. He might as well have added musical notes to certain dramatic scenes, particularly the first public attraction film. By avoiding this, and by getting the right attitudes and nuances in the camera and casting, he raises gender standards to a very fine and memorable level. My favorite scene would probably go to Finley's story about an Irish immigrant he tells Leroy, where all the elements of this kind are in place. It might not be very high at the top of my favorite blacks - and I'd still cast Murder My Sweet as the director's masterpiece in that kind of photo - but it's certainly better than B-level .
