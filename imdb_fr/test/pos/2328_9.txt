Not the best plot in the world, but the comedy in this movie is the rule. Kelsey Grammar is beautiful in this movie. Rob Schneider is another fun guy who will make you crack with his segments with Ken Hudson Campbell, who plays the role of Buckman. Lauren Holly probably plays the most serious character in the cast, Lieutenant Lake. Bruce Dern is an excellent actor in this film, probably playing the most serious character in the film. The actor I loved most was Toby Huss in the role of Nitro; all the electric shots he takes in the movie are hilarious. <br /> <br /> The plot is a little uneven, about Commander Tom Dodge, who for years has wanted to order his own sub. When he finally gets the chance, instead of a brand new submarine, he gets a rusty diesel submarine from the Second World War, the Stingray. His crew is not better, the unsuited to the US Navy. It is then put in a series of war games, which shows how an old diesel engine can behave against the current nuclear navy. Things still do not improve when he finds out that his dive officer is actually a woman, to see how women are doing with submarines. To get the command post he wants, he must win the war games and blow up a dummy ship. <br /> <br /> The film goes pretty well, in fact I laughed all the time when I saw this movie in theaters. I loved it when they were in Buckman's silence and sobs, and that every reaction to the smell was hilarious. <br /> <br /> Overall, 9 out of 10, this movie is just fun to watch, it's good to have a movie like that, I hate movies that are trying to be serious at 100 %.
