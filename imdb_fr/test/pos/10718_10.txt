It's a phenomenal film. Really one of the best movies I have ever watched. I am a serious critic and it takes a lot to stir, but this movie had all the right combinations to "stir". The passion of the actors, without the suraction, the pain for all the characters involved, the serious and subtle truths about marriage and divorce, make it a must-see film, despite the fact that we are in the 1970s. is certainly not an "old film", but a classic / vintage film. I hope you will get involved as I did when you consider how volatile relationships can be, when you also consider how deep the pain associated with love can be and the most difficult decisions to take will always be the most painful, are made, the pain subsides, but only gradually. This film certainly shows that the most unstable relationships are not necessarily weak relationships and that leaving is certainly not synonymous with loss / lack of love. The "making" of this film certainly comes from a place deeply rooted in someone's heart and mind.
