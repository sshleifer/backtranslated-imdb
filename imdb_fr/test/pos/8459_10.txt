Normally, I do not comment on IMDB movies, but in this case, I feel I should do it. I love movies and I want to make them happen. This film is a perfect example of good cinematographic achievement. <br /> <br /> This is one of the few films I saw on the small screen (originally, I saw it on air on AMC, I think, and then on the DVD that I just watched) that made me feel this feeling in the pit of my stomach. This gnawing sensation that the director hopes to see you feel while watching his thriller. <br /> <br /> Jack Lemmon's performance is excellent, followed by Jane Fonda and Michael Douglas. I had so much empathy for Lemmon, whose character, Jack Godell, only wanted people to listen to his warning. <br /> <br /> But what impresses me the most in this film is the absence of score and it's also makes it beautiful for me. Apart from the opening titles, there is no background music to increase the tension because none is necessary. And while the credits run, white on black, in silence, that's what makes all the difference. <br /> <br /> I use the film as an example for anyone who says that music makes film. I think the film should make the film and the music should only amplify that. But for The China Syndrome, music is not necessary to understand the realism and urgency illustrated here. The characters describe all this much better than the music could ever. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie, it is one of my favorites. If you like movies, you will not be disappointed. If you like more movie soundtracks, you may not want to try this one.
