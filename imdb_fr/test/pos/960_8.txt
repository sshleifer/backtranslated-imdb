I do not know why people considered it trashy or obnoxious; It's not like American Pie or something like that. I do not know why people are offended by the universal sockets; since this is part of the plot, the advertisement is excusable. <br /> <br /> It's a funny film with a good dialogue, a good subtle mind, a good story, a good moral (thankfully, it does not get too dark). , BIG action game, and an end of cheese. <br /> <br /> (minor spoiler) The basic premise is the classic story of a shepherd (Muniz) who lies so much that no one believes him when the wolf (Giamatti) comes along. So, he takes his best friend Kaylee (Bynes) and they will drive the wolf crazy. <br /> <br /> Frankie Muniz can be annoying in other roles, but not as Jason Shepherd. He manages perfectly the suave confidence of his character, and what seems to be a lack of expression at first sight is in fact a perfectly executed nonchalance. <br /> <br /> Amanda Bynes. What more can i say? The girl has the gift. She is funny, talented, versatile and very attractive. (I'm only 6 months older than she is, I have to go to California soon.) In fact, the role of "best friend" was originally a boy, but he became a girl as soon as officials given Amanda's interest. Which works pretty well, because the role would have been rather boring without the abilities of Bynes. <br /> <br /> Paul Giamatti is a very talented man. Some imitated Marty Wolf as a diabolical and diabolical, but Giamatti made him not only a fool but a fool LIKEABLE, a fool who brightened the screen rather than intentionally lowering it. And I doubt that many other actors are also able to mitigate the psychological depression suffered by Wolf. <br /> <br /> In short, it's an excellent film. I loved seeing Jaleel White able to make fun of himself. I loved seeing all the little references and such embedded in the movie. (One of the guests of the party is the director, Shawn Levy, another is Bynes's former co-star, Kenan Thompson) I loved seeing Amanda in these outfits ........ Get the DVD if you can. It contains all sorts of great extras and the lovely Ms. Bynes will guide you through the menus. :)
