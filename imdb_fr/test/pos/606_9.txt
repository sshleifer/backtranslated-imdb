MINOR SPOILERS <br /> <br /> The misunderstood classic remains one of the most beautiful and personal films of Henson. It may sound funny to call such a bad-liked film "misunderstood," but people seem to remember this one especially for Jerry Juhl's captivating screenplay and Paul Williams' punchy songs. Now, although these things are certainly great, as is the formal playfulness of the film (scenario in the screenplay, pause in the movie, etc.), what sets the movie "The Muppet Movie" of the other Muppet films is the thread serious and nostalgic through the image. It's a road movie, OK, but as in most road-movies, the pleasure is to get there, and the realization of the characters' goals is tempered by the uncertainty and the fact that they can never really go back. Throughout the film, we are shown the disadvantages of the show, even before the Muppets have done: Piggy abandons Kermit without the slightest hesitation after a call from his agent. Gonzo expresses the loneliness and regret of an artist's life. the road in its obsession "I'm going back one day" and, worse still, Kermit is continuously tortured and put to the test by Doc Hopper, who wants him to market his art for unfathomable purposes. (One can only wonder what Henson would have done with the management of the society by his family after his death.) Kermit himself is dismayed by his choices in the desert conversation scene, and the latest issue of 'Magic Store' asks if all this was worth it, before concluding that it probably does not matter. All this is punctuated by the expected chaos and satire of the Muppets and deliciously ugly jokes, and of course, serious things would not work if they were not. But "The Muppet Movie" is not another farce, as would the rest of the Muppet films with diminishing returns. No, it's a beautiful metaphor about the relationship between art, entertainment and the business world. It's as effective as 25 years ago. 9.5 out of 10.
