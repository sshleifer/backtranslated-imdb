Given his acting roles in the 1940s (Casper Gutman, Signior Ferrari, Mr. Peters, Jerome K. Arbutny, former Superintendent Grodman, Earl Fosco, Titus Semple), many fans are surprised at learn that Sidney Greenstreet originally named himself in West End and Broadway comedies. He was usually such a nasty or serious public actor that his comic talents were ignored. In fact, he actually made four appearances in a comedy (the parody of his ugly depictions with his ugly partner, Peter Lorre, in a cameo appearance). His best appearance in a comedy is probably that of magazine publisher Alexander Yardley in "Christmas In Connecticut" (although his autocratic soapoon and half crazy in "The Hucksters" is nearby). Despite some problems with the screenplay, it's a good movie, which usually came to life at Christmas time. <br /> <br /> Elizabeth Lane (Barbara Stanwyck) writes a column in the "American Housekeeping" magazine for Yardley, where she gives household tips and recipes. She is Martha Steward's version of 1945, except that Mrs. Steward is a cook and home owner and can testify to her attempts to try and test what she defends. Stanwyck can not. His cooking recipes are those of his friend Felix (S.Z. Sakall), gourmet chef and restaurateur. The house she describes as her home (a model farm in Connecticut) belongs to her unofficial boyfriend, the architect John Sloan (Reginald Gardiner). Gardiner would have no problem marrying Stanwyck, but she is not ready to consider a final commitment to him. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the film, an American wrecks the Nazis. This is Jefferson Jones (Dennis Morgan), a sailor. He spends two weeks on a raft before being saved. Aware of its advertising value, Greenstreet decides to grant Morgan the wish to organize a real Christmas in Connecticut. He basically tells Stanwyck that she will entertain Morgan and himself at his farm during the holidays. Stanwyck is unable to explain that the image she has of herself in the columns (with her ability to turn over the jacks and raise a baby she would have had with her husband) is a lie - if she she will be dismissed, as will her immediate superior. Dudley Beecham (Robert Shayne). In a moment of depression, she accepts Gardiner's marriage proposal, and Gardiner discovers that his Connecticut home is becoming Stanwyck's "real" home, of himself and their "baby". <br /> <br /> Of course, besides Stanwyck and Morgan discover that they fall in love with Greenstreet's inebriated curiosity (to the great annoyance of Gardiner - he actually expects Stanwyck to still marry her) ). The complications follow one another, the accumulated lies, and when the neighbors 'babies succeed to the neighbors' babies, before Greenstreet begins to wonder if something is missing. But it's a comedy, so everything is going well. Even Greenstreet, at the end, is amused by all the madness - his famous celebrated chuckle mirroring that of Santa Claus for a change. This is not a classic comedy, certainly not great, but fun enough for the season to be watched in December.
