Lloyd Hamilton was one of the most comic (and funny) of all silent movie comics. Why is he completely forgotten? Unfortunately, the original negatives of a large percentage of his films were lost during the Fox warehouse fire in the early 1930s. Hamilton was not handsome or graceful like Chaplin, Keaton and Lloyd; He was not as smart as Raymond Griffith. And unlike Harry Langdon and (again) Chaplin, Hamilton did not try to please the public. <br /> <br /> However, his films were very popular at the time of their initial release, and they remain hilarious today. Oscar Levant once claimed to have asked Chaplin if there was another comedian he had ever envied, and Chaplin immediately named Lloyd Hamilton. The character most often portrayed by Hamilton on screen - a flat-cap character, with meticulous hand gestures and a duck-like walk - was later adapted by vaudeville comedian Eddie Garr (Teri's father). Garr), then adapted by Jackie Gleason "The Poor Soul", his television personality of the 1950s. <br /> <br /> "The Movies", directed under the pseudonym Roscoe Arbuckle, is one of the short films Hamilton's most innovative, and he's hilarious. We first see him as a peasant bidding farewell to his family outside their cottage, before going to the big city. Then he moves away from the cottage and we see that it is IN the big city and the traffic is flourishing all around him! <br /> <br /> Finally, our hero finally ends up in a restaurant (uncredited, but it's the Montmartre caf√© in downtown Los Angeles) where all the movie actors eat between takes. There's a funny gag when Hamilton's crazy character meets three costumed and disguised actors as Presidents Washington, Lincoln and Roosevelt: this gag would have been funnier if the impostors looked more like the originals. Finally, our boy sits at a table hoping to meet a celebrity. Indeed, entering the restaurant and sitting at the next table is a big movie star ... none other than Lloyd Hamilton! The double exposure is very well done - the junction is almost invisible - when Lloyd Hamilton himself salutes Lloyd Hamilton himself. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Hamilton's peak period of creativity was very short. . He began his career in the slapstick and played the role of double-actor (Ham and Bud, in front of Bud Duncan) and had a short and dazzling period of celebrity in the short films at the end of the silence. The sound films were not Hamilton-style, and he was quickly removed from the list of actors in some rudimentary early speeches. Then he died young. Fortunately, "The Movies" is quite entertaining and is a splendid introduction to the style of this unique comic. I will evaluate 7 out of 10.
