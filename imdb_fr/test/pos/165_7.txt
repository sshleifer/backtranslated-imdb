Three children were born during a solar eclipse and ten years later, it made them grow up without consciousness. As they approach their simultaneous celebrations of the tenth anniversary, they become devious and calculating murderers. Joyce Russel (Lori Lethin), a pretty teenager from the region, is confronted with these little terrors while most others fall in love with their angelic attitudes. <br /> <br /> We find movies like "The Bad Seed" and "Village of the Damned", the movie of these evil children may not be completely original, but it's still quite disturbing. The three children actors - Elizabeth Hoy, Billy Jacoby and Andy Freeman - are extremely convincing. Director Ed Hunt and his co-writer Barry Pearson maintain an unpleasant and convincing atmosphere throughout the film. they even go so far as to accuse the little girl of having participated in a television show against her elder sister (the future comedienne, star of the MTV channel, Julie Brown, whose striptease is really attractive). <br /> <br /> Name Actors Susan Strasberg, as Ice Teacher, and Jose Ferrer, who almost do not have the time to sit in front of a screen as a doctor, add to the proceedings by their presence , while KC Martel, one of the youngsters of the original "The Amityville Horror", is very friendly as Joyces's little brother. Other familiar faces like Ellen Geer, Michael Dudikoff, Cyril O'Reilly ("Porky's", "Dance of the Damned"), Joe Penny ("Jake and the Fatman") and William Boyett ("The Cach√©") can also being seen. <br /> <br /> Regarding parents' fears, children playing with firearms they discovered and locked up in old refrigerators, "Bloody Birthday" is little more than Slasher variation with children as antagonists. Helped and encouraged by the music score of Arlon Obers, this film remains in the memory more than some of his brothers, without much gore to retreat (although this arrow through the gag of the eyes works very well). <br /> <br /> Bleak, naughty and downbeat, "Bloody Birthday" is worth a look for the curious. <br /> <br /> 7/10
