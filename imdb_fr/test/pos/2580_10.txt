If ever a potential film should sound like it would not work if you read the script on paper, it would be this one. Here we have what looks like a sad and gloomy s-m movie soft-porn, complemented by the big poster in the theater, depicting an almost naked Christina Ricci chained to none other than Mr. Bad Ass MF himself , Samuel Jackson. But let me tell you, if a film ever comes alive on a major celluloid film with a deep power to spare, it's the redemptive sequel to Craig Brewer in Hustle & Flow, Black Snake Moan. <br /> <br /> Unashamedly over From the beginning, this film absorbs you with the opening scenes and continues to dig deeper and deeper with each subsequent image. It is your basic story of two deeply wounded characters who find strength and courage to live in a more positive way. This has already been done, of course, but, as I have always said, it is the way a story is told that gives it heart, depth, meaning and power. <br /> <br /> Ricci is damaged by character of child-abuse-wild child The character of Lazarus, musician also insane grief, is in desperate circumstances, and Laz takes the initiative to try to help Rae. That in itself is relatively unique: the idea of ​​a man who is truly trying to help a woman who is suffering a lot rather than trying to make more of it, and we know from the beginning that Laz's heart and heart of the film are: in the right place. The film is essentially based on the redemptive and healing power of love (music is a second), and the film resonates deeply with this truth - with soul, talent and brilliance. <br /> <br /> A major reason the film succeeds so deeply because of the ferocious and committed performances of Ricci and Jackson. Scenes that would have seemed derisory and pathetic in the hands of small artists are on the contrary powerful. In particular, the movie's arc scene, in which Jackson sings and plays the title song alone in his house, with Ricci, in the midst of a violent storm and violent demons from Rae's past raging in his head , pushing her to crawl to Lazare and cling to his leg, does not show himself as ridiculous as technically, but rather cathartic. <br /> <br /> All secondary performances are fantastic here too. Justin Timberlake is perfectly credible as Rae's boyfriend, Ronnie, anguished by anguish, and the always so wonderful S. Epatha Merkerson is also perfectly expressed as a personage with obvious feelings for Lazarus. John Cothran Jr. is also notable, as is the reverend friend R. Laz (a nod to blues musician R. L. Burnside, no doubt). Let's be realistic: everything works in this film, including the music / soundtrack, which includes Burnside, Scott Bomar, Bobby Rush, Son House and, more importantly, Jackson himself, whose fantastic version of Stackolee I listen to. There is also a very beautiful and moving version of "This Little Light of Mine" presented in the film, timidly timid and sweet sung by Ricci. <br /> <br /> Samuel Jackson said in recent interviews that he believed his performance in this film is the best of his career to date; I totally agree with him. It is a job of which he can be extremely proud, as well as all the other actors of this brave, bold, extremely wise and deeply sincere mother of the project.
