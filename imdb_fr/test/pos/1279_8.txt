A messy man, known as Bill, lives in a sullen little apartment, with a Marilyn Monroe wall poster and his business typewriter. Only man can think of nothing to write. He wanders the streets following the people, just to see where they are going. Maybe that will give him an inspiration to write. He begins to follow a well-dressed man holding a bag. He follows him for a few days. While in a cafe, the well-dressed man sits at a table on Bill's other side and asks why Bill is following him. The well-dressed man says his name is Cobb. Cobb then surprisingly informs Bill that he is a burglar and even starts taking him home with him to steal things; Although Cobb insists that he does not go to others to steal. He says he likes to let people know that he went there and interrupted the things they take for granted. For example, he puts another burglar's pants in a man's pants. <br /> <br /> The film is also told in flashback. The director has used this technique in greater abundance in his recent feature film Memento. Bill finally decides to cut his hair and get dressed in a suit, on Cobb's advice. He meets a blonde lady in a club, who frequents the owner, a bald man, who is very dangerous, she says. We see a scene where a hammered man uses a hammer on man's fingers in the blonde woman's apartment. These are some of the many pieces of the puzzle that the director has shown us, and they will all come together when we come to the surprising conclusion.
