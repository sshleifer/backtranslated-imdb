I am generally disappointed by what the media describes as "lesbian" movies: murderous bisexuals; psychotic murderous lesbians; women who experiment with other women but end up with men; ridiculously pretty women who just make men angry, etc. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, FINGERSMITH is on a very tall pedestal above this bin. It is a credible love story interpreted to perfection by all members of the cast, down to the smallest of supporting actors. In addition to having a very engaging central conflict, the romance between the heroines is well developed and credible thanks to Cassidy and Hawkins. <br /> <br /> I also saw TIPPING THE VELVET, but FINGERSMITH is far superior to the previous one, Fingersmith is both satisfying and enjoyable to watch. It offers lesbians around the world an excellent follow-up of BOUND.
