It's an incredibly fascinating story, told with great simplicity and grace. The story itself is the subject of the film, even though the landscape is beautiful. The actors play is sober, even superbly, because the characters themselves show off in all their eccentric simplicity. <br /> <br /> This work of art will probably not be appreciated by those who watch movies "casually", without reason. You have to work to be included in the story, but once you are involved, the captivation is over!
