Frank Sinatra has one of his best roles as a reformed heroin addict returning to his Chicago neighborhood after a long stay in a clinic. He intends to stay out of drugs and find work as a drummer, but he can not avoid meeting his old friends. He was originally arrested not for a drug charge but because he was caught playing an illegal poker game. His poker skills earned him the nickname of The Man with the Golden Arm, and the men who run the game, one of them being his former link to the heroine, want him to be treated again. . Meanwhile, Frank must take care of a woman he injured in a car accident, Zosch (Eleanor Parker), and come to terms with his old girlfriend, Molly (Kim Novak). The film is excellent for putting us in the mental state of Sinatra. When he felt safe at the beginning of the movie, I felt good for him. But, when a promised phone call does not come one day, it will sink into depression and return to its momentum. Later, when he finally passes the audition, he arrives completely exhausted. His embarrassment when he can not play the right rhythm is devastating. He had such big dreams and the other musicians do not even give him a bit of attention as he rushes out of the room. The film moves quickly and shows Frank's drug problem in a realistic light without turning into a social message image. The actors are uniformly good. Elmer Bernstein's score is one of the best of his time. The only thing I do not like in the movie is the end. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS <br /> <br /> Although I really like the character Zosch and Parker is very good in the film, they could have done a little more to fill his background. The end is a little too pat. Although there will surely be pathos that will remain with the characters after the movie closes, Zosch's death ties things up a bit too much. Frank is free to love Molly and he will not go to jail. In addition, his dealer is dead, at least the immediate threat disappears. Well, I guess in Hollywood, we always want to put everything in order in a nice little package. It hurts the film a bit, but in the current state of things, it's one of the best adult movies about addiction I can think of. 9/10.
