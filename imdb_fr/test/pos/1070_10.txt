This Christmas present has arrived thanks to TCM. We had never seen the film, even though we had seen most of Barbara Stanwyck's films. This comedy made us laugh so much that we sometimes had to hold back, to hear the dialogue. <br /> <br /> This is a film that should be seen by people in stress, especially around Christmas. This would certainly raise the spirits by simply letting go. The film would make a perfect gift in the form of a DVD or VHS tape. <br /> <br /> "Christmas in Connecticut" was directed with great panache by Peter Godfrey, based on a story by Aileen Hamilton. <br /> <br /> The best thing in the film is the happy association of two of the most popular stars of that era: Barbara Stanwyck and Dennis Morgan. Barbara Stanwyck has always played with women full of will, obviously, it has changed pace for her. In this film, as well as "Lady Eve", Ms. Stanwyck displays a talent for comedy. She and Morgan, who have played in many musicals, are a winning combination. <br /> <br /> There is no weak performance in the film. Sydney Greenstreet, a notorious actor for his role as "heavy", is a pleasure to watch as the rich and fat, Alexander Yardley, the man who possessed a media empire and who knew a good thing when he saw it. Reginald Gardiner, an accomplished English actor, adds sparkle to the cast of stars behind the two directors. <br /> <br /> S. Z. Sakall, is another source of continuous joy; he plays the Hungarian chef Felix, who has trouble with his own version of the English language. In addition, Una O'Connor makes a perfect Norah, the farm governess of Sloan, Connecticut, perfect. <br /> <br /> By reading the other comments of this forum, it is sad to learn that the glorious black and white cinematography is not appreciated. by some people. After all, color was not very common in the 1940s and most classic films should be seen in their original format, because what would be done to color them? <br /> <br /> This film should be a requirement for those looking to spend nearly two hours of uninterrupted fun at Christmas time, as total joy is assured. Look at him with an open mind and heart and perhaps you would like to see "Christmas in Connecticut" every year.
