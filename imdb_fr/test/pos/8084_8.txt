It's a plot-based and extremely entertaining film. Nothing surprising or original in the plot, but more importantly, it moves at a steady pace and therefore holds your attention. I did not really notice acting, which I think is a good thing. John Mills was fine, but seemed to take everything that was happening considering how his life was deteriorating around him. It would be stuck to the head, would rise 20 seconds later, dust off and continue as if nothing had happened. A small problem in a movie with a strong story, authentic places and a plot that allows you to guess until its conclusion.
