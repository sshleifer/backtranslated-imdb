I saw this film for the first time at the theater. I was 10 years old. I watched it a second time and I must say it was amazing. Music, dance, acting. It's a beautiful story and extremely well told. I fell in love with Treat Williams when I was a kid after seeing him in this movie. One of my favorite parts was when his mother shouted at him to give him his pants, then finally said "how much do you need"? (money). It was classic. ; ). <br /> <br /> Moms are the best. If you have not seen this movie since its release, I invite you to see it again. It's timeless. That will do what all great movies do; make you laugh, cry and think.
