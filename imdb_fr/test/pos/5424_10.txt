'The Big Snit', Richard Condie's cartoon entitled 'The Big Snit', is a journey through qwerkyness, madness, hill, nice backgrounds, fond characters and a conclusion that almost gives me tears of joy every time I see him. <br /> <br /> This short film that I have seen over and over and over and I have NEVER TIRE (fortunately to have it on tape of a TV show) !! It never stops making me laugh uncontrollably, then descend into the depths of my mind, emphasizing the greatness of the human condition. <br /> <br /> Because when someone says "Come on, let's finish the game", everything is fine in the world and the problems we face every day we suddenly realize that we are only doing small things fleeting things. . At first, this film seems to be a simple fun humor for the cartoon, but it is much more than that. This film has more spiritual meaning in humanity as a result of which everything seems so bad and so trivial. <br /> <br /> He is flawless ... in all respects. AND DAMN FUNNY TOO;) <br /> <br /> Rating 10 of 10.
