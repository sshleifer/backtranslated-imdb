Graphics: brilliant, obviously. The most amazing things have certainly NOT been given in the trailers. The fight sequences move extremely fast, but after watching a few, your eyes must be used to them and that does not seem so confusing. Cloud offers a wide range of swords, and I would like things to move a little slower so we can see them, because each one was incredibly detailed. Oh, and we end up seeing exactly how we equip Materia ... <br /> <br /> Music: great too. I was a little worried about this, because (from what I've seen), Nobuo is not the best at writing music to accompany the action (do you remember the sequence Steal the Tiny Bronco?), But it's brilliant and it fits perfectly. I am happy to have pre-ordered the OST. However, they changed the lyrics to One Winged Angel, so you will not be able to sing if you know the lyrics of Carmina Burana. <br /> <br /> Intrigue: The first half of the film sets things up and presents everyone in a rather complex tapestry, but the second half is almost entirely fight sequences, once all players are in place. I would not call it a weak conspiracy, but it's not nearly as complicated as the plot of the game. I think it's in order to avoid trying to overshadow the game, and I think it's a good thing ... the film is its own entity, and should not try to go beyond the original in terms of pure plot. <Br/> <br /> I admit I was hoping that this movie would bring FF7 to more people, but it's NOT a mainstream movie. I was going to give it only nine stars, just because it did not even try to explain anything to newcomers ... Marlene (at least, I think it was Marlene ... it was like her ) gives a little background to the beginner, but it is more an update than a crash course. But then, I realized that for me, this film is a 10/10, so why should I take points just because other people probably will not like it ... if you played the game , or at least you're familiar with, you should see this movie. But you do not need me to tell you that. If you do not know him, go out and buy him, sit there for twenty hours and beat him, and then watch the movie ... even if it does not have a background, it's still beautiful. You will simply not get any of the internal references ... that make up 50% of the movie (that is, anything that is NOT a fight sequence).
