Plunkett and Macleane are a wonderful update of the swashbuckling tradition, prior to Johny Depp and his pirates. The tone is light, with a touch of social comment, but nothing too heavy. We could almost see Errol Flynn and Basil Rathbone. <br /> <br /> It starts at a slow pace, with the introduction of the characters and the establishment of themes of social inequality and rebellion; but, it goes up a gear once the boys have taken the highways. The flights are large and elegant, with romantic touches that are swashbucklers' bread and butter. The actors engage and help raise the material a little, which is quite hollow. The figures do not have much depth, but they are played with a charm and a skill that does not matter much. <br /> <br /> We talked about Muh about modern music. The period music tends to the most serene, which seems out of place. A classical score with Celtic beats for action pieces might work, but more modern music, rock and rebel techno seems to add an edge to the action. Since the characters are more legends than reality, the precision of the music seems useless. The songs tend to adapt to the mood of the scenes being broadcast, so it usually works well. I just wonder how they missed the film "Stand and Deliver" by Adam Ant. Make no mistake, it's not a serious movie. It's pure escape and a wonderful lark. Tony Scott shows a little of his father's visual talent, but I do not think we'll see much Oscar nodding in his career yet. He seems to understand the material here and makes a good movie. Over time, it can be a name to be reckoned with. His father took some time to mature beyond visual stylization and become a more complete director. To watch absolutely for an entertaining evening or for a crash movie festival.
