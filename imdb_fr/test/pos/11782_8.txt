Of all the Star Wars parodies I've seen, it's probably the funniest. Not because of the premise, Star Wars with simple electronics instead of spaceships, but because of the way it was wrong. It's deliberately exaggerated, and that makes it hilarious, and since everyone knows it's deliberately exaggerated, no one complains. The special effects were as deliberately horrible as possible, and included a toaster on a visible rope carrying toast and an eggbeater on a rope. This short film is fun for any Star Wars fan (who I am not) or for anyone who has 15 minutes to spare. Super short !! <br /> <br /> My note: *** on ****. 13 minutes Not classified.
