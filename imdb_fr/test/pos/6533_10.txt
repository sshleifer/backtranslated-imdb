Well, I must say that this movie was probably the funniest movie I've seen all year. And I'm not saying exactly the right way. It's probably the most pathetic movie I've seen in a while, and yet that's what makes it so hilarious. you can say that these people really try to act, unfortunately for them, they do not do such a good job, so even replicas delivered with what is supposed to be serious seem really funny. Aaron Carter essentially plays a very similar character to himself in real life, but he still manages to make the character appear unrealistic and not at all realistic. This film is one of those movies where everything that's supposed to sound serious is really funny and everything that's supposed to be funny is so stupid and silly that you have to laugh because you know how hard they are trying. This movie is so bad that it's really good. I would definitely recommend it if you are in the mood to laugh.
