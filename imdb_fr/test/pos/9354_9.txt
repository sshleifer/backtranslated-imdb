Exceptional film that deals with a theme of great proportions with a very well balanced direction. Dmytrik was a very good director, at least from what I can say about this film and Murder my Sweet, but he was seriously affected by the HUAC as other directors and actors. It's ironic that Crossfire has not received an Oscar, it's an exquisite example of how to make a low-budget quality film. Everything is exceptional in this film: a well written scenario that uses many flashbacks, a superb distribution, a superb lighting that seems to tell the story more than the actual actions. What can you expect from more than a first-rate movie? May I add that black is used here for its elegance and that I could add financial benefits. But this proves once again that what was initially considered a B movie may have more impact today than most stubborn A movies that have lost their audience over time. <br /> <br /> This film is This is not a black film in itself and it raises serious questions about what the black is really. The style is really dark, in terms of scenery and especially lights, but the theme goes beyond the recipe of the "black genre". You can see things from the opposite perspective and say that anti-Semitism is just a pretext for a criminal investigation, with the issue around murder being the center of attention. That would have been the case if Robert Ryan had not achieved an outstanding performance. Be that as it may, the film has a lot to offer and it is a shame that the director has suffered so much from his unfairness for his earlier beliefs in a truly "black" period of America.
