Octavio Paz, Mexican poet, writer and diplomat, winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1990, said about "Nazarino": "Nazarin follows the great tradition of crazy Spaniards from Cervantes, to live accordingly". A humble and spiritual priest (Francisco Rabal in a wonderful performance) tries to respect the principles of Christianity, but he is excluded from his church for helping a local prostitute by offering shelter after she committed murder. Nazarin travels the country roads of the turn of the twentieth century in Mexico, offering help to the poor and begging for food. His two disciples, a murderous prostitute Andara and her sister Beatriz, a failed suicide desperately seeking love, consider him a saint, but that does not prevent him from suffering the hatred and humiliation of the church and the people that he meets on the road. He ends up being beaten in prison and begins to question his faith so he can not forgive his attacker. <br /> <br /> Bunuel tells the story in the manner of a Christian parable masterfully and admirably combining the admiration and irony of the main character and the sharp critics of formal religion and hypocrisy. The film is simple and profound as well as beautiful, ironic and heartbreaking. <br /> <br /> I consider Bunuel one of the best filmmakers of all time. I have seen twenty of his films and they all belong to different periods of his life, but they have in common his magical touch, the masterful combination of gravelly realism and surrealism, his curiosity, his inquisitive mind, his sense of humor and its dark and brilliant fantasies. It is with great pleasure that I add to the list of my favorite films the tragic comedy surrealist "Nazarin", little visible and almost unknown, but surprisingly candid and touching.
