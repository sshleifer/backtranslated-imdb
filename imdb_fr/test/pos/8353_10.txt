I thought it was a wonderfully written film. I love the little Scamp and the angel of the street. This film is very easy to understand for little kids, but it's also a good movie for adults. I liked this film because it takes the original of Lady and the Tramp, and this film is a classic. Lady and the Tramp 2 Scamp's Adventure was filled with new characters, catchy songs, brilliant animation and unforgettable classics. I liked the movie since I saw it for the first time. I also liked the way they showed the different personalities of each character. It also shows the disadvantages and the good things of making new friends with whom you can spend time. My favorite song in the film was always present because it showed the different characters sharing their views on how they felt. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who was a fan of the original Lady and the Tramp.
