I agree that this is one of the best episodes of the series; my only drawback would be the somewhat shocking appearance of Mark Lenard as a Romulan commander. My reasoning is this: if you are not present at the first broadcast of this episode, then you know Mr. Lenard under the name of Sarek, the father of Spock. And for the 2nd generation Trekkie (or Trekker - your preference), it saves you from getting out of the scene first. Still, he is an excellent commander as well as the opposite for our captain and this episode is written with force and well played. Both sides have made excellent arguments about the cost of the war in relation to the price of peace and certainly recall one of the best films of the Second World War and more recent films. These are not my favorite genre but I would definitely recommend a fan to see this episode through this filter. You will see that it holds up. I will never understand why science fiction gives so little respect - the best tragedy is to place ordinary people in extraordinary circumstances.
