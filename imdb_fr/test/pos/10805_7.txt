I was very curious to see this Wajda-Depardieu exit. In addition, the period is really fascinating. Being a fan of Wajda, I was disappointed and that may be a euphemism. The film never really took off - no basis for the animosity between Danton and Robespierre, etc. <br /> <br /> Basically, the scenario was weak (adapted from "The Danton Affair"). And yet, the direction was masterful ... it's Wajda, after all! In addition, there were incredible actors BUT they never attract the attention of the public as they should. Depardieu presents himself as a Danton almost clumsy and nonchalant ... This is not exactly the image we have in mind. Woijech Pzsoniak is amazing, as usual, but again, the scenario is setting limits, even the players of great talent can not collapse. Andrzej Seweryn and Bogoslaw Linda appear ... like Bourdon and Saint-Just ... and if you know Wajda, you know them. <br /> <br /> Overall, I was disappointed. very rented movie. Nice distribution, good director, but no quality foundation. Bad, non dynamic script. We must enter the mentalities of Danton (Walesa) and Robespierre (General J) ... what are their motives? Hey ... who knows? One loves women, the other powder itself? Riiight. Ok, so if you're looking for a good movie about the French Revolution, I highly recommend "The French Revolution" ... it's in two parts and oh-so-great! Excellent performance, in-depth scripting, juicy juices ... a truly satisfying experience! Klaus-Maria Brandauer is a much better Danton than Depardieu ... the wonderful Andrzej Seweryn apparently took notes of "Danton" and is BRILLANT like Robespierre. TO HAVE! NOW! As for Wajda fans, you'll do better with "Man of Iron / Marble", "Promised Land", and so on. Cheers!!
