(My synopsis) Rae (Christina Ricci) was a nymphomaniac and a high school slut who connects with Ronnie (Justin Timberlake) to meet her needs. Ronnie must report to his National Guard unit and leave Rae alone. Rae has not been alone for a long time, because she is the tramp of the city with a compelling need to meet a man. After a party, Rae is taken to her home by a friend who ends up beating her to death and throws her on the side of the road. The next day, Lazarus (Samuel L. Jackson) finds Rae and takes her home. Lazare gives Rae medical care and also thinks she can save her on her own. Rae is like a dog in heat so Lazare puts a chain of 20 kilos around her and her radiator to prevent him from going out in search of men. Lazarus himself has problems because his wife has just left him for another man. Lazare turns to his blues music to relieve his pain. <br /> <br /> (My comment) The film has a profound meaning when you have gone beyond sex and violence. The film has a different feel. The story is raw and almost puts you in the movie as if you were there. The 40-pound chain is a good and symbolic metaphor for a chastity belt. You do not give love to anyone, but you keep it for your true love. The chain could also be a parallel with a woman who is chained to the kitchen, but Rae did not cook. Rae only wanted to have sex all the time, unlike a woman. I think Craig Brewer (screenwriter and director) made an awesome movie, and Samuel L. Jackson sings a nasty blues song. The story is emotionally charged and addresses all topics of race, religion, music and sex. (Paramount Classics, Duration 1:56, R-rated) (8/10)
