Broadcast this morning for the press at the Rome Film Festival, "N - io e Napoleone" is easy to love. First of all, it can count on great production values, as do very few Italian films today, with beautiful sets and costumes. The casting is great too. The director Virzì constantly talks about the young leader Elio Germano as "a young De Niro". Now, of course, he's going too far, but the boy can act. I loved his performance and he did a great job with the accent (Tuscan). Daniel Auteuil is a great actor and has played very well as Bonaparte. It's really great to see him play in Italian, I hope to see him again soon in Italy. Basic actors have also worked well - people like Valerio Mastrandrea or Sabrina Impacciatore may seem like unlikely choices, but they all performed well. Even Massimo Ceccherini, best known for his wacky movies and trashy reality TV shows, became well integrated and was really funny. The low point of the cast was the "Diva" Monica Bellucci. Of course, she was slightly better than usual, but she managed to appear (and sound) completely unnatural even in the role of Baronessa Emilia, in which, with a good dose of irony, she used her own accent umbro. The scenario, made up of veterans Furio Scarpelli and Virzì himself, is intelligent, with lots of laughs and emotional moments. Of course, the end left me puzzled. The message is a little ambiguous: the whole film says that political ideals can lead you to blind hatred, but if you get closer, you'll learn that the object of your hate is ultimately a little human being like everyone else, sometimes funny, sometimes sad, sometimes pathetic, so it is difficult to hate him suddenly; then, in the last minutes, it is said that after all, it would have been better to shoot him in the head at first. Personally, I do not like this concept very much. "Io e Napoleone" is always a nice film, the best presented so far at the Festival (the other being Fur and the Hoax). My rating is 8/10
