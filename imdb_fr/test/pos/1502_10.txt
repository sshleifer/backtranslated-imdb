this film gets a 10 because there is a lot of gore in it. who cares about the plot or the game of the actors. took footage from other movies and added them to this one. Since I've never seen any of the movies he's filmed, that was not important to me. The godfather goriest Italian movies you'll ever see. no gore hound should be without this movie in his collection of horror movies.
