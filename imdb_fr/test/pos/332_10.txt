I think it's one of the best tamil movies I've seen in a while. I love the fact that it does not revolve around a guy and a girl who fall in love and they made the film brilliantly. The cast did a good job and I especially congratulate the little girl. She was brilliant and really brought out the feeling of an adopted child looking for her real mother. Best of all are the songs, the beautiful music and the moving lyrics. There are some great songs in this movement, you'll go! especially "Kannathil Mutthamittal" and "Velai Pookal". Great songs, both. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants to enjoy a good cry and an excellent performance (and great songs!). Hi Simran.
