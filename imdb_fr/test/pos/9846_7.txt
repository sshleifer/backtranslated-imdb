The large James Cagney, in capital letters, appears only until the second third of the film and probably has less time on the screen than Dudley Digges, who plays the role of the potentate of the reform of the school. But when Jimmy arrives, as a deputy commissioner to reform Reform schools, he cuts the air with his hands and hops on tiptoe and spits a powerful National Warners-First dialogue with all the customary, and waited, panache . The psychology of this ancient antiquity, one of Warners' many efforts to assert its place as a "socially conscious" studio, does not go very far: Digges is bad simply because the script requires it, and there is the picturesque notion of juvenile delinquents will become swell children if they are just given a hint of autonomy. But it is made in the fast, sparse style that the studio has specialized in, and it never gets bored. Frankie Darro, who had all sorts of problems on the screen during a brief stint at Rotten Street Kid, Warner's favorite, is an ideal JD - a beautiful charismatic bold with a puppy's nose and a hateful look that could wipe out steel. No actor can touch him today.
