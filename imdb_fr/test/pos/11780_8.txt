Made with a twenty-dollar exchange budget, this thirteen-minute cheap disc parodies the legendary blockbuster of the legend '77, George Lucas's The Star Wars, in the most infective and stupid manner imaginable. Screenwriter / director Ernie Fosselius delivers a winning and disturbing mix of ridiculous sound effects, action scenes staged in an inapplicable way, special effects raw (far from) (you must absolutely love lasers scraped on film, asteroids in aluminum foil, and appliances ... I mean, spaceships are swung on obvious cables), badly doubled in a dialogue, a merciless shameful play, and the rousing piece of Richard's classical music Wagner "Ride of the Valkyries". The characters are presented with sufficiently broad lines; My favorites are the little god Fluke Starbucker, the venerable Jedi Knight Auggie "Ben" Doggie and the naughty villain Darph Nader (who swears only incomprehensible gibberish). In addition, 4-Q-3 is clearly based on the Tin Man of "The Wizard of Oz" while Artie Deco is definitely a cheap vacuum cleaner. The real master stroke of this film is to embody the legendary legendary comedian Paul Frees in the role of narrator; The deliciously rich and fat histrionic tones of Frees add a lot to the stupid, but disjointed gaiety, which plays with language (lines of choice: "You're going to laugh, you're going to cry, you'll kiss three dollars bye!"). A total hoot.
