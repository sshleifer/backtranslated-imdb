Hoot is a fun film directed by a young teenager about a group of college kids trying to stop a string of pancake houses from bulldozing a piece of land with endangered burrowing owls. The acting is pretty good and the new faces are nice to see. Many well-known comedians are in this film and maintain humor almost non-stop. It's a movie for the young audience, maybe 5 to 11 years old. I thought it was a good change of pace compared to the adult movies that are taking over the screen these days. There is neither realism nor accuracy about life in general for adults or children. It's just a bunch of fun with a constant message to save the beautiful places of this country from becoming too developed. If you remember the day you were not fighting for money, you may remember that money is not everything. Few people over 12 will enjoy it unless they have a thing for the old special series after school.
