As a modern Marco Polo, from Venice to China, we arrive here, Amelio, who is again responsible for making us the gray area in the middle of two worlds in solid colors. Eroded by the collateral damage of globalization, Europe's pessimistic view is reciprocal with China. <br /> <br /> The sight of this charming but confusing country is treated from below, devoid of any claim to learn or impose opinions. The reality is nonetheless hard. Abandoned and exploited children, hives, backward areas are the other China we do not know. Vincenzo (Castellitto), technician of a steel plant, is one of us. His trip to China is a pretext to understand, to learn from within a country where progress and problems of the third world coexist in an infamous balance. It is not entirely clear if Vincenzo knew from the first time that the mechanical component had already been repaired, I think; anyway is a minor aspect. Liu, the Chinese girl, is the key to the whole movie. She has a lot of difficulties on her back, she has the strength to win, but how could she fight with little money and little help? <br /> <br /> The realistic and impartial vision of the facts by the girl, refusing Vincenzo's money, touched me a lot. A pack of banknotes can not get her husband, baby (forced to treat as a stranger for the law), protects her by contempt. Liu knew that his intentions were benign and kind, far from a cold act of charity. Their friendship is beautifully told, its way of developing step by step, dignified and formative, unique. An invaluable legacy to keep. <br /> <br /> Some scenes are breathtaking, whether for acting (Vincenzo crying on the ferry) or for dialogue (at the restaurant, on the railways). In addition to a carefree set-up and a rather lazy start, "The Stella che not c'Ã¨" is brilliant and accurate just because she tells the untold truths. <br /> <br /> In competition at the 63rd Venice Film Festival, it's a safe bet that Tai Ling for the Mastroianni Award, dedicated to emerging stars. She certainly deserved this award. <br /> <br /> [8/10]
