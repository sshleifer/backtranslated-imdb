As a connoisseur of waste, I came across this little treasure. Action, romance, crooked cops, violence. Everything is there and not one has been removed from the right. I was in love right away. Then, a funny thing happened about the second time. I became addicted. I thought it would be a rented and giggling movie. <br /> <br /> Rudy Ray Moore knew what he wanted to see in a movie. He did not have the money to make it look good, but he did it anyway. It is very commendable. It also shows that he was doing the film for himself. I do not know how many of you have heard Rudy Ray's music, but if you have not done it yet, he has a whole series of albums that go back to the fifties.
