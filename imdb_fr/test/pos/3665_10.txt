I grew up in my Bollywood movies - you know that the typical plot meets a girl, a girl rejects boys, a dakus (villain) kidnaps a girl, a boy saves a girl by killing hundreds of dhakus and they get Of course, I omitted one hour of musical style numbers.) Well, to watch Hari Om, I was expecting another typical Bollywood-style film; however, to my great pleasure, it turned out to be atypical and even quite comical. Hari Om of Bharatbala is what could be described as one of those "quirky" Indian films such as the very popular South Asian hits such as Monsoon Wedding, East is East or Bend it Like Beckham. <br /> <br /> Being from the South Asian-born and having watched various classic Bollywood movies, there was a lot of humor and sub-dialogues to pick up that reminded me of the fun and charming side of the culture Indian (for example, the various Indo-pop numbers that were redone by Nitin Soni or the Indian spiritual slangs that were used). The Hari Om can be enjoyed by all South Asians. It is also fun for those who are not accustomed to Indian humor, because the characters and plot are for all audiences. <br /> <br /> In a coconut shell, the movie is that of a rickshaw driver (known as "four wheels" for those of you who have traveled to India, played by Vija Raaz (of Monsoon Wedding) who gets involved with a scammer and ends up with a lot of money to avoid selling his "Madhuri" four-wheeled vehicle, he escapes by chance with "Madhuri" and a woman charming and charismatic of French origin, Isa (Camille Natta), who escapes herself to the boredom of her boyfriend Benoit (Jean Marie Lamour), was in the pool). The film tells their journey through the beautiful landscape of Rajasthan. the country of love stories; Through humor, you see the two main actors trying to find out who they really are. <br /> <br /> What made the evening most memorable was to have the director, executive producer, principal editor and even Mrs. Natta's mother present at the screening. After talking with Bharatbala (who has a background in zoology), a lot of interesting things were revealed, including finishing the film just 10 days before the Toronto International Film Festival and taking 45 days for filming. to have only five actors in the play (the others were real actors for the first time). When I arrived home, I realized two things in the film: there is always a human connection between us, despite our differences, and second, as directed by the director, "Everybody has a love story ". <br /> <br /> It's a must for everyone!
