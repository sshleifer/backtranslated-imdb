Mute Witness is a modest but very solid thriller that has never really caught the attention or the good comments it deserves. The film ?? written and directed entirely by Anthony Waller ?? It is a thriller under the sign of the action and the black comedy and the influences of horror. No needless gibberish or endless intrigue, just the mystery. Mute witness discusses the vicious subject of snuff films and actually takes place in Russia. *** SPOILERS *** Since production costs are cheaper, a US film crew travels temporarily to Russia for the filming of a horror film. An old shed is used as a filming location. The makeup artist on the team is accidentally locked in the night and, trying to find a way out, she witnesses the recordings of an authentic snuff! She is caught and tries to escape, but since she is silent, she can not cry for help, nor can she explain what she saw to the police. The girl's life is really in danger now, because there is a whole network hidden behind these snuff productions and they do not want the witnesses to be alive ?? *** Spoilers ***. Mute Witness contains several extremely exciting action sequences and is rather bloody. Some of the mysteries are in fact kept secret until the end. Regarding the same subject, I would say that it is much better than the most famous `` 8 mm '' directed by Joel Schumacher and interpreted by Nicolas Cage. Playing in mute witness is not terrible, but the main actress (who is Russian herself) looks really cute. Sir Alec Guinness also makes a special appearance. And a very cool, I can say. Surely recommended with fun and frights guaranteed.
