The Australian public and the Australian film industry often complain that there are not enough big Australian films in the country or that they are all identical. <br /> <br /> Well, in this case, this film is not a true copy. other Australian films. It's unique - it will make you laugh out loud, it will make you cry and you will feel really good about yourself. <br /> <br /> The cast of this film is superb and the acting is incomparable. no. The script and the photography (color / light, etc.) are wonderful. But more importantly, it's a very good movie. I do not want to talk about the plot, because I think it's always better to see a movie knowing as little as possible. Suffice to say that this film will appeal to a wide audience. Bring your girlfriend, take your mom, take your friends, for a successful evening. <br /> <br /> 10/10 !!!!
