Most of the time, I liked this film, but I must say that if there had been someone other than Bill Murray in the lead role, it would not have been so good. It brings an energy to the role that makes this film goes up a notch it would have been otherwise. I especially enjoyed the jokes about one of the counselors and there are other fun things in this movie, like the Hot Dog Challenge. This film would also pave the way for summer camp movies with the competition at the end. Almost every film in the camp has either this scenario, or the plot of undisciplined or troubled children, or a combination of both. This series would also take a rather strange change of tone since both films are for the family, while parts three and four are more adult oriented and more similar to the old teen sex comedies of the time. It sort of made the opposite of Police Academy movies, which ranged from R to PG-13 to PG. This series goes from the opposite to R. Remains that this first and only good series deserves a lot of chuckles due in large part to Bill Murray.
