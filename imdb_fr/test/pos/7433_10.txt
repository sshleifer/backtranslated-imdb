OMG !!! have you ever thought they would make a movie about it? Well I knew they would, but I did not know when! and now it's finally here !!! when I received it yesterday through the message, I put it in my (nasty) stereo that reads DVDs and immediately had that huge smile on my face as clouds appeared (air well ... gorgeous !!) and they were followed by all the other fascinating characters in the final fantasy of the game! including tifa and aeris, my favorites .... (they are pretty in this too) the graphics knocked me out !!!! they were really incredible. so real until the last hair! the scenario is a little confusing, especially since my version of the film was in Japanese, but of course - being a fantastic fanatic for a long time - I did not bother a bit - I had just read the subtitles! all the characters speak as they would in the game, and reno and rude are always ridiculous. the dragon scene is mean too. it looks so good !!! in any case .... the graphics were, unbelievable .... the scenario, fantastic .... and the basic idea of ​​even having a movie ff7 ....... genius !!!
