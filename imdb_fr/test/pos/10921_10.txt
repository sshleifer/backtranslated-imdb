Howard Brackett (Kevin Kline) is a teacher about to get married. Then, one of his former students wins an Oscar for a movie in which he plays a gay soldier and thanks Howard in his thank you speech, describing him as being gay too! This film follows the after-effects as journalists settle in Howard's village. He tries to convince everyone that he is straight. <br /> <br /> I like this movie! Kevin Kline is wonderful, he has really hilarious moments and he always lets me feel good with a huge smile on his face. Therefore, it is a movie that I like to watch as often as possible. If you have not seen it, you are away!
