"Acrobatty Bunny" by Robert McKimson is one of the director's best short films. While the circus-based setting may conjure hideous memories of McKimson's dreadful "Big Top Bunny", "Acrobatty Bunny" is actually not as drab as this parody. Pitting Bunny Bugs against a ferocious lion, "Acrobatty Bunny" is a fresh and fun movie right from the start, not to mention extremely attractive. There is a classic scene in which Bugs comes out of his hole with a strangled elevator and then emerge directly into the lion's mouth. In a brilliant parody of Disney, he screams "Pinocchio" in the throat of the lion! This brilliant opening is a sign of things to come. First there are choreographed antics in and around the lion's cage, followed by a hilarious, grotesque and irritating rendition of "Laugh Clown Laugh" which, in my childhood, I regularly personified! All this ends with a short acrobatic sequence that gives its name to the cartoon. I never liked the circus as a cartoon backdrop and I find out that it's a boring and predictable set of gags, but "Acrobatty Bunny" stands out and gives an exhilarating short film that's one of McKimson's best .
