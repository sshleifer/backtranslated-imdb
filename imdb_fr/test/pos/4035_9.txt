"D.O.A" is a small, catchy and entertaining image from start to finish. Dennis Quaid is at his best caustic; and Quaid is unfortunately one of the most underused talents in Hollywood. Her beautiful-belle Meg Ryan also appears with him, but as usual, it does not really have an impact. <br /> <br /> The film is directed in style throughout its course, drawing on many influences. his feeling of "shit". Do you believe it's headed by two people? The answer is no. Everything is superbly smooth, from his innovative camera to his flawless use of black and white photography. All these elements make it possible to keep the freshness of the debates. <br /> <br /> Dialogue is an unparalleled pleasure. He is lively and yet complex, he does not lose a word and manages to be entertaining. The scenario of this film is like a piece of pocket art. <br /> <br /> It has gone unnoticed for centuries before I finally got it late at night. If this is the first time you've heard about it, do not leave it as I did! Expect it fast, it's really top-top ...! <br /> <br /> If you're in the mood for a solid movie that manages to surprise at every turn, it really does. <Br /> <br />
