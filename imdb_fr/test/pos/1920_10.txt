The filmmakers gave everyone's story a rather boring story with a focus on his wife at home. At the same time, we are exposed to an original and existential French solitaire. <br /> <br /> The film is more than a documentary. I almost never feel that I have experienced something deep accidentally, which makes it all the more profound. <br /> <br /> The film contains interesting inner moments. Absolutely loved the trip that the filmmakers made me. (A lot of Europeans in the credits). Hopefully PBS will project this so that it reaches a wider audience in the United States.
