The story is amazing, it starts with a new kid in town called Roy, while in the bus going to school, he notices a kid running without shoes and the same day he breaks the big nose trying to fight with him. . Roy soon discovers that this kid is a runaway and he and his half-sister are trying to spoil a construction show, which could kill all the beautiful owls that live there. Roy decides to help them fight there. Can they win this fight in front of the smart but dilapidated cop Dave Delinko (Luke Wilson) A nice, funny and adventurous movie. I admire Luke Wilson for this role. I do not think his brother Owen would even accept that role.
