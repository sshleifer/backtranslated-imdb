It's better than the first. The movie begins with Sheriff Sam. Then Sam and Anne put their bags and go to the Tropicana while Jack follows them. <br /> <br /> People get shot, get a drink in the neck, get crushed by anvils, stabbed with ice cubes, eyes torn off, explosions in the head, drowning, draperies, pushed lobsters in faces, throat cut, bruised by the snow, killed by snowballs, arms torn off, melted by antifreeze, icicles on the neck, icicles on the neck, smashed in the face pots and pans, fingers biting, ice cubes in the mouth, bits on the neck, people exploding, snowballs roasted and sinking in blenders. <br /> <br /> The snowballs are hilarious, they put it in a blender and turn it on, then it says "it was fun", they put a waffle and it burned. <br /> <br /> This is just a good movie. Then they start thinking of other ways to kill him, and the snowball responds: "It's not good" <br /> <br /> It was worth spending ten dollars to buy this. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10 stars.
