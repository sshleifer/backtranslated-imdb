I had the privilege of watching Mar Adentro last Friday and I am always shocked by its beauty, the powerful work of every actor and actress and the incredible ability of Amenabar to tell the story of Ramón Sampedro, who was well known in Spain for asking for legal euthanasia, lost the case in court and finally died in front of a camera drinking a drink with a poison, freezing all our hearts with his determination not to continue living immobilized forever because of an accident. <br /> <br /> Before watching the movie, I was already fascinated by the strong symbology of its title, which I would translate as "In the sea" and not as some people suggest "At sea", and which is taken from An original poem written by the man of whom this story speaks. Then I watched the movie. Oh my friends. It's a cinema with a capital C. The narrative flows to take you to the heart of each character: Sampedro, reincarnated in a Bardem that you have forgotten from the beginning, is at the center of this man full of humor and hope, and his hope is to die, because for him, the life he lives is not worth living. The other characters, except one, dance around him and respect his decision because they see him as an independent human being (forgetting that he depends on others for everything), even if they love him so much. And here's what the movie is about: love. You can feel it, you can breathe it in the skin of each character. You witness the rise of feelings among the three women who meet him in the film: Gené, a member of the association defending his right to die in dignity, his friend, his story in the film is a hope for us, the lucky ones can live a normal life in this world; Rosa, the woman who meets a good man in the middle of his list of broken relationships and suffering in the hands of all the men who have used and despised him; Julia, the woman who shares a tragic destiny with Ramón and finally acts in a way that we can only understand. <br /> <br /> However, before meeting these women, Ramón knew what love was like, because you can not meet him. without loving him, and he is deeply loved by his abandoned family: Four unique characters by their humility and courage, each with his own thought about his decision, each considered respectable in his own way, because the terrible thing in this story is that no one is to blame for what happened. Unfortunately, life is sometimes so terrible. From this familiar quartet, I particularly liked the work of Mabel Rivera as Ramón's sister-in-law, Manuela: a fantastic performance. <br /> <br /> I would like to draw attention to three episodes which for me are the best highlights I have ever seen. in a long time, and if you have not seen the movie, do not read this, skip this paragraph and reread it from the next one starting with "Mar adentro", let the movie show you its secrets. 3. The best love scene I saw in a movie, when I really felt the love invading the screen, is when Ramón dreams that he is flying to meet Julia at the beach and they kiss each other. 2. Gené telephoned Ramón the day before he did it and he told him that it was better that they say goodbye at that moment, instead of causing him trouble with the authorities. . And then she knows it's the last time they're going to talk, and she's fought for him to have the right to die ... but she does not want to lose it because she loves him as a true friend, and even if she is. respect his decision at all costs. 1. The best A young Ramón on the beach, watching his girlfriend under the sun, jumping into the water from the rocks to a sea that is retiring. We see the accident, we hear his voice recalling what happened and saying he should have died right now. Bardem's face, face down, has been shown from below. And the hand of a friend who pulls him from the forehead and brings him back to a life that will be a hell for him in the next 30 years. There are many others, like the impressive ending, although we know all too well what Ramon did in Spain. <br /> <br /> Mar adentro did not deceive me, Amenabar never knows it, but this time he did it. thank the actors who took part in the project and who may have taken it personally, because it is not only a film, it is an elegy for a man who died alone while he asked to die "in all legality", which meant for him, as Bardem pointed out, dying with the people he loved and who loved him everywhere.
