It may interest people to know that this film was shot without any possible recourse against Phoolan Devi herself and, when she finally saw some of it, was so enraged that she announced that she should not be shot in India, if not in gasoline and set itself on fire. I do not know if it was shown or not, but given her position at the time as a future politician, I doubt it. Since then, I have seen a report that she was removed from office and charged with new crimes since arriving in Dacoit. It is for this reason that she would have hidden. <br /> film, made even more important by its refreshing and brutal approach; none of the pink-tinged melodromes that one would expect from a typical Indian movie. It should be noted that the concerns about how the film's messages are truly feminist are essentially irrelevant: it's a true story. It seems that his fears do not concern what is described, but the way the film describes it.
