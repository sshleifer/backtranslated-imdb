I am a 49 year old married and happy, who loves this movie is dead. <br /> <br /> Geena Davis's character is strong, smart and kicks ass ........... .... I thought she did a great job (this is a euphemism) in this film. <br /> <br /> I'm not very good in action movies, but I thought it was so sexy and fun. <BR/> <br /> She's my alter-ego ............. when she starts to assemble this assault rifle in the old hotel room ..... ....... ......... I had chills ............... she did it as if she knew what she was doing ... thats one of my LOT favorite roles in this movie ........ <br /> <br /> I think she deserved an Oscar for her role and her physical roles ..... ... <br /> <I'm going to have "CHARLY" tattooed on the back .............. I'm one of those girls who will NEVER BE A VICTIM ...... . ............... I'm like her ............... (secretly ... shhhhhhhhhhhhh ....... and n is not that oh so sexy?
