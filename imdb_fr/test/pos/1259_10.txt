It's a totally awesome movie! If you have not seen it yet, you should do it. Of course, the plot is slow to develop, the special effects are laughable, the acting is ridiculous and the action is poorly choreographed, but as the DDP wrestler would say; It's not a bad thing ... it's a good thing! Everything in this movie is hilarious, especially if you have the dubbed version, which has even worse actors. It's an incalculable number of laughs until the end, desiring the rest, where the mother fights the women fighting. So, I give him ten stars. Unless you are one of those "discriminating" and "intelligent" people, with good taste and who only like "high quality" movies of the highest caliber, I recommend this totally monkeydellic movie!
