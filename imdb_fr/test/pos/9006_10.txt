Forever strong is one of those sports movies that you can actually watch. It reminded me a lot of Remember the Titans because it included comedy, sadness and just awesome. I saw it during a pre-screening and all my friends liked it and easily placed it in their top 2 sports films. The acting is awesome in the movie. Even though it looks like Remember the Titans, this movie has something very unique. I think this is definitely worthy of an Oscar and will receive many awards. Everyone should really go see this movie and it's worth $ 10. I'll have to see him again when he comes out because it was so good. I can not say a bad thing about the movie.
