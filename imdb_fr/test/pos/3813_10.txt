Obviously, previous reviews are not fans of this genre, but I think this one is pretty well done. <br /> <br /> It's cunningly cute, clever and dark. This story reminded me of the types of girls I was in love with as a child. <br /> <br /> It also makes me want to watch some of Nadia's other films, as well as many youtube comments about her warmth. In this video. <br /> <br /> Of course, there is Burton's influence here, but I would not say that Brad is trying to rip him off. <br /> <br /> He is jumping in and adding his talents to kind that I can appreciate. I like what he does and he does it well, said Nuff!
