I saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort, good messages for the kids. A little predictable. The book was better, it gave more details about the plot, the environment and how the children discovered the plot. I think Hiassen's offbeat humor is better in the book than in the movie, but there were also a lot of fun moments in the movie. This is probably a bit too slow for children under 6 years old. I loved the casting of Jimmy Buffet as a science teacher. And those cute babies were adorable. I wonder how they managed to film them. The movie showed a lot of Florida at its best, making it very attractive. Do I imagine it or did Carl Hiassen make a brief appearance?
