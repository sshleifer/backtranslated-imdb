Well, it's safe to say that Subconscious Cruelty is a strange movie! Supposedly a glimpse of the human spirit, Subconscious Cruelty is composed of four gruesome and strange tales of the extreme. The first segment, titled "Ovarian Eyeball," is actually just a warm up, but it's good that it gives the viewer an idea of ​​what to expect from the next three segments. He just sees a naked woman lying on a table, while another woman cuts her belly and takes out a human eyeball! I do not know why, but it certainly allows a visceral vision. The following story is the best of the group and takes up the theme of the "old favorite" of the sick film of incest. The segment follows a man who lives alone with his pregnant sister. He is repelled by his pregnancy - but he still wants to sleep with her and, of course, he succeeds. This story stands out for the monotonous, factual storytelling, as well as the end - which does not fail to deliver shocks. This segment is well played, well filmed and undoubtedly the highlight of unconscious cruelty. <br /> <br /> Of course, the next two sections are not as good as the second; director Karim Hussain always manages to get something out of the bag before the end of the film. However, it does not do it right away, because the third segment is the weakest in the movie and simply sees that many people have sex with the ground. It is very surreal, and therefore memorable for the same reason; but there does not seem to be any interest in that, and I wanted something more morbid after the second part. The film ends in beauty, however, although I'm not quite sure what I meant, the last segment contains the best images of the film. This segment focuses on religion and is certainly not for anyone who appreciates it! Director Karim Hussain has accomplished something here. Indeed, although this collection of four "extreme" stories is not a whole, the film is almost tasteful because it was shot so eloquently and attractively. The director seems to have imitated the highly respected surrealist director, Luis Buñuel, with gore, rape and incest; and if you ask me, he has not worked bad at all. Not for everyone, but certainly worth a look for extreme fanatics!
