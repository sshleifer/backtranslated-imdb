NEVER try to understand the logic of this story. But accompany Gus, 10, in the journey on the strangest road ever seen. More strange characters and unlikely situations than a meeting at Twin Peaks! Nothing makes sense, but it's impossible to stop looking at Motorama! Now where can I find this "R" ????
