Very typical of Almod√≥var of the time and, in his way, no less funny than many of his later works. And why? There is nothing that can be provoked or shocked, and I suppose such an effect is more fortuitous than intentional. No, the great humor stems from an underlying, almost surreal, absurdity that is woven into the background: the almost total lack of taboos of the characters. This is the same kind of "comic suspense" that we find in his later works, although you find it in a more approximate version here. He prepares many masterpieces to come, but is not there yet. <br /> <br /> The only critic who commented on this movie before me said that it must be a group of "very selective" people. I find this film hilarious. I do.
