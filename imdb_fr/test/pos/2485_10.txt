Realistic masterpiece. Thirty years later, the images may seem a little old, but in reality they only specify the effect "fist in the face" of the film. I have never seen a film like this in my life. The first time I saw it, I did not know if it was a fiction ... And it did not look like ... This film is a masterpiece that every individual in the world must see. It is the best critical film of society. The ultimate movie that demonstrates that the system is down. And the system has not changed much in thirty years. I think this film should be regarded as a piece of education.
