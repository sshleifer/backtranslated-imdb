It's a really wonderful love story. I liked the songs, but even if you do not like it, you must love the story. Peter O'Toole is at his best and Petula Clark is fine too. I saw it for the first time when I was about 13 years old and I loved it afterwards. Now in my forties, I still enjoy it, probably even more. Still makes me cry and laugh and feel good. It's a movie to watch only with a guy from the new age or by yourself because it's a girl movie. But what's wrong with that? Need a little love and maybe a little cry, try this movie. <br /> <br />
