After watching Oldboy, I was a little disappointed with the rest of Park's work. Some are good, but they never approach Oldboy's level of humor and originality. This one does not look like Oldboy at all, but its level of quality is the same. <br /> <br /> The acting is good with Kang-ho Song, OK-bin Kim and Ha-kyun Shin. excellent performance. Kim in particular manages to move from frightening horror scenes to surreal comedy without the slightest mistake. <br /> <br /> The plot is strange with lots of twists and takes a big shot at the vampire shots. <BR/> <br /> The staging is punctuated by a lot of rhythm and humor and presents some of the most memorable scenes I've ever seen. He boasts of what is probably the strangest love scene you will ever see. <br /> <br /> This is just a great movie.
