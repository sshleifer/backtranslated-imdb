It's certainly one of the scariest and most compelling films ever made. You are stuck in the movie from beginning to end. Even if there are holes in the plot, it continues to be exciting until the final slaughter. Besides "8 MM" and "Peeping Tom", this is one of the best movies on "Snuff Movies", a taboo theme of our culture. If you like the SCREAM trilogy, you will surely love it.
