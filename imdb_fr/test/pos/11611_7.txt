The dreams of Karim Hussain are to be feared. When the right hemisphere of his characters overrides the left hemisphere, shocking images of blood, dismemberment and various abominations are broadcast. Religion will not save you, any more than Mother Nature or your own family. Hussain's black poetry, because that's what this movie really is, destabilizes all sanctuary institutions. <br /> <br /> "Subconcious Cruelty" is a subject that appeals to the crowd today on the horror and fantasy festival circuit. The opening meditation of the film on madness is both well written and profound. The protagonist's desire to desecrate the process of childbirth that brought him to the hell he inhabits unfolds with horrible and credible illogy. From there, the film continues deeper into the subconscious and addresses Mother Nature. Hussain offers representations of pagan fecundity and mushroom madness. Nature is exposed as bloody and violent to the frightening light of Hussain. <br /> <br /> The "subconscious cruelty" disturbs everyone and rewards those who see beyond shock in the mature themes of life, lust and madness. very worthy movie explores. CJ Goldman deserves congratulations for his special makeup, as David Kristian for a disturbing sound design and Teruhiko Suzuki for the score.
