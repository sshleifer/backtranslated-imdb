Brad Pitt pushes his index finger into Diane Kruger's leg wound and holds it there until he gets what he wants. Funny, horribly. The invented thread carries "The Dirty Dozen" and sometimes abandons it to pay tribute to other films. Lots of fun. Even "Paris when it sizzles" is mentioned in a delightfully organic dialogue. The character of Christoph Waltzer and his sensational performance excited me. Brad Pitt creates a real original. I like the lack of vanity of the actor. There is a quirk in the character that is purely Brad Pitt. Tarantino visits a new universe but. thankfully, his hand. his brain and his heart are visible everywhere.
