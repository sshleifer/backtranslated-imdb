"Murder Over New York" is fun, but not as good as most other Fox Chans. This film would have been better named, "Charlie Chan in New York," the working title of the film. This is an opportunity for Toler to play Chan in the big apple. There are many things to like here, however, including guest guest Shemp Howard of Three Stooges. <br /> <br /> Here is one of my favorite sayings of Chan, "Coincidence as an old egg - leave an unpleasant smell." Toler and Yung are good in this one, as are the main actors. But there is little or no mysterious atmosphere that I search for in these films. Still, it's good to see.
