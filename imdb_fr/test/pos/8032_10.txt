2002, Bourne Identity is one of my favorite movies of all time. However, many fans of the book complained that the film had very little to do with the plot of the book. <br /> <br /> The assignment is the real deal. It is strange that nobody in the Bourne Identity discussions mentioned this movie. (Well, I already did it.) <br /> <br /> In addition to the excellent storyline, I personally found this film as good as any spy movie I have never seen, with the possible exception of The Bourne <br /> <br /> The identity itself. <br /> <br /> The action is quite realistic. I particularly appreciated the protagonists' training program, which was very inventive. <br /> <br /> The sensation is dark and gritty. There are some surprising twists. The acting game is excellent. <br /> <br /> If you like this kind of music, I can not recommend this movie too much.
