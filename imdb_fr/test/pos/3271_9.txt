"Two Hands" is a good addition to the Australian film catalog. <br /> <br /> It is this curious mix of real life, surreal life, comedy, tragedy and love that Australians have developed on their own. <Br /> <br /> Heath Ledger is basically a good guy so naive. Wanting to get along, he falls with a "Big" local Pando Man (Bryan Brown). But just as he sets foot on the dark path of crime, he meets Alex (Rose Byrne). Here is the cause of the mistake of changing one's life unexpectedly. After accidentally falling on the wrong side of Pando, things go very quickly and without a helping hand from another world, it would have been a short, sad film. Yes, Jimmy learns some lessons from life and no one escapes an injury, but in the end, he feels good. Although history contains a lawless theme, it is not glorified and helps to show how a destructive crime can be a normal life. <br /> <br /> Heath Ledger is excellent as Jimmy, both innocent and knowledgeable, Rose is hypnotic as Alex and Bryan are wonderful as usual. It's a small set of credible characters and I found myself concerned about the good guys and not loving the bad guys. <br /> <br /> This DVD is usually in the aisle cheap, so I recommend you add it to your DVD collection too, it would be money well spent. <br /> <br /> 8 of 10
