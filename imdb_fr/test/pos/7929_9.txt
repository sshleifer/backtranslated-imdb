This film is one of the classics of the history of cinema. It was not designed to please the modern public, so some people may think today that it is cracking or scalded. I found it absorbing. Cherkassov is quite good at playing Alexander Nevskyi, just as he did when he played Ivan Groznyi (Ivan the Terrible) several years later. The music was beautiful. <br /> <br /> My only complaint is the mediocre soundtrack, which was quite distorted. Although I do know a little Russian, it would have been nice to be able to choose more words rather than having to count almost 100% on subtitles. I was watching this on an old videotape from the library, though. Perhaps there is already a DVD version on which the sound has been improved. I would like to know if the actors used archaic Russian or even the old Slavonic church when they spoke. The subtitles were strangely worded and it's hard for me to say if this reflected an older way of speaking or if the subtitles were just a little badly done.
