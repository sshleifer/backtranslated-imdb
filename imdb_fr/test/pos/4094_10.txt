The musical version of LOST HORIZON from 1973 is the most endearing and endearing musical film of ALL TIME. The 1973 musical remake of James Hilton's novel about the mythical SHANGRI-LA! is a real special gem. BURT BACHARACH music and lyrics by HAL David. A strange mix of drama, adventure and musical sequences. It has the peculiarity of being the ONLY anti-war musical fantasy ever filmed. <br /> <br /> This film was a critical and financial disappointment in the United States, but brought in a lot of money abroad. Only in America, it failed. Very different and unique in his approach as a movie musical, he deserves much better than he deserves. LOST HORIZON is an incredible adventure. Frank Capra's 1937 film and this 1973 musical are faithful adaptations of James Hilton's novel. What I like in the 1973 version is the freedom in which music numbers are presented. The film has a prestigious cast and a director and director of gifted photography. It is a BURAR BACHARACH Shangri-La and it is a wonderful place. Songs like THE WORLD IS A CIRCLE, SHARE JOY, and LIVE TOGETHER, GROWING TOGETHER evoke a happiness that Hilton has written in her novel. Why should not Shangri-La be a crazy place? The two songs of love, I could frighten him and the images that I just erased are the sensitive points of the photo. There is a peace and a soft voice quality in these two songs that is very faithful to the philosophy of history. In addition, THINGS I WILL NOT MISS is a good duet with a powerful melody. It's a good exchange of different types of perspectives and who can blame Olivia Hussey and Sally Kellerman for trampling, singing and dancing on tables? It's a great team and the number is well staged. <br /> <br /> I have always found it interesting in this story how the Great Lama kidnaps someone from the outside world to take his place in Shangri-La. The character of the Great Lama is a sweet soul but a little radical in his vision of humanity as a whole. He has no hope for the world outside of Shangri-La. If this film were to be redone today, it would be interesting to see more emphasis on the main character, RICHARD ONWAY, in conflict with what he left in the outside world, as opposed to what he has found in Shangri-La. <br /> <br /> Of course, for the film to be credible, the character of RICHARD CONWAY must be presented as suffering from amnesia at the end, as it was in the book. None of the film versions of LOST HORIZON are true to the novel in this respect. Did Conway find Shangri-La or did we imagine it? Are they all dead in the crash of the plane? Every man has his own idea of ​​what his Shangri-La would be like. The conflict with Conway who wants to believe in Shangri-La and find his old life in the outside world is powerful. I love the melancholy on the faces of Kellerman, Kennedy and Van as they watch their friends leave the mystic valley. It is interesting to note that Conway does not want to leave paradise, but his brother is putting pressure on him. The two versions of LOST HORIZON work in different ways, but they both succeed in probing James Hiltons' ideas about a hidden valley where money has no value and where moderation is the rule. So, in a sense, it's anti-capitalism in its theme where money and materialism are not the motivation. The rule is human kindness, decency, compassion, courtesy, etiquette and living in harmony with each other. <br /> <br /> LOST HORIZON has a much stronger story than most musicals. He tries to answer the fundamental questions of life and we can not blame him for not succeeding. It must be remembered that LOST HORIZON in 1973 was post CABARET. It was no longer fashionable for the characters to sing in a music, let alone be dubbed by other singers. LOST HORIZON was an easy target for jaded critics. Expectations for her were high, almost unreasonable. The producer, ROSS HUNTER and BURT BACHARACH, had to be targeted and the critics wanted to reach them both. As a producer, Ross Hunter had had decades of financial success. LOST HORIZON was his film tracking his success. AIRPORT, 1970. For years, AIRPORT has been the most watched movie on television. He has been nominated for 11 Oscars, including Best Film. At the time, Burt Bacharach and Hal David were the most successful songwriters in the country. LOST HORIZON's flawless sentimentality has not come to light in the wake of the collapse of censorship in films like EASY RIDER, MIDNIGHT COWBOY and THE GODFATHER. Sex and violence was a new frontier in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Spectators flocked to films that were not usual. Sumptuous musicals are no longer well received, no matter how good they are. Today, LOST HORIZON can be enjoyed and appreciated on many levels. It's the ultimate escape movie with a strong story, wonderful music, expensive budget and quirky humor. This is unconventional in that the music is introduced after 45 minutes in the film. This changes course halfway when the mystical valley is introduced and why not? LOST HORIZON '73 is a divine film that deserves to be rediscovered. A lost and legendary treasure deserving better than his reputation.
