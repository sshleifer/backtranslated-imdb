"One Dark Night" is a staple of the low-budget horror genre of the 1980s. Filled with retro word games, clothing and sets, "ODN" transports the viewer into a simpler time, where horror movies were exactly what it was ... Horror! on, the film tells a dark fable of what happens when you play with the dead. Well done by his team of scream-queens, and an excellent directorial work by Tom McLoughlin, who admires time and makes you believe what he presents. There is no "who did it?" and certainly no big twist at the end. It's simple and horrified from start to finish, with a lot of humor from the 80s to add spice. I give it "8" just because some of the special effects are insufficient towards the end of the film, but at least there is no CGI ... Perfect film for new fans of the horror genre of the 1980s, or those looking to relive a fun night of classic horror happiness.
