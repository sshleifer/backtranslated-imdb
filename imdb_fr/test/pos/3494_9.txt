I like this film!! It may be my generation, but I can really understand what he's talking about and what he wants to do. it made me laugh all the time. duration of the film, the next day and beyond. I think this movie is not about watching if you mainly care about plot and character development. this film is almost reserved for the generation who will understand it. there are a lot of things that you know to be educated in this generation and that you would not do if you said 40. I think Sacha Barren Cohen was very, and I mean very well. he is a genius. and the reason he's so stupid is that he can make people think he's a complete idiot, and make it funny at the same time! <br /> <br /> Very good movie. strongly recommended!!!! (not so loud if you are over 30)
