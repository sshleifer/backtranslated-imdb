It seems that Hack has been described as unrealistic ... but that's what TV is. The television is supposed to escape from everyday life and I think Hack is doing a great job in this regard. Add to this the slow process of revealing one's past and engaging / interesting intrigues; you simply can not get enough. Plus, with great actors such as David Morse, Andre Braugher and even little Mathew Borish, what more can you ask for? So, if you're looking for a rousing experience and you like "outsider" characters, I suggest giving Hack a chance, especially now that everything is finally happening.
