I can not think of any film that makes the concept of grace better, in a theological sense. The well-intentioned religiosity of a small congregation, which went wrong after the death of its leader, causes them to lose the same thing they preach: grace. The dear gift of a humiliated Parisian culinary genius brings them back to their vocation to love each other and humiliates an elderly general, anxious not to have ruined his life. Choice is a central theme, as well as grace. At the same time, artistic giving is recognized as having a powerful and transcendent role to play in everyday life and life to come. Can not improve or ignore. It's a film that changes the lives of those who hear its message.
