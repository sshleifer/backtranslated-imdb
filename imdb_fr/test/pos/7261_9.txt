I've seen glimpses everywhere before deciding to watch them. And what do you know, I really liked that! It has a new twist of 18th century England. Although the music of the dance scene has been visibly modernized and the colors of Liv Tyler's clothers (although THIS IS PRETTY!), They fit perfectly. <br /> <br /> If you just want to have a good time, you should check this out. Very different from other detailed movies of the 18th century.
