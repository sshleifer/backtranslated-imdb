Rickman is sexy and good, but "the unknown" is less convincing - Reedus is rather sexy, but he is not a regular actor - it could be the director's fault in this case - we are supposed to find him attractive to the extreme just because it's "pretty" - but that's not enough. The upset wife is almost convincing - 7 years of marriage and the character of Rickman and herself should be better adjusted with each other, whether their roles are incompatible or not - they must already have models. I understand that, although I think the woman is a little stiff in her role - and is not convincingly attracted by "the stranger" - so it's a failure - the tacit link between Rickman's character and this "stranger" is better done, we do not know what it is. I miss Rickman's sexy English accent (thankfully, he slips in and out of the American model). disappointing but with very good actors.
