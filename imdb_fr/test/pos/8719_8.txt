"Cactus Flower" is another "oldie but goody" song from about the same time as "Out of Towners". She is accompanied by a brilliant cast: Goldie Hawn, during her first appearance in the film (before the facelift), Ingrid Bergmann in one of the following and the always funny Walter Matthau. The story tells the story of a dentist who claims to marry for an excuse not to marry his girlfriend, hence the need to find a fictional wife as proof. He encourages his elderly receptionist (Bergman) to take the role, which has caused many comical disasters and surprising turns of love. It's in the same vein as the comedies Doris Day / Rock Hunter. Fans of those - like me - will love this movie; otherwise, do not bother.
