"Seeing Other People" is a bold romantic comedy about a couple named Ed and Alice (Jay Mohr and Julianne Nicholson) who are engaged and planning to get married soon. They live together but have doubts about their relationship. Alice realizes she has had so little sex in the past that she may marry Ed because she never felt anything else. They agree to start playing with others for a while to test their own relationship. <br /> <br /> The film balances a sneaky question - focusing too much on the "What if?" aspects of life, can it actually do the opposite and make you feel more constrained? When Ed starts having sex with a schoolgirl, he starts to get hooked and almost forget about Alice. When he realizes this, it scares him. <br /> <br /> I had never heard of this movie in advance, but I appreciated. It's not very well done and really has that indie impression of small budget deliberately - but it's a lot better than most romantic comedies in today's mainstream. <br /> <br /> Find out if you get a chance.
