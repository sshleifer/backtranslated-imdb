I saw this film in preview, and it's delicious. Cinematography is unusually creative, the acting is good and the story is fabulous. If this film is not going well, it will not be because it does not deserve it. Before this film, I did not realize how charming Shia Lebouf could be. He does wonderful and autonomous work as a manager. He has something incredibly sweet in him and makes the movie even better. The other actors are also doing a good job, and the film contains moments of very high suspense, more than one would expect from a movie about golf. Sports movies are shoveled, but this one stands out. <br /> <br /> This is the one I would recommend to anyone.
