good job. that's how I would describe this animated Scooby-Doo adventure. It's so far the best Scooby animated film I've seen. I loved the story. I thought it was had depth. The film is as well paced.It does not become boring for a minute.It also has an interesting group of characters (in addition to Scooby, Shaggy and the gang, of course) and in addition, the film was a real explosion. I have a lot of fun watching it. I also liked the good Scottish music. It was very catchy and contagious. Naturally, we know that Scooby and the Gamg are going to solve the mystery, but it is always fun to get to this point. The animation is also very good for this movie.I love if they did a 3D adventure with Scooby, but we will have to wait and see. For me, Scooby-Doo and the monster of Loch Ness is a 7/10
