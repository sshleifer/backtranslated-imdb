My son Adam (5 years old) is a big fan of Scooby Doo. He likes this movie a lot. He particularly appreciated the fact that the Loch Ness monster attempted to attack Shaggy and Scooby. The vote score is his choice and reflects his love of the characters. <br /> <br /> After seeing the movie "Vampire Rock" first, this is very similar to this one, which looks like a different basic plot setting. <br /> <br /> Few adults will arrive without having their own recollection of the televised cartoon series, let alone look at it without children. You like or like it. Child, I loved Scooby Doo for half an hour, I'm happy my son loves it, I can pretty much stand it now.
