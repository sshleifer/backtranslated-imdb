A good old-fashioned volleyball and revenge western, with a touch of gravity, injecting a bit of black social history into his plot. Under the direction of Mario Van Peebles, OK, the runaway misfits of Billy Zane's (seemingly unstoppable) army are doing well, their adventures are plausible but fun and exciting. There are good back-and-forth scenes that show the character and background of the hero. The end of the shooting comes to an end when our heroes defend the city from voracious and white land grabbers, and even Stephen Baldwin is not bad in this equally powerful and pleasant westerner.
