This is another classic Seagal movie. He walks, no, sails through the patriot, all the other Mega Seagal movies. In this film, nothing resists Seagal's challenge, except maybe in the part where he has to find a cure for this so-called "plague" and he starts to throw information on the lab, but everything goes well, I do not mind, his master. Seagal, he must win. What about his outfit in the movie, masterpiece, he must have chosen himself. It's great that everyone in the movie dies after being exposed to the virus, but Seagal does not even have a cough. The incident in the end when he killed the fat guy with the broken glass, genius, I bet Seagal thought of that one too. This film is a pure and simple class. great intrigue, great characters and Seagal.
