Designed to be a sort of social commentary on how our lives lost control in the 1970s, this film plays more like something that Mr. Schlesinger put up after a bad day on the highway. A mixture of nut fragments found along the highway in Florida and along the highway of life, the distribution is largely wasted and probably ended up on the floor of the editing room. The problem is that what he did not end up on the floor of the cutting room probably should have! Now available on DVD, it's pretty funny to see a comedy that would have cost $ 100 million in production if it was made in 2004. It continues and is not too difficult to watch, and curiously, in 2004, we are all still pretty much just <br /> <br /> jump in our cars and go faster and faster, heading nowhere.
