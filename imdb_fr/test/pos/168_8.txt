This dreadfully peevish and bizarre teenage comedies movie of the early '80s may never reach the surprisingly popular climax of the film "Devil Times Five", deeply disconcerting and criminally misunderstood and criminally underrated by crime. <br /> <The plot, thin but useful, is centered on a trio of maladaptive tykes - two bratty boys and a little girl with sparkling eyes, albeit angelic in appearance - who were all born during a solar eclipse on 9 June 1970. When the strange antisocial trio, which forms an exclusive and exclusive circle, reaches the age of ten, it suddenly becomes monstrous and declares itself open for the open season to the unsuspecting and unsuspecting local yokels of the suburbs Californian Meadowvale, previously dormant and peaceful. . Screenwriter / director Ed Hunt, the unusual incompetent hack not known, responsible for those bastonnas so terribly miserable that the delicious sodomies "Starship Invasions", the incredibly stupid parable of Jesus Christ (!) "Alien Warrior" and the incredibly stupid " The Brain ". does a pretty solid and capable job here: Killing scenes are numerous and reasonably brutal (the flail gag at the eye is particularly naughty), there is a considerable amount of free nudity and soft-core sex, a good amount of tension is beautifully created and maintained, pretty heaps of black humor punctuate the striking and distorted chaos, and the sinister ending surprises manages to be really bumpy. <br /> <br /> In addition, the casting of the upper drawer still raises the perfectly observable and captivating procedure: Jose Ferror as a small town doctor, future star of the TV series "Jake and the Fatman" Joe Penny in amateur astrologer, Lori Lethin of "The Prey" in courageous babysitter heroine, Susan Strasberg in idiot Michael Dudikoff, teacher at school, "American Ninja" in the role of joker and Cyril O'Reilly (the lonely vampire misanthrope in "Dance of the Damned," a haunting melancholy), in the role of a libidinous teenager who thinks with a hot girl naked in the back of a parked van. Billy Jacoby (who later starred in "Dr. Alien" and "Demonwarp"), Andy Freeman, and in particular Elizabeth Hoy, strangely adorable, is really scary and compelling as the terrible troika of evil perverse and rough amoral. And yes, it's not other than Julie Brown, the copper comedian who made a surprise hit in the Top 40 with the hilarious melody "The Gotta Gun of the queen of the reunion", as the lovely red bimbo with generous bosom who does a good, nude striptease totally alien, but still so hot and much appreciated, while dancing in her room to a rock and screaming rock song! Overall, this baby is considered a sturdy and satisfying slasher object.
