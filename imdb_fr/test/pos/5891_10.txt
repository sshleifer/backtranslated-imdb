The best years of our lives perfectly reflect the time of my youth and the feelings of that time. The cast was uniformly wonderful. It was probably Dana Andrews' best role of his career and he should also have been nominated for an Academy Award. There are so many wonderful scenes in this film that it's almost impossible to list them all. Cinematography is among the best of all films. This film is a time capsule of what was happening in the 1940s. A must-see movie for all real movie fans. Some critics have said that this movie has aged. I do not agree. The theme of human desires is timeless. And the obstacles facing veterans returning from the war will always be with us. This is just a great movie - one that can be watched over and over again.
