It's one of the most unusual intrigues I've ever seen in a horror movie, but it's based on good, solid Universal Studios fare: lots of monsters, a pretty heroine, villagers carrying torches . But what I prefer is Larry Talbot (The werewolf) who seeks the cure for his lycanthropy. After being dead in the original "Wolf Man", he is resurrected and walks in "Frankenstein meets the Wolf" and "House of Frankenstein" in search of a way to end his affliction. I think that the audience for the first time will find his research in this very interesting film. <br /> <br />
