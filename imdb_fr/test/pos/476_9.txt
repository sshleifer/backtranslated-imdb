"My Dinner with André" in the 1980s, with Wallace Shawn and André Gregory, is essentially a dialogue about the world and how it affects and can elevate the mind. "You Are Alone" from 2005 shows how common social events can break the soul. <br /> <br /> The story revolves around three main characters. There is Daphne, a pretty teenage student who is concerned about almost every decision in her life. There is also the prostitute, or paid escort, Britney, as confident as Daphne is self-aware. What makes them interesting is that they share the same body, even the same character. Part of the magic of this film occurs in one of the first scenes where Daphne approaches a door of an old hotel room. She stops and is obviously torn by the decision to knock on the door or not? but it's Britney who slides effortlessly into the room when the door is open. <br /> <br /> On the other side of the door is Buddy, a middle-aged man with little, if any, personal qualities to find attractive. He goes so far as to talk about the profession chosen by Britney as soon as he enters the room. However, we quickly learn that Buddy is the neighbor of Daphne and has watched over the years its evolution from girl to woman. This complicates things for the public. Is Buddy just a worried neighbor or does he want something else? <br /> <br /> If it's sex that Buddy wants, here he is. Britney loves sex. His definitions are perhaps clintonesque, but that does not make him forget his enthusiasm. She prefers older men and wears a rainbow of plastic bracelets that her clients are asked to choose. Each band of color denotes a specific act that it will perform ?? but exactly what act will be revealed only after the group has detached itself from the wrist and the choice is irrevocably made. <br /> <br /> Britney believes or believes she can control every game. Even when she is blindfolded and bound by one of her usual clients, she imagines her arms and body caressed by several men but her legs and her pubis caressed by a woman in blood red lingerie. The images of the film do not stop arriving. <br /> <br /> Buddy's pathetic life is one of acceptance. He lost his wife, his dog, even his fantasies of the pretty teenager next door. It is no coincidence that he has drawn Daphne or Britney to this hotel room. There is a painting on the wall of a plate with only a fish head on the left. It's a perfect metaphor for Buddy's life. all the good parts are over. So here, where he brought his wife while they were still students, he takes a position ?? regain control of his own life, make his statement. <br /> <br /> The director of "You Are Alone", Gorman Bechard, knows his job. The main action in the hotel room serves as a solid anchor for the film, assisted by a myriad of interspersed scenes that add a dimension to the characters, their circumstances and their conflicts. As the movie progresses, Britney asks Buddy if she should undress. He says yes, but she only undresses for her underwear. A real prostitute would probably take off all her clothes (one of the five clothes of the profession). But it's not Buddy who's teased, we are. At the end of the film, we find that human emotions and motivations are much deeper. A tease does not work if she does not deliver. Britney does it, just like "You Are Alone".
