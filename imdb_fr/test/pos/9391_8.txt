"Death Bed: The Bed That Eats" is an extremely bizarre horror movie that you really have to see to be believed. There is an old canopy bed that loves to eat humans and it does it anytime, it can attract someone to lie There is also a long-time deceased artist, trapped behind one of his paintings, who provides a voice-over narration.The first and only film by George Barry offers truly surreal moments such as the bed absorbing its victims in a mysterious way. sea ​​foam yellow and liquid.The atmosphere is dreamy and there is only a little gore, unfortunately the premise is rather silly and the acting is amateur.Always amateur unusual cinema, I enjoyed this Oddity to Low Budget Luck.8 out of 10.
