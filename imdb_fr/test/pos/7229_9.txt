He falls for a beautiful, rich girl named Juliet (Jane Jenson), who is also troubled by the fact that her father is a pretty abusive son, you know what. their. Unfortunately, their fathers are against each other while Juliet's father wants to take over Tromeo's father's movie studio, but could love really defeat them all and stop this enmity? <br /> <br /> The comical and horrible drama satire drama of Troma's wacky and disgusting characters is a marvelous modern rendition of William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet. This film was released in 1997 and received good reviews as it is a humorous satire of the legendary story that triggered everything. She has good laughs, piercing violence, graphic violence and gore like a shattered head on a fire hydrant. . For me, it's the third best Troma movie after the immortal "Toxic Avenger" and "Troma's War" being in second place. Yes, the acting game can be a bit bad, like some of Troma's movies, but the above elements warrant it and it's a If you like horror comedies, Peter Jackson and Troma, or if you want to see a comic version of a beloved story, BTW will also look for some fun appearances of The Toxic Avenger and SGT. Kabukiman NYPD. <br /> <br /> Also recommended: "The Toxic Avenger", "Meet The Feebles", "Ichi The Killer", "Re-Animator", "Terror Firmer", "Class of Nuke'Em High", " Romeo and Juliet (1968 and 1996) "," Coins "," The Troma War "," Toxic Citizen: The Toxic Avenger 4 "," Basket Case "," Riki-Oh: The Story of Ricky "," Demons "," New Nightmare "," Freddy Vs.
