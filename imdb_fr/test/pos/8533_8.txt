On Monday, earlier this week, around the month of July, I was under the influence of the sweet leaf, and I, being a horror fan, wanted to see something scary. I was thinking of The Ammityville Horror 2, but I have something much better. I was at my friend's house and he had the VHS Evil Ed. No blanket or anything, he did not even see it himself, but he told me it was about "A guy who goes crazy and kills a lot of people. " Well, this movie was very shocking, I had never seen the brutal nature of sadistic violence before this movie, It buries Ted Bundy and Ed Gein both! It's pretty funny too, with references to The Evil Dead trilogy (and in addition the Evil Dead 2 poster is ubiquitous in the movie!) The movie is about Edward, a cool obsessive-compulsive guy who happens to be an editor. He is then loaned to another building department and sent to Sam Campbell's chic and violent world, the Splatter and Gore departments. Sam Campbell, Eddy's new boss, talks to Eddy about the big breakup of his movies, the horrendous Loose Limbs series, and he needs Eddy to make the movie a little less violent so it can be aired in the entire Europe. Eddy soon has his regrets, as the images and scenes that are displayed to him from the isolated suburban home in which he is sent to work, and then what happens from there is really nightmarish. Imagine yourself in its place! The acting is awesome, the overlay is a bit funny (Sam Campbell's voice is often funny, as well as the other actors). However, the overlay job was done very well, I give this movie a 10/10, and it's a good introduction to the subgenre Gore in Horror. Very good, nightmarish, bloody ....... Just see it for yourself. <br /> <br /> Quote from the movie: "Where is my Beaver rape scene ?!"
