In recent months, I've seen a lot of criticism for The Italian Job, many of them negative. Most of these pessimistic criticisms are that, despite its modernist bravado and high-budget technology, the film does not have much substance where it counts. Look, people, it's just a fun movie. This is the type of photo where you are supposed to sit, relax and just enjoy the film's steady pace. Like Ocean's Eleven (2001), you can focus on both characters and plot without having to think too much (a chance for some of us). Of course, "Ocean" is a better film, but who cares? The plot may have a few holes (there's a whopping three-quarters of it), the action may not be as rewarding and free as the trailers have shown, and part of the dialogue may seem useless and nerdy, again, who really cares? Cool characters, Mini Coopers, big explosions, Charlize Theron. What else do you want? I think it's time to drop the fake act of Roger Ebert and Gene Shalit and have fun for once! Oh, and whatever, whatever you do, do not compare it to the original because, to repeat what F. Gary Gray told the press a million times, THIS IS NOT A REAKE !! My advice: If you are interested in choosing one of the fun and fun movies, do not even bother to see The Italian Job. But if you do not have a severe inferiority complex and / or want to see Ed Norton get caught by a group of Ukrainians, keep going. In a nutshell, my movie buffs are: Lighten up and have fun, damn it
