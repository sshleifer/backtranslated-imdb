Walking With Dinosaurs is an amazing documentary, educational for both ignorant dinosaurs and dinosaur lovers (like me). I admit that I was very young when I saw this on Discovery, but it immediately obsessed me. (Spoliers !!!!!) The series contains six episodes, ranging from the Upper Triassic to early dinosaurs in the late Cretaceous, at the end of the dinosaurs' reign. When I saw this film for the first time, it was as if I had really traveled in the past. The majesty of Diplodocus, the adventures of Opthalmosaurus and the benevolent mother-in-law version of T-Rex all amazed my family and me. It's an incredible movie and I think the BBC did exactly what it intended to do. Great job!
