I just saw this film in the children's program of the Berlin Film Festival and it just killed me (and just about everyone in the audience)! And make no mistake, this film is among the 250 best of all time! Let me tell you that I am in no way associated with the creators of this film if that is what you believe in reading it. No, but it's actually that! Without forgetting the "kid's-film" label, "Klatretösen" ("Climber Girl") is almost always a classic (as in "biblical")! The story concerns Ida (magnetic: Julie Zangenberg), 12, who is devastated to learn that her father has the deadly disease. In the United States, a special surgical procedure would cost 1.5 million euros and, of course, nobody could afford it. So Ida and her friends Jonas and Sebastian do what any good kid would do - and rob a bank! Sounds corny? Do not forget that it's not America and that "Klatretösen" is by no means a Robin-Williams-multiplex-dish-of-the-day decoder that no one takes seriously. Director Fabian Wullenweber decided to make a big-budget action comedy for kids and, boy, did he succeed! Let me say it this way: this film is like no children's movie and few others have done it before. And it's not just the action. After about 20 minutes of approximate exposure (finally, conceded), it turns into a monster that: <br /> <br /> - puts without shame an "impossible mission" to shame (the many action sequences are masterfully organized look really expensive - take that, mom! <br /> <br /> - dwarfs almost every other outstanding movie (not easy here, they're kids) <br /> <br /> - easily launches a dense story with enough laughter so that Jim Carrey looks for career alternatives <br /> <br /> - nods to Damon Runyon and child karate in the same seconds <br /> - arrives with so much naughty humor that side from pc that i can hear the american evaluation board wetting his pants from here <br /> <br /> - manages to be tender, serious and sexy at the same time (ohmygod, what am I saying? they are children! They are children! - Never mind, look at this last scene!) <br /> <br /> - Stafan Pag stars els Anderson, who for some years "Mirakel" is the favorite actor of all children <br /> <br /> ride!
