Like a few people I know, I arrived late on 'Stingers'; not before 2000. Three years later, I would not miss any episode. The series is really as good and has, to put it better, maintained its integrity, unlike "Blue Heelers", for example. Crime is the thing; personal lives are there but only occur when they concern an investigation! When Gary Sweet was brought in, some fans seemed worried, but he was well integrated, which did not surprise me. Gary could compete with any British or American actor in a similar series. The cast changes from time to time but every change brings something new and fresh. With arguably the best Australian crew behind the scenes, "Stingers" will remain a cutting-edge drama series.
