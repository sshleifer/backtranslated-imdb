Garlin did a great job. Beautiful concept well executed and well produced. It's a very sincere story. As a fan of "Curb Your Enthusiasm", where Jeff was pretty much the role of straight, I was delighted with the depth with which he brought that role into a simple but effective performance. <br /> <br /> the humor was sober and subtle and relied on the poignant character, which I liked a lot, rather than being great or over-explained. And there have been some good little surprises and twists. The vignettes of the convenience stores were a delight. <br /> <br /> When I say it's a wonderful "little" movie, I do not mean budget or quality. It's simple, intimate and handmade. He tells a very credible daily story. Relax and go see him. Let him wash you and you'll feel good about it.
