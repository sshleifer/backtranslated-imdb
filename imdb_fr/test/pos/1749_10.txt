People who know me say that I have a soft spot for animated films. <br /> <br /> To be fair, these people have a half right, my current weakness is the animation films exceptionally well done, like this family film Max and David Fleischer. <br /> <br /> You may be thinking to yourself: "If it's so great, why have not I heard about it?" Good question. This film was released the same week as the Pearl Harbor attacks. The inevitable bad moment has plunged the film into relative darkness. Things are improving, however, because the film was finally released on DVD under the title "BUGVILLE". <br /> <br /> It's funny to see that the film went through all of this because it kind of reflects the plot. Although some people claim that the film tries to send an environmental message (ouah), I personally think that the main idea of ​​the film is perseverance despite adversity and difficult times (after all, the country was hardly out of the depression that the time had known). . <br /> <br /> Our grasshopper hero, Hoppity, desperately wants to help his threatened community. Problem: every time he tries, whether it is by the ill will of others or by simple bad luck, he fails miserably ... and slowly begins to gain the disdain of the same people he tries to save. Although he does his best to maintain a positive attitude, he sometimes breaks down and it is only thanks to the encouragement and support of his friends that he gets up and fights the good fight. Just a healthy reminder that when all is said and done, no one is truly autonomous. <br /> <br /> "Okay," you say. "He has a good message (two in fact), does that really make him EXCEPTIONALLY WELL DONE?" <br /> <br /> My answer: partially. <br /> <br /> It's not just the message that makes this movie special. This is the characterization. This is one of those movies where you can see the personality of each actor in his animation. You almost do not even need spoken lines. A good way to summarize everything is "energetic" or "lively". Many movies used the point of sale, "adorable cast of characters". Every time I hear this phrase, it always makes me think of this movie. <br /> <br /> Example: the bad guys: Swat the Fly and Smack the Mosquito. Many movies have "cute" bad guys, but I do not think you'll find as entertaining and endearing as these guys. Forget that 3 Cartoon Stooges from the 60's. Swat and Smack are what you'll find closest to an animated version of Moe and Curly (but unfortunately not Larry). Practically all the funniest moments in one way or another involve this macabre macabre. Yes, they are rotten without goodniks, but you always care about them. This is the kind of power you only see in a screenwriter, director, and talented team. <br /> <br /> The film contains two little jokes about racial stereotypes (Amerindians and Chinese). I do not think they were supposed to be mean; but they are there, no matter. They did not bother me, but it would be unfair of me not to warn someone who could potentially disturb them. <br /> <br /> So, if you share my weaknesses (and I think you do), try this one.
