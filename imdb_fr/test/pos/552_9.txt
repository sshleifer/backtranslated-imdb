A freshman at the university, this movie reminded me of my relationship with my mother. Of course, my situation does not correspond to that of Natalie Portman and Surandon; but my mother and I grew up with the typical fights between mothers and daughters. There is always the mother who tells you what to do or who is not the kind of mother you want to be. I looked up at the end of this movie. Surandon's reaction when her daughter went to the east coast, miles away, after all that they went through, reminded me of how I felt, coming from a small town on the west coast , going to New York. <br /> <br /> The film is intended for women who have children now adults. It's very touching, I was moved by the film. All the feelings of the characters in this film were quite real, you did not feel any false sentimentality. During the screening of this film, I sat in the credits of the film, alone, wishing that my mother is sitting next to me so that I can hold her in my arms and thank her for everything. This film is a bit cheesy of course, but everything is really important. That's all a mother can learn from her child; and what a child learns from his mother. 8/10
