David Cronenberg's films are easily identifiable, or at least elements of the film are distinguished by his brand. Fetishism, the blur between the organic and the inorganic, squishy things that should not be squishy and throbbing. "eXistenZ" is a Cronenberg classic. In short, this is a future generation of computer games, but instead of a video monitor, the visuals are provided by your mind. The game plugs directly into a "bio port" located at the base of your spine and as long as the game is running, the player can not distinguish the reality of the game. Jennifer Jason Leigh embodies the game developer and guide Jude Law, a novitiate marketing company, through the game. While they are in the game, they discover strange events and possible crimes. But are they real or is it the game? Even the author of the game does not know it. <br /> <br /> The film is a real treat, it engages the viewer, but in the dark until the last minute. Another thing I like in "eXistenZ" is that it does not use a lot of special effects, it's the story that propels the film. Recommended for Saturday night, when science fiction is called.
