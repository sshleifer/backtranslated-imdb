If this film is not at least selected for an Oscar nominee for best foreign film, I will stop waking up at night to watch the event. Fridrik Thor Fridriksson has proved that money is not the key to making a good film but originality. In a cold country comes a warm but stimulating film of a man suffering from mental illness and his fight against a crazy world. After an idea like this, you wonder if the man is crazy or the world in which he lives.
