And I do not understand why the show becomes so difficult. In my opinion this show is really excellent. Well, the first two episodes were not that special, but it gets a boost in the third episode. Which seems to be typical of a Steve Moffat sitcom. I would rank it among the best sitcoms that Britain has ever produced. <br /> <br /> The show itself is a farce at its best; it does not look like Fawlty Towers, but you can certainly rank it as high as a Black Adder, a pairing or the youngest ones! I watch the first season and all I can say is that I'm happy to have bought the DVD! <br /> <br /> The problem with this show is probably and why it was hit so hard, according to Internet, that the original press release compared it to Fawlty Towers and that everyone was disappointed not to know it ! Although even Green Wing is closer to Fawlty Towers than this show, all I can say is that your mind is free of prejudice, give at least one series at least (episode 3 included) and decide for yourself -even! /> All I can say is thanks to Steve Moffat for writing it and thank you to all the staff who did it!
