For a TV movie, it was really worth the detour. The acting was very well done and the story itself had a touching universal theme. I did not read / see the original and, as a rule, I can not stand Shakespeare, but I enjoyed this film (the scenario of the Civil War was also very well done). Do not expect to see an epic, but you should find it moving enough to enjoy it. By the way (on a side note), do not compare this (or any other film for that matter) to the original work. Films are not supposed to transfer a book to the screen, but rather to take the general idea, and then adapt a story. When people say "the book was so much better" (they are usually wrong anyway), what they are really trying to say is that the book was so different.
