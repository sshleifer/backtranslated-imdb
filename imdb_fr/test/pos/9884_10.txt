Take someone you love or want to love and see this movie. <br /> <br /> It touches you in the right places. <br /> <br /> All the other commentators here have said everything. Maybe the cynics will not be impressed. <br /> <br /> They seem to love only what depresses you for days. <br /> <br /> This movie is Ga- I'm so happy that the director is not trained at USC. <br /> <br /> This validates my postulate that there is too much mediocrity and conformity to the cinema these days. <br /> <br /> This is because of the USC mentality and consanguinity. <br /> <br /> Hurray for Jeff Hare and Richard Marcus, the actors and the team. Good game!
