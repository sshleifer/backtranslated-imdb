As a long time resident of western Pennsylvania, I have an intimate knowledge of this subject and I thought it was great to be captured so authentic on film! Congratulations to the producers of this epic !!! And what a great legacy for school children for years to come. <br /> <br /> The attention to detail and the realistic description of this complex network of activities make it a unique production. <br /> <br Spectators will be fascinated by history and captivated by storytelling. <br /> <br /> Grahame Greene is wonderful as a presenter. <br /> <br /> BRAVO !!!
