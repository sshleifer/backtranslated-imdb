I saw this movie on September 1, 2005 in Indianapolis. I am one of the judges of the Heartland Film Festival, which presents films for the Truly Moving Picture Award. A truly moving image "... explores the human journey by artistically expressing hope and respect for the positive values ​​of life." This film was awarded to Heartland. <br /> <br /> It's a golf story at the beginning of the 20th century. At that time, it was the game of the upper class and wealthy "gentlemen", and the workers could only participate as caddies in country clubs. With this backdrop, this story based on a true story unfolds with a young boy from the working class who assumes the role of golf club and the world's greatest golfer, Harry Vardon. <br /> <br /> And the story is inspiring. Against all odds, Francis Ouimet (played by Shia LaBeouf of "Holes") has to face the greatest golfers of the United States and Great Britain at the American Open of 1913. Francis is poorly prepared and has a child for a caddy. (The cart is hilarious and motivating and steals every scene in which it appears.) Despite these handicaps, Francis displays courage, wit, heroism and humility at this world-class event. <br /> <br /> And we learn a lot about the first years of golf; for example, the use of small wooden sticks, the provision of short holes, the manual dashboard, golfers swaying with pipes in the mouth, the terrible conditions of the greens and fairways, and the game being not canceled even in torrential rain. <br /> <br /> This film has an exceptional cinematography and artistic direction. And without big movie stars, the story is somehow more believable. <br /> <br /> This adds to the inventory of great sports movies in the vein of "Miracle" and "Remember the Titans". <br /> <FYI - There is a Truly Moving Pictures website with a list of winners from the past 70 years.
