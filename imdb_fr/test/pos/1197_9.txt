Hair is one of my favorite movies of all time. Even though I was not part of my generation, I have watched this movie 9 times and can not get enough of the beautiful message of understanding, passion, beauty and love. This film is against the Vietnam War and shows how people should be united regardless of color, origins, religions and classes. I love the characters of Berger and Woof and I think Central Park of the 70s is one of the most beautiful places in my life. <br /> <br /> By the way, I always have this music in mind: <br /> <br /> When the moon is at the seventh house and Jupiter will line up on Mars, peace will guide the planets and love will guide the stars <br /> <br /> It is the dawn of the century of Aquarius The age of Aquarius Aquarius! Aquarius! <br /> <br /> Harmony and understanding Sympathy and confidence in abundance No more lies and decisions Golden dreams of visions Revelation of mystic crystal And the true liberation of the mind, Aquarius! Aquarius! <br /> <br /> ps: I'm surprised to see that the director of this film is the same director of AMADEUS. I love both movies!
