This 1959 serial drama immerses us in the life and passion of three young women in the publishing world as secretaries. It follows the same idea as THREE PARTS IN A FOUNTAIN a few years ago. This is happening in New York and COINS in Rome, Italy. Our three beauties are Hope Lange, in her lead role, Suzy Parker and Diane Baker. Lange is doing well and has her own background in the area, Joan Crawford. Suzy plays an obsessive woman who has trouble losing her father-in-law. It's hard to believe that anyone can reject this beauty for any reason, but Louis Jourdan, his throbbing heart, does just that. Somehow brings you back to Paul Neuman rejecting the magnificent Elizabth Taylor in CAT ON A ROOF HOT TIN, is not it? Diane Baker, the third damsel in distress, meets and goes out with Robert Evans, before he becomes the producer and husband of Ali MacGraw, for whom he is known. Hope's boyfriend at home, played by newcomer Brett Halsey, promises to marry her. She also meets Stephen Boyd, a co-worker, who is interested in our hope. The three ladies have their drama in front of them. Crawford almost steals the movie. Her presence and her usual strong bitch are fun to watch. Veteran actor Brian Aherne plays one of the bosses with a yen for pinching the back of our main lady. He is deliciously charming. Martha Hyer, also a loser in a thankless role, has never really been explored. Too bad because I like this actress who never seems to have this role to distinguish his abilities. She has a crush on a married man in the office played by Donald Harron, with whom I had the pleasure of working in two Shakespeare plays in New York. He is also a distinguished actor and wasted in this film. <br /> <br /> The set is very fun, in technicolor and cinemascope, directed by Jean Negulesco.
