This film is exceptional! As of April 8, 2007, it was available on request from the time of the show. It had been a while since I had not seen it, but it featured Thomas Jane in the lead role in which I saw him. At first, you see a normal guy who seems a little pervert, with a woman who seems to be about to follow her own path. The cut directors I just watched have an opening scene that is cool. Paulina Porizkova is dressed as a cheerleader and looks very cool and hot. While trying to buy a late-night coffee without small bills that become hastily violent, Paulina shows that her name on her jacket is the real deal. Meeting his former comrade of the road Nick played by Aaron Eckhart was cool at first, and he even lent him his wife's car to take care of his business. Then he spots the silver briefcases, and the day changes for the one who is strange and violent. There is a cast of real characters parading through the next series of scenes. But, Paulina's Dallas steals the show, I think. His story of Casey's story to the doctor who is there to get a personal interview in an application for adoption, is outrageous. As a general rule, I never thought that tall women were so sexy, but as with any rule, there are exceptions. Paulina is like we've never seen before in movies. Sexy and deadly, as in the movie with Tom Selleck, but with maliciousness never seen before. If you are looking for a movie to add to your collection, this one is worth it. Paulina naked is worth the price alone, but this story has everything we can hope for. Love, friendship, sex and violence in a great mix. When I saw it for the first time years ago, it dazzled me and I know you will feel the same way.
