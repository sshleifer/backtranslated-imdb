Everyone who worked on this film did an incredible job. Honestly, it's one of the best lesbian movies I've seen in a long time. The acting, the writing, the cinematography, the music, the visuals, everything was top. As a passionate fan of the genre (lesbian movies and gymnastics), I was incredibly delighted by this film. It really gave me a lot more than I expected. Hear the questions and answers with the actors and the team was great, the lead actress has so much positive energy and is so humble and lovable that it's a pleasure to see people who can be talented and not lose any view what is really important. And the writer did a hell of a job, as well as the staging and editing was great. Thank you very much for making a good movie! Thanks also for the sentence about "if you want to slap yourself, it would be bisexual". I'm tired of movies where characters who have a relationship with both genders are gay or heterosexual, it's wonderful to see bisexuals being recognized and part of the gay community, and that's was good that the labels were not even necessary at all in this movie. What an end! Just when I thought it could not give me more, it was. Nice work and my applause to everyone. I will spread the word, it's really a film not to be missed!
