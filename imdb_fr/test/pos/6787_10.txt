Wow! What a beautiful warm and rural film! The story focuses on Mi Taylor (Mickey Rooney), a wandering young man, whose journey takes him to a quiet, rural coastal town. There he stays with the Brown family. Velvet (Liz Taylor), their youngest daughter, who befriends Mi, is passionate about horses and wins one at auction. This horse is a beautiful brown stallion; appointed by his former owner as a "murderous pirate", but Velvet names him Pie. Shortly after, Velvet suggests to have him participate in the Grand National race. Mi and her family are against the idea, but quickly agree. Velvet and Mi begin training for the most famous horse race in England. This film is a good example of what British films are. I remember seeing this for the first time at the age of eight and during my summer vacation. My parents recorded it on TV and I warmed up instantly ?? I watch it almost every day instead of the big collection of Disney movies I owned. <br /> <br /> I think it was one of Liz Taylor's first movies and a good movie! His character is na√Øve but sweet ?? her playing is extremely convincing, especially when she describes her love for horses. It's also a good opportunity to see Angela Lansbury in one of her leading roles. who co-starred as Velvet's older sister, who spends most of her time in the movie being hit with a boy from the city! I must say that she was a beautiful woman when she was younger. Beautiful blond hair and a pink face cheeks. Although she does not play a major role in the film, she has several scenes. Do not disappoint his fans! Parents reading this, I must emphasize ?? if you can get a copy of this, do it! If you are kids like animals ?? I strongly suggest you show it to them! They may find some boring scenes, but you'll see Velvet ride the horse several times throughout the movie and entertain the kids with a big challenge! A charming and nostalgic film. I could just leave now and put it on!
