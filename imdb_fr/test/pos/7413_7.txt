Did not have much aspiration for this film, but was pleasantly surprised. A film very well done, very well cut, does not really live up to Human Traffic, but it is a very good effort. Well done and I thought that the main actor had achieved a superb performance! In fact, the only very bad performance of the film comes from Tim Curry, which is supposed to be his name. <br /> <br /> Cool Film is surprised not to have done better than it did. I had never heard of it until I saw it at a friend's house. <br /> <br /> I'm not a fanatic, but I imagine that people who love him will really like this movie.
