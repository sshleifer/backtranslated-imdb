I'm fifteen years old and I've seen thirty-three films from Sinatra (not counting the TV and documentary videos) and I was only impressed by two of them. "Until the clouds parade" and "The miracle of the bells" do not really matter, however, considering that in the first he sings only a magnificent "Ol 'Man River", and in the last he My record, my radio shows, my TV shows and my favorite movies on Sinatra change almost every day - everything takes on a different connotation at every viewing and sometimes seems like the best thing he's ever done and sometimes the worst. until the cycle comes back, but there are two incomparable things. Regarding the films, "The man with the golden arm" is at the top of this list. Anyone who knows anything about Sinatra knows he thought it was his best- he was nominated for the Oscars, it was the first serious look at drug addiction, etc., etc. The jazz score is unforgettable, Kim Novak is friendly despite a ridiculous accent, Eleanor Parker is annoying and waaaay too dramatic, the turtle like Arnold Stang is fun the fi For the first time, but more embarrassing every time, and Darren McGavin is a wonderfully gooey drug dealer, the sets are not convincing - at first glance, this looks like a particular mixed bag thrown by the great Otto Preminger with an eccentric charm. <br /> <br /> Then you arrive at Sinatra. Like everything that happens in his life - apart from music - the reports on his game are always divided in two. Directors such as Fred Zinnemann, Frank Capra, Billy Wilder, Stanley Kramer, Martin Scorsese, Peter Bogdanovich and Otto Preminger all agreed that if Sinatra had worked as hard on his films as on vocals, he would have been one of the greatest actors in the world - if not the biggest. Humphrey Bogart even said, "This guy has the most natural acting talent I've ever seen." Not bad for a man who has never taken acting lessons in his life, produces at the same time the discography that would make him "the greatest singer of the twentieth century" and performs almost all his scenes in one take. <br /> <br /> In direct contradiction to all this, are these other critics and biographies who haughtily sniff out what ugly actor was this Mr.Sinatra and the number of "bad" films he has made. The question will never be satisfied to everyone's satisfaction, because controversy was one of Sinatra's greatest strengths, and both arguments played in his hands. In any case, at that moment, in this role, Sinatra is magnificent. One critic said in the late 1950s: "Sinatra may not be the greatest actor in the world, but there is nothing more fascinating to watch." No matter what Sinatra does in a movie, it's hard to ignore. This, of course, is a "charisma", which I have only seen in a handful of other people: Orson Welles, Richard Burton, Marlon Brando, Montgomery Clift, perhaps James Cagney. There is no real definition for this and it is often difficult to know if you really appreciate a performance or if you are blown away, but it is the quality that is displayed here that makes the film. Sinatra is downright captivating, real, intense - transcending decades and thousands of paper-doll stars with quality called quality. Like it or not, it's a one-man show with a few character actors hanging out in the background. He covers every emotion with remarkable subtlety, from the sweet and solitary tenderness with Kim Novak to the terrifying shock of Frank Sinatra (Frank Sinatra!) Moaning and screaming in the agony of the "cold turkey". Sinatra was right - that's his best performance. No question. <br /> <br /> I was eight when Frank Sinatra died. I have not been there for all the years of bobby-soxers and Anchors Aweigh, Mr. Ava Gardner and From Here to Eternity, "albums with lampposts and fans of" swingin "," Kennedy, Vegas, the hogwash . Basie and Mia and Reagan and Madison Square Garden concerts in South Africa at the White House at Sands. I can not say that I love Sinatra because I heard it at Paramount or because I hear "September of My Years" autobiographically - the usual excuses. And my excuse? When I was eleven, I watched a movie called "On the Town" ...
