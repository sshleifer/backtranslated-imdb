My father The hero was my favorite movie when I was younger. This is Andr√©, a divorced french who wants to take his beautiful daughter (Katharine Heigl} on vacation, hoping to be a little closer to her, but of course, Nicole is not so easy She is angry and hurt by the fact that her father has never been there for her and decides to give her a hard time.One day at the beach, Nicole meets the beautiful Ben and make up a crazy story about him, his father, the whole island gets involved and the film turns into a hilarious and entertaining film, I'll give my father the hero 8/10
