I was surprised that "Forgiving the Franklins" did not generate more buzz at the Sundance Festival this year. There were times when the laughter at the screening I saw was so loud that you could barely hear the movie. The film has an excellent acting and a story that really leads to examine larger problems. You know little problems like religion, sex and truth. Many comedies seem to rely on the same old invented situations, many let you think: "I know they stole it in a sitcom". I really think that Jay Floyd did a fantastic job with a tight budget for this movie.
