We will never see this movie released by HBO in the near future, if at all. If someone discovers it in a video store, catch it before someone else, because I doubt it will be released again. <br /> <br /> An incredible and timely film about the first World Trade Center bombing on February 26, 1993 and how government agencies are tasked with identifying and preventing terrorists from harm and cause harm to US citizens. American goods broke down completely and let it go unintentionally. <br /> <br /> We are all scared because we all know now that the terrorists apprehended at the end of the film will not be the end. of our nightmare that resurfaced on September 11, 2001. <br /> <br /> The film shed light on everything that went wrong in 1992-1993 and allowed this first tragedy of the WTC to produce. It took us another eight years to realize that we should have learned from this first WTC attack to be more vigilant and ready to prevent the second, much more devastating, attack on the World Trade Center. I found this film more difficult to watch after the events of 9/11 and the video of the 9/11 attacks themselves. <br /> <br /> All I can say about this movie is not to watch it alone. The end itself is so powerful and prophetic that it will leave you in a state of shock knowing what we know today and perhaps in need of having someone who is with you, but do not look not the movie, to call a doctor.
