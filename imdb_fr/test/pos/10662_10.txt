The most famous film of Sergei Eisenstein has really stood the test of time. The story of a mutiny on board a warship in 1905 gives the impression of Soviet propaganda, but shows the conditions that led to the revolt. The stage on the steps of Odessa should remain engraved in everyone's mind. <br /> <br /> Okay, so "The Battleship Potemkin" was not the first film to use the editing, but they did a great job here. Of course, any film history course should show this movie. It's a great historical drama (though I admit I do not know how accurate it is). A 10/10. <br /> <br /> Oh, and we should have already learned that "Potemkin" should be transliterated to "Potyomkin".
