/ * may contain spoilers, but of course it does not matter :) * / <br /> <br /> The Potemkin Battleship is a breathtaking spectacle of mesmerizing images. The visual direction is (and has been) inspiring, the size of the film is impressive and the technique is definitely pioneering. What is truly amazing is, in my opinion, the depth and effectiveness of a film, devoid of proper literary script, sound (save the soundtrack), decent picture quality, profound self-referentialism, of a seemingly exceptional game, etc. What you get is a purely visual experience that you will remember. <br /> <br /> By the way, the old poster said: "Eisenstien had the feeling after a lot of suffering to give the heroes what they wanted, the problem is that you think that Eisenstein is on the verge of getting ready for one last final fight, then he's cheating on you, it's a bit cheap, I'd rather have seen a huge final action scene. "<br /> <br /> I have to warn you that the end is not cheap and Eisenstein was not generous to the heroes. The story was however. Potemkin really went through the squadron as shown in the movie. <br /> <br /> Finally, I would strongly recommend to see Battleship Potemkin to anyone more or less seriously interested in cinema. To see him with a movie buff, it made me talk for hours. However, if you tend to consider movies, generally accepted as "big" or "classic", as "slow" or "boring", this movie might not be for you yet. Not a lot of cheap entertainment here. <br /> <br /> For me, it's a complete 10/10.
