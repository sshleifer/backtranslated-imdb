It's a film that has left me breathless ... wanting to learn more about Afghan history and traditions. With the "evil mantra" mantra darkening the reality, it was inspiring to experience the beauty of people and their beliefs. <br /> <br /> The cast was flawless, the scenery just wonderful. The acting was top quality and the fact that the Academy neglected it (with the exception of music) is unforgivable. <br /> <br /> The scenario is wonderful and the journey is so moving. Causing an "ugly cry" from this observer. <br /> <br /> A movie to watch a second and a third time.
