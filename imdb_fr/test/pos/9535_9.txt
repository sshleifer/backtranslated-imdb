It brings back so many childhood memories. (I'm not old, I'm 19 years old) It's great. The trains, the old house, the runner fallen to the ground, the landslide really scary (well, it's at 6 years old), the drama if the children can stop the train, or will it crash ? It is a children's movie without a doubt, but it offers great safety without blood / guts / guns etc. for kids. And there is Bernard Cribbins, who is cool. 8/10
