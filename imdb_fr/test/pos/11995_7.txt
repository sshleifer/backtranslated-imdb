Seriously. If it had been Shack's first film, he would have been just as funny, silly and clumsy. Satirical comments on the course system would make it a nice late night rental. <br /> <br /> However, everyone wants to compare it to the first movie, which may not be fair. The first film is a cult classic. what could he possibly follow? Nothing. So, take this second movie alone, and it certainly has its moments. <br /> <br /> Jackie Mason is fun, doing his best to imitate Rodney-wannabe. Is he as good as Rodney? Are his lines as good? No, but he's funny. The rest of the cast falls in line as decent, but not exceptional. You will recognize the faces among the actors and you will wonder how they got where they are today. <br /> <br /> The film is predictable, but most are not in this genre? Again, this is not the best comedy you'll see, but if you like the fun of the Cannonball Run, you'll enjoy this one.
