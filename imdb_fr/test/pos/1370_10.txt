A crazy Scottish warrior race, stuck in outer space, low budget and without food, started at ten, which will help these men to pluck, with visual effects that half fear, but I have a I do not like the fact that it's weird, if I met one so I would flee, but not if I had Scottish friends, we would have sworn and avoided this fate, so in the end it was not sloppy was a DVD, I'm happy to have watched, but if they do a sequel, throw a few actors, all are not equal, some are good, some play with the game, some are wooden, and should perhaps to be stowed in, but the action made me watch all, filming, screaming, not stalling, I'll tell my friends not to be scared, and look in another year.
