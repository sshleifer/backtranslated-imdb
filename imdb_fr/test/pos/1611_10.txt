Are seaside resorts sad and sad places where they are always represented, as in movies and novels? Admittedly, this film, with the almost contemporary film "Do not Look Now", describes Venice as a particularly sordid and decadent tourist trap (for a lighter approach, see "Just Married" with Ashton Kutcher and Brittany Murphy). Having never been to Venice, I can not be sure, but it is an ideal setting for this dark but sumptuous spectacle of Luchino Visconti, one of the great stylists of world cinema. Having seen the film, I would now like to be able to read Thomas Mann's novel on which he is based (which also inspired Sir Benjamin Britten's opera). Since I do not know the story of the film and the film has little intrigue or exposure, I wonder about the obsession of Asadbach (Dirk Bogarde) for the young Tadzio. Is he homosexual? A pedophile? Or is his desire for beautiful youth more innocent? Maybe Tadzio reminds him of what he could have been and now knows he will never be. Those who complain about the slowness of this film should stick to car accidents and kung fu: after 2.5 hours, it is not very long, and it moves slowly, but hardly. The film takes advantage of the delightful music of Gustave Mahler, on which the character of Aschenbach is clearly based. Dirk Bogarde gives a moving performance and the film is honored by the presence of Silvana Mangano, one of the great beauties of Italy, as the mother of Tadzio.
