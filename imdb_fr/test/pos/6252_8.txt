Do not you just hate slashers that never seem to start? Sometimes they need a full hour of lame red herring before real action occurs. "Tourist Trap" is not like that! If you generally want to get macroces cuts ... you will get cuts as macabre! Many and constantly from beginning to end! This film contains what is probably the biggest opening sequence of the horror cinema of the 80s when a teenager, on a walk after an engine failure, is trapped in a deserted house and assaulted by a scary collection of statues of wax. Four more slaughter lambs arrive at the house and meet a crazy maniac who looks like a mix of Leatherface (from Texas Chainsaw Massacre) and one of those crazy sculptors of old wax museum films. "Tourist Trap" is an exciting horror entertainment, with authentic suspense, macabre images, extreme strangeness, morbid humor and fantastic make-up effects. The twists of the plot are not always original and the acting is rather ugly but, seriously, we do not care. The fast pace and the groovy killer icon allowed this "tourist trap" to win a place among my 5 favorite slashers. A bit surprising is the total absence of nudity. Too bad, because all the girls look pretty and after only 10 minutes, the mandatory line "Who needs a swimsuit?" is talking.
