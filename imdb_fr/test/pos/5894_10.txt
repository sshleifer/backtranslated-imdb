Blue ribbon banners, stars and stripes forever, decorated generals and unconditional surrender of enemies who demanded tons and tons of radiation, was the essence of US victory in the Second World War. World War! The celebration in Times Square, as everywhere else in the United States, suggests a national zenith !!! America is at the top right !! a thing, a painful thing and painfully perverse..The period of adjustment !! .. The celebration ended when the bottle of champagne was over..Now everybody has to live their life ... only one problem though .. .They must have new lives ... the old lives are gone forever ... The polite and pleasant smiles had a fragile facade with a long life of ice cubes in boiling water !! Each of the characters in the film is paraded by primordial doubts and is unable to pretend to be an excuse that nothing was really serious, for the simple reason that it was not true! Once the sergeants, and the generals, and their wives, daughters, sons and virtually all other Americans affected by World War II, were exposed to disabilities, nightmares and recriminations of the Second World War and to what she actually accomplished and denied, the same !! For the moment, social and moral issues had a personal interest ... Frederick March and Myrna Loy had to start all over again! Dana Andrews realized that he should never have been married to Virginia Mayo !!! Theresa Wright realizes that she is constructively selfish! In addition, the character, Homer, is about to get married and he thinks that everyone around him is as devastated by his injury as himself, essentially in the sense that they can not or do not want to get out !! <br /> <br /> If this film is so fabulous, it's because a happy ending has been reached the hard way, once everyone has recognized the new departure of the new United States and the new the world as a whole, the tragedy of the Second World War was recognized and emotional events experienced. torn were taken in stride, and treated accordingly !! Frederick March and Myrna Loy are to return to Chapter 1 of their marriage, Homer has informed his new wife of what to do to be married to him (ie she will feel like a nurse in the half of the cases) and Thresa Wright's involvement in Dana Andrews means that her entry into adulthood has resulted in partial liability for the break-up of a marriage ... This amounts to learning to drive a car to get her license to drive at the Indianapolis 500 ... The characters in the film are the typical Americans after the Second World War are deadlocked because of the brutal awakening of coercive changes in their lives ... Happiness is no longer offered to luxury of the adjective cop-aesthetics ... it is now about formidable conditions and a good victory the evil by the choice the least ugly! ... World War II did not happen !! He will now dominate the social models of American life !!! <br /> <br /> The total catastrophe of the Second World War also reflected the feelings of personal human inadequacy of most Americans !! I loved this film, as well as AFI, probably for the reason that it brought to light issues that were both taboo in an unjustified way !! .. In conclusion, see this movie !! Nightmares about fighting, dilemmas over marital unhappiness and / or readjustment, coping with your life when you're hit by a disability and simply acting human are constantly featured in movies and on television, HOWEVER !! it's 1946 !! Very new to Americans so ... DO NOT FORGET THAT !! Director William Wyler illustrated what Americans feel after the Second World War when the film industry left it with one hand tied behind the back !!! Take this into account and you will probably realize how amazing this movie was !!
