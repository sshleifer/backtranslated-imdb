I loved this film! Since I do not want to say too much about it, it's essentially a mother and a daughter and the life they have together. It's a very comforting story, between the struggles they have. I also think that Natalie and Susan have perfect chemistry throughout the movie! This is definitely worth the detour! Two inches in the air, at the top!
