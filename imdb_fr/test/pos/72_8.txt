Even a bad Julie Andrews Musical is worth watching and it's not bad! In fact it's quite funny. In fact, it's a fascinating study of how to manipulate a star's character. <br /> <br /> To break Julie's "two shoe mold," she plays a German actress, Spy / English Musical Hall. She then won her title in the film S.O.B. and play a drag queen to Victor Victoria and other not so good girls usually under the direction of her husband Blake Edward. <br /> <br /> The film is certainly problematic It is difficult to feel his character because she is a German spy. We want to love Julie but she is on the wrong side of the law. That's probably why this movie failed. Julie as a German spy? Our Mary Poppins? our Maria Van Trapp suddenly a German spy? <br /> <br /> The romance seems to happen overnight and come from nowhere. But never mind, it's a musical with Jullie. Oh, and did I already mention that Rock Hudson was inside? <br /> <br /> Julie gives a wonderful performance that any music lover should not miss. Great WW 1 Songs and nice tunes by Mancini. <br /> <br /> Yes, the film has holes in the plot and sometimes does not seem logical. For example, why did the Germans suddenly sue Julie and her uncle when she was spying on them just a minute ago? <br /> <br /> But on another note, who cares? The musical numbers are fun and exciting. The costumes and the landscapes extraordinarily sumptuous. Cinematography quite to the mark. <br /> <br /> He has boring idiotic detectives that Blake Edwards puts in all his movies. (Yawn) <br /> <br /> But Julie tried desperately to change her image. (You can imagine having dinner with Blake and Julie - Julie: "Blake, I have to change my image." <br /> <br /> Blake: "I'll make you a German spy, then we'll undress you in another film and then play a transvestite in another film.They will not recognize you.This will be the death of Maria Von Trapp "<br /> <br /> fascinating study on the change of image.Magnificent Julie. lovers of musicals, much more entertaining than Star!
