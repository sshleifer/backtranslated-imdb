Okay, so it starts off in a very unimaginative way with a narrative of the main character (Justine embodied by Laura Fraser - an extraordinary actress on her own), but it continues to become something miraculous. It contains stupid little things that you really should not find funny but do it every time. There is a particularly memorable moment when your jaw falls to the ground the first time you look at it, when Jake's body, containing Justine's feminine spirit, tries to get used to her new anatomy. I will not spoil it, but the second time I watched it was with friends. Seeing their faces was awesome. It makes you cringe, but laugh at the same time. I am also a big fan of the music used. There is a beautiful little group that appears randomly in the street or on a path from time to time, but also beautiful but unknown pop songs (often the best ones). He feels like he was written for an English cast by an American writer, which only bores me a few times. Overall, this movie is hilarious. I'm a big fan of Laura Fraser now, having received her film for my birthday, and I expect even if some of the cast members are not well known, you'll enjoy it too.
