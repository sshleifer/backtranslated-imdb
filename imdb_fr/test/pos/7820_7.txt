Marco Poloni (Costas Mandylor) was born into a family of pastry chefs in the Bronx. Although the Polonis have been well known for their confectionery over the decades, the company has had a difficult time. Meanwhile, Grace Carpenter (Lauren Holly) is one of the most talented dessert companies in Manhattan, but she does not seem to be able to occupy a prominent place in the confectionery industry because of the glass ceiling. An accidental meeting between Marco and Grace gives rise to a conversation about a possible solution for both of them. The Golden Whisk, who is preparing for the near future, wants Grace to join him. There is a big amount of "dough", haha, at stake for the winners, enough to install Grace into her own business and also save the Polonis restaurant. Reluctantly, Grace agrees. But, there are complications. Some judges and competitors may have previous problems with Grace and Marco. Then, although Marco and Grace both have a sort of attraction for each other, Grace has a very rich, long-time boyfriend. Can Marco and Grace win the contest? It's a beautiful film for the romantic in the heart. First, there is the beautiful distribution. Holly has always been a charming actress with a remarkable hoarse voice that enhances her attractions. In this film, she is perfectly chosen as Grace, determined but beautiful. Mandylor, a newcomer, also delights the rival baker with a beautiful appearance. The rest of the actors, including the wonderful Brenda Vaccaro as Marco's mother, are very kind. As a Hallmark film, costumes, sets and production facilities are irreproachable and the script always manages to appear fresh and fun, despite some familiar themes. Treat yourself to a sweet treat, lovers of romcoms, getting the viewing of this film. It's certainly the cinematic equivalent of a big box of quality chocolates.
