I really think this movie looked like Waiting to Exphale with white women in the 1950s. As in Waiting to Exphale, all the female characters mixed up with married men or not. The only difference, besides the obvious, was that there was not much humor in this movie. I would even say it was tragic. Only one of the male characters seemed to be kind and sincere (the Hope Lange guy), but despite that, there was a conflict in this relationship. <br /> <br /> The story was about three young women sharing an apartment who had hopes and dreams of success. Unfortunately for them, romance did not seem easy, even if they were young, smart and attractive. This film could be called a tearful with the saddest part involving the character of Suzy Parker whose obsession with an ex-boyfriend leads to tragedy. <br /> <br /> It's a must see.
