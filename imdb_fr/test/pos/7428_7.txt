It was the third time I tried to watch this movie. The previous two times, I found the start so sweet and "schmaltzy" sickening that I stopped watching. However, now that I'm a little older and more compulsive, I forced myself to watch the entire movie and was very surprised to see that I liked it a bit. So, I watch the movie in much the same way that I would watch swimming in the ocean when the water temperature is 70 degrees (that's about 21-22 degrees Celsius for all lovers of metrics) . Of course, the water is terribly cold and shocking at first, but if you force yourself to stay in the water, you'll get used to it - resist the urge to jump right away !! <br /> <br /> The film begins with a long exchange between Flynn and her daughter, played by a lispy Patti Brady. Some may find their conversations very cute and endearing, while others will find them a little difficult to take, because these moments are so sweet! In a way, Flynn played an incredible role, because it's hard to imagine in real life with children or a domestic actor, especially that he wanted to be true to a woman of this movie - now, C IS ACTION! NEVER SAY GOODBYE is about the divorced couple, Flynn and Parker, and their common desire to remarry. Since they both love each other, as well as their lispy child, it seems that they will tie the knot again. However, they have some serious problems: Lucille Watson (who plays her usual dominant and dominant mother-in-law), Flynn's girlfriend (after all, it's Errol Flynn and he's divorced; whatever he has a girl SOMEWHERE) and a navy (played by Forrest Tucker). <br /> <br /> As expected, all this is settled in the end and everyone lives happily ever after. However, despite its formula and predictability, the film is a winner because it is very fun to watch. Flynn, despite his reputation as an action-adventure hero, is very talented for comedy-romance and it's very amusing to watch him. In addition, the film has the scene of all times Cuddles Sakall - it is so cute and cute that it is perfect in this type of film. And, despite the sweetness, the film is rather well written. What matters is that the movie is FUN. <br /> <br /> That's why I recommend you watch this film and force yourself not to throw up in front of the deliciously sweet aspects of the film. Once you have overcome this, the rest of the movie is an image that is well worth your time.
