I am surprised at the questions and issues raised by this documentary in the magazines, especially because they are interesting questions. Those who could best tackle it would certainly be the authors of the film themselves. Nevertheless, I think I can enlighten something that, in my opinion, has been forgotten, which is, in my opinion, the purpose of the film, its subject and what it is trying to convey. What is his message after all? At the risk of emphasizing the obvious, I will begin by saying that filmmakers have an intention. They try to tell a story, extract the meaning, and convey a message. Keeping this in mind, we can take down many criticized points, especially those that imply what people expected unlike what filmmakers were really trying to show. Causes and consequences of violence? The film is not about it. It's not "a non-Brazilian audience enlightening" on the problem of Brazilian favelas? Well, who wanted to do that? Is AfroReggae so-and-so and supported by whom? It does not matter in this context. Not enough women in the movie for your tastes? It is not a question of equality or feminist cause. Every little detail about Anderson's life, his mother, son, family, and all the aspects and the workings of the AfroReggae movement? Well, do not be so difficult because it does not matter. A story can have so much length before becoming a movie. If the authors had to show everything everyone expected, they should instead create a six-month television series. If you wait for all of this, you are mistaking the film. <br /> <br /> The film actually talks about two people who started a movement. Two people full of ideals. Two people who are hungry for change. Two people are trying to do something against all the wrongdoings around them. People who had a long walk and wanted to get up. It's all about finding meaning in life, taking inspiration from misery, changing destiny and becoming something other than what they were meant for - criminals and drug traffickers. It is about success and hope and not the cruel reality of violence in Rio de Janeiro, although it is an integral part of the film as the characters are constantly surrounded. Unexpectedly and not without reason, the film ends up being more centered on Anderson's journey through the difficulties of life. That's because they were confronted with Anderson's accident while shooting the film. I'm not sure, but they may have even seriously considered stopping the shoot, leaving behind all the effort. But Anderson wanted to continue. And that's what they did, running the risk of losing a film with an identity crisis, given the sudden change of course, but winning to show that someone was overcoming such a devastating event. It is very obvious to those who watch it that the film starts on AfroReggae and turns to Anderson. It is very unique in this sense (the shift of the history line). Perhaps their only sin is not to make it obvious from the start, which could create expectations that will not be met. <br /> <br /> As for the importance or the banality of Anderson, I would say that everyone does not want to change the whole world. , put an end to all violence, feed all those who are hungry, be like Mahatma Ghandi, be as well known as Mother Teresa or any other known personality who exists. It's much easier to identify with and get inspired by someone who tries, like everyone else, to transform their own tough lives, raise problem children, deal with injuries or permanent illnesses and even paying bills at the source. end of the month. To understand the film, one must understand that it is a question of leaving behind a past of drug addiction and crime, of compensating for that and of trying to persuade others not to follow the same embarrassing path. Even if you can criticize the effectiveness of the chosen method and doubt the ideology of the method, you can not deny their intentions. <br /> <br /> In addition, the perception that Anderson is special or chosen might have this in part because filmmakers have become very involved in the lives of the characters they describe. As much as becoming friends with them. It is impossible that the whole movie is not better lit up on Anderson. If a dear friend becomes paralyzed in an accident, it is not a fact, you make a big deal. And it's not necessarily bad. It is not much that they treat him as "an elect" as much as they try to show him as a seed for transformation and a source of inspiration. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, do not look at this documentary for the scenes of the reality of poverty and the crime it contains, look at it for what it is more: an inspiring story. <br /> <br /> Like Nike-Ad-like? This seems to me quite well and professionally done and it does not affect or alter the intentions of the film. Romantic? Speculate on his references as a documentary if you want, but why not when he is supposed to provoke a reaction and inspire? Do not try to improve people's lives through music and dance - the essence of what people are trying to do - romance their own reality? Excuse me, but the reporters make simple reports and you can watch them on TV every night. <br /> <br /> If I wanted to become a filmmaker, I would like my first film to be so fantastic.
