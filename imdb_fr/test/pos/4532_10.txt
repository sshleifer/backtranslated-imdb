This film may not have seemed like much to some people, but it had everything I was looking for in a comedy. succumb to fun moments accompanied by some really moving scenes, great actors and pretty much everything a good movie is supposed to be. Although David Spade plays his usual snobbish character, he made this role an unusual performance that I do not think he had ever gone through until he went to the movies with Joe dirt. It does not matter if some people are not fans of Chris Farley or not, I saw this movie when it came out and my friends and I are still talking about it ... 11 years later. It was this movie that finally revealed to me that Chris Farley was the real deal. he is the best comedian I've seen in my life. in the words of some, he could be clumsy, intelligent, funny, serious, crazy, sober and moving or depressing at the same time. not the same words but the message is all that matters. one of the true great actors of our time and one of the true great comedies of all time. with good actors, a good story, hilarious moments, serious scenes that sometimes made me cry. this film stands at the top of the hordes as a film that marked the beginning of a brief reign at the top of the world of comedy by the late great Chris Farley. no actor before or since has captured my interests for a film since. because no actor has invested so much in his films before or since. this film is worth it, if you have not taken the time to see it, do it at the next rental of a movie.
