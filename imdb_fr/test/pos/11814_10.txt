When the film "The Cure" begins, we discover a young man named Erik (Brad Renfro). Erik is a teenager who lives with his paranoid mother. His neighbor is Dexter (Joseph Mazello). One day, Erik and Dexter connect and head for the supermarket, where Dexter first tastes Butterfinger. When Erik discovers that Dexter has AIDS, he tries tea with water and leaves to improve it. But when on the cover of The National Enquirer indicates that a doctor in New Orleans has found the cure for AIDS, the two boys will stop at nothing to get to New Orleans. <br /> In my opinion, "The Cure" is easily one of the best friend films ever made. This shows the unconditional love between a boy, his best friend and the mother of his best friend. Everything is so well done that nothing needs to be changed. Not only do I give him a 10/10 to be a fantastic friendship movie, but it's also a sad AIDS movie, but fun and fun. And the tragic finale with Dexter's contraction of AIDS is enough to make me shed a tear. Very well done.
