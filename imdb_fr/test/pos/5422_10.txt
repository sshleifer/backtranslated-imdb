I only saw it once - in 1986, in an "artistic" theater in Minneapolis ... but I remember it as if I had seen it a thousand times this morning. Hilarious ("Sawing for Teens", playing Scrabble with all the tiles "e"), beautifully animated (removing his eyes, putting them back in position and then putting them back) and poignant (the end of the world, the pettiness of a snit ) ... <br /> <br /> Observation required for the human race. To call it simply as a cartoon is to call THE GREAT GATSBY by typing.
