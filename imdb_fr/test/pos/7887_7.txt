Unusual movie about a man who befriends his social opponent for fear of blackmail. Peter Boyle makes this film with his coarse and rude portrayal of a hard-working "Joe" of the working class, in love with the past, fearful of the future and worried about the present. The first half-hour of the show features young Susan Sarrandon's film debut as Melissa Compton, a rich and willing girl who lives in a slum with her losing boyfriend, full of an entirely naked scene. His boyfriend is the weak point of the movie, a drug addict and poorly portrayed dealer who faces his death following the overdose of Sarrandon. In a bar, we meet Boyle's Joe in a bar as he screams about minorities, crime, hippies and drugs, and it's easy to see that the last character on Archie's Norman Lear television Bunker is based on a clean version of Joe. The comparison is even about Joe's wife, personal life and hobbies. Joe creeps into the life of Bill Compton, Melissa's father, and the two form an unlikely couple as they search for Melissa who escaped from drug treatment and returned to addicts she calls friends . Their research leads them to a "greed", as Joe calls it, a free love party fueled by drugs and a lot of nudity and, surprisingly, Bill Compton and Ultra Conservative Joe join the scene. They are robbed and this leads to a violent and murderous end that prefigures the brutal and chilling end of Taxi Driver six years later. Joe is a funny movie that, at least in appearance, is anti-violence and anti-racist. Yet the main character of the film, Joe, becomes the very instrument of the upheaval he fears when he enters the illegal and unbridled sexual excesses against which he struggles. So, in this respect, the movie is not a powerful message and lets you ask what was the end result.
