The weakness of this comes from the confusing narration, intrigues often coming from nowhere. But that did not matter because I still liked it. Once you have accepted that this movie is not taken too seriously, you will enjoy it even more. It's basically a love story, confusing at first, but evolving, it's really something that's worth it. Of course, this has already been done many times before, but the complicated version of this document is quite inspiring and touching. <br /> <br /> The fantasy and the cgi that reigned were impressive at first, but I still appreciated his goal. And people stop complaining about the way they borrowed other movies! Guess what we know !! And that does not really matter because its purpose was to amuse and entertain. Sometimes people have to stop being so critical and think for a moment before they start barking. To compare that to Hollywood standards is totally stupid and ignorant. It's a totally different style and audience. As far as I am concerned, some of the best films I have ever enjoyed are those of Oriental producers and directors. There is your police history 4, shaolin football, kung-fu hustle, dragon tiger door, legendary fist, hero, squatting tiger, etc. I will always be interested in these types of films. Now try to judge my perception, but I warn you that I see things from the point of view of these 5 countries in which I lived. So you'd better be as experienced and open-minded.
