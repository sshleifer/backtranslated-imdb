The only sequence of Zeppelin that I saw before this DVD is that of the movie 'The song remains the same' of 1976. We spent hours watching a house of friends, but I had never really liked it and I hated the fantastic sequences. .. <br /> <br /> What about this DVD? I did not know it existed before looking for the Physical Graffiti CD ... "When did this come out?" I thought that <br /> <br /> For some reason I thought Page was not a great guitarist, but to say that watching this DVD changed my opinion is a huge understatement. <br /> <br /> There is "White Summer" from 1970 - 10 minutes of guitar magic. <br /> <br /> There is an acoustic set of 1975 - "Bron-y-aur Stomp" has a brilliant finger - selection of an improvisation section. <br /> <br /> 'In my Time of Dying' and 'Trampled Underfoot' (also 75) are breathtaking - with Page and Bonham tearing things apart as no one has ever done. Demonic possessions of rawk !! <br /> <br /> The magic continues in the Knebworth section 1979. The return of 'Achillies Last Stand', given their various drug addiction states, only defies belief! A song composed of several complex guitar overdubs, Page arranged it to allow him to "punk it out" live - the effect is totally hypnotic. 'In the Evening' - I never liked it on record, but it goes quickly. 'Sick Again' - an excellent piece of sleaze-rock. The images of Knebworth are very interesting, cutting with great success between big screen, rosaries and illegal images. <br /> <br /> The factory is breathtaking throughout the performances. Page, in spite of his painful thinness, looks like a six-year-old who enjoys most of his life at the Knebworth concert - and makes watching contagious. <br /> <br /> One thing that left me puzzled - the 'black dog' The performance of 1973 seems very 'camped' !! Robert Plant still adored a little "chopping" and these jeans are absolutely ridiculous - and would justify an arrest nowadays.All very different from the muscular studio version of kick-a-$$$. <br /> <br /> I like this DVD.This reminded me how much Zeppelin was good and stays.
