It's one of the best films I've seen in the era of silence (sad to say, I have not seen many movies yet except Chaplin / Keaton). Very visually brilliant, with an incredibly influential style in editing and composition. Really unique (especially for his time) camera angles and extremely hectic editing. Must see for the movie buff. <br /> <br /> The disadvantage is that it is a little too distorted by its politics (I have no problem with politics in the film, as long as it is subtle or less ignorable as a seat back of the story). Also, it's not an "entertainment" movie, which is fine, but it's not something I'm going to watch a billion times. It's a clear and simple art, like it or not. <br /> <br /> Worth an A + for influence alone, but based on personal pleasure, I give it an A-.
