Many Americans are lazy, and this has manifested itself even in our DVD viewing. Many of us do not like to take the time to read an hour and a half (or more) of subtitles. So we chose not to see a lot of foreign films. A film that is TOTALLY worth your time, no matter how serious the task you might take during the reading of the subtitles, is "The Green Butchers". It is by far the best foreign film I have ever seen and is also superior to many American films I have seen recently. It is a complex situation told in a remarkably simple and amusing dialogue. The depth of the characters obtained in this film is incredible. The way Svend and Eigel (sorry if these are misspelled) feed on contrasting characters is downright spectacular! The actors were well set up, and I really hope that a sequel is envisaged ... he needs very little Bjorne and what his face has to offer ... just give me Svend and Eigel for a kind of trip with support characters and more amazing dialogue! To the author of this beautiful scenario, I say: write more! The story itself is rather twisted, but you'll find yourself attacking the villain anyway ... without any remorse. PLEASE check this movie!
