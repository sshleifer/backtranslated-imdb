The violent death of Fernando Ramos Da Silva, only eight years after the completion of this film, only reinforces the poignancy of the powerful message of the dierector BAbenco. The film is divided into two halves - the first in a reformatory where a group of young people are abused and raped by violent law enforcement and guards. The second backdrop is the city where they are confined because of their own actions and their own morality, which includes acts of sexual assault, procuring and murder of various characters who enter their lives. for constant changes in characters when interacting with other people. The character of Lalica, a transvestite who is the mother and the love of some of the children, is particularly interesting. Her reaction to the arrival of Sueli, a prostitute is both poignant and tragic. <br /> <br /> There is no happy ending to this story and I recommend you watch it carefully because there are some very uncomfortable scenes to watch, especially in the first twenty minutes. But while watching, it's important to remember that it's not just a fictional tale. The actors are not trained professionals, but selected boys in the streets of Sao Paulo. They actually lived this life so vividly depicted on screen and, in the case of da Silva, died in the hands of the police, described so brutally. A documentary? A piece of fiction. It is close to both, but it is certainly a heart-wrenching material. It's a movie that leaves you breathless and thinks long after watching it. <br /> <br /> 10/10
