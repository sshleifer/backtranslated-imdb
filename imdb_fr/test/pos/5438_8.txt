This movie was really different from what I had imagined but nevertheless exceeded my expectations. This film has the exact mix of comedy, drama, political criticism and satire (not necessarily in that order). Without being condescending or wisenheimer, it reveals the open and subtle problems of our high-tech democratic capitalist society. It makes you laugh instantly and stays in your thoughts afterwards. For those of you who like "wag the dog" and wish to have both male and female politicians, this movie should definitely be the choice! <br /> <br /> "Politicians are very similar to layers: they must be changed frequently the same reasons."
