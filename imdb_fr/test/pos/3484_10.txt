This movie was so real. In fact, I have felt all the emotions described here in my life at different times - that of Rory and Michael. I have Duchene muscular dystrophy like Rory, so what you see here is exactly what I myself felt. Some people will not believe that there are people with disabilities like Rory, full of anger and rebellion. I know they exist because I am one of them. <br /> <br /> The story is fantastic. For a character-driven drama, the story moves quickly. I never got bored, maybe partly because I saw things that are close to my heart. But I think most people, with intelligence, will be glued to the screen and will care about the characters. The game is phenomenal! James McAvoy is perfect as Rory O'Shea, who suffers from Duchene muscular dystrophy. Steven Robertson deserves an award for his interpretation of Michael Connolly, who has cerebral palsy. <br /> <br /> Michael's love is not made by a girl and Rory helps her cope with the problem. I have felt this many times and the question is "does not she love me because I'm just not that one or because my disability has rejected her?" Whatever the girl says, we will always be skeptical of the truth. It's natural and it hurts anyway. <br /> <br /> Some passages make me cry a little because it's sad and I have to face the problems myself. People without disabilities who are terminally ill can not understand how they can feel. It's a must-see movie for everyone. People with disabilities are everywhere and greatly misunderstood. This film brings a little light to certain facts of life, which are so taken for granted by valid people. We want to be like you, live on our own terms, go out, get drunk, be loved. Outside, we can not do much but inside, we dance!
