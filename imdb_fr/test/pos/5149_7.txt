Roy Andersson has managed to craft something that defies almost every convention of what a film should be, a work of art that is beautiful, funny and evocative at the same time. The end result is an emotional story, albeit somewhat fragmented, about humanity in its simplest and most honest forms. <br /> <br /> This will probably not please everyone. In fact, humor is so well tuned that many get on its wavelength. Almost absurd times, awkward silences, and coherent medium shots will certainly discourage the most eager audiences. But it is within these incoherent narratives and unconventional thinking that Andersson shapes a world in which each character seems to occupy the front of the stage in an absurd way. Each scene is absorbed by the desolate environments, the characters seeming to be alone in their own oddness. It is a difficult piece to watch from time to time, especially because, like many of her scenes, she requires patience. But if some can greet him on an artistic throne, others will simply look in confusion. It's a film that mixes sober humor and own heart
