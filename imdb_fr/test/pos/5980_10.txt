Larisa Shepitko's THE ASCENT (1976) is an extraordinary and exhausting tale of the fight of the Nazis in Belarus occupied by Germany. The Ascent reflects the Russian obsession with the horrors of the Great Patriotic War, but is exceptionally steeped in religious symbolism and ready to acknowledge the existence of at least that great Russian collaborator. The real battle does not concern the Nazis, who play basically in the background as mere extras, but between the Russian Nazi investigator and Sotnikov, the captured partisan who finds the spiritual strength that allows him to die without being beaten. . With its many references to crucifixion, the story takes on heroic proportions glorifying the sufferings of martyrdom and its influence on future generations. A remarkable job.
