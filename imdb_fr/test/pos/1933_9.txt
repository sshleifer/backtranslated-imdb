1931 also featured "an American tragedy", the original narrative of "who will he engage with, poor girl or rich girl". it was a really entertaining film. Babs Stanwyck was as pretty as she could be, ditto sally blane. Monroe Owley played the memory of Babs' husband in an unforgettable way. I had never heard of him, but I thought he had a good physical resemblance to Bing Crosby's "The Big Broadcast" ('32), even with a receding spine and winged ears. Ricardo Cortez, the rich playboy with a heart of gold. a true pioneer of the cinema which returns well. the dilemma is solved at the end, at the title lines and I believe Annette Hanshaw had the recording to hit, although the off-screen voice went very well. I also enjoyed the scenes of the dance hall. I am sure they were genuine; the group, one of the best of its time was superb. good job, Lionel Barrymore !!!!
