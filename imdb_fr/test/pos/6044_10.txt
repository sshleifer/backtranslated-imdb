I took part in a training camp at MCRD Parris Island in 1953 and this film is an almost equally accurate description of what the boots experienced at that time, even by burying that sand chip. Many of the "actors" in the film were Marines in active service. This film is perhaps more fun for the Marines than others, but I feel that the film itself is very well done and that Jack Webb has achieved a "good DI". Semper Fi!
