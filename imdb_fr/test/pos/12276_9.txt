Excellent little movie that was aired some time ago on SBS here at Aus. Get a copy if you can - probably just for a few viewing, because you'll remember the script - and it's the twists and turns that make this movie so funny. Well-done and intriguingly scripted, it shows how low-budget shorts can be good.
