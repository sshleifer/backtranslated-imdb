The music is from Stravinsky (and not from Philip Glass, stupid incompetent) and was written ten years before the unfortunate birth of Glass. The staging is simply extraordinary. The narrative in Japanese adds a threatening quality and intensity that the Latin version does not have. cf. The version of Terzieff. The heads and giant hands are totally justified by the mythical aspect of the tale. The accessories and makeup used for the plague are simply on the spot. This is Taymor's best work. The singers are very good, especially Terfel. Langridge is very moving and clean, and Norman finds the right expression. Its beauty is here magnified and finds its rightful place: larger than life. Simply a must.
