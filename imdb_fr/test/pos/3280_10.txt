I think Mario Van Peebles' film, Posse, is a very important film. This is a great starting point for a movie about a story that many ignore. This story tells the story of the first black settlers, cowboys and infantry returning from the Spanish-American war with a gold cache. The main character, Peebles, is haunted by memories of his murdered father. The racism applied to new black settlers and infantrymen is explored in this film with an excellent cast like Melvin Van Peebles (father of Marios), Billy Zane, Stephen Baldwin and a superb performance of Big Daddy Kane. <br /> <br /> We feel that Peeples has tried to use the largest possible number of remarkable black actors (and some less remarkable - smiling) :) Perhaps too much, some personalities (Issac Hayes, Pamela Grier) in cameo, others briefly such as Tone Loc. The feeling and efforts of Peebles' efforts to expose these actors will be understood by some. The big distribution (a feat for any director) works well and tells the story in the classic western "revenge and fight against justice". <br /> <br /> The remarkable role of the veteran in the story is remarkable. actor Woody Strode (from Once Upon A Time In The West), whose own life was a barrier, in the context of an earlier era not yet over, faded out of memory. No other actor could have played this role better. Read here the mini biography on Woody Strode: http://imdb.com/name/nm0834754/bio <br /> <br /> The film manages to balance the action with a bit of sardonic humor. The dialogue was excellent but a bit contemporary! And as others have mentioned, blasphemy was not accurate at this time. The sex scene was a bit heavy - not really necessary. There are some historical inaccuracies such as the apparent electronic brand of livestock, etc. But Posse is a good effort to open the door to more historical and creative works that reflect other new stories and events. The actual pictures of real cowboys at the end credits were very pleasant to the touch.
