<br /> <br /> After reading the report of the unemployed critic, I went to a projection of "Radio" not knowing what to expect. Fortunately, the unemployed critic now appears, in any case, for a frustrated film director / critic. His criticism is hard and totally unjustified! <br /> <br /> It's a movie that will make you laugh, make you cry and give you a break at the end! <br /> <To paraphrase a phrase of actor Ed Harris in the final scene of the Barbershop "... and all the time we thought we were teaching on the radio, the truth is ... He was teaching us. all the time, as we want to treat each other from time to time! "<br /> <br /> Yes, the film pulls on the heart. Yes, it's emotionally manipulative and yes Cuba Gooding Jr. (during an Oscar-worthy performance) is sometimes a little exaggerated (see the Christmas Day dance scene) but you know what? SO WHAT! From time to time, we must remind the American community what tolerance can do for our great country. We must remember how we CAN be. <br /> <br /> It's a solid casting. I was particularly pleased to see S. Epatha Merkerson, who represents Radio's mother, doing something outside of Law and Order. I always wondered if Mrs. Merkerson was a good actor or if it was the quality of the writing delivered by a major player in Law and Order. After watching this movie, it is easy to see that she is indeed a very good actor. <br /> <br /> Alfre Woodard, in the role of director Debra Winger, is also in the game. recurring role of coach Jones' wife and Chris Mulkey as protagonist, Frank Clay. <br /> <br /> We can not ignore the performance of Ed Harris as coach Harold Jones. After reflecting on this film and having grown up in the Great South, it is difficult to really appreciate Mr. Harris and his contribution to this film. As coach Jones, Ed offers a calm and solid performance, that of a man on a mission. Coach Harris will not let the city or circumstances distract him from what he knows with all his heart, it's the right thing to do. <br /> <br /> If you see this movie, be sure to watch the ending credits. You'll be thrilled by James Robert's real "Radio" Kennedy, now in his 50s, still leading the T.L. Hanna football team goes out into the field every Friday night. <br /> <br /> One last note. If you were a teenager between the middle and late 70s, this film is worth the price of admission, just for the soundtrack!
