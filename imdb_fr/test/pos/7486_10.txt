This film is excellent. Not because he does something special or new, but because he is always great in all its parts. No part stands out as "revolutionary" or "stellar", but all parts are well above mediocre, making it an excellent film for me. <br /> <br /> I own several copies of this film, and can get it on DVD or Blu-Ray collectors, one day (because of the high prices of Blu-ray, and of course the face I do not have a Blu-ray player ... but that's next to the point of this review). <br /> <br /> It looks like a kind of ordinary, but quickly turns into a drama filled with tension, action, heavily portrayed characters, and a well thought-out plot that keeps you interested up the Very fine. <br /> <br /> Wait, no, it does not start normally. <br /> <br /> It starts a little like a Qun. Tar. the movie WISHES it to be. With a great scene where an attempt to buy coffee and donuts goes ... very, very badly. <br /> <br /> At the end of the movie, nothing was as it seemed, and some people died, and some people are very rich. I will not tell you who ... look and enjoy! Overall Rating: 10/10, A **, Excellent!
