"Only the Valiant" is considered a good western western. This cavalry of Gregory Peck against the Indians is a solemn mission of suicide without trace of humor. Veteran director Gordon Douglas led an epic outdoor epic with an ideal cast of tough guys under considerable pressure. even Lon Chaney, Jr., superbly fits as a powerful Arab soldier. Apparently, screenwriter Edmund H. North and screenwriter Harry Brown's "A Place in the Sun" drew their screenplay from Western director Charles Marquis Warren's novel about a group of sunk riders cut off from any issue to prevent deadly skins from launching a devastating raid against defenseless white settlers. North and Brown stick to Warren's novel for the most part and to last-minute revelation - when it seems like there is no way for our heroes to survive a new onslaught of Native Americans, that's a butcher! This turn-of-the-century tale develops an effective claustrophobic feeling in the second half of the action. Douglas and his company take studio-related sets and make them compelling during the night hours. The black-and-white photography of Lionel Linden, director of photography for "Going My Way", gives this Western a sinister look that accentuates its tension and atmosphere. Actor Michael Ansara, who later played the chief villain in "Guns of the Magnificent Seven", is extremely effective in a small role as a hated Indian leader Tucsos. <br /> <br /> "Only the Valiant" voice narration by Army Scout, Joe Harmony. "This is my favorite place, I am a scout for the army, my work has been entrusted to me for a long time, and behind this pass is the entire Pache nation." (There is a graph of the territory with the Flinthead Mountains stretched across the screen with a bottleneck.) It was a city teeming with the passage, killing everything, then we built a Fort - Invincible Fort. Like a cork in a bottle, it was fine for a while, but the 'Paches are pretty clever One day the bottle blew up the cork plum.' We are shown the remains on fire Invincible fort with a dead man pinned to a palisade wall and a spear coming out of his belly. Captain Richard Lance (Gregory Peck of "12 O'Clock High") and his men enter on horseback and capture Tucsos (Michael Ansara), and Joe Harmony (Jeff Corey of "True Grit") wants to kill him on the spot. Harmony points out that Tucsos is "the guy who started this business". Captain Lance intervenes, "The army does not shoot at the prisoners, Joe." Predictably, Harmony is appalled by this prospect. "He's not an ordinary injun, he's as close to a god as a guy can have, and if you shoot him right now, things will calm down." Without Tucsos, other Indians will become reasonable, as fast as they are. They will take it, you will take it alive, you will have each Pache of the territory that will follow it, we have had three years of it, you can stop it now. "In an equally predictable way, Captain Lance refuses to kill Tucsos and Lance's decision to take the Indian back puts things into action. <br /> <br /> Colonel Drum (Herbert Heyes of "Union Station") surprises Lance when he tells him he should have shot at Tucsos. As things stand, they have to send Tucsos to another job. Everyone, from Joe Harmony's soldiers, knows that taking Tucsos to Fort Grant is like asking to die. The Apaches are balanced in the mountains and the fort is under the force. In the meantime, we meet Captain Eversham's daughter, Cathy Eversham (Barbara Payton of "Kiss Tomorrow Goodbye"), and young Lieutenant William Holloway (Gig Young from "They're pulling horses, are not they?") And play participate in a major narrative complication. You see, Lance and Holloway both want to marry Cathy. Clearly, Cathy wants Lance. Colonel Drum refuses to let Lance take Tucsos to Fort Grant because Drum can not spare Lance. Drum changes orders and Holloway is given the mission at the last minute, and everyone is shocked. Lance never changed order. In addition, Lance has seen Cathy and Holloway kiss each other in public and everyone thinks that Lance has reassigned Holloway out of jealousy. Indeed, an officer observes that rewriting orders is a possible rewrite of the Bible. Predictably, Tucsos escapes and the surviving soldiers and Harmony bring back a dead Holloway. <br /> <br /> Although Drum is expecting a relief column of 400 soldiers, Harmony reports to Lance that Tucsos will attack. Tucsos saw the fort and knows their lack of strength. Lance asks to take 6 or 7 men of his choice to be part of the invincible fort and to prevent the Tucsos from constituting a war party. The bottleneck in the mountains prevents the Indians from surviving. instead, they must go one by one. Lance believes that his men can thwart them until the arrival of the relief column. Drum gives him permission and Lance chooses the worst men. All hate him and would kill him willingly. <br /> <br /> "Only the valiant" illustrates the new breed of military western after the second world war. This is not a western gung-ho John Ford cavalry. Indeed, Lance's own men want to kill him, which suggests the attitude of the troops during the Vietnam War, when they tore their own officers. Lance is in charge of all but the few who know the circumstances that led to the Holloway change of orders. Black and white photography reinforces the disastrous nature of this western. "Only the Valiant" is a last fight in the west until last minute reprieve. Apparently, Peck hated this movie, but it's not a western western spit and varnish in Technicolor. On the contrary, "Only the Valiant" lives up to its Warner Brothers origins. It is small but important and it is dirty, with many dramas and bad characters, practically a western "Dirty Dozen".
