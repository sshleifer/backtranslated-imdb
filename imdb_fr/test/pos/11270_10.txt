Thank you my God for the internet movie database !!! When I first got this film, I watched it every night just before going to bed and I shot something different each time. But no matter how I cut it, it bothered me. The black and white and all the contractions really scared me. You look at the uncertain screen of what you are looking at, and just when you think you have it, it becomes clear and it's something completely different. The pictures are VERY disturbing, the apparent contractions and the straight razors do not match me in all the films. Always whenever I looked at it, I interpreted it a little differently (there is no dialogue, you know), so I decided to consult IMdB for the summary of the plot. Boy who throws me a loop, I did not know it was supposed to be God. Now, I'll look at this with that in mind and see what happens ....
