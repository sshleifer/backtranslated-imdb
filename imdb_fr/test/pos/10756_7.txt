Admittedly, Harold Lloyd's best work ended with his last big silent comedy "Speedy" in 1928. After that, he started soundtracks (like Chaplin and Keaton and Laurel & Hardy and WC Fields) and did better than Keaton. but not as good as the other three. Chaplin was rich enough to make his own films as a producer (but he made sure his films were punctuated, so there were five years between two productions). Laurel & Hardy being under the protection of Hal Roach, the production standards of their shorts and their sound movies were pretty good. Fields first worked with Mack Sennett, then with Paramount, and then freely. Lloyd tried the path taken by Chaplin, but with less success. <br /> <br /> He produced his own movies, but unlike Chaplin, he did not own his own studio. In addition, his first two choices were not good (especially "Feet First"). But he began to choose wisely and "Movie Crazy", "The Cat's-Paw" and "The Milky Way" were all good choices. These three (and perhaps "Harold Diddlebock's sin") were his best sonic adventures. They are all entertaining, but none are up to "Safety Last", "The Freshman", "The Kid Brother" or "Speedy". <br /> <br /> Of the four most controversial sound films, "The cat's paw" is the most controversial. Ezekiel Cobb's solution to rid the city that elected him mayor is very extreme for the likes of 2005. Or is it really? When a film is shot, its policy is dictated: "The Cat's Paw" dates from 1934. This second year of the New Deal Roosevelt (itself rather controversial for greater government involvement), the public has seen such films as "Gabriel over the White House" and "The Phantom President", where our leaders took extra-constitutional measures to rid the nation of its internal enemies (and to impose disarmament around the world). Even Cecil B. De Mille had this act with "This Day and Age", where a bunch of teenagers use rats to force a gangster to confess his crimes. <br /> <br /> For us, the use of violence forces anyone (even a group of morons and brave like Alan Dinehart's gang) to confess that it's repulsive. After all, the Supreme Court has protected us from confessions under duress. What we forget is that the reforms we are thinking of only happened when Warren Court and Burger Court adopted them. For example, although Sutherland J.'s opinion in the Powell ("Scottsboro Boys") case of 1932 ensured that every accused had a right to counsel, Gideon c. Wainwright did not extend this to the order for the accused's lawyers until 1962. The Miranda case, with its well-known anti-self-incrimination warning, dates back to 1963. No such thing was tried. necessary in 1934. <br /> <br /> If you study other films from the period up to 1954 (and even 1960), tricks are used to obtain confessions - Kirk Douglas confesses his crimes in front of witnesses in "I Walk Alone" while Burt Lancaster holds him a rifle. When Lancaster leaves, Douglas chuckles about confessing under duress, only to see the gun is unloaded. Suddenly, he realizes that (legally - in 1948) he confessed unconstrained. I hate to tell any civil liberties advocates who read this note, but what Cobb / Lloyd did to Dinehart and his friends in the conclusion of "The cat's paw" was not only legal but would have led to their Prison sentences in 1934. We may call it heavy hands, fascist or horrible, but it would have worked legally when it was imagined.
