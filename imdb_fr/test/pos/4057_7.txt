It's Showtime! Showtime is simply a breakthrough in the career of Eddie Murphy and Robert DeNiro. It is an entertaining film and a guilty pleasure, but not quite up to the standards of the actors, especially that of Robert. Showtime, directed by Tom Dey, presents some roles of William Shatner and Mos Def. <br /> <br /> Showtime talks about two very different policemen, Mitch Preston (DeNiro) and Trey Sellars (Murphy). One takes his work seriously in a discreet and discreet way, while the other is easier to live with and wants to have more pleasure than criminals in his back seat. They are both after the same criminals behind a huge collection of TVs, VCRs, and so on. They then cross each other and a television channel wants a new reality show to fight crime while on television. Mitch hates advertising while Trey loves it with his phrase "It's Showtime!" Their antics and methods are broadcast on television and this is the new show "Cops". The pleasure begins. <br /> <br /> Overall, Showtime is a fun action comedy. A good film but not quite up to the expectations and standards of the actors. However, he rolls and smashes and parodies reality shows. A good break from shows like Cops. Really in the end, just a guilty pleasure. <br /> <br /> My rating: 7/10 <br /> <br /> Eliason A.
