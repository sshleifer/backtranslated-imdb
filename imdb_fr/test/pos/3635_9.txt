In Nordestina, a village in the middle of nowhere in Pernambuco, Antônio (Gustavo Falcão) is the youngest son of his mother, who had been crying continuously for five years. When he is young, he falls in love with Karina (Mariana Ximenes), a 17-year-old girl who dreams of seeing the world and becomes an actress. Antônio promises to Karina to bring the world to Nordestina. Once in Rio de Janeiro, he participates in a sensational TV show and promises to travel in the next 50 years or to die of love with a deadly machine he invented. Fifty years later, Antônio (Paulo Autran) tries to repair what is wrong with his trip. <br /> <br /> "A Máquina" is one of the best Brazilian films I have seen recently. The refreshing and original story is a fable of poetic and magical love that will certainly delight the most skeptical and hard-nosed viewer, in a unique romance. The management is excellent. the scenario is great; cinematography and colors are beautiful; the distribution directed by Gustavo Falcão, the icon Paulo Autran and Mariana Ximenes is fantastic, with marvelous lines; The soundtrack contains some beautiful Brazilian songs starring Geraldo Azevedo and Rento Rocha's "Dia Branco". If this film is distributed abroad, rent it or buy it because I'm sure you'll love the story that makes you cry. My vote is new. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "A washing machine 'Combustível é o Amor' (" The machine? The fuel is love ")
