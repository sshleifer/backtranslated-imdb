I loved this film. My daughter is 3 years and a half and a peasant girl in the heart. There are no movies for young children. I loved this one because the worst thing about it was when one of the boys said "stupid". I congratulate them for being out and making a real family film. I rented it the first time we saw it and I am looking to buy to add it to our collection. My daughter can not stop talking about it. It goes with our lifestyle. We live in East Texas. I hope to see more family movies like this one. She even named one of our calves "Hokey Pokey Keen" !!! I can not say enough about this movie. I'm expecting a lot of other movies like this one.
