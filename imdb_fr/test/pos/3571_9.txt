"Bluff" has been airing for a few months in cinemas in Bogot√° and today I finally have time to see it. I did not know what to expect, but I was very pleasantly surprised. It is a police comedy of the same kind as Snatch, etc., which manages to balance the elements of suspense with comedy. The style of the film is established very early with a playful music and the Argentine narrator who passes directly in front of the camera - strange the first time, but then adapting naturally. <br /> <br /> With my mediocre Spanish, I always found the plot and the dialogue quite easy to follow, and the comedy is largely related to the situation. My Colombian girlfriend made fun of the different representations of people from different regions and social classes who passed me a little, but for example, a well-played representation of a pompous idiot in a position of power is fun in all languages. I think that the merit of this film is to have a global flavor: I was not often reminded that it was Colombia that I was watching. However, it is important to note that many wealthy Bogotanos live like some of the characters in this film and that this is by no means a misrepresentation of Bogota or Colombian society, but simply a portrait * selective * - as in any movie. so-called "real" situation / culture. <br /> <br /> I do not know how much of the comedy would be lost in subtitles, but if it concerns your country, go ahead, take a look at it: it's a very smooth film and enjoyable with excellent elements of black humor. And all this in 90 minutes well packaged.
