It was a very good episode. Although neither "trapped in the closet" nor "Cartoon Wars", there was a lot to do. The character of Al Gore and this "super grain" thing weird like hell were damn funny. But the scene that made me love this episode is one of the greatest Cartman / Kyle scenes of all time. When Cartman is superstitious to Kyle, he will steal his gold (which is of course a fake!), And he comes a few inches from his face. Suddenly, Kyle wakes up and they have this crazy conversation where Cartman tries to act as if everything is fine. Cartman looking for the treasure in the end, though predictable, was quite funny.
