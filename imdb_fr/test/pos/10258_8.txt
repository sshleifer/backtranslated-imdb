It was the very first film I saw in my life in 1974 or 1975. I was 4 years old at the time and I saw it at the cinema. I did not understand that it would be a classic at the time (I fell asleep about twenty minutes after the beginning of the film). After seeing it on TV, with two of my other favorite movies Car Wash (my favorite movie) and The Wiz, which seemed to be distributed each year around the same time, about 40, 50 or 75 times, I The know it here was a movie that I would like to have one of my favorites. These three films were the only live action shows I could watch as a child. <br /> <br /> I would not consider this a film of blaxploitation, but rather as a film of urban interest. Cise and Preach reminded me of some of my uncles, especially the Wild Irish Rose they drank. My mother also told me about some of the holidays she attended and that some of the things that happened in the movie were similar in nature to what happened in real life. If you are one of two or three blacks over thirty who have not seen this movie yet, I recommend buying the DVD now. I am happy to have attended some events of that time.
