The idea is not original ... If you had already seen this kind of story, you would know what would happen from the end after watching for the first twenty minutes ... the scenario, the positioning of the actors and the projection are also too important. obvious ... If you have never seen such a story before, it's definitely a good experience, you'll enjoy the twist at the end ... do not forget to see it again once you know the "truth" , you still enjoy the plots ... Even though I guess right at the very beginning, I still could not help stay in my seat until the end ... <br /> <br /> Conclusion: to see absolutely! ! This one from Korea is better than any recent Japanese movie ... forget Hollywood! <br /> <br /> Do not miss it !!
