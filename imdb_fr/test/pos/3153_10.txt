I racked my brains for another film that reminds me of this one. I really can not propose one. I think that's because most of the films that cover this subject (war, peace, violence) have a fixed documentary style. they are meant to be informative and to bring your emotional response to the surface by intellectual means. In some ways, this DVD may seem more intellectual, but it really is not. It's philosophical, perhaps, but it bypasses the information mode and goes directly to the same place as a piece of music. It makes you feel, but sometimes you do not even know why. You are just caught somewhere on a wave of feeling. When you look at it, notice how well it is assembled. It may not be for everyone, but for anyone looking for a rare cinematic creation that respects you.
