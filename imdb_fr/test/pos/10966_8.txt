It concludes with the statement that "the film you just saw was an improvisation" - you felt foolish one day to think that an improvisation was a good film and astonished at the genius of Cassavetes ... once again. Of course, Cassavetes told a guy that it was not really an improvisation in itself, on his deathbed, so ... it's the story of a light-skinned black woman, Lelia, who goes for white, and his family: another who passes - for - white brother named Ben, and a black - black brother named Hughie. When she falls in love with a white idiot named Tony, he is unpleasantly surprised when he discovers she is black. From there, the aspirations and weaknesses of the three main characters are discussed. Hughie is a jazz singer poised to become a failure. Lelia is still desperately depressed about Tony and Ben is violent and violent in general. He desperately needs something to get him out of his lifestyle. Overall, I guess it's really a question of stasis or change in human life. I suspect that Cassavetes organized the plot sufficiently, and that the dialogue was improvised. The dialogue itself is very uneven - sometimes someone says something very memorable, other times it's awkward. What is amazing is the extent of the incarnation of their characters by amateur actors. Cassavetes took the acting class that he taught at the time he decided to do Shadows, whispered to the top ten students, and that was the result ... the guys playing Ben and Hughie are very good . At first, I did not like Lelia, but as the film progresses, you will see more and more that she is one of those actors who improve as the tension and the drama develop - not necessarily the best with small discussions. Shadows is hailed by many as the forerunner of the independent film movement (made in 1959) and is definitely recommended.
