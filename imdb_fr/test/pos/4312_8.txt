it's a good watch if you have time - deal with three friends who engage in a useless fight in a bar and have serious problems. they find themselves fighting against shadows and can not escape. Very, very disturbing portrait of Japan, the arbitrariness of modern life ... intense scenes, but a bit of a cauldron <br /> <br /> the spoiler was that the plot is not too bright based on English subtitles. obviously, I do not know Japanese. <br /> <br /> The only other Japanese film I've seen is Kurosawa, which is different and much more sumptuous than this modern genre. so, can not really compare. otherwise, it compares better with most Hollywood blockbusters for plot and accumulation. <br /> <br /> taptieg24
