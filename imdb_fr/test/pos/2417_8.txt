This is the fourth movie of the Karate Kid series. However, this has nothing to do with the previous 3. The only remaining character is Mr. Myagi. This time, Mr. Myagi meets troubled teen Julie Pierce (Hliary Swank, before she gets famous) Julie She naturally learned to fight. Anyway, through Myagi, Julie learns karate and becomes a better person spiritually and learns to respect herself and in the end regains her respect. I like the unique idea that the antagonist is a woman and a man is her enemy. I also have fight scenes that are very good, very discreet and with minimal violence. No fights are graphic. The end is also good and a little surprising. is predictable, but it is not a typical end for this kind of film.The film has echoes of the original, especially the spiritual aspect and the lessons learned.it is not as good as the 1st mov that is, and certainly not as good as the 2nd. It is however a giant step forward compared to the disappointing 3rd entry. It is a very entertaining film for dogs that suits the whole family. 8/10
