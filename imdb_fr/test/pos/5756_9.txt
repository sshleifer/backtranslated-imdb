Okay, maybe this is not the most sophisticated movie you've ever seen. In reality, there is not a little "sophistication" * in it. It's childish, adolescent, harmless, silly ... and completely hilarious. Basically, Richie and Eddie run the worst hotel in England. Anticipate ridiculous antics with the guests as they fight, try to pay the rent to the only resident who is stupid enough to stay, drink all night with the boys from the nearby power plant ... And fall in desire with the beautiful actress who comes to stay to avoid the press. Try if you are a fan of Rik and Ade and their work. If you are not ... Do not take the movie. It's that simple. <br /> <br /> * I'm not too fat, it's a word from another fabulous journey of Rik in the world of cinema ^ _ ^
