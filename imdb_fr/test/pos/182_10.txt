In my review that I just presented, I called the main actress Katerina when she should have been Veronika. I was so involved with the character and the action that I guess I was not concerned with the names. In any case, she and the film are brilliant. As I said, the cinematography and the use of editing by the director are worthy of Eisenstein and his cameraman, Tisse '. The design of the production is top. The place of the actors in the foreground, in the background and in the background of a given staging deserves to be studied. A remarkable and memorable camera movement, and an end that has an emotional impact that leaves Hollywood movies far behind. Gee! Heroic self-sacrifice instead of walking in the rainbow. Thanks again, John Hart
