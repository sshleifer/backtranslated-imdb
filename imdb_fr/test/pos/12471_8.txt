If you're looking for a modern cinematic version of Buster Crabbe or Johnny Weismuller to overcome the machinations of unscrupulous white safari guides or cunning black tribesmen, while preserving the animal kingdom, this movie does not suit you. This is a tale of the "legend" of Tarzan since its beginnings in intelligent and adult terms. He is beautifully filmed and true to the stories of Edgar Rice Burroughs. <br /> <br /> Tarzan is not a hero of action, but a man divided between two worlds: the natural and the civilized. In a breathtaking performance, Christopher Lambert describes this anguish with absolute realism. If it slides just once the cat is out of his bag: the audience (especially the adult audience targeted by the film) will laugh and the film will completely lose its grip. He will dive into the depths of cheese. But Lambert never lets that happen. (Forget what you think of him in other movies, and when I saw this movie at the theater as soon as it was released, I thought it deserved an Academy Award.) <br /> <br /> The support cast is still excellent, other commentators have noted. I do not agree with most of them because I did not find anything wrong with Andie McDowell's performance. I would not have proposed it for an academy - the role is undemanding - but it is quite up to it, as it is. I do not know why her voice was superimposed either. <br /> <br /> The cinematography of the African story segment is absolutely beautiful. It captures both the beauty of African wilderness and the exotic expectation it arouses in the collective imagination of those who have never been there. The landscape is lush and exotic and the colors are vibrant. <br /> <br /> But it's also a "vintage" film, and cinematography also beautifully portrays Victorian England - the countryside, the city and the interiors. The costumes are remarkable. The soundtrack is beautiful without being overwhelming or importunate. <br /> <br /> There are disturbing scenes - especially for animal lovers - but no more disturbing than some scenes of Dance with Wolves. It is an excellent film about the conflict between civilization and nature, embodied by the young Lord Greystoke, convincingly described by Christopher Lambert.
