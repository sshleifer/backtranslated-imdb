One of IMDb's Message Board posts had two women talking about Colin Firth, how they watched the movie just because of him. Of course, they were two young women; but what struck me was that this film was little appreciated by the general public. The brilliant interpretations of Michelle Pfeiffer and Jessica Lange have barely been noticed, not only by the audience, but also by the Academy and by most critics. <br /> <br /> I think I know why. First, the plot - or in fact the configuration - is a kind of bastardization of Shakespeare's King Lear with the dying and mad patriarch and the three intriguing girls who will inherit. Their names even begin with the same letters, Regan, Goneril and Cordelia - Rose, Ginny and Caroline. And I guess "Larry" (Jason Robards) works for "Lear". The apparent idea envisioned by Jane Smiley in her Pulitzer Prize novel was to tell a story similar to Lear's from the point of view of girls and to tell her a sort of realistic realism of the end of the twentieth century that was not not considered by the Bard. The problem is that in the story of Smiley and Moorhouse, the two older daughters are very human and have strengths and weaknesses, while the father is a very despicable character without too much reductive qualities. His only strength was his ability to financially succeed the farm; However, we can even forget that since his father and grandfather built it and inherited it. The second problem - and I can not attest personally - is that I did not read Smiley's novel. ... is that the film is only a partial and limited interpretation of this novel. Nevertheless, it is almost always true that an excellent novel, especially a long and ambitious one with many psychological nuances, can not be faithfully transferred to the screen. The visual and sound requirements of the film mask the subtleties of a narrative, while the time constraints do not allow the complete development of the character and motivation of the novelist. With five or six hours, Moorhouse might have made a film more in line with Smiley's novel. <br /> <br /> A third problem may be that of Moorhouse. She began her career as a director with the highly successful Australian film Proof (1991) starring Russell Crowe. She continues with How to Make an American Quilt (1995), which celebrates women, especially women of a certain age. However, it was a bit heavy and clearly and resolutely a female film. In a sense, Mille Acres goes from there, showing us not only the women's point of view, but doing it in a way that may seem motivated by political reasons. Larry Cook is clearly a bad, bad dad. He beat his daughters and he had a carnal knowledge. He led the house with an iron fist. Jess (the character of Colin Firth) seduces Ginny, an inexperienced, and breaks her heart for something more fun, it seems. Then he turns to Rose, who will clearly be the power behind the new owner, and catches her, while accidentally inciting her husband to end his life in an accident with drunkenness. Other men are unidimensional characters without nuance, as they often appear in romance novels. I think most audiences were shocked by the heavy incest, adultery, and sexual betrayal that was incorporated into the story. <br /> <br /> That said, I think critics and the public are wrong. I think management was biased against men, but in this story, it had to be. I think Moorhouse did a great job in making an emotional and engaging film about a family dynamic that was not too pretty. And the game of Pfeiffer and Lange was nothing short of sensational. They seemed to feed each other in a way that I found absolutely authentic and deeply moving. In particular, Pfeiffer was captivating as she projected her anger and hatred. The way Moorhouse has allowed her character to be revealed to us over time is a tribute to her performance as a director and to Pfeiffer's outstanding performance. And the skill with which Moorhouse guided Ginny's change of character, who passed from a "ninny", as she called herself, to someone with self-awareness and some understandable bitterness, was also excellent. The fact that she left her husband was as shameful as anything else. He had to go get her, forgive him and bring her back. And Robards in his intensity and his madness was also very good. <br /> <br /> I predict that this film, which was bombed in theaters, will be better appreciated in the coming years as seen on DVD. My question is, what happened to Moorhouse? Her talent is obvious, but she has not yet made her fourth feature film. When she does, I hope she will remember what she believes, but also to be fair. I think that in reality, she was fair to the two main characters of this film, but did not pay enough attention to others. In addition to the unpretentious father, Caroline's Jennifer Jason Leigh was unfinished, which leaves us wondering why she did some of the things she did. And husbands had to be more than models. They had to be involved and involved.
