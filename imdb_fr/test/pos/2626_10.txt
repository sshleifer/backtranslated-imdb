I remember seeing this film 34 years ago and it was full of suspense and twists. This takes you to the beginning and prevents you from guessing throughout the movie. I've been thinking about this movie for a number of years, and I checked in the video stores to see if it was available, but I could never find it or anyone else who heard about it. I think this type of film is timeless and I know that a whole new generation of viewers will benefit. I hope it will soon become a video, because it would be fun to see if it has the same impact on me as in the early 70's. <br /> <br /> It's very rare that a TV movie can do as much. printing, but that's what has been done and still does so after so many years.
