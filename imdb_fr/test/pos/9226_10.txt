Here's what you need to remember about this movie .... IT'S A CHILDREN'S MOVIE !!!!! I do not know about the rest of you but I'm an 80s kid. I was obsessed with Rainbow Brite. So, of course, I love this movie. But if you look at other Rainbow Brite movies, this one is by far the best. But, as I said, it's a children's movie. You have to judge it as a children's movie. It does not matter to the children if the acting, the animation or the scenario is fantastic, even good. All that interests them is what happens to the characters. If the good guy or the good guy wins, then it's a good movie. If not, then it's bad. You all know what I mean. You were all children once.
