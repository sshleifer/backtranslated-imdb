I've been a "huge" Rush fan since "Moving Pictures" and this gig is just an example for anyone who is a fan of why Rush is so popular. They have completely admitted to playing their biggest show to date and, despite the rain in a football stadium, they still manage to perform exceptionally well from start to finish. A real example of this is during "yyz" the whole crowd begins to sing with her in a classic way, in perfect sincerity. They really play all the favorite songs of everyone with a real "desire" powerful that rarely happens. You get the best place at home for one of their best gigs. The second DVD is a fascinating documentary about the band in Brazil. It shows you a lot of things going on behind the scenes and allows you to see them not just as musicians, but as real people in their daily lives. This DVD gift box is a must-have for all Rush fans, young and old, and an essential asset for your DVD collection. Their is even a cd of the concert for those who just want to listen to music. This DVD is worth it!
