A delight from the beginning to the end. <br /> <br /> If you do not like Muppets, I can only complain. This great movie does not just take advantage of the Muppets' popularity - it's a well-crafted and well-written film. It contains good songs and that melancholic thread of melancholy that has always been present in the creations of Jim Henson and who is most personified in the character of Kermit the Frog. I've always reacted to this as a child, and that's what makes the Muppets still enjoyable as adults when other materials for kids drive me crazy. <br /> <br /> A huge cast of big names in cameos makes this movie look like a children's version of "Around the World in 80 Days", except it's about 80 times better . <br /> <br /> Note: A
