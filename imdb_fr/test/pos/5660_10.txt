I finally managed to see this movie ... after so many years of waiting ... <br /> <br /> I was so curious to see if this movie is as bad as some people say it. . <br /> <br /> And in my opinion, this movie was not bad at all, on the contrary, it was amazing ... <br /> <br /> I took every second of that ... from beginning to end. end ... <br /> <br /> The actors were great, they sent me the feeling that I lived the story at the same time as the film ... <br /> <br /> Landscapes were so beautiful was the film was shot ... and it charmed me .. Also the music was amazing and I have nothing to blame .. <br /> <br /> I think the plot was very original, I do not think I saw a film like this ... <br /> <br /> Too bad it is not recognized around the world ... too bad for those who do not have not done. Do not have the chance to see him. I give this film 10/10
