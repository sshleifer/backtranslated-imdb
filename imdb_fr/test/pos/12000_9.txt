Sorry to repeat myself again and again, but here is another great episode of Columbo. I guess that's why I'm a fan - most episodes are really great! The best episodes always have a standout feature, and in this case, the murderer and his accomplice are probably the youngest villains of Columbo. <br /> <br /> After watching many episodes where Columbo and his opponent act as close friends, it feels good to see an episode where minds dissolve and negative feelings come to the surface. It just gives a more dramatic and biting episode. Columbo soon realizes that the two students who claim to help him do not secretly mock him and feed him false clues. He plays happily, deliberately putting the bump in front of them to underestimate them! But of course, he knows instantly when they talk about baloney. <br /> <br /> The murder itself is another complicated, like the episode of Bye Bye Sky High IQ, with a sophisticated chain of reactions that manages to kill the targeted target while providing to assassins an alibi apparently waterproof. Between 1978 and 1990, technology evolved from disc players and firecrackers to remote-controlled locking systems and hidden cameras. <br /> <br /> Stephen Caffrey performs a great performance as Justin Rowe, the odious, spoiled student. Gary Hershberger is discreet but good as his friend "yes-man" Cooper Redman. And it's nice to see Robert Culp in the role of Mr. Rowe, Justin's father. <br /> <br /> A very satisfying episode in every respect.
