I have this movie on a collection of inexpensive B-movies. It's not restored, in fact, the audio was hard to discern during the first few minutes. <br /> <br /> At first, it looked like a typical haunted house movie and it looks a lot like Clue's predecessor, Murder by Death, House on Haunted Hill, etc. <br /> <br /> About half an hour after the beginning of the film, the plot takes a really interesting twist - it goes from a snapshot melodrama to something completely different and more entertaining than I thought at the beginning. <br /> <br /> Go for a walk, it's a lot of fun, even if the long clips and the wider shots (and the almost total absence of musical score) make it a bit squeaky by the standards of 'today.
