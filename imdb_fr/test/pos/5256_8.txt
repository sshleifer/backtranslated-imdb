The Women is a cute movie about women of all ages (but especially 30 and older) and about their life issues. Not only men and infidelity, but also relationships with friends and family, take the time to communicate with others, image problems, compromise your values, your achievements in life and find what will make you really happy. <br /> <br /> You must also be true to yourself. People often give you advice but do not really follow it. Sometimes they have created an illusion and should you really follow the same path or react according to your feelings now? I really liked this movie. Sure, he was trying to look like Sex & the City once in a while, but it probably helped me to like it. The difference here is that it's a bit like the discoveries after the scene of life in which were the stars of Sex & the City - here, most are married or have spent the point of looking for a man. Now they are trying to find happiness in their marriages and their lives. <br /> <br /> Obviously, he's not an Oscar nominee, but he's entertaining and serves his purpose. <br /> <br /> And for the men In the cinemas, there was an equal share of men and women in the cinema hall (most were with their wife or their girlfriend) and the men were in laughing. :)
