Anyone interested in Texas needs this DVD. It's just a good movie about real Texas with great scenes. It took a bunch of Texans to do that properly. Hollywood would never have had it. There are so many subtle things that Tubb put in the movie and he may not even have thought of, but that makes the show. <br /> <br /> Guest cameos are not seen at all. Each star fits perfectly and does not divert the film. Most places mix so that when the credits arrive, you will return to the movie to find the character. Strait's roll is dead, it could not have been better done in real life. <br /> <br /> The second half of the film is completely different from the first, it's a little "hokey", but it's going to be fine. In a way, the scenario works. The "hokey" is like a special after school, but it seems credible and natural. <br /> <br /> I have never heard anyone use the Sonny Pruitt line before, except for the people I grew up with. It was the icing on the cake for me. <br /> <br /> Definitely a collector's item, with Pure Country, Sugarland Express, Jr. Bonner, Texasville, The Last Picture Show, Giant and of course Hud. <br /> <br /> Gig'em Aggies '86
