Before I saw this movie, I heard a lot of praise about it and exclamations about its horror. To not take anything away from this film, I think it was not so horrible or even shocking. It's just a movie about people living in the dark side of the city. And a good one to describe the point. <br /> <br /> There are very good actors and a well thought out manuscript. Paavo Westerberg is a well-known writer on the Finnish film scene and is best at describing contemporary Finnish culture (although he is not the only writer in the film, but I dare say he is the writer correct me if I'm wrong). <br /> <br /> The cast is excellent, with the exception of Jasper Pääkkönen (the pseudo-main character who, in my opinion, should have remained in the televised soap opera scene), and the sets, cuts and the sounds are very well done and give a great atmosphere to this film. <br /> <br /> This film tells stories of sadly interconnected destiny which, according to a well-known Finnish band song (Eppu Normaali ", by Tuhansien Murheellisten Laulujen Maa", which was VERY roughly translated as "Paha Maa ") leads throughout Finnish society to a dark and sad end, accompanied by alcohol, loneliness and bad choices. And that's the side of Finnish everyday life, about 80% of the population has no conscience, unless films like this one are made.
