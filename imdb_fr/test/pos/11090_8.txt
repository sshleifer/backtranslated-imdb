"Belief in the Great Other as an invisible power structure that exists in the Real is the most succinct definition of paranoia." ?? Slavoj Zizek <br /> <br /> This is a review of "Marathon Man" and "The Falcon and the Snowman", two films by director John Schlesinger. <br /> <br /> Although Hitchcock and Lang brought the "Thriller of Conspiracy" to Hollywood, the genre only blossomed in the late '60s and' 70s, with movies like "The Parallax View" , "Z", "Marathon Man", "Capricorn One", "The Manchurian Candidate", "Three Days of the Condor" and "All Men of the President". It was the time of Vietnam and Watergate, a deeply suspicious public of all political leaders. <br /> <br /> The genre remained silent in the '80s and early' 90s until the TV series "X Files" came to life. With slogans such as "The truth is out there" and "Do not trust anyone", the series offers a world of vast plots and government plots, the common man at the mercy of all manner of projects ridiculously developed. The only way out of the labyrinth? "Fight the future!" as the slogan of the last season of the series proclaimed. It was apparently our duty to walk the labyrinth of information as we discovered an elusive "truth" that guaranteed our own freedom. <br /> <br /> This trend has come to an end with the Internet boom, from conspiracy thrillers now to "conspiracy documentaries". The Internet generation has won independent documentaries such as "Loose Change" and "Zeitgeist", while in the mainstream, Michael Moore has thrilled his audience with stuff like "Fahrenheit 9/11". All these documentaries believed in a "secret order", a cabal of politicians and wealthy businessmen who conspired to reduce human rights and enslave the world. They struggle to create a mono-myth, linking various conspiracies and hidden programs in one encompassing narrative that explains the purpose, the point and the future of everything. <br /> <br /> This need to "streamline the stories", to make them more "effective", is reflected in the scientific community, which is struggling to create a "grand unification theory" and ultimately a "theory" at all ", fusing everything from quantum mechanics to special relativity into a single, encompassing formula. <br /> <br /> So, finally, the "conspiracy thriller" is rooted in the desire to control the man. The modern subject is one who manifests a total cynicism about official institutions, while at the same time believing in the existence of plots (an invisible Other pulling the strings). This apparently contradictory coupling of cynicism and belief is strictly linked to the disappearance of the great Other. His disappearance leads us to build an Other of the Other (conspiracy) in order to escape the unbearable freedom engendered by his loss. Conversely, it is not necessary to take the Great Other seriously if we believe in the Other's Other. We are therefore allowed to be cynical and believe in equal measures. <br /> <br /> The man therefore seeks to control a whimsical universe, to create a sort of paternal baby-sitter (be it God, a mathematical formula, a conspiracy theory, an explanation of the violence / conspiracy / murder / war, etc.) that gives meaning and symbolic order. The Great Other reassures the believer. It is a "lifestyle choice", similar to religion, in which its place in the world depends on the irrational. <br /> <br /> The problem of most "conspiracy thrillers", from the innocent days of Hitchcock's "Topaz" to the modern tariff like "The Da Vinci Code", is twofold. First, they are not wrong to suggest that something is wrong with "elites" or "best", but they are wrong to individualize and personalize social, collective and systemic processes, an approach which implies that it is right. a question of personal morality rather than social structures. Secondly and most importantly, these "conspiracies" ignore the fact that the Great Other simply does not exist. There is no symbolic order pulling the strings. <br /> <br /> Some modern "conspiracy thrillers" ("Eyes Wide Shut", "Existenz", etc.) recognize it, with their indescribable webs of lies, accidents, truths and half truths, nothing ever adds up, nothing ever makes sense, the real and the hyperreal, the truth and the desire, all fuzzy, without any identifiable zero points, but they are mostly films of intellectual directors. <br /> <br /> Compared to these modern "conspiracy thrillers", "Marathon Man" and "The Falcon and the Snowman" are positively archaic. "Marathon Man" talks about a graduate student (Dustin Hoffman) involved in the affairs of his older brother (Roy Scheider), who unfortunately deals with spies, rifles, double agents, diamonds and bad Nazi dentists. Scheider is suave, Hoffman is excellent and Schlesinger strikes us with stunning visuals (the revelation of the Eiffel Tower is astounding), but the most interesting part of the film is that its various lines of intrigue do not intersect before 1 o'clock. . Even then, it takes half an hour for things to make sense. Unfortunately, the film ends with a cliche confrontation between the bad guy and the nice guy, everything is perfectly solved and explained. <br /> <br /> "The Falcon and the Snowman" is a bit more ambitious. Sean Penn and Timothy Hutton play two friends selling government secrets to the Soviet Union. Hutton works at a civilian defense subcontractor and smuggles information out of his office to Penn, a small drug dealer who has no qualms about selling to the KGB. Penn does this strictly for the money, while Hutton is disappointed by the US government (including his attempt to dismiss the leader of Australia) and therefore sells the secrets strictly because he hates the way his country is committing crimes and spy games. In other words, the film is about a conspiracy in response to plots. <br /> <br /> "Marathon Man" ?? 7.9 / 10 <br /> <br /> "The falcon and the snowman" ?? 8/10 <br /> <br /> Apart from a strangely wacky car accident and its clich√© ending, "Marathon Man" is an effective thriller, with several ordered scenes. "The Falcon and the Snowman" is even better, with Penn making a memorable performance.
