This is one of the best television productions of a musical. I heard Merman's casting album, Angela Lansbury's album, saw Tyne Daly in concert and saw Rosalind Russell's film countless times. I think Bette is otherwise the best, so tied with the best. It captures not only bravery, but also the pathos of Mama Rose. I have never been a fan of Natalie Wood, so I really enjoyed Cynthia Gibb, which is probably her best role. Everything from costumes to decorations to secondary representations is wonderful. The three strippers, led by the always reliable Christine Ebersole, are hard to beat. There must have been a TV production of Mame a few years ago, with Cher, but I think Bette would be the best bet (pun intended) for Aunt Mame.
