Hong Kong, 1920s. A young man of poor beginnings dreams of becoming a hero and spends most of his time practicing and learning kung fu and bodybuilding, despite the desire to his father. He helps a servant escape from a merciless businessman, whose fools then come after them, and terrorizes the young man's noodle restaurant, his uncle. The uncle turns out to be an old reformed assassin of the Triad, who now helps the young man to master the martial arts. This is the Karate Kid style in its own right with "wash the wok" instead of "wax on, wax cir". The villain of kung fu is the son of the ruthless businessman, who has a style of scorpion that looks cool but is rather silly and surely completely unrealistic. <br /> <br /> But history, which develops over time, has an epic meaning. , good characterization, excellent kung-fu and is usually very entertaining. The young hero is very friendly and is a good protagonist. The love dimension remains undeveloped, which is a little disappointing. Otherwise, a good movie. <br /> <br /> My rating: 8 out of 10
