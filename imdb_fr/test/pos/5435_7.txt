Robin Williams shows his stand-up skills and strengthens his acting status in this film "What's wrong with American politics and how can Hollywood try to influence without bothering people?" Of course, Hollywood uses movies with hidden or not so hidden agendas. I think this movie is for people who like stand-up and political discussion. And the trailers in this movie were for everyone just to make sure as many people as possible would see it. Everybody knows that Hollywood is more liberal / democratic than Bush & Co., so they have to do these movies from time to time ... but this one was maybe too obvious, at least I thought so, to make real changes. <br /> Despite everything, great political debates and stand-up fees ... I enjoyed it and, thanks to the ratings from IMDb.com, I was positively surprised when I walked out of the cinema and, yes, I laughed a few times. Sometimes you just have to give up and forget all the seriousness .... see this movie if you like the good and clever stand-up or the politics and you will not be offended by the many references according to which things are not good right now. Praise him if it does not suit you.
