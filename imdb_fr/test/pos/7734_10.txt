I just can not believe the low scores of this movie. The likely reason is the low number of votes, which means that few people have seen it. It's just a fantastic movie! There are so many stories related to each other, but it's not complicated. Each character grows up with the film and we live with them changes of life. The scenery is simply amazing and the final credits are the best of all the movies I've seen (just like a Shakespeare play). Yes, it's a little dated (filmed in 1982) but the problems encountered by the characters are very current. It could have been shot in 2002 without changing the script. Raul Julia is amazing, the best role of all time in a movie - it's her centerpiece. A young Molly Ringwald is excellent as she matures from girl to girl. Susan Sarandon is perfect as a carefree young woman and John Cassavetes is the force that puts it all together. Do yourself a favor, find this movie, watch it and enjoy it. Return to IMDb and mark this movie in the top 250 of all time, as it should be.
