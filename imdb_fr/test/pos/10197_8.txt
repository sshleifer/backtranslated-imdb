as a robocop fan, I have always loved this movie. I saw it when it came out, and finally I bought it in DVD of Brazil, it never went out in the United States in DVD. I like the movie, but like everything in this world, everyone has their opinion, likes or dislikes. no matter what a movie does, someone will always say "why did not they do it differently?" in other words, you can not please everyone. if you like robocop, you will love this movie. For me, it's so unique that it's not lame, or silly like a lot of low budget movies. This film has always interested me. I can see some scenes that Robocop borrowed here, but tell me which movies do not do that? many movies use other ideas than others and change them sometimes. fun movie!
