Shwaas is great! whereas the producers had a lean budget, they did an excellent job. This is a watch not to be missed. The little boy did a great job with a lot of emotions running through his eyes. Grandpa is at his best. The photography is superb. Technically correct and very creative. This helps to add a lot of emotions to the main content. The film will keep you going and do not be surprised if you are upset after the movie and the story stays in your mind for a few days. > Enjoy it and again, do not miss it
