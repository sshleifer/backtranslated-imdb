I saw this film for the first time in the late 60s and I try to see it every time it goes on television, which is unfortunately not often the case. Now that I have TCM and FMC, I hope it will be at least once a year. Like Louis Gossett Jr. in An Officer and A Gentleman, Jack Webb delivers an incredibly fantastic performance as Parris Island's Sergeant Instructor with the rookie rookie, and the rookie's script, though dated, is touching and well played. . And having real potty heads in the cast certainly contributed to the film's realism. It's a great movie with a great acting and a great story. See if you are lucky, well worth the time!
