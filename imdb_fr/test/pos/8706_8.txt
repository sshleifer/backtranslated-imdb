I watched it on Sky TV late at night because I'm a vampire fan. I must admit that I almost expected it to be a B-Movie disaster, but I was absolutely wrong. <br /> <br /> The subspecies is a family of vampires. When a vampire lord dies, his two sons, the beautiful and noble Stefan, and his brother, the evil, hideous Radu, fight for their birthright, the bloodstone. The bloodstone is a holy grail for the vampires and bleeds the blood of the saints, giving the vampire who drinks it an ultimate high. <br /> <br /> The struggle for the bloodstone takes an unexpected turn when 3 university students make a field trip to the territory of the brothers and Stefan must protect them from his fraternal desires. <br /> <br /> As I said, I went into this movie without much expectation, but it was one of the best low-budget movies I've ever seen. The sets and places (Romania, it's been a long time since I did not see it) are very nice and the score has done justice to the film. <br /> <br /> Most of the actors were enough, but it's Anders Hove as the devilish radu stealing the movie (and all the following sequels). Hove's performance as a crooked Vamp is truly breathtaking and rocks the movie just okay, pretty d @ mn good!
