In one way or another, you can not escape the basic message. The strong survive. Those who are sensitive psychically or emotionally, leave. They leave a hole in the lives of those who love them. A hole that is seen in its purpose as selfish. That's what Phoebe does at the end. Just before helping Wolf heal his blame. She can accept the closure of the missing ... of her sister. Beautiful European landscape. There is a lot of truth about idealism and dependence on the next big moment. For a moment, I thought of the Baader-Meinhoff gang that existed in the early 70s. I liked this film because it reflected a time when I myself became a major.
