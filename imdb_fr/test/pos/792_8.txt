To my eternal shame, I have never seen a silent movie - not even the mother of all the vampire movies, "Nosferatu". However, if they show half the creativity and great joy of this Buster Keaton effort, I will probably try to look at it a little more. It's really fun and an amazing introduction to the world of silent comedies. The premise, as it stands, is centered on an unfortunate case of mistaken identity since Keaton is mistaken for the famous villain Dead Shot Dan (co-director Malcolm St Clair). This leads to a number of lawsuits and escapes as the authorities come closer and closer to the increasingly desperate Keaton. <br /> <br /> You will be amazed and entertained. Keaton is a natural comedian but also an accomplished stuntman, judging by the way he jumps and jumps like Jackie Chan in speed. And the comedy is also of an exceptionally high level - my better half had to cut a phone call to her parents because she was laughing too much! If you've never seen a silent movie like this, it's nothing less than a revelation to watch - it certainly has thrown away all the ideas I've had about silent movies. Of course, it's not as refined as today's movies - the acting is pretty awful, but it does not matter if you like the movie anyway. Anyone with a passing interest in movies in general should make the effort to look at this because they will not be disappointed. Brilliant!
