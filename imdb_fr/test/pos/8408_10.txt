I loved the movie. I loved Timothy Dalton and Joanne Whaley. The movie had many different places. I really liked when Ann Hampton realized that she could not make Rhett love her. And when Scarlett and Ann got together and Ann apologized for taking Rhett and Scarlett just told her not to worry, she would get it back. There was a beautiful story to tell. You simply can not compare it to GWTW. There are so many beautiful scenes. I love SCARLETT AND GWTW! Of course, do not forget to have a handkerchief in hand.
