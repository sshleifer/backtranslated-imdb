An unusual film, based on the classic principle of a thug who marries a girl who loves to flee the country. But a twist soon puts the tale backwards. Most of the film hits well: the story runs smoothly, the acting is solid (the voice of Sienna Miller is priceless, it can really play!), The chemistry between the two films Major and offbeat American rural landscapes are really good times. The mood, which begins with being light and romantic, quickly moves to something darker and really weird sometimes. <br /> <br /> Sometimes the pace slows slightly, but we do not leave it. to prevent you from watching this unusual little cinematographic treatment. Alexandre Montin, Paris
