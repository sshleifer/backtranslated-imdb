A deliciously nasty black comedy about a middle aged schlub (Danny DeVito) who wants to upset his mother and makes a plan to do it with a bitter divorcee, who wants to overthrow his ex-wife. The film's cynicism is without any excuse, and it does not give us anyone to like, but for once, it works in favor of the film rather than disabling it. <br /> <br /> Anne Ramsey, like DeVito's battle ax, steals the show in a grotesquely funny performance. Even if it is a horror, you end up nagging her, because she seems to be able to hit DeVito and Crystal at the same time, both hands tied behind her back. <br /> <br /> Grade: B +
