Settled in Paris in 1910, an old and rich opera singer decides to give his fortune to his beautiful cat Duchess (voiced by Eva Gabor) and his kittens, but the jealous butler Edgar develops a plan when he removes cats. and leave them in the country. Fortunately for them, with the help of an independent and well-known Tomcat, Thomas O'Malley (voiced by Phil Harris), helps them get home, especially to meet some of his good friends like the swinging 'Scat Cat' ( expressed by Scatman Crothers) - and trying to thwart Edgar's plans. <br /> <br /> The Walt Disney animated death movie, very entertaining and annoying, contains some pretty jazzy tunes, like the memorable "Everybody wants to be a cat", a good voice and great animations even in these times of computer animation. Not one of Disney's greatest animated films, but a Disney favorite and one of the few gems of his time that works well, highly recommended.
