What gas of a movie! "Black Film" has always been one of my favorite genres, but this one stands out from the others. Only "The Big Sleep", "Out of the Past", "Murder My Sweet" and "The Killers" can get close to this classic caper. I know that these four American films I just mentioned are not capers in themselves, but rather detective novels with complicated intrigues, which always give off a "black" quality, similar to "Rififi". <br /> <br /> What is different here is the way Jules Dassin sets the mood of the film in motion, not only in the cruel realism of the principal but also in the use of the streets of Paris as a subliminal character and co-conspirator in itself! The film is centered on "the Stephanois", a dark, sullen and complicated ex-prisoner who is driven in a last blow to the heavy tribute. Even if he is a tough guy, with no smile and badass, you always feel in him a burning desire for redemption by getting rid of the demons of his past (hey, he saved little Toni!). Dassin chose the good guy (Jean Servais) for this role. <br /> <br /> That aside, the rest of the development of the story is put in place as we go through the famous scene of "silent" to capture the eventual disappearance of the main "perps". Only their wives survive, with the exception of Ida, Mario's honey. They seemed to understand best the underlying futility of all this!
