This short film was part of the fourth part of the "Short Cinema Journal" - a film I rented from Netflix, but which seems to have been originally a monthly series of films for lovers of modern short films AND eager to see the DVD full of advertisements. So far, I have tried two of the DVDs in the Review, and I felt enraged by the awful way a viewer needs to navigate the record to see the movies. Talk about an over-produced and too complicated way of doing that! Although I have and will continue to see as many shorts as possible, I really doubt that I'm going to bother with the newspapers because of these factors. <br /> <br /> This may be due to the fact that I do not like the disc. many that I was not favorably disposed towards this Portuguese animated short film. It's definitely possible. However, even if this is the case, I think the other reviews were too positive about this simple little movie. Some of the illustrations were really cool - I liked how the simple black-and-white drawings suddenly became 3D environments as the camera went from a dull distant plane to the city below. It was lovely and I took a job. But as for the story of a cat who wants to go to the moon, she did not bring me anything. <br /> <br /> IMPORTANT UPDATE - I saw this movie on a DVD titled "Cartoon Noir" on the 5 / 09. It was a rather unattractive collection of art films. However, this time, I saw THE HISTORY OF THE CAT and MOON with a totally different audio track and the boy made a difference. Instead of Portuguese with subtitles, he had a French accented narrator who spoke English in a Black Film style. Although I usually hate to double, this time it really made the movie. The narration of the Portuguese version leaves much to be desired if you do not know the language or do not understand the subtleties. Unless you speak the language, try to look for the other version (provided you understand English).
