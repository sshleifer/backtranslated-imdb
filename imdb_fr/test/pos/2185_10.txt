George Hearn really missed out on what was great. I heard the version of Len Cariou but it was too tame. George was great in this character - very expressive. <br /> <br /> Angela Lansbury was perfect for the role. She gave a good performance. She gave Ms. Lovett a great sneaky and comical personality that balanced the dark story. <br /> <br /> I love black humor when Angela Lansbury sings her songs, her physical expressions and George Heard's angry emotions in her songs about rage, revenge and distress. <br /> <br /> I've watched this piece 20 times since 1985, when I saw it on PBS. I bought it on video (after copying it alone in 1985) when it was released in 1990 and I definitely bought a copy of the DVD when it was released in 2004.
