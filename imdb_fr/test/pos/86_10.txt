This film was anything but boring. It deals with reality. For those who think this movie is boring, open your eyes to the real problems of our society. Our children are dying. The consequences of alcohol and drug abuse should not be ignored. I work in a correctional facility as an addiction counselor and deal with these issues every day. The consequences of alcohol and drug abuse affect people of all ages and backgrounds. It destroys families, hurts people and causes serious brain damage, all kinds of health problems and death. Everything is avoidable. This film should be broadcast in all the high schools of the world.
