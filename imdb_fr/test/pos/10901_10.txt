Paul Rudnick (Jeffrey, Addams Family Values) wrote this eloquent account of a mild-mannered school teacher (Kevin Kline) who was superseded by a former student actor (Matt Dillon). The rest of the film deals with the absurdities that surround this configuration - the effect on the city, his fianc√©e (Joan Cusack), himself - and culminates with a finale that will please everyone. <br /> <br /> If you're an angry gay rights activist or a naive young person looking for a true picture of a man's struggle to go out or a faithful representation of life gay, then save yourself the trouble and rent something else (maybe Beautiful Thing) or read you book (Giovanni's room). If you are able to understand that this film was inspired by the piety of Tom Hanks's speech at the Oscars, when he won for Philadelphia and makes fun of Hollywood culture and ignorance of small towns , and you have a penchant for 1930s-style comedy (Bringing Up Baby, Holiday, The Palm Beach Story) so enjoy! Far from being a scathing satire, the film seeks the exuberance of Preston Sturges farce and approaches it. No, it's not "deep" or "powerful" - neither Romy & Michelle, 9-5, nor Young Frankenstein - and that does not pretend to be; he keeps his tongue in the cheek. He gets too preached and cursed for his own good by the end and sure some of the jokes are a bit bland (there's also a cloakroom scene that could have been cut) but after watching countless comedies that failed It's like a breath of fresh air. <br /> <br /> Kevin Kline and Tom Selleck play beautifully while Debbie Reynolds and Wilford Brimley provide extra support. Joan Cusack's excellent, award-winning performance is outstanding and the excellent Bob Newhart is Bob Newhart. <br /> <br /> The fact that many have been offended by In & Out is as absurd as the mentality of the city-dweller to whom he mocks; personally, I was more offended by Philadelphia. I will take harmless fluff on holiness at all times.
