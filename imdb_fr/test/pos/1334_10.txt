Despite the criticisms that follow, I enjoyed a lot of what it is precisely. Eyecandy for both sides of the gender spectrum. Soderberg has already made the difference before winning Oscars and is at the top of his game. Ocean's 12 is light, commercial, fluffy, Steve's day at Midway if you want. I'm not usually a fan of Zeta-Jones, but I have to admit that Kate is SUPERB in this movie. This is the end of the cries of a next trequel and I will be one of the millions of people who will attend 120 minutes of discussions between George, Brad and Matt through the excavations of Clooney in Lago di Como, while they con a rich type of villain. If we have tolerated 3 Lord of the Rings payments, I ask if we can chat one more time on Clooney's lid of salt and pepper?
