Ok, when I rented this several years ago, I had the worst expectations. Yes, the acting is not great and the picture itself looks old-fashioned, but while I was sitting there, a strange thing happened. I started to like that. The action is great and there are few scenes that make you jump. Brion James, perhaps one of the greatest B-class actors alongside Bruce Campbell, is great, as always. The story is not bad either. Now, I would not want to buy it hurriedly, but you will not waste your time looking at least this good grade b post-apocalyptic western.
