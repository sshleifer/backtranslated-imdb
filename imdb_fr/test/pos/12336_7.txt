I did not know anything about this movie before watching it. This seems to be a less known teenage horror of the 80s. What struck me was the differences between many other films of that era. <br /> <br /> The first thing I noticed is the slowness with which this movie progresses. This does not make the typical configuration of showing murdered characters one by one. It takes time to build the story back, leaving some mystery about what might happen. I was almost beginning to think that no one would be really hurt in this movie. But everything leads to the climatic sequence in the last 15 minutes, then it gets pretty graphic (it was a bad time to take a snack break - I could hardly finish my pizza once it started). <br /> <The characters also seem slightly more three-dimensional than most scary teen movies. Conversations were refreshing for the most part, contrary to the extreme stereotypes you expect. For example, the girl who is popular, snobby, queen of the clique is not constantly insulting everyone, but is able to have doubts and be respectful towards others. <br /> <br /> To summarize, I found that this film was a little original compared to what I expected, and a little better done. He attracted me, interested me, then let me have it. As I said, it's pretty bloody during the final, but almost family-friendly for the rest of the time. I do not need to own it, but I'm glad I discovered it.
