Okay, I admit that it often seems like most Sylvester / Tweety couples have exactly the same plot: Sylvester tries to get Tweety, but fails several times and is always mutilated, often with the help of a bulldog. I guess it's a bit like Wile E. Coyote chasing Road Runner (in other words, mammals should never attack birds). "All Bir-r-r-rd" has the same plot and the place on a train. In a way, the best part of these cartoons is to see what kinds of Sylvester schemes have come up to try to attack Tweety. We know it will fail miserably, but it's also fun to see Tweety turn into a rascal (if you've seen his cartoons very early, you'll find he's not "cute" at all, but actually had a cruel series). This one works mainly as a way to pass the time. <br /> <br /> By the way, I thought I saw - I mean, I stretched myself taw - Sylvester passed a piece of luggage with the name Friz Freleng on it.
