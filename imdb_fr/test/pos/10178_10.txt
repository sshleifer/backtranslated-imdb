A SUPERMAN cartoon <br /> <br /> A huge amount of gold is sent by train across the country. Using state-of-the-art techniques, a sophisticated group of hooded thieves are trying to hit gold. Lois Lane, the intrepid journalist, is the only passenger on board. It's Superman to the rescue. But now that it has become a fugitive train, can it even stop the BILLION DOLLARS LIMITED? <br /> <br /> This is another example of Max Fleischer's series of great cartoons for Paramount Studio. They present an excellent animation and stretches tense and fast. Destined to be shown in movie theaters, they are way ahead of their Saturday morning counterparts.
