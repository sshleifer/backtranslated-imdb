... the last time I laughed so much. Rowan Atkinson's talent is to have been able to create a multi-level cartoon character with a clearly defined personality - almost meaningless. All the success of the program rests on the shoulders of Atkinson, but he carries it easily. Despite the fact that the series only airs during one season, anyone, even vaguely in contact with pop culture, recognizes the social delay in the rubber face, both the talent and the efforts devoted to the performance are great. Sometimes infuriating, sometimes kind, Mr. Bean is an innocent and unlucky guy who also turns out to be an evil incarnate. The brilliance of this character can not be put in words, you must see it for yourself. <br /> <br /> The show sometimes becomes too depressing, as in the famous New Year's skit or when Bean celebrates his birthday. by going alone to a restaurant, offering himself a congratulatory card signed by himself and using a stake that he does not like too much. Yet there are times when you can not help but be impressed by the inventive ways in which Bean gets off the hook, for example, when he's ingeniously putting his money or turning it into something else. swimsuit without taking his pants first! Whatever your reaction to Bean and his unorthodox lifestyle, you are forced to laugh while watching. <br /> <br /> Finally, I would like to emphasize that although "Bean" is considered a program for children, it is just as enjoyable for any adult with a sense of humor. Because the most "adult" jokes will go beyond the heads of toddlers and that the smart slapstick (yes, it is so) is funny, no matter how old you are, "Bean" is the real definition of a family show. It's a classic and it always lights up my day.
