All I can say after watching the DVDs of the first season is that I can not believe that NBC has "greened" this show. It's so different from what's popular except Lost. Those who miss X-Files may have a worthy successor. Not as mysterious or intense as Lost, I think it's more entertaining overall. <br /> <br /> This kind of long story is hard to do. I mean, it could degenerate into a childish dribble if most things are not consistent. But they are good and I think the distribution is excellent, the writing is clear, the location and the first-rate accessories, as well as the special effects very good for a television budget. Of course, it reinforces what is plausible, but it never becomes as stupid as insulting your intelligence. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that it's a big sci-fi drama for the whole family. I doubt that this is a classic long like X-Files, but in the meantime, I recommend you get the DVD if you missed it as I did the first time. This fall, my performances are not to be missed! <br /> <br /> PS: I just heard that it comes from the NBC ... We hope that science fiction will take it back.
