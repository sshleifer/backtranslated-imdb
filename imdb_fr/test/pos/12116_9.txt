It was a super anime. The animation is certainly old, but it is still worth watching and presents a better plot than Ninja Scroll. The problem was a bit long. <br /> <br /> Japanese movie star Hiroyuki Sanada who played Last Samurai's Ujio performed the main character Jiro and the film was made by Rintaro, who used Galaxy Express 999 and Metropolis. <br /> <br /> The anime has a good animation for an old anime, interesting characters like the villain Tenkai and Ando Shouzan, and of course, that we must not forget the beautiful scores of the film. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie is worth watching by fans of cartoons, animation in general, action and Samurai / Ninja movies. Despite the low levels in the film, it does not make him a great movie to watch. <br /> <br /> Do not miss this movie.
