Leonard Maltin gave this film a dreaded BOMB rating in his 1995 film and video guide. What movie did he watch? Kid Vengeance or God Gun are bombs. This film is a delight. It's fantastic. It's literate. It is well mounted. It's beautiful photographed, making brilliant use of colors. From the beginning of the film, the film draws your attention and informs you that this film is a satire well made of all the kind Spaghetti Western. The film is played from start to finish, with tributes to Douglas Fairbanks, the 77 Sunset Strip and the famous confrontation in The Good, The Bad, and Ugly. Edd Byrnes, George Hilton and Gilbert Roland work brilliantly together to make the satire work. It is unfortunate that Mr. Maltin described the film so badly that it is not deserved. We can only guess his reason. I suspect he completely missed the purpose of the film and was expecting something more serious than this movie is supposed to be. The Kudos belong to everyone involved in this project. This film is a little gem waiting to be discovered by people who are interested in cinema and who appreciate satire.
