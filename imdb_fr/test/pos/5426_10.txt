This film is entirely human. This film remained for years my favorite cartoon of all time. <br /> <br /> Is not it the simplest things that make life so much more interesting ?! We humans are so sweet, compassionate, funny, caring - we are inventing the most beautiful and amazing machines to kill as many people as possible with as little effort as possible. In our short lives, we destroy our world, and often our own lives, instead of spending the rest of our lives trying to repair what we have destroyed. Sometimes there is nothing left to fix! <br /> <br /> This film can entertain, educate and even help us realize what's wrong with our lives! Life is short and can be even shorter! The end is too optimistic, I'm scared. <br /> <br /> I love the spirit of Richard Condie and what he does with it! <br /> <br /> Enjoy <br /> <br /> H.K.
