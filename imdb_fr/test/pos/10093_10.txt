If you consider yourself a fan of horror movies, you have probably already seen Hideo Nakata's Ring and Dark Water. They are beautiful and Ring makes his way to Hollywood (maybe Dark Water will soon be adapted?). While Ring is almost 100% pure, the heart beating and breaking the nerves, a story of two sisters is both brittle and nervous. <br /> <br /> With The Other, I consider this Korean film to be a brilliant horror film. The only flaw in this movie is that some people think its first 20 minutes are pretty slow. It's typical of Korean and Japanese movies. I consider it carefully planned rather than slow, it's a "calm moment before the storm". With an in-depth introduction of the characters, the imho viewer will become more closely involved with the character, one of the highlights of Korean and Japanese movies. <br /> <br /> Like Ring, the story of two sisters does not exaggerate with a horrible appearance. Instead, they let our mind do the intimidating work itself. In this way, it is scary and horribly elegant at the same time. I would not be surprised if Hollywood redo this film after bringing Ring and Grudge / Ju-On (this film is not very good by the way, I noted 5.5). Do not miss it!
