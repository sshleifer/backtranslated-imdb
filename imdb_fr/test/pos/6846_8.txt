I loved this film !! Great game by Carla Gugino. Interesting story about a kidnapping that goes terribly wrong (is not it all?). Some surprising twists in the movie and the plot was easy to follow without being so complicated that it was totally incomprehensible. It was a totally unexpected treat. More "Quentin-ish" than most movies try to be.
