It's Christmas time! A nativity in terms of rebirth, or at least that is what we can hope for Italian cinema. It was something like 30 to 40 years old that Italian cinema did not design a work of art of this size. This is an absolute contemporary film that can also be considered at the same level of quality as the Italian masterpieces of the past, needless to mention any name. Finally, it is also an important production for the Italian standards of the time. In this film, there is a rare balance of different elements, understandable and enjoyable at different levels of achievement. True poetry, real humor, real tenderness, real drama, real beauty. No rhetoric, no surrealist shortcuts, no typical Tornatore tourist representation, no sur-actor, no self-referential director. There is also an interesting use of two heartbreaking songs by Nina Simone, whose music, I think, has never been used appropriately for a score. So, if this does not really resemble Italian cinema, it is an extraordinary evolution for Emanuele Crialese after his film "Respiro", another beautiful and definitive film. "Nuovomondo" is not to be missed, it is this kind of "medicine film" useful to take pleasure in making a film, watching a movie, useful to enjoy and understand life. Francesco Cabras
