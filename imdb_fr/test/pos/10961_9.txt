Watching John Cassavetes' first film is a strange experience, even if you've already seen improvisational films. <br /> <br /> The first thing you notice is its roughness. From the outset, it is obvious that some characters are screwing up their lines. But then you move away from the situation, dipping deeper into the intimate exchanges of these people and asking yourself, "Do I stumble on MY words?" The answer of course is that we all do it. It is unfortunate that most blunders in this regard occur early in the photo, because after about twenty minutes, you have plunged so deeply that you would not know if a bomb explodes behind you. <br /> <br /> The next thing you notice ... or maybe you notice a few hours or days after the end of the movie is that you've never seen a substantial plot, but the themes and the poetry of dialogue and characters never leave you. In fact, the treatment of the role played by the race in the daily life of these characters is always present, but it is so ephemeral that even these are not aware of how they inform their opinions about themselves, their self-awareness, their perceived status, or the fate of their relationships. <br /> <br /> The title is appropriate because you get a full spectrum of blacks, whites and grays ... and not just in the skin pigmentation of the characters. Leila Goldoni (truly remarkable here) is African-American / Caucasian, her two brothers are African-American black and white. The irony is that they exist in what is undoubtedly the most "trendy" and most tolerant atmosphere of the time ... the west-west district, animated by many beats. .. and that there are still conflicts within and around themselves. <br /> <br /> I do not think I've ever seen a movie with such subtle technique or rendering. It's a bit like absorbing a very beautiful gallery artwork and then sinking into happiness by thinking back to the images she evoked a few days later. <br /> <br /> Excellent mastering and extras on the Criterion disc. Without doubt the first truly experimental independent film ever made.
