The whole town of Blackstone is scared because they have lynched Bret Dixon's brother - and he's coming back for revenge! At least, that's what they think. <br /> <br /> A great Johnny Hallyday and a very beautiful young star Mario Adorf in this Italian-Western film, obviously filmed in the Alps. <br /> <br /> Bret Dixon returns to Blackstone to investigate why his brother was lynched. He is lonely and bandit par excellence, everyone is afraid of him - Mexican bandits (fighting the Gringos who took their land!) And the "honest" citizens who lynched Bret's brother. They lynched him because they thought he had stolen their money instead of bringing him to Dallas for the bank's security. But that's only half the truth, as we discover in this psychologically interesting western. <br /> <br /> But beware, it's a depressing movie because everyone is guilty and definitely everyone. It's bad for the bone ... <br /> <br /> Still, I enjoyed it a lot and gave a 8/10. Strange, there are only less than 5 people who voted for this film as of January 12, 2002 ....
