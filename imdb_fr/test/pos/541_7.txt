This film impressed me because of the quality of the acting and the powerful message contained in the script. Susan Sarandon plays the role of an unstable, irrational and possessive mother, who constantly conveys to her daughter the message that they must stay together. She removes her daughter from a dysfunctional but loving Indiana family to pursue an exciting acting career in Hollywood. The girl is dubious, but at first she has no choice --- the connection with the mother is pathologically strong. <br /> <br /> In the future, the girl realizes that her mother is embarking on fantastic flights and does not have her feet on the ground. She sees her mother go crazy with desire for a seductive and seductive guy who loves them and leaves them. She sees that the mother does not understand. So how can she turn to her mother for advice? <br /> <br /> The mother asks the girl to do a dramatic test and sees the girl play the role of the mother so that a terribly painful mirror is held up to the fly-by-night mother . This causes a period of depression and the girl is horrified by the impact on the mother and apologizes, but the lesson takes root. <br /> <br /> There is a growth of character when the mother realizes her selfish claim on the girl and is finally persuaded to let the girl go. It is a touching scene and a valuable lesson: parents, regardless of their emotional dependence, must let the child go and become their own distinct person.
