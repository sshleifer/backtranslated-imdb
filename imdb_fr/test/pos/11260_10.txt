What can I say? I could not sleep and I came across this movie on MTV. I started to watch it with the intention of changing channels if it started to get lame like so many anti-drug films, but I let myself be drawn into this film and I could not stop looking . Nick Stahl did an incredible job with his character and, in my opinion, he really made the movie interesting to watch. I was interested in buying the soundtrack of the movie (or even the movie itself) and MTV.com was of no help, but believe it or not, Amazon.com accepts pre-orders for the DVD release on August 5th. I know I had trouble locating it and I'm sure others might have had the same problem. I buy my own copy to be able to drool over Nick Stahl while screaming at the same time thanks to the emotional scenario!
