I saw this film for the first time as a teenager when it was released in the cinema a long time ago. When I saw him again, almost 30 years later, I was surprised at how much he held up. The gags are always funny, the interaction between the characters works perfectly and the cameos are doing better than ever. (Steve Martin must be the best.) <br /> <br /> My children (9, 11 and 14 years old) all loved it, and the music is good enough that they still sing songs several days later . <br /> <br /> I would suggest that before you see the movie, you should watch at least half a dozen episodes of the Muppet Show to get an idea of ​​the story behind the characters, otherwise the movie will be won . "It does not make much sense.
