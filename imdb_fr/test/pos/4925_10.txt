You do not have to be a fan of the cartoon series to enjoy this movie. I watched it for the first time at the age of nine, as a fan of the TV show. My parents laughed the same way as me. This is done in the classic style of yesterday's Bugs Bunny cartoons, and given the vulgar cartoons of the moment, I think everyone would enjoy a cartoon movie that relies more on "madness" than on vulgarity, to be well laughed.
