This 1955 film follows Tony The Stephanois, recently released from prison for theft, as he embarks on the theft of his life. He teamed up with his old burglary companions and they brought in an expert, CÃ©sar from Milan (played by Jules Dassin, who also directed in Hollywood.) The brilliance of this film lies in the half-hour of the flight. During all this time, there is no dialogue or music, there is only the dull sound of digging in the ground or piercing the safe. This increases the suspense and attracts you. They fare with jewels worth several hundred million francs, but a jewel offered to a dancer by Caesar draws their attention to a trio of brutal brothers. They went in search of hiding and bad luck. Great butt / gangster movie, but I prefer J.-P. Melville's films in this genre. <br /> <br /> This movie is like a lemonade I had last night. I had been to a Caribbean restaurant and the lemonade was made with sugar cane juice instead of sugar. There was also a lot of ice cream and a lot of lemons, which left it pretty acidic (which I like). The sugar cane juice gave it a subtle and slightly more mellow taste than the sugar itself, and the ice cream guaranteed it was cold and refreshing as I sucked it. 7.5 / 10 http://blog.myspace.com/locoformovies
