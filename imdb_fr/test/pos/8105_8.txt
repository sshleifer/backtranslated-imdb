Once, I filmed about 6 months on Turner Classic Movies for about 20 minutes. I thought every minute of what I was looking at was golden and because it was somewhere in the middle of the film and I did not want to ruin it if I had to watch it from the beginning, I decided to to rent. at once. Well, the video store I frequent did not have a copy, so it took me six months to finally rent it elsewhere. Before this experience, I had only seen a few Chaplin shorts, funny but not very clever, but after seeing the excerpt from The Great Dictator, I watched three of his other films, City Lights, The Gold Rush and Modern Times (City Lights was great, I found the gold rush a little overrated, but it was worth it, and I discovered that Modern Times was one of the funniest movies I've ever seen never seen (the second funniest behind Keaton's Sherlock Jr.) /> <br /> Finally, the Great Dictator as a whole To be honest, he had his moments of comedy and drama. These moments do not always mix well: Chaplin's comedy worked well when mixed with The City Lights is the best example, but it did not always work with social commentaries. The fact that there was a dialogue attenuated the impressive talent of Chaplin. I did not like it, I liked the film as a whole, but I thought it did not matter, I would have given it a solid 7/10 on the rating scale. if not for the end. The last speech of the Jewish barber is extremely powerful. Yes, he addresses the tempora and mores of 1940, but his message is perfectly applicable to the world today. The speech made me cry and I consider it one of the best endings I have ever seen. Final score: 8/10.
