The story unfolds in the streets of Sao Paoulo in Brazil, where a young boy named Pixote grows up alone without his parents. Worried and without direction, Pixote is taken to a children's home with other teenagers. Behind closed doors, terrible things are happening within staff and groups of children. And there's one last trigger that blows up the place, the last incident that makes Pixote and her friends decide to escape and escape. From there, begin an adventure brimming with strong friendships, torn friendships, love and hate, criminal activities and shivers on the beach. Talking about things is something that someone like you and I do sometimes. <br /> <br /> I think this film is perfect in many ways because it touches you on so many levels, he did it with me anyway. The style of document used to represent Pixote and its environment seems more realistic and the actors, who are really street children and have led a similar life, help humanity in these conditions to appear more natural. There is also a social commentary on child abuse, but I think what makes the film so great is that the pressure is on the story and not on the political opinions. The last scene, which I find the best piece of the film, seems to me to be something beyond anything I've seen before. So full of emotions and yet so unenthusiastic, this film is a true story, believable, unbearable and unforgettable. A real heart-rending masterpiece and so underrated! <br /> <br /> My vote: 10/10
