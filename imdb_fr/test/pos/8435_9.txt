China's syndrome is a perfectly rhythmic thriller and not at all slow or boring, as some people tend to say. The transitions from one scene to another are great and the tension mounted in the film will keep you on the edge of your seat for the next two hours. Jack Lemmon is brilliant, as always, as a nervous operator and Jane Fonda once again brings real emotions to the story. You can see this film as a political statement of the time or just as a cleverly crafted thriller. Anyway, it's definitely worth watching.
