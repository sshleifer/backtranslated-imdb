Christine Lahti (Sandy Dunlap) and Mary Tyler Moore (Holly Davis) worked well with tasty material, Ted Danson did his best with a thankless role of Chip Davis. the other a career woman who knows her biological clock. I found the relationship that the character of Ted Danson had with the single woman of the sordid character of Christine Lahti. He behaved decisively, but he left two "widows" crying over him, screaming. I found it disgusting when Sandy told her that she wanted to break up after meeting his wife, he called her to tell him she was missing (did he call his wife? no sign of this). He behaved like a heel. It might have made a better movie if he had not been killed. Maybe the two ladies would have woken up and dropped her. I liked the friendship between the two ladies but she was spoiled by what they had in common: the cad of a husband.
