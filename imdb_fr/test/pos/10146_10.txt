Some people say the pace of this movie is a bit slow, but how is it different from any other Hitchcock movie? They all move very deliberately and, at one point, are thrown jets of suspense and brilliant montages. This film gives us just the right amount of comic relief that makes the suspense scenes all the more suspenseful. The Albert Hall scene is one of the best examples of Pure Cinema in Hitchcock's collection (probably the best of all "Rear Window"). "Pure Cinema for Hitchcock" meant a series of small pieces of film perfectly assembled without dialogue, to tell the story in a visual way. This is of course the basic definition of the Albert Hall sequence, as well as the shorter stair sequence at the end of the photo. <br /> <br /> Not a lot of Hitchcock skips here, and the acting is superb, especially Doris Day in a rather surprisingly serious role.
