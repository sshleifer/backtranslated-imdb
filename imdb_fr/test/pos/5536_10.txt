Married To The Mob was one of the first VHS tapes I had with Coming To America and Grease. I still have fond memories of this movie after all these years. Damn, I still have the video of this movie in good condition. <br /> <br /> The Story: Undercover cop Mike Downey (Matthew Modine) is sent to spy on Angela De Marco (Michelle Pfeiffer), the wife of the murdered mafia member Frank "Cucumber" De Marco (Alec Baldwin ). Later, he falls in love with her after he realizes she was innocent in all of this. Angela must not only deal with the undesirable advances of the mafia boss Tony "The Tiger" Russo (Dean Stockwell), she must also face his jealous wife Connie Russo (Mercedes Ruehl). <br /> <br /> Married To The crowd is funny and continues to spark your interest when you're not trying to be funny. I like the little jabs you need in the mafia life (the jealous wife of the mafia, the mafia boss who does not realize he is not a magnet, etc.) and you like the characters of Angela De Marco and Mike Downey. It was the last part of Johnathan Demme's fun phase before he became serious and gave you gems like Philadelphia and Silence Of The Lambs (best thriller of all time). If you're in the mood for comedy, Married To The Mob is a keeper. It's better than rubbish that is considered comedy nowadays (Epic Movie, Date Movie, Meet The Spartans, Disaster Movie, etc.).
