When I was younger, I saw the end of HAIR on television. I just watched the last 5 minutes of the movie. And that really impressed me. I got goosebumps and I thought I should watch this movie. <br /> <br /> And I did it, and I have to say: this movie is amazing. The songs are great, the actors are very good and the message ... The message of this film is one of the most important: "Make love, no war". This film is a true masterpiece. In the meantime, it's my favorite movie. <br /> <br /> The last song is one of the saddest and happiest I have ever listened to. I could almost feel myself joining the crowd. All I have to say: "Let the sun shine, let the sun shine"
