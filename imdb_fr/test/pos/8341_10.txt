Too many Christian films have focused on fear of judgment and have therefore seemed condescending and undisciplined. "Second Glance" does things well. It is an almost perfect evangelical tool; this is the real reason why so many young people do not want to have anything to do with Christianity. This assures viewers that they must give up their sin - not their pleasure - to succeed in the Christian lifestyle. "Second Glance" works even like a movie. The filmmakers were obviously working on a very small budget, but they managed to write a script that was dynamic enough to distract viewers from this obvious fact. This film brought me to my Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, and thanks to the Christian stations that show it everywhere, he surely touched more people than me.
