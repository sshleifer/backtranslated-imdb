Well, unlike most people ... I went in this movie expecting it to be not so good and it turned out to be a great movie. It's a pretty cool scenario, I like the idea, but what really made this movie is the actors. they all did an amazing job and it was pretty cool to see Fishburn and Dillon working together. It's a film where we immediately think that we can predict what will happen, but that the results are not as convincing. I do not want to reveal anything about the story, so I will not do it ... but I suggest giving it a chance. If you have seen the movie Money Train and appreciated that you would like this movie. Maybe all that Lawrence Fishburn touches is in gold?
