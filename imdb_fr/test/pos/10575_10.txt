It was indeed an incredible adaptation. As I missed the first episode, I unfortunately missed the link between the characters and the fluidity of the scenario. But as soon as I watched the second, then the third installment, I was blown away. I ordered the DVD less than a week later and unable to wait for his coming, I went out and brought the book. From the moment I opened it, I became hooked, I just could not let it down. I decided to finish the whole book before daring to watch the DVD. I preferred the book because it penetrated into the characters' minds, you could perfectly understand where they came from and what their role in history was. They missed the adaptation a lot, which was disappointing because the book is a centerpiece and I think they could have done it superbly if they had been able to stretch it over a longer period. But given that we can only settle in a slot of 3 hours, I think it's excellent. He brilliantly followed the twisted story. And the actors who were registered as main characters were incredible! The scene of love was pure beautiful. It was so tender and loving and it showed how much homosexual love can be natural. I was totally blown away with the adaptation of the book and television! I loved Sarah Waters' two previous novels and found the Tipping the Velvet adaptation quite enjoyable. But when I read and watched Fingersmith, I knew that none of his previous novels / adaptations could beat him. Sarah Waters has indeed exceeded this time! I recommend you watch this adaptation! If Tipping the Velvet was not your thing, do not be discouraged by this one. Fingersmith is a brand new ball game. It's a beautiful twisted but dark story about love, greed and betrayal ... <br /> <br /> SEE!
