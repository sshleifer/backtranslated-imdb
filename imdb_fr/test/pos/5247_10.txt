Contrary to the comment posted directly below, The Big Trail (1930) was not filmed in a three-camera process "very similar to that of the last Cinerama". It was the final of Napoleon (1927), a totally different film! The Big Trail was shot simultaneously in the 35mm and 70mm (Size) versions. Both versions are released from time to time on Fox Movie Channel, so it's easy to compare them. The version Grandeur (circulated in a mailbox containing approximately its original report 2-1) is more impressive from a cinematographic point of view with its wide-angle panoramas, but suffers from the same problem that prevailed at the beginning of CinemaScopes, a lack of close-ups imposed on director Raoul Walsh in concentration problems. Scenes featuring people rather than crowds or close-ups are much more effective in the standard version, as the camera can get closer to the players, creating a greater sense of involvement for the viewer. Looking at both versions simultaneously, we have a clear idea of ​​the plans that Walsh chose to take close-up, in the standard version, but could not, in the version Grandeur. There are also some sequences involving El Brendel: a go-anywhere game with Ian Keith, and some business with his wife and a donkey, which are in the Grandeur version, but lacking in the standard version. <br /> <br /> For The Disc, The Big Trail is the only one of Fox's three films to have survived in its original widescreen format. (The other two are Fox Movietone Follies of 1929, completely lost, and Happy Days, which only survive in the standard format.) Other studios also experimented with wide-ranging films at that time, but the only other known to exist in both formats is The Bat Whispers, filmed in 65mm and 35mm formats, and released by United Artists. Billy the Kid (1930) and The Great Meadow (1931), RKO (Danger Lights) (1930) and WB's The Lash (1930), featured in the standard version of Turner Classic Films, are also among the larger films. . Kismet (1930) of WB was also filmed both wide and standard, but seems to have completely disappeared; the rumor says to lose it. <br /> <br /> Why did the broad film fail in 1930? The theaters were shocked by the stock market crash of October 1929 and the exorbitant costs of installing sound equipment, and thus prevented the additional cost of installing new projection equipment and new screens. wide just a handful of movies, photographed in a variety of different systems that were not even always compatible with each other. It will not be until 1953 that Fox, now Twentieth Century-Fox, will attempt again to succeed this time with the introduction of CinemaScope on the big screen.
