This show must be my favorite among all horror TV shows of the 80s. Like the tales of Darkside, also of the same creators, this show is a rare gem. If you agree with me, THANK YOU for signing this petition that I started, in order to spread the word for Monsters and distribute it on DVD. Here is the address of the petition: www.petitiononline.com/19784444/petition.html Some of my favorite episodes should be Glim Glim and Rain Dance. I also liked the opening intro with the monster family. It scared me! One of the things I should ask DVD creators to include would be the organ sound heard just before the commercial break. I do not know if any of you remember this part, but it's one of the main things that reminds me of memories. I mean, come on! The TV series of War of the Worlds has already been released on DVD, so I say Monsters, as well as Tales from the Darkside, and the series should also air on Friday the 13th! We, the fans, must express our opinion! We need this awesome show on DVD so please, spread the word !!!
