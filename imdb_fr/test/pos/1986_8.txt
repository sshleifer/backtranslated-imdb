I've always thought that a movie whose plot is centered on a virtual reality video game never sounds like it's going to be something special, but eXistenZ has proven that I could not be more wrong. This film is amazing and, while very entertaining, offers much more than that. From beginning to end, this film has conceptualized you to the point where you can have so many ideas that you can not draw a final conclusion. David Cronenberg has a talent for this because he does a lot of things. <br /> <br /> eXistenZ is pure Cronenberg; the way he is written and directed is very particular to his style and that can only be a good thing. Cronenberg set a clear target with this film and was to let the audience guess what he did with apparent ease. His taste for the grotesque is not as prominent in this film as in The Fly or Naked Lunch, but some elements, such as game modules and their manufacturing, can make the audience sound. Regarding his previous work, eXistenZ is more a combination of videodrome and less violent scanners, a rather impressive combination. Placing the film in the not-too-distant future was a very good decision because it allowed Cronenberg to be extremely imaginative with the film environment and also allowed him to visualize more concepts, thus enabling a less inhibited writing. It was important that the film does not get too confused and Cronenberg avoids it very well by keeping things relatively simple. In addition, if he wanted to make an unassailable film, he could do it much better than that. <br /> <br /> eXistenZ has an extremely talented casting of character actors and all behave very well. Jennifer Jason Leigh gives unparalleled performance as a game designer who spends more time out of reality than in. Leigh is sexy and has a leading role in her role as Allegra and she is really interested in the role. The range of emotions she shows in the film is particularly impressive, making her totally believable (if you can believe anything). Jude Law is also good and is very convincing in fear of the implantation of his character. The chemistry between these two is very electric and gives the film a little extra flavor. Ian Holm and Willem Dafoe are just two of the big supporting actors who add depth to the film with colorful performances. The cast of the film is not huge, but eXistenZ definitely has the ethics "quality is better than quantity" which works very well. <br /> <br /> In addition to being entertaining and challenging, eXistenZ addresses social issues such as control and self-loss. This again demonstrates the film as an intellectual vessel and could also explain why it was not a huge Hollywood success. eXistenZ has a lot to offer and even though everyone does not like it, those who like Cronenberg's work or who love science fiction will be sure to love this movie. It's one of those films you have to watch with an open mind, but it's really something special.
