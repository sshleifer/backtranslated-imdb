If you have never experienced the thing that is Zasu Pitts, here is a Zasu Zinger! In 1933, Mae Questel caricatured Pitt's voice for the character Olive Oyl for the cartoon version of Fleischer's Popeye comics. Zasu (pronounced Zay-Sue) does his best imitation "Olive Oyl" wandering moaning and clapping his hands or attaching himself to the policeman's laynard. I was still waiting for her to say "ohhh myyyy", but it's "something that always happens to someone". The first time I saw this movie, I loved Zasu and found his character really funny. Since then, I have seen her in other movies where she does the same routine moaning, tense, fragile flowers. So, after watching this movie again, I started to be a little annoyed by the consternation of the complaints and the quasi-hysteria around a piece of dust. But, there are some funny comedy tracks here, and it's also a mystery movie. It's an interesting mix of mystery and comedy that actually works. The mystery intrigue holds well in the camp of Zasu Pitts and James Gleason who interprets the policeman Arthur Crimmer. The haunted house is fun with many secret passages and even a skeleton in the attic! Well worth the watch. Read more reviews of public domain movies at: http://pdmoviereview.blogspot.com/
