The film took a bit of trouble playing with the facts. But that will almost put you in an era and place that no longer exist by getting * feeling *. <br /> <br /> As Keith Richards mentions in Paul McCartney's movie about Holly, Buddy Holly is almost all rock done since his day. The tragedy that prevailed is treated gently and the rest of the film recreates the joy of a great musical career and a happy musical body. <br /> <br /> Gary Busey makes a remarkable and energetic portrait of Holly, and his performances suggest that he really gets into the music. As a long time Holly fan and rocker, me too.
