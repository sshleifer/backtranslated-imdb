Oz is without a doubt my favorite show of all time! the best word to describe it is "genius"! the writing, the acting, the stories ... all this show is absolutely amazing! <br /> <br /> I just discovered the series and I became addicted to it right away. I am really surprised that he did not get the recognition he really deserves. It's violent, and most characters are not made for you to like them, but the series is written in such a brilliant way that you can look beyond violence and criminals and see them as real people. These are the lowest forms of foam, but he always finds a way to allow you to understand a lot of characters and even to worry about their stories. <br /> <br /> Violence in the show is necessary to make it as realistic as possible, but the show does not deal with violence, as some might think. It is truly a work of art and I am sure that whoever gives it a chance will love it as much as me.
