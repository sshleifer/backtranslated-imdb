This film is simply one of the best movies I have the privilege of owning. It took me years to make this movie and it was well worth it. The film is supposed to be an anti-drug propaganda but turns into its opposite even if it is not halfway through the film. The delighted look on the faces of the players who receive their premium of drugs appeals to all those who observe. Until the final phase of their drug-induced lives, heroin has a say. YIKES! This is the anti-drug message that has been so fabulously sought after. The soundtrack of this movie is fucked! By far, this is one of Pink Floyds' best albums! If ever the opportunity, take a look, listen and take the time to watch a film of spectacular quality.
