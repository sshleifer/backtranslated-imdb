* EXPECT OTHER SPOILERS * <br /> <br /> A friend told me to watch this series, and I'm glad I took her words for her. <br /> <br /> I read the synopsis on the DVD cover and I was immediately intrigued. The main protagonist is Muslim? Not at all, it's a first! This is an FBI agent who is deeply safe to enter a possible dormant cell in Los Angeles; and get this - he is a practicing Muslim. I was a little skeptical at first, half expecting if a hero or the antagonist might be speaking fanatical drones more stupid, free and stupider than ever ... ... let's face it, a lot shows were guilty. <Br/> <br /> But then, I watched the first three episodes and thought, well, that's fine. Only until episode 4 ("Scholar") where I was really impressed. I would like to congratulate for the quality of the writing and also, superb performances of the actors. I love the complexity of each of these characters - they are not two-dimensional cardboard cutouts good or bad. Michael Ealy gives a wonderful and credible performance as FBI member Darwyn Al-Sayeed, crossing the line between being a good Muslim and being a man with flaws. Oded Fehr gives his character an interesting depth - Farik is not the typical oily stereotype of the Middle East, but simply someone who really believes in his cause and does not see himself as a fanatic, but a man willing to take all extreme measures to justify his beliefs. He is very charismatic and authoritative. But I would say that it is the performance of Alex Nesic that has clearly left an impression in me in "Scholar". His description of his character's emotional struggle was incredible - torn between the soft words of a Muslim scholar urging him to return to the non-aggressive path because it was the only way acceptable to God and the persuasion of Farik to believe the opposite. <Br /> <br /> I'm looking forward to seeing more shows like this, not a ridiculously high series of one man show. It's smart and open-minded.
