Vg Brit rom-com, to watch if you can get your hands on a copy. Odd and often surprising, this is not the best of Brady's movies (Kiss Kiss Bang Bang is by far the funniest), although it has a unique charm. Well written, the story turns after a few dead ends, but most of the time surfaced with a new plot. You know from the beginning how this will end, but when it comes, it will be an honest and open end, a realistic and credible end, the end seemed like a start, nice and let me want more.
