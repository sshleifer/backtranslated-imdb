Archbishop Desmond Tutu, who is rarely my favorite, said everyone should see this movie because it's something that can help heal the world .... <br /> <br /> It's one of the most poignant films I've read and commented on Tutu's comments ... I read many comments and even if they go from good to average to comments on the choice of actors ... The fact is that it is one of the most extraordinary events of our world. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission ... for the first time, a country has chosen to trace its horrible story, find a way forward and create a cure for the population ... <br /> <br /> > The film begins with a white policeman who is offered the opportunity to absolve himself for brutal crimes and the black man tries to make sure that he will not escape, he plunges into the humanity of the people and the Huge need to heal Everyone needs .... <br /> <br /> Definitely, a boost ..... To everyone involved .... Once again, I'm proud of to be South African ..... <br /> <br /> An interesting comment can be found here: http://www.biz-community.com/Article/196/97/5223.html
