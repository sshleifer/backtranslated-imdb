This is by far the funniest sitcom ever on TV. I have all 9 seasons on DVD and could watch them again and again. Anyone who does not find this show hilarious, comforting, entertaining and bursts with hysterical laughter is crazy! Kevin James is absolutely one of the most talented comedians. My boyfriend and I love watching comedy shows in Boston (where we live) and seeing Kevin James twice and his brother Gary Valentine (Danny) once. They are both incredibly talented and simply plan intelligently with their work. There are so many comedians who are terrible and Kevin and Gary really show the true side of real comedy. Leah Remini, although posh and slutty in real life (if I read) is an incredible actress and deserves more credit than any other woman in sitcoms. She really does the show ... with Jerry Stiller! This show is a must and you will become addicted in one to two episodes!
