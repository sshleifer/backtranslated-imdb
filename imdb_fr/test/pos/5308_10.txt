The United States of Leland was an incredible movie. I kept putting the guide on my TV, not knowing what it was and never having the chance to stay there and enter it. Then one morning, when I woke up early, I saw that he was about to start. So I decided to watch it. I had the time and interest to watch it. When I saw that Ryan Gosling was in the movie and he was the main character, I was immediately sucked and I could not move from my couch. The fight Leland is going through is such an inspiring story. Everyone has to deal with the same kind of thoughts throughout their life, whether it's a small minor detail or something as big as it goes through. I have to sit down and watch the movie again just to catch everything I may have missed the first time. As a general rule ... I would recommend this film to all Gosling fans or those who like a good movie with a real good story. The fact that there are so many other big stars who have all had great performances is simply a BONUS added! So do what you can to take the time to watch this movie, I can almost be sure it will not be a waste of time.
