I do not know why some people complain that this film is not a comedy and that it is at the same time too unrealistic. If that had been realistic, there certainly would not have been a lot of comedy. I do not think a comedy should make you laugh aloud twenty times. There was a lot of subtle humor, sweet feelings and Kim Frank had just described a dream character. In real life, there are a lot of people whose facial expressions do not change much, so Kim Frank kept him well. The end was pretty unrealistic, I would say, but happy. It's a light film with a happy ending. I liked it. Beloved, actually. The worst thing was that Krueger went to Schwedt and I'm glad they did not show what happened to him. To show how he was when he came back is clearly alluded to.
