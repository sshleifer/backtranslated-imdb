Do you remember that college friend who always insisted that you rent the strangest movie possible? This is the film he would have made if he had the chance. <br /> <br /> I would like to be able to explain exactly what Sea of ​​Dust is all about. He claims to be the story of a doctor who got caught up in strange activities in the "Black Forest". He goes there to help, but ends up being caught between two young women, for whom he seems to have a weakness for. But that only scratches the surface. It's the kind of movie where things happen just at random ... and not a good thing. People are constantly flogged and stabbed. There is a pair of scary girls who seem to have left The Shining. Tom Savini is a sort of imaginary religious figure who decides to no longer be imaginary. He has a plan to conquer the world by sharing the suffering of Jesus. <br /> <br /> At one level, it's a movie about sex. It is a film without nudity, which was disappointing, but the intention can not be confused. On another level, it is the paradise of the stone. Unexpected things happen so often that it stops being unexpected. At the moment when the doctor goes to the birth canal of his girlfriend to be reborn, it will be enough for you to put it in the account of the madness of the film. <br /> <br /> The disadvantage is that the film is rather verbose. Some points are hammered repeatedly. If you look at it with a group of stoned friends, it could be an asset.
