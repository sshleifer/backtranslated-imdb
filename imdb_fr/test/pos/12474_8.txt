After seeing this for the first time, I thought, "Wow, this is the most spectacular movie I've ever seen visually." Since then, I have seen some that exceed expectations, but he remains one of the best in this department. I'm just disgusted by the long-awaited DVD that was so badly made, the quality of this transfer is not much better than that of the VHS tape. <br /> <br /> The scenes of the jungle are filmed in Cameroon, and "lush" is the best adjective to describe what you see. Apart from the sounds of the jungle, "seeing" is certainly almost at the beginning, because there is almost no "hearing", no dialogue as long as Tarzan (Christopher Lambert) is not a friend, Ian Holm and vice-president. versa ... so be prepared for that, if you have not watched this movie. <br /> <br /> As far as history goes, all I'll say is that it's not the Tarzan that many of us have come to know in Johnny Weismuller's films. .... but it's not a complaint. If you want action and you do not care about cinematography, just go beyond this period of silent introduction. <br /> <br /> In this version of Tarzan, our hero returns to Scotland (his roots), adapts to this environment (most of the time ... and a bit too fast to be credible, frankly), then go back to the jungle without Jane. This is supposed to be more true of the Tarzan books, written by Edgar Rice Burroughs. <br /> <br /> The special effects here were created by Rick Baker, one of the best in the industry. DVD net or not, it's still an amazing movie to see and very interesting throughout its 2 hours and 15 minutes.
