I just wanted to say that I watch National Velvet on television, we are in February 2006 and I checked the dates, and so on. Amazing to see that this was done in 1944 and Rooney was 24 years old while Liz Taylor only 12 years old she is an accomplished English actress. <br /> <br /> To give reason to some American contributors: There are no Irish villages in England. Ireland is a completely different country and has absolutely nothing to do with the English countryside. The scenes shown are supposed to be taken on the south coast of England between Brighton and Arundel (county of Sussex). Unfortunately, no scene of this type exists now. As in many other places, roads and buildings were built on hills and beaches. <br /> <br /> So, please, dear Americans, never confuse Ireland with England! we make a big exception to that. Like confusing Texas with Coney Island.
