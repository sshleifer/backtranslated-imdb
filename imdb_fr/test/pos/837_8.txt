After finishing the Zero Woman series, I was looking forward to the series Female Prisoner Scorpion; both based on Tooru Shinohara comics. Unfortunately, I was not able to see them in order because this is the third in the series. <br /> <br /> It starts very well while The Scorpion (Meiko Kaji) escapes from the police. Detective Kondo (Mikio Narita) managed to catch her, but she cut off her arm and escaped. If that was not enough, a dog then raises his arm and is seen trotting in the street before finding a place to taste his treats. <br /> <br /> Scorpion could just as easily go back to prison as to life. there is no picnic outside. First, a local Yakuza Tanida (v) threatens to send her away if she does not turn it off; and then the gang leader picks her up when she gets rid of Tanida. But they do not hold her long before she escapes and seeks revenge. <br /> <br /> Soon, they fall like flies. Some certainly deserved it because they wore screamy outfits with shirt collars so big that they went all the way to the shoulder. Madam (Reisen Lee) goes to avoid being killed. <br /> <br /> Police come to their last kill and the sewer trap. She has been there for a week and the police find out that a friend (Yayoi Watanabe) is providing her with food. (The story O Yuki (Watanabe) and her brother is a very interesting secondary plot, but only incidental to the movie.) They try to burn her, but that's The Scorpion, and she has some unfinished business. <Br /> <br /> Not the usual mixture of sex and violence, it's a slow and beautiful tale.
