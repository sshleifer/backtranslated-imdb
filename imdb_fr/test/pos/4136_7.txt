It would be unwise to judge that this story or documentary is more authentic than the other. Both formats have an underlying form of fiction and never reflect reality as producers seek to reconstruct and tell stories from their perspective. Since both formats generally leave some unresolved issues because of the "complexity of secondary intrigues" and the time spent in front of the screen, viewers do not have the opportunity to open debates, to investigate further and to build the truth. By adding to the viewer's inability to evaluate sources (comparisons with written history, for example) and the logic behind the arguments, the story can be distorted by storytelling and documentary. <br /> <br /> For most people, the documentary can be considered more truthful. as this usually involves the testimonials of actual participants and real life sequences. However, these visuals are selected and edited to allow producers to present their version of realism to viewers. In The Real Buddy Holly Story, Paul McCartney seeks to establish the Buddy Holly as family and friends recall and to emphasize Buddy's influence on the rest of the music world. Testimonies may have been distorted, memories may not be accurate and emotions have evolved to make Buddy a legend. The documentary made corrections to the version of the film and covers other events, like 3 members of Crickets and that Buddy's music was heard outside the United States at that time (he had to engage in a tour of the world!). However, there was no mention of what happened to Buddy's wife after her death. Criticism and / or negative discussions may have been omitted from the documentary as the producers seek to introduce a friend the world should have remembered. In the end, we fail to construct the truth as a whole, because we limit ourselves to the "realities" of the past that the documentary tells us. <br /> <br /> Personally, I prefer a narrative film because it provides rich images. , which helps us to reconnect with the collective memory of this time. This gives the public a more constructive structure of the story, which results in better retention of memory for the public when it tells the story. There is also an element of flexibility that allows filmmakers to express their thoughts and points of view on certain issues. In The Buddy Holly Story, race issues have been highlighted and viewers can certainly understand them based on the current situation. <br /> <br /> Movie lovers are constantly looking to revisit certain emotions when they watch and use a film, and the public can choose to establish personal links with the applied meanings that a filmmaker wants to translate. In most stories, people are more likely to remember selectively struggles, inspirations and the way the story ends. In The Buddy Holly Story, we remember the struggles that Buddy and the crickets had, the way Maria was a source of encouragement and the fact that Buddy Holly was an excellent performer until the day of his death.
