I saw this movie when it came out. Patty did not want to be separated from her siblings. However, the juvenile justice system does not care. When Patty reviewed the file, the judge sent her to a juvenile detention center. He claimed that she broke the rules of privacy by consulting private records. She just wanted her family together. I could not blame him. The parents were not even fit. One of the youngest children had to have a toilet. The father stopped and left them. He pushed him away and left the children alone at the gas station. Patty had to take the authority to protect them because she was the oldest. They were placed in foster homes. The good part is that the social worker has recovered them as a family. The chief social worker told him to quit and not to intervene. He was crazy about power. He had Patty placed in the juvenile facility. Why did not they go after the father, who was released from prison, for abandonment? Yet, children are caught in the middle and do not feel safe.
