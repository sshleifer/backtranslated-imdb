Driving Lessons is a British version of Harold and Maude, in which Rupert Grint was reformed and Julie Walters, a super player. While it's true that Grint has a stone face like a red-haired Benjamin Braddock for the first half of the movie, it does not dissuade the quirky family movie - there are things going on out of his character's experience that could shockingly react . The chemistry between Walters and Grint brings the film, although Laura Linney's hard work to make her human stereotype written is also remarkable. These performances, combined with a fun poppy soundtrack with artists such as Sufjan Stevens, John Renbourn and Salsa Celtica, make this movie for children's popcorn a Saturday afternoon.
