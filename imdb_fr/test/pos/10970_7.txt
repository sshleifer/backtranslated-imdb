The year 1959 marked a turning point in the world of cinema. Several great directors of the classical era published classics that ranked their career among the best. Just take a look at the titles. Hitchcock, North By Northwest, Billy Wilder, Someone It Hot, Rio Bravo, Howard Hawks, Imitation of Life by Douglas Sirk. Add to that a couple from the previous year, Orson Welles' Touch of Evil, Hitch's Vertigo and The Wind through Nick Ray's Everglades, and you get a pretty good summary of what was possible in the classic Hollywood style. <br /> <br /> At the same time, two films appeared, alluding to a whole new way of making movies. One was out of breath Jean-Luc Godard, the other was John Cassavetes Shadows. The two films had some common points: largely improvised actors, portable cameras, small budgets and a certain young jazzy swagger. In some respects, however, they could not be further away. Godard was still convinced that the director was a referee of style. He knew more about cinema than most Hollywood producers and Breathless was full of the iconography of the classic detective film. Cassavetes, meanwhile, was an actor and refugee from New York's theatrical scene. His first film shows him little impressed by the cinema and great supporter of the actors. Godard's film constantly refers to his own artifice, while Shadows aims for a certain naturalism. <br /> <br /> He does not reach it, mainly because naturalism is a myth, especially in the cinema. But he feels powerful, kinetic but punctuated like the cool jazz of the score, certainly the main inspiration of the cinematographic style presented here. This does not hold, mainly because the actors of Cassavetes here are amateur beatniks, where the style of Cassavetes requires strong and imaginative actors. His later work with Gena Rowlands, Ben Gazarra and Peter Falk put him out of the water. Due to the director's technical inexperience, some pieces of dialogue had to be rebroadcast later, which hampers the freshness of the improvisation. It's still fascinating to watch, both for the big moments (like the scene where Leila Goldoni talks about her disappointment at the loss of her virginity) and to watch a revolutionary artist make his way.
