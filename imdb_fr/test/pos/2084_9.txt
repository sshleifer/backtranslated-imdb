Robert Florey and James Wong Howe gave him a frightening expressionist look. The scenes are shot from strange angles - especially scenes involving the figurative and literal woman killer Zachary Scott. His sociopathic behavior foreshadows another superb, medium-budget film, "The Stepfather", more than two decades old. <br /> <br /> The entire cast is excellent, although (without being his fault), it's hard to think. of Joyce Compton like anyone except the singer in "The Awful Truth".) Scott, Bennett, Emerson, DeCamp (especially, and although playing an older woman looks gorgeous) - they would not have could be exceeded. <br /> Building a scary story of women living with women versus psychiatrists is a risky trick that pays off. Nothing tacky at all. Nothing tacky at all. <br /> <br /> The resolution is unfortunately a little exaggerated. It's not Emerson who meets with Bennett. It makes sense. But Scott is sent too fast. I see him more as a character of Mr. Ripley, who could have escaped everything - botulism, murder, jealous sisters - and disappear into the big world beyond this story. This would not have prevented the secretary and her boss from finally meeting with a happy ending.
