Kevin Spacey again chooses a winner with K-PAX, an endearing film that expresses profound revelations about human existence through the naive and yet unquestionably wise viewpoint of Prot's character. <br /> It is a pleasure to try to determine "whether or not" as the plot develops and the character of Robert Porter materializes. Some may find the end a bit unsatisfactory, but in reality it could not have been otherwise. <br /> <br /> My few problems with the film revolve around the rather simplistic and overly simplistic description of patients with mental disorders. I was surprised because the movie plot shows a lot of intelligence and I do not think it would have lost anything by being more honest about the behavior of people with mental health issues. <br /> <br /> That said, I realize it was a film and not a documentary and the film itself is beautifully shot and the story unfolds at a nice pace. <br /> <br /> The bridges are excellent and Spacey offers a languorous and relaxed performance, more like a stand-up than an alien. <br /> <br /> A good movie that will make you talk with your friends.
