It's a very good film. I give it a 10. <br /> <br /> It's very different in that it's a kind of long stalking scene. The fact that the main character is silent is used very credibly throughout the story. <br /> <br /> She sees a murder (for a snuff film) and decides to run, but is pursued (it takes time). I will not reveal the rest of the film because it would spoil the experience, but rest assured: it is very credible, well played, very intense, with beautiful surprises and a beautiful ending. <br /> <br /> Don 'do not miss this movie.
