My curiosity and patience to finally see this controversial film, which just released on DVD for the first time in the UK, have been more than rewarded. Peter Watkins has distinguished himself by his boldness and technical skills. This pseudo-documentary is certainly ahead of its time, still topical scary and updated. <br /> <br /> The film is inspired by the upheaval of the late sixties in the United States, when the government increased its legitimized use of violence and oppression, as the anti-war movement reacts. more and more violently and radically. To deal with both prison overcrowding and the specific training of riot police units, the government has set up what are known as punishment parks. The "criminals" sentenced, mainly militants, have the "choice" either to be imprisoned for years, or to spend three days in one of these parks, where they get either their death sentence or a penalty of imprisonment even longer. . The situation in the parks, however, exceeds their worst expectations. It reminded me of a sort of realistic version of Battle Royale (2000). <br /> <br /> The structure of the film is extremely effective and reminds us of parallels with the Cannibal Holocaust, made almost 10 years later. Both films are constructed and filmed in such a way that the viewer is led to think and feel that he is watching a real documentary. He is shocked, even though he is aware of the fact that it is a film. Both confront us with the inherently violent nature of humanity, but where the Cannibal Holocaust is devoid of profound meaning (it is above all an exploitation film in every sense of the word) and does not raise crucial questions about the state of the world. That's exactly what Punishment Park does. <br /> <br /> I was deeply impressed by Punishment Park and I can not believe that such a powerful and important film could have been rejected and marginalized for so long. Maybe that says enough about the truth of its content, about the functioning of power structures in this world. I do not agree with the criticism that Watkins polarizes and stereotypes, because the film depicts activists and guardians of legitimate power structures that are in fact as polarized as these. If they were not, there would be no conflict and no change in our societies. In fact, clashes between these two groups often take stereotypical forms, whether they are activists and institutions in Latin America, Russia or New York. If these groups do not become polarized towards these extremes, the militants would be part of the silent majorities who complain tacitly but who reside at the same time in the injustices of the world. <br /> <br /> As Peter Watkins tells us about the introduction on the DVD, the Punishment Park actors are mostly amateurs. Most of the children were real Los Angeles activists, most of the police were part of the national forces and even some of the court members were part of the social and political establishment of the time. Not presenting both groups before shooting scenes in the improvised courtroom adds to the spontaneous and improvised sensation. Parallels are drawn with problems of the time, such as the repression of Black Panther members (one of the black prisoners would look like the charismatic bumeadeader sentenced, Bobby Seale) and the Chicago Seven trial. <br /> <br /> I admire Watkins' obvious and sincere commitment to injustice and its concern for human rights and the increasingly repressive measures taken by governments (nowadays name of the terrorist war) to silence those who do not agree and who refuse to brainwash. Punishment Park remains an extremely important film that should be shown in schools and seen by all those who share these concerns. Maybe its marginalization can finally be compensated.
