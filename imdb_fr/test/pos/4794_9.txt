Luis Bunuel has always been a filmmaker whose work was obscure to me. My first experience with him was the discreet charm of Bourgeose, often considered his greatest job, with which I became so frustrated and bored that I ended up closing the tape. Similarly, Belle de Jour, which is certainly his most famous film and generally considered one of his many masterpieces, did not interest me at all. I did not hate it like I did Discreet, but I did not like it. Third, I saw The Golden Age. Finally, I arrived somewhere. Fourth, Los Olvidados, also good. Nevertheless, neither L'Age d'Or nor Los Olvidados impressed me. Great movies, but not masterpieces. <br /> <br /> Nazarin is my fifth Bunuel, and I like a little more than these two others. This is a Spanish priest in Mexico who refuses to live in the luxury that most priests live. He wants to be more like Jesus, leading the sweetest life possible. He is also ready to forgive everyone and to suffer without protesting. I'm pretty sure Bunuel does not understand the character and sees him rather pious. However, I guess only because of my knowledge of the director, whose best known quote is "Thank God, I'm still an atheist", that he apparently would have quoted in an interview devoted to this film (this information comes to me from John Baxter). book on Bunuel, if that interests you). The interviewer who pulled these words out of Bunuel's mouth must have been confused about Nazarin himself. He who was more predisposed to believing in a religious conviction, who knows nothing of Bunuel, could see the priest as a heroic figure. This is especially true if the viewer has his own criticisms of organized religion. The priest may be a little selfish, but he seems to be basically a good man. When she hosts a violent prostitute in her room to protect her (and presumably to save her soul), people begin to discover and assume that their relationship is sexual. His superiors assume the same thing and punish him for it. Later, he suffers even worse punishments from religious.
