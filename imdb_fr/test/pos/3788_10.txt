In one of Charlie Chaplin's best feature films, he places the little comrade in the trenches of the First World War, where he brings his intolerable politeness and endless patience to the chore of life in the trenches, where the troops have lived for months before finally reaching the top to overtake the enemy, and usually to their death. As a comedian, Chaplin needs acting skills to turn such brilliant comedy into trench warfare, but the irony he uses in the film makes even the most uncomfortable conditions very entertaining. <br /> <br /> All of Chaplin's best movies, short films and more, this one is filled with brilliant and memorable scenes, such as the scene where he scores the kill with a piece of chalk on a chalkboard in the trench, erasing it when he recovers his helmet exploded, the scene where he and his comrades slept under the water, opening the beer bottle and lighting the cigarette, and well sure the passing of the enemy. All these scenes are scenes of show that recall the most wonderful scenes of Chaplin. This one must not be missed!
