Nothing like it was seen on television at that time and probably will never be again. From the first image of this police light that blinded you and from there, you heard the words: "police squad - in color", you were shocked to see that it was not in any case an ordinary sitcom. <br /> <br /> kill a "Guest Star" and never refer to him again, where did you see him before? Then, the show started and if you do not pay attention, you will miss several jokes in the background. Do not be too careful about something or you'll be sorry. It was the show for which video recorders were made, long before Married with children or the Simpsons. <br /> <br /> Stories do not make sense and the dialogue is sometimes so strange that you have to think about it. for 5 minutes before realizing it was a joke. <br /> <br /> The characters Frank Drebin and Ed Hocken came out of Dragnet and they were absolutely straight (no accent or funny expressions), but instead of word games and twisted. phrases played absolutely impassible. Only once, if I remember correctly, had a segment been played for laughs - a scene involving a trip to a dentist, an aspiration and a lot of saliva. <br /> <br /> There were tedious moments, like that of the informant. Johnny and an appearance of a celebrity. It was strictly a joke, but they had to use it in all six episodes. Never mind. All can not be perfect. What's important is that the rest of the time you started crying with laughter. <br /> <br /> Leslie Nielsen was fortunate to see his career revived when he put the character of Frank Drebin in three summer Achilles heels too. Do you remember seeing it in anything except from Naked Gun type work? And do not count the terrible Mr. Magoo reworked for live action. He probably made a lot of money, though.
