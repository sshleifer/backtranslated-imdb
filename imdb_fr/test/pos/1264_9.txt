Seeing this at the Hong Kong International Film Festival more than three years ago. I went there without any expectations since Christopher Nolan was not a name at the time, but it seemed interesting and turned out to be one of the best things I saw at this festival. It worked well on the big screen, with the technique of cutting scenes out of sequence, adding to the mood. Mr.Nolan gave a good account of his work at the end, enough to put someone apart from his debut as a filmmaker! I liked it better than Memento, although it may have been due to lower expectations. And the fact that it's more of a home-made art film.
