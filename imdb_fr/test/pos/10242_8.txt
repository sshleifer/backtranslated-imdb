It's the story of a long, clumsy love. The daily life of a 50-year-old woman and a few people around her is illustrated. His daily life is so ordinary and so routine that I did not know who the real main character was at first. Then the public knows that the woman and a man who was her classmate in high school had a very small connection. The woman did the same job - a dairy and a supermarket kosher - for a long time. There are so many tracks that delivering milk bottles is a very difficult job. The man had married another woman, who is now dying of cancer. He works at the town hall and looks after her at home. They never look at each other or talk to each other, but they never forget each other. <br /> <br /> The original Japanese title means "At times, the days you read books". But of course, when the man said, "Now I want to do what I always wanted to do," it was to hug her and make love to her. She writes to a radio host, "If God gives us time to talk, we need at least a whole day." Dreaming of that day, she sublimated her desire in hard work and reading books. I personally know a woman who has loved a man for many years, even after marrying another and deceased as a result of an accident. Therefore, the frame of the story is not so special. On the contrary, this film describes well the unspoken romances of many ordinary men and women. Through this film, you will remember your lost love story. This is a film with a lasting effect.
