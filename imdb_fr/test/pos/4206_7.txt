Another nice film from Warner. I really liked John Garfield in this film, although I wonder why Cagney was not in the role. Maybe it was too similar to ANGELS WITH DIRTY FACES? I mean, it's another story of Dead End Kids too, but I really enjoyed them here and this movie had a lot of nice comic touches as well as good serious dramas. The boys work very well with Garfield. A beautiful sequence has been the whole scene of "swimming" that starts without worry, but ends up being too close to disaster. <br /> <br /> A negative comment: Claude Rains was very disappointing. As a detective, the handsome actor seemed as out of place here as a nun in a brothel.
