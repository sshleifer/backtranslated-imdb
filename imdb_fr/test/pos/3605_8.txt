Captain Corelli's mandolin is not an Oscar nominee but it was pretty good. I must admit that Mrs. Cruz can really act. She performs a very good performance. In fact, she makes us her boyfriend Tom in the drama. John Hurt was great, as usual. Nicholas Cage seemed to be having fun. I bet he felt he was returning to his roots as an Italian. However, I learned something. One more chapter in The Horrors of Nazi Germany: the many Italian soldiers killed during the time they surrendered to the Allies and Germany.
