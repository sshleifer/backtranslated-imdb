I learned one thing: you have to take this movie as a funny vintage comedy, if you do not want to be disappointed. The movie is nice because it's a delicious comedy. I think the hype has damaged it: the overly glorious Monica Bellucci appears in a few scenes and is not as good as she wanted to let you believe. She has an unnatural sound, wrong: the best actress of this film is Sabrina Impacciatore, who speaks with a perfect Tuscan accent and shines alongside Massimo Ceccherini. Elio Germano is very very good: the most promising young Italian actor, in my opinion. Daniel Auteuil looks like Napoleon, but I preferred other actors. Thus, the most excited performances were also the worst. <br /> <br /> The costumes and the design of the production are acceptable: of course, American period movies are more accurate about these things because they have money. A comedy period, in short, with a cast of first order (except Bellucci and Auteuil).
