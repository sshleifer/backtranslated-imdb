This is the very first movie I have ever seen in the cinema by myself. I was 7 years old and to this day it's one of my favorite movies. It's pure smarmy cheese. The caricature was intended for young girls and sold dolls with soft bodies and large plastic heads, one for each color of the rainbow, with their own special animals, "sprites" and even a rainbow horse. rainbow speaking. This show is typical of this period: each hope showed that hope, conviviality and magic could improve "everyone". <br /> <br /> The film is about the coming of spring, when light and colors come back to the world. but this time it does not happen for our adorable hero. A spoiled princess plots to take precedence over the spirit giver (and life giver) of the universe, which happens to be a giant diamond, for its own devious purposes, regardless of reality, and now Rainbow and his newfound friends, Orin, Onyx and Chris have to save the universe. As I said before, it's corny, but it's cute, and it's just like all the other cartoons from this period, like CareBear, Strawberry Shortcake, Rose Petal, and the Smurfs. All movies created to sell dolls to children. And it works. :)
