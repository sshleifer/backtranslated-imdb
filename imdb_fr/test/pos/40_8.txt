Lackawana Blues An awesome HBO movie about a beautiful woman who made her home a home for many characters. Touch, live and seduce - an excellent mix of sounds and stories - based on a true story featuring a cast of stars ..... <br /> <br /> you get the point and no I'm not not on the payola for the crew of HBO - I would throw more superlatives but I'm about to go out. The extras of the DVD include a deleted scene, a featurette and a commentary. The funniest part of this featurette was a "star" lighting used during the interview of executive producer Halle Berry. <br /> OK seriously - good times
