The cinema of the sixties was as much a period of revolution as politics and music. The filmmakers dared to make avant-garde films about taboo subjects previously allowed in the exploitation films. Both with "Breathless" and underground American cinema (like Kenneth Anger), movies have become more and more experimental. All this has accumulated when Hollywood realized that they had a mass commercial appeal with "Easy Rider". One of the best (and most surprising) results of this era was also one of the least successful at the start. "Head" was created when The Monkees' career seriously went wrong, which is one of the best psychedelic movies ever made. <br /> <br /> The plot? Well, there are not really, as many have said. This implies that the Monkees move from one surrealist scenario to the next. However, these sequences are all clearly tinged with LSD and make a mockery of how The Monkees was fed up with limiting themselves to their slight prefabricated reputation. It's a shame that the film did not find any audience. The young fans who loved them had switched to a new fashion, as always. The psychedelic crowd / Haight-Ashbury to whom the film was awarded would never be found dead in a Monkees movie. It's all their loss. This film is perhaps less conspiracy, but it is certainly not meaningless and it is very intelligently put in place. The crew later made "Easy Rider" and "Five Easy Pieces". The film was relaunched later in a retrospective in 1973 with Raybert and it sparked a very positive reaction, which earned him the worship he deserved for so long. Ironically, the Monkees would be victims of the same commercialism that they had expressed in this film at their meeting in the 80s. (10/10)
