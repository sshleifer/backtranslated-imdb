Aside from the fact that this film was shot mainly in Rockport, Massachusetts, a beautiful city where my mother once rented a small storefront and had a lot of pleasant summer, it was a fun little movie and cute. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that I have no desire to see this film, although I have a weakness for romantic comedies (I do not know why). The caravans I saw were not attractive, the actors did not seem so interesting and I did not know at all what the plot would be. Finally, I found it to be an interesting meditation on relationships and family. I had a lot of fun and I must admit that I thought this movie was one of the most neglected gems of last year. I am disappointed that so few people seemed to appreciate the "human nature" that this film presented to the viewer. <br /> <br /> I have read many negative reviews about this film, and I must admit a certain level of shock to the cynicism that reigns in them. As a graduate student, I consider myself pretty cynical, but it was a nice little film that deserves a lot better than it did.
