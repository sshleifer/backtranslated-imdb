I suppose that this film will elicit critical acclaim in Canada, particularly in Quebec. This is because Canadians have always loved hockey and the Montreal Canadiens have been like gods in Canada for decades. As an American, what we have closer are the New York Yankees. If you are a fan, then they are the biggest and most successful team in history. If you're not a fan, then it's Satan's team !! Well, at least that's what happened when I grew up in Washington, with regard to the Dallas Cowboys. So, I'm pretty sure, when this movie was shown in the North, that everyone immediately had a strong emotional reaction: their national sport AND the closest thing to a national NHL team. <br /> <br /> Now the cartoon the main character talks about growing up around Ottawa and encouraging Canadians AND Maurice "The Rocket" Richard. However, when his mother accidentally bought him a Toronto Maple Leaf jersey and forced him to wear it, I knew right away how horrible and shameful it would be for a little boy. This ability to connect to the character - even if he lives in a far away country - is what made it a very special short film. The way the other children treated him and his conversation with God at the end make this film a charming nostalgic film. Very intelligent and memorable.
