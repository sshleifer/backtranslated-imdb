*** SPOILERS *** Feeling alone and in need of companionship and love Frances Austen, Sandy Dennis, keeps all these emotions inside as she lives all her life as a popular young single woman with many high class friends. But for reasons of deep insecurity, she keeps them at arm's length. As for Frances, her male friends are almost as young as her age, so she will have no reason to have sex with them. <br /> <br /> One evening in the early evening, Frances entertained some of her friends. She spotted a young man from the window of his apartment, Michael Burns, sitting alone in the pouring rain. Feeling that he is homeless and alone after the departure of his friends, Frances goes to the park and offers the young man shelter at home until the rain subsides and even until the night in a guest room she owns. You can see right away that Frances is more interested in having the young man sheltered from the cold and the rain than she wants to have as a friend or as a toy for herself and as a toy. that the movie was right. <br /> <br /> A really amazing performance by Sandy Dennis that looks something like Kathy Bates Academy Award performance in the movie "Misery" made in 1990, twenty-one years later. Frances thinking that the young man was alone and homeless and, later, when he met him, dumb sees himself as the ideal person to have as a true friend. He is by no means his equal or better than his friends, the doctors in lawyers of the Indian chiefs, and is therefore totally dependent on her. It turns out later that the young man is not the lonely and homeless person that Frances thought to be. Then she slowly discovers that he does not really need her and that he manipulates her instead. It reminds of something in Frances' mind that turns out to be an impulse of deadly proportions. <br /> <br /> A truly strange film by director Robert Altman that plunges deep into the loneliness and depression of the human spirit. The actress Sandy Dennis is perfect in the roles of Dr. Jekyll and Miss. Hyde in her role of Frances Austen, lonely but dangerous, and it's a shame that she did not receive an Academy Award for her role in the film either. but was not even nominated for that. <br /> <br /> As in most of Robert Altman's films, there seems to be a lot of improvisation among the actors of the film and an ad lib dialogue, especially between the sister of the young man Nina, Susanne Benton, and her boyfriend Nick, David Garfield. The only thing in the film that I found confusing is when we see Frances go to a city clinic to have a full gynecological examination and tell the doctor that she expects to get married very soon. Was her husband the young man who stayed at home? But apart from that, the film sticks well enough to the story and its end is a real shock for the public as for the young man. When he finally finds out at the end, Frances is not only a little offbeat, but alienated as well.
