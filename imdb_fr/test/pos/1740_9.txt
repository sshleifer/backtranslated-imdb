First of all, I never had Dr. Who until recently. Honestly, I have never had the opportunity to look at previous incarnations (intentional wordplay) because it was never "big" here in the United States as everywhere else. <br /> <br /> That said, I must say (obviously) that after finishing the second season, it's one of the best science fiction shows I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Now I watch a lot of Sci-Fi shows from all over, and The show stands out. <br /> <br /> The first season was fantastic, with Christopher Eccleston in the lead and I thought he was great. Of course, the lovely Billie Piper also added to the character of Rose with such humanity and such warmth that no one could do it better. Let's not forget Camile Coduri as Jackie and Noel Clarke in the role of Mickey / Ricky who are just great to watch. Then there is David Tenannt. At first, I thought he looked too clumsy to play the character (his ears !!), but after watching the 2nd season, he fits perfectly. His acting and physical comedy are almost perfect. He is excellent with a lively dialogue and can become serious without flinching. <br /> <br /> Apart from the good acting game of the cast, the actor is composed of most of the guest actors. Many of them are veteran actors, but some are new to me and are damn good. <br /> <br /> The production and the direction of the series are of superior quality. From time to time, there will be bad taste effects here and there, but this has always been a factor in the original series and, as with these episodes, it is negligible. <br /> <br /> What I like best in the series: The stories. Writing to people is always the key to good entertainment. Russell T. Davies has written many episodes with a few other writers and they have done a great job. They managed to create excitement, ingenuity, intelligence and fun through intelligent concepts and quality dialogue. I also appreciate the fact that they can penetrate the stories and enemies of the former doctors (my friend explains a lot to me while we watch the series) and with respect. <br /> <br /> I will not mention Nothing to say about the 2nd season and how it ends since the channel Sci-Fi has just started broadcasting the 2nd season. <br /> <br /> I would not want to ruin it. It's so much fun and exciting. You will never want to leave your eyes or miss a word of dialogue. <br /> <br /> It's really good. <br /> <br /> PS: Thanks to the producers for the return of Nicholas Briggs! **EXTERMINATE!**
