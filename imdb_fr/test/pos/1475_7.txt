Ah! When good actors take the bland material! If you think of this film as a tight police thriller, you risk being disappointed. Although the situations are very true, the plot unfolds at a very predictable pace and you can see what is waiting for you before the actors take you there. Many criminals and secondary characters are actually moving stereotypes. Much of the dialogue is just stupid. <br /> <br /> But! If you like to see good actors rise above this kind of material and do something about it, then you will love this movie! Sam Elliott has nothing short of brilliant to bring to life the depth and pathology of Detective Falon's one-of-a-kind character. Those of you who have never seen Elliott move as far as his usual stoic stoic positions will be delighted with the range of emotions he describes in this film. And also, in his early fifties, he looks fantastic! Her bare breast scene gives hope to middle-aged men everywhere! Esai Morales is doing a remarkable job in strengthening his role as Det. The new police partner of the greedy beaver of Falon. He could have easily played the role of Robin in Elliott's Batman, but instead, he instilled an authenticity and passion into that role. He makes it work despite some of the lame lines he is given to say. <br /> <br /> Paul Sorvino is fun to watch! He plays the eccentric police captain. He seems to know that he is playing in this movie. It makes it fun for us too. <br /> <br /> This film is very detailed, but is offset by great performances! Sam Elliott's fans should definitely have one, because it's a kick to see him spread his wings and do so much more than he's allowed to do!
