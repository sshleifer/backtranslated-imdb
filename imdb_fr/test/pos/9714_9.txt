It seems that everyone wants to follow the movement saying "Maha Go Go Go" ... The word is MACHA ........ Like "Mach" ..... pronounced maa - ka "... <br /> <br /> I grew up with this series in the early 70's, here in Los Angeles, on the last and very regretted channel 56 ... Before that, there was Tetsuwan Atomu (Astro Boy), dating back to 1963 on kHJ Astro Boy was the first example of anime televised we had here in the United States ... I was in the anime when I was a kid and I followed him until the end of the years 80, when he became a series of "misbehaving talking heads," a phenomenon that is only getting worse, "says Nuff. <br /> <br /> Regarding" Speed ​​Racer ", I really enjoyed the basics, the POV shots, the cinematographic aspects of the live action skillfully adopted for the animation ... It was quite typical of most of the Japanese cartoons of the time. .. Graphics Note how well the series is inspired by Stanley Kramer's (1966) movie "Grand Prix", especially the American credits, which are being redone .... <br /> <br /> Oh yes, I have the original comics from which the series is based, so I know what I'm talking about. <br /> <br /> What were we doing from the point of view of animation apart from shit like Johnny Quest? ..... The "same old" stuff we had been doing since the 1920s .... Ho-hum! <br /> <br /> I guess the real problem that I had / had with the way the anime was / is shown on American television is the work of war hat made on scripts, credits, etc to "clean up" for the American public ... I will not enter other programs that we are talking about 'Speed ​​here. <br /> <br /> Look at clowns like Peter Fernandez as one of the culprits here because he was 99% responsible for rewriting the series ... Not to mention the voice of Speed, Racer X and others ... Between him and the Trans / Lux gaffes (Think Felix the cat and the mighty Hercules - oy vey!) They took a very sophisticated show and dropped it at Sesame Street. Think about "Cruncher Bloch", "Forthebird Company", "Skull Duggery" ... If I continue, I'll throw up. <br /> <br /> This series dates from the forties, but me, at the time, was quite eager to feel insulted by the finesse of this program and other Japanese programs ... I want to say, it is obvious when someone is killed, but either he removes it or conceals it ........ Pleeeeeze! <strong> Good show - originally. Unfortunately, all the most recent incarnations of the series have the CRAPPY look "made in Korea", not to mention the nauseating "pc" content. Even the Japanese outsource their animation now. <br /> <br /> Try to watch the original Japanese opening on YouTube from time to time ... It gives me chills in the back. well. Robert
