Scientist Carl Lehman (played by David McIlwraith) explodes something terrible in a deliberate chemical explosion. His brain was transplanted into the body of an almost indestructible metal cyborg suit by his evil colleagues led by the obsessive comrade Alex Whyte (a perfectly hateful portrait of Richard Cox). Lehman embarks on a murderous madness. It is up to the evil mercenary Hunter (a wonderfully disgusting turn of the divine Pam Grier) to stop him. The director Jean-Claude Lord, who previously directed the under-appreciated psycho-slasher thriller "Visiting Hours", stages abundant action scenes with considerable verve and maintains a steady pace throughout his film, which in turn makes a sci-fi trash movie / horror action release. Punchy-brand character Maury Chaykin plays easily with the honors of Burt, who, in the most insipid sequence of the film, has a brutal fight with Lehman's pregnant wife, Lauren (a winning performance by charming Teri Austin) . Stan Winston's clever makeup f / x and Paul Zaza's thrilling score add to the fun of the game.
