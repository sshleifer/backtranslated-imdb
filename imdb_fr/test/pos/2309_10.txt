especially when we look at the amount of crap that was made on DVD. I found this movie very funny. Rip Torn is classic with its beards; Rob Schneider, so hilarious as boring as Ensign overcompensating; Bruce Dern makes a big "bad guy". The whole distribution seems to be having fun and it is not to the detriment of the public. If you like funny comedy and you do not really want to understand, you may fall in love with it.
