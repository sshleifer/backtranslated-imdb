In all honesty, the promise of Martin Donovan playing Jesus was enough to make me see the movie. Really useful; smart and funny without doing too much. The poor-quality shooting was probably a good effect, but ended up being a little too shocking and the end looked more like a PBS program than Hartley. Still, there are so many memorable lines and great moments that I can judge her harshly.
