Someone on these tips has predicted that everything is dreamed by the protagonist's best friend, although he has not seen it for 20 years. I am reluctant to dismiss that, but it raises viable questions. Why a phone engineer - or a shoe salesman or a butcher from elsewhere - WANT he to create a mythical world and weave it around a friend populating him with his character with secondary characters just as mythical? With such imagination, the friend should write and not dream. Whatever the dream or not, and the obvious candidate is the director Paolo Sorrentino, has created a very observable world in which Tony Servillo makes stillness an art. We are asked to believe that Titta La Girolomo (Servillo), in her forties, has "upset" the Mafia a few years before our meeting. As a penitent, he is a virtual prisoner in a small Swiss hotel where he visits a local bank every week. with a suitcase containing nine large mill in used notes. Besides this weekly trip, he is free to do what he wants and what he likes is smoking, playing cards with a man who cheats and a woman who reminds the husband how they fell in society , and ignore Olivia's friendly overtures. Magnani, who has been trying for two years to get a smile and / or a "good evening". For reasons that are better known to him and that are incompatible with a man who has no interest in anything, Servillo spends a certain amount of time every day applying a stethoscope to the wall of his room and listening to his private conversations. his card. Finally, he responds to Magnani - he has to do it or they would not be a movie. This is plot 6f: the one about Destry, who never carries weapons, or Sean (Duke Wayne), the quiet man who refuses to get up to provoke and fight until the obligatory scene where the weapon is tied and fists erect. - but instead of being satisfied with a polite come, he removes 100,000 pieces of the bag and bought him a car. The latest inconsistency arises when Magnani tells him that she will pick him up at 4 pm the next day in his car and go to the mountains to celebrate his birthday. We established that she lived in the area. She is seen driving from one place to another, ignoring a police roadblock to get off the road and knocking over the car. This incoherence aside, it remains a beautiful piece of film with excellent lead performance and a very good supporting role.
