This is the fourth feature film by Marc Recha. In the third 'mans buides' - empty-handed - I promised myself not to cut my veins. But this time, the plot is completely different - a kind of homage to Ramon Barnils (Sabadell 1940 - Reus 2001), Catalan journalist -. The images in the trailer are breathtaking - a brilliant river bathed in sunshine - and the promise that Marc himself would be in front of the camera with his twin brother - neither of the two professional actors - finally convinced me, six weeks later his exit. Surrender yourself in this very unusual road / river movie. Learn almost nothing about Ramon Barnils, except his most poignant legacy: his constant fight against the amnesia of what we, the Catalans, have chosen to forget. 'The battle of the Ebro' - The battle of the Ebro on wikipedia - was lost not once but twice because after 40 years of silence and 25 years of shy democracy, nobody has done much to recall the legitimate side of the Spanish Civil War and those who fought it. This film talks about single people wandering in the same places with very little awareness of what had happened there 70 years ago. This film is about landscape.
