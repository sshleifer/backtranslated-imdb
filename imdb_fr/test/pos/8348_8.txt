I loved this movie almost as much as the original version! What teenager does not live what Scamp lives: want to regain his independence by becoming more and more distant from your family? The songs were nice, and the characters were great .Lady and Tramp look almost exactly like what they did in the original movie. They did a good job on the voices of these two, also considering that the actors of the original voice are probably dead. more lines to Lady, Annette, Colette and Daniel.Oh well, at least they had the common sense to keep the same scenery of the original movie.
