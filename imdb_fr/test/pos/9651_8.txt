The reason I examine this is that the previous comment was written by someone who came out of this movie, not even halfway through. Unfortunately for him, he missed a film of immense beauty. Agreed that the beginning of the movie was very slow, in fact, my friend fell asleep briefly. I woke him up before his snoring disturbed the audience. Fortunately, the film evolved from there into a love story, a drug story, and what it was like to be young and free in the sixties. The fantastic performances of the two protagonists and the look of the film gave it an impression of true authenticity. Be patient, like many great movies, it's worth the wait, and it's certainly a movie I'd be excited to see again! 8/10
