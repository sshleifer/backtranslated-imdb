I met Jennifer for the first time a few years ago when I was in town when she appeared on television in the middle of the night; I fell asleep before the end, but it stuck to me until I had to find it. Its appeal lies in the fact that, although it does not have much to do, it creates an intriguing atmosphere and because Ida Lupino and Howard Duff (real life, man and woman at the time) present a seductive and discreet chemistry. Lupino is a woman involved in a large California property whose former guardian - Jennifer - has disappeared and disappeared. (Shades of Jack Nicholson in the Shining, although in this case it is not Lupino who will or has gone mad). Duff is the guy in town who manages the finances of the property and takes a sunbath in Lupino, who decides to play hard to get. She becomes more and more involved, not to say obsessed, with what happened to her predecessor in the dark old house full of down stairs and locked cellars. Atmospheres and romantic bypasses are by far the best of the movie, as viewers will likely find the resolution a bit disappointing - there is not much to do (except for a little thrill in the end that anticipates Brian Codas's filmic De Palma). But it's done well and, again, it stays with you. Extra Attraction: This is the movie that introduced the song "Angel Eyes", which would be part of the standard repertoire of Ol 'Blue Eyes.
