The wonderfully engaging song with the same name as the movie won the Best Song Award, Oscar, in 1955. <br /> <br /> Love is a splendid thing. <br /> <br /> It's the April rose that only grows in early spring. <br /> <br /> Love is a way for nature to give a reason to live. <br /> <br /> This golden crown that makes man a king. <br /> <br /> Once on a high, windy hill <br /> <br /> In the morning mist, two lovers kissed and the world froze. <br /> <br /> Then your fingers touched my silent heart and taught it to sing. <br /> <br /> Yes, true love is a very beautiful thing. <br /> <br /> How can we forget such a beautiful song? Henry King, the director, had the privilege of working with Jennifer Jones twice that year for this film and the widely underrated film "Good Morning, Miss Dove". Jones was nominated for "Splendored Thing", but she could also easily have been nominated for Miss Dove. <br /> <br /> William Holden is just amazing as a war correspondent sent to report on the 1949 communist revolution in China. His love for Jones, an oriental doctor, was endearing and so memorable to watch. <br /> <br /> Even if the end is not nice, it's still one of the greatest novels ever on the screen.
