Many of the previous comments are about money, but some, finally, not so much. <br /> <br /> It's hardly a movie 'B' ... it's produced, the real flight sequences are really beautiful and the model sequences are first-rate. This is not a "good for nothing". <br /> <br /> Ricard Barthelmess is very good in this field, and he makes a good companion for "Only Angels Have Wings". <br /> <br /> If you want to spot John Wayne, first see J. Carrol Naish, they meet together. <br /> <br /> Tom Browne is quite young (and somewhat boring), but when they wear it with the most pathetic pencil mustache in Hollywood history, it makes his character even less believable. Sally Eilers is much more so. <br /> <br /> Regarding the subsequent influences, this is Wellman in the area of ​​the first airliners in distress ... the opening sequence of this film, with the guy from Air Operations Arriving at the "Grand Central Airport" would fit very well in "The High and the Mighty" ... just imagine Regis Toomey ... and a 1955 Buick.
