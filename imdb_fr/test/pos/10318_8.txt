A short film Three Stooges, this one featuring Shemp. Of all those involving Shemp that I've seen, it's my favorite performance of him in a short film by Stooges. The basic plot is that Shemp must get married before 6:00 pm even if he wants to inherit the half million dollars a rich uncle left him in his will. So Shemp begins to marry but finds that the path is more difficult than expected, that is to say until they learn money from his legacy. The best things here include shaving Shemp, Shemp and Moe in a phone booth and Larry at the piano as part of Shemp's vocal training session. Also the sequence where Shemp is confused with Cousin Basil and his result is hilarious.
