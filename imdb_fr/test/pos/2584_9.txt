I watched this film during the first broadcast available in my area and it was clear that most people did not have the film. Even if you do not do it, it's a good movie with an interesting character development. It's a deeply human story about very imperfect people in a city in the southern wooded hinterland, and really speaks to the root of the blues. If you do not know what "Black Snake Moan" is when you leave the theater, you do not understand it. And no .. it's not just a song. Christina Ricci does a great job and is quite convincing in her role, just like Samuel L Jackson. I think this is his best performance since his role in Pulp Fiction, and probably his best, including because of the scope of his character in BSM. The rest of the cast is solid, with some brilliant performances here and there, especially John Cothran Jr as Reverend RL. I am a very selective observer and this film is honestly ranked among my favorites because of its candid look at race, sex, religion and neurosis in a rural southern town, with its cinematic genius, in my opinion.
