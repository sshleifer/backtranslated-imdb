I am surprised that mine, to this day, is the only comment on this vt. film ... as far as I know, the series itself has been hugely successful, critical experts and real people have rented it to a person. In any case, let me tell you right now that, like me, you are a fanatic of agile police dramas, you will like "The Lost Child" Tennison, the heroine, throughout the series "Prime Suspect" , fought against The male police throughout the series, reached its current rank, relatively powerful, in the hierarchy of the police, thanks to his hard work, his obstinacy and his talent for police work . She is essentially an ambitious woman, but she has a romantic side and is certainly not a man who hates. Unfortunately, her relationships are affected by the sordid hours of her career and she never married. Thus, when she finds herself pregnant with her last affair, she must choose to become a mother and jeopardize all her police work. not to mention future advancement, or having an abortion - which she opts for. Abortion never has an important place in the drama that ensues - it is very cleverly treated, in less than two minutes of film, a marvel of economy in terms of script and editing - but it is still there , as a counterpoint to Tennison's desperate efforts to find another "lost child" - a kidnapping victim - before it's too late. The story takes a lot of twists, before the surprise ending, and we are fascinated, as much by the plot as by the characters (although I found the many bad guys a little behind), the police and especially Tennison herself even are not always competent, nor sympathetic, who figures, given the unpleasant work they must perform, in the dismal underworld that this series usually inhabits. <br /> <br /> Mirren herself said that she would not make any more movies in the series, but, excellent as she has always been in the role of Tennison, the series itself is also "At the height of the actor" as his other addiction, "Dick Wolf's American Law & Order" - The one who appears there, everyone could last forever. As it is my fervent hope.
