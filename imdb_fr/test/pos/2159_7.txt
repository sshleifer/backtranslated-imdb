Night hunter is an action movie sold in style B. Get a life and grow people. Don "the Dragon" Wilson is a kick boxer (Hall of Fame) and not an actor. If you're looking for an Oscar, this is not my brother here. Looking for a deco action movie with a budget lower than low, that's it. The plot may have been a little thin, but it's not movie B. I understand everyone is a critic and how a man's junk is another man's treasure. Get real people, judging each film as an Oscar nominee, just silly. Impressive battle scenes, mixed with a new twist on vampire movements. See if you are a fan, praise something else if you are an enemy.
