Coming from the pioneer of comics Alex Raymond, "Flash Gordon" was the grandfather of all sci-fi epics. This series is the first time that Flash is brought to celluloid life. Despite its low budget, it is a big space opera. <br /> <br /> The story begins with the Earth doomed to destruction, as the Mongo Planet rushes through space on a collision course. The Zealander scientist Maverick, Dr. Zarkov, is heading for the planet, which is approaching by a self-taught rocket, convinced that it can do something to stop the fleeing celestial body. He recruits last minute athletes in the form of Flash Gordon, an ingenious athlete, and the beautiful Dale Arden. Once they reach Mongo, their problems really begin. They clash with the evil emperor Ming the Without-mercy, conqueror of his world, who has ambitious plans for the Earth. <br /> <br /> The rest of the series revolves around Flash's desperate attempts to save the Earth; the matching extraterrestrial cultures he encounters; the allies he makes; spaceships he flies; the battles he fights and the monsters he kills. <br /> <br /> Brilliantly designed by Raymond, "Flash Gordon" presents classic archetypes of legendary myths and fables of antiquity. There are echoes of famous tales, such as the sagas of Troy, Camelot and Sherwood Forrest. You have the dashing, handsome hero, on a quest to save the kingdom (Flash); The evil king (Ming); The old sage (Zarkov); The beautiful young lady in distress (Dale); the seductive siren (Aura); faithful allies (Thun, Barin, Vultan); In addition, monsters, dragons and assorted critters. <br /> <br /> Flash is a modern Robin Hood, Jason or Beowulf. Ming is Prince John or Aggamemnon. Dale is Helen of Troy or Gwenevere or Maid Marion. Zarkov is Merlin or Ulysses. (Or Gandalf) Thun / Barin / Vultan are the merry men or knights of the round table. <br /> <br /> You have the idea. <br /> <br /> You can not help but notice how many ideas of "Flash Gordon" will reappear later in STAR WARS. The cloudy city; The ice world; The moon of the forest; The opening text that scrolls (from the second series); There are others, but you understand the essential. The whole science-fiction genre owes a lot to this timeless classic. <br /> <br /> Buster Crabb is the ideal hero of action, and I personally think he's better at that kind of role than any other action group today. stars. He also played Buck Rogers and Tarzan. <br /> <br /> Charles Middleton is the incarnation of evil evil in the role of Ming. Of course, it sounds a bit melodramatic today, but that's what the public expected of their villains in the 30's. <br /> <br /> Jean Rogers is the love interest of our hero, Dale Arden, and I had a crush on her the first time I saw this as a boy. I can easily understand why Flash has always rushed to his aid. She is the perfect girl to counter the seductive manipulations of Aura, the bad girl par excellence. <br /> <br /> The supportive cast seemed perfectly chosen to mimic their comic book counterparts, and despite FX's sordid effects, there was a lot of thrilling activity in this groundbreaking series. <br /> <br /> A fun show and the beginning of the genre from science fiction to cinema.
