I remember watching this movie again and again when I was a child. I liked it. Although I have not looked at it recently, I am sure I would still appreciate it today. It's a very light and funny movie that will make people laugh. The situations with each of the characters were so funny and imaginative! I particularly liked the girl with the mother's ashes (which ends up picking them up on the road after the explosion), the thieves and the nuns. This beautiful style of humor we miss a lot these days. In addition, this film proved that the actor Paul Keenan (Dynasty / Days of our Lives) was gone. I recommend it to anyone lucky enough to find it in their local video store.
