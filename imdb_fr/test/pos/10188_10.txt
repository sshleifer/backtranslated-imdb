I'm not a fan of Disney at all, but I happen to be in Orlando for a friend's wedding. So my travel companion and I went to Disney for a few days. I did not see a good 3-D effect in, well ... but. I usually try to stay away from these presentations. The 3-D effect was so good. I am a 38 year old man, and even I wanted to try to touch and touch. It's that good! Word of advice. In the end, look at the back of the theater on the wall. Said like that ... the first time I saw it, the effect did not work. So I said to my friend ... "It would have been nice if ...." My friend said, "That's exactly what's happening, it does not work for any reason." It's a great show. You will not be disappointed!!!
