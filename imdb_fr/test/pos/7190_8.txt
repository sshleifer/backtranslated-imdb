I do not know the English version of this film, but the Norwegian translation is the funniest film I've seen in many years. The characters say so many funny things and make so many strange references to the news that I'm amazed that they always have more options, like the architect who can never say the name of the magician Miraculix properly. This becomes things like Malcom (i) X and "utenriks", which is Norwegian for foreign affairs. <br /> <br /> Like the word "utenriks", many translations make no sense in English, and probably not in French either, so translators must have invented their own jokes and did it very well. Of course, they have a very good base to build on, with a comic film from start to finish! <br /> <br /> Recommended in all languages ​​with a good translation!
