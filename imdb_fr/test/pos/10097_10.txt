Let me say: I like the kind of horror to the extent that I see each of them on which I can get my hands, no matter the quality (except the horror film B really poor quality of which I could happen to me) and that I have recently become a big fan of Eastern Horrors. I did not know that a Korean horror would be at the top of my list beating heavyweights such as the Japanese Ringu (or the American ring), or even American quality movies such as Sixth Sense and The Others , and the highly acclaimed Hong The Horror of Kong "The Eye". <br /> <br /> Previously, "The Ring" was my favorite horror, but it seems to me that I prefer the beauty of "The tale of two sisters" every day - the story is extraordinary and rather open to the interpretation, allowing for repeated viewing, although it is likely that you will want to watch it again and again just because the film was shot so masterfully ... the story is probably one of the best of its kind at this day. The acting is also great on the part of the cast and the alarms when they arrive have the potential to make you vibrate as if nothing was in the Ring - I found myself stuck on the screen in those places unable to to leave me eyes. <br /> <br /> I'm always happy that Sadako / Samara canceled it did not come back to haunt me later - after all these feelings are unpleasant and that The Tale of Two Sisters leaves you feeling uncomfortable but a person who, hopefully, will not leave you without sleep but will leave you satisfied to have seen something rather special. But remember ... if you do not understand the plot after the first viewing, a second viewing is more than advisable. Personally, I did not have the time to do it because it was late, so I flipped through scenes of the DVD, many times until I had a good synopsis in the head and after watching on the net, it seems to me that I have almost nailed it on the widely accepted interpretation. And the satisfaction of solving such a puzzle is extraordinary. <br /> <br /> In the end, a masterfully crafted horror will probably not produce the same "level" remake (bought by Dreamworks) simply because of the Korean content and it is advisable for everyone to catch this in theaters or on DVD, whenever possible ... it's one of the best you'll get. Unfortunately, because of the type of movie in question, there is no way to talk about the story without being disturbed. That's why it's better to do what I did - look at it without knowing anything except for its "two sisters" story! And get ready for something that probably will not fit for a while.
