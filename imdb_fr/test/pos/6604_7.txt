Dogtown and Z-Boys is a documentary about the Zephyr skateboarding team and its influence on skateboarding. He also focuses on the history of skateboarding. It was directed by Stacy Peralta, a member of the original Zephyr team, and was written by Stacy Peralta and Craig Stecyk, another member of the team. The documentary features members of the Zephyr team and is commented by Sean Penn. <br /> <br /> The documentary talks about the beginning of skateboarding and its evolution from surfing. It tackles the popularity of skateboarding in the late '60s and' 70s, its decline in the '80s and its' rebirth 'in the' 90s. Skateboarding was introduced to Dogtown, the nickname of the poor side of Santa Monica, California. The Zephyr team comes from the Zephyr Surf Shop, which manufactured the first modern skateboards. The documentary consists primarily of the original members of the Zephyr team who talk about the Zephyr team's past, the competitions they won, their popularity and prestige. It focuses on three particular members of the team; Peralta, Tony Alva and Jay Adams, three virtuosos of skateboarding, and probably the three best members of the team. <br /> <br /> The interviews in the documentary were usually archive voices of Dogtown in the late 60s and 70s. Very rarely, you actually see the people interviewed, but when you see them, they are displayed in black and white, while the archive images were in color. I think Stacy Peralta used this technique to show that the documentary was about the past (that is, the Zephyr Team's Glory Days) and not the present. The documentary is very rhythmic, we often see awesome skate clips on the catchy music of the time (like Jimi Hendrix, Led Zeppelin and David Bowie), and the interviews tend to be quick and direct. Knowing nothing about skateboarding (ie not even knowing how to drive one in a straight line on the ground), I was very surprised to find this documentary so interesting. The reason is that this documentary was more about the Zephyr team than the real sport of skateboarding. As a result, although I could not identify with skateboarding, I could identify with the boys on the team. As it was done by real team members, it gives it a little more depth and authenticity. <br /> <br /> All in all, I must say that this is one of the best documentaries I have ever seen. This gave me a whole new idea, not only of the Zephyr team, but also of skateboarding as a whole. For those who love skateboarding, I can only imagine how much more interesting it is. Seven and a half stars out of ten.
