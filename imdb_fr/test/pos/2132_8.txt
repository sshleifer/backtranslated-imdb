In fact, I liked this film even though this movie seems to be so hated and I think it's even better than The Deer Hunter, which has been overrated. This film and Year Of The Dragon are very underrated although I can see why someone would not like this movie. At half-past three, the film lasts too long and the second half of the film is much better than the first half. Kris Kristofferson and Christopher Walken argue for Isabelle Huppert but she can not make up her mind. Sam Waterston is the bad guy who has a list of 125 people to kill, who is said to be anarchists and thieves. Jeff Bridges, Brad Dourif and the young Mickey Rourke are also part of the cast.
