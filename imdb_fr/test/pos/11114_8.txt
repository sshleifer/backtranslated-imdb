Although at first glance, this movie looks like the story of your parents' high school life (and many people will try to tell you that this movie is WAY out of date) ..., the "lessons" learned by the heroes / heroines are without appeal. NOT obsolete. Who does not want to be famous? And who does not want to be accepted by his peers? And the homosexual guy, is not there any controversy today about gay marriage, blah, blah? This film, although released in the 80s, still addresses some of the most important issues in the world today. This film, however, has a little too much blasphemy and nudity for my taste. (so the note 8/10)
