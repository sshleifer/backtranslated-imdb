It was a good movie, I would compare it to the movie The Game. You arrive at the end of the film and you can not move ... your brain has been removed and shaken (not agitated) and put back in your head. Do not plan anything after this movie, you will need time to think about what just happened. <br /> <br /> Do not come to this film hoping that the Matrix style will spend millions of euros in special effects, the special effects of this film come from the actors, they keep you involved, no, they suck you and do not let you go all the way through the movie. Super actor, great plot ... very nice film, I can not say enough. Also a very original plot, lots of twists and ideas that I never thought. The end is abrupt and leaves you in suspense, wondering if it was real. Is this really the end? Good ending, do not say it's bad ... just let you ask, and a little tired. <br /> <br /> Excellent movie for those who love the action, like a good plot (do not get up for a bathroom break on this movie, you will come back lost) and enjoy the games of mind, because that's exactly what it is.
