THE KITE RUNNER is one of those modern epics of which we are sometimes honored. Crossing two continents, several generations of families and several decades, this film addresses a multitude of elements, including friendship, love, loss and ultimately redemption. <br /> <br /> His main driving force is the young Amir (Zekeria Ebrahimi), a native Afghan boy who often plays with hired help; mainly the young Hassan (Ahmad Khan Mahmoodzada), a boy from Hazara whose family is supposed to be inferior to the Afghans in power. But both form a friendship bond based on education (Amir teaches Hassan to read), closeness in Amir's house and, of course, kite flying. <br /> <br /> But times are tough for the city of Kabul. The Communists invade and Amir and Hassan separated because of an incredibly brutal prejudice by an Afghan boy against Hassan. The two may never see each other again. <br /> <br /> Amir's father rushes to take his son out of Afghanistan, before making his way to America. Here, both have set up a service station and live from day to day selling on niche markets. And as Amir's father gradually falls ill, a new revelation will strike Amir's heart; A film he can not ignore and which demands his return to his beloved city, Kabul. <br /> <br /> Study of friendship, war and reconciliation, The Kite Runner is truly a fantastic film. History is never spoken inappropriately in English when we are in a foreign country, and only in broken English whenever we are in America. It was refreshing and gave an impression of realism. <br /> <br /> The game of actors was on par with what you will see better. Homayoun Ershadi, who plays the role of Baba, the sick father of Amir and his powerful patriarch, deserves special mention. Also lead Khalid Abdalla while old Amir is well played, especially when returning to Kabul to find him in ruins; quite the opposite of his departure. <br /> <br /> The cinematography of Afghanistan during the flight and the ultimate return of Amir is breathtaking, with snow-capped peaks that will relax your mouth (I am I do not know exactly what channel of mountains they used in the movie, but no matter where I want to film it myself!) But it's not the cinematography or the game of one or two people that make this film a success . It's a very well-told simple story that is worth it to all moviegoers. Highly recommended.
