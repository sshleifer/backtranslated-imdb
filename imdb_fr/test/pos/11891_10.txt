I just finished the screening of El Padrino in Germany. A great movie. We are looking forward to seeing more of Mr. Chapa's films in the future. It was wonderful to see a film so well mounted with so much suspense and a story that will remain an instant classic. The end with little ambiguity leaves the story open for a sequel. Seeing a high-quality film shows how serious Chapa is and his skills as a writer, actor, director, and filmmaker. Chapa has impressed many people with his triumphant performance in the movie "Blood In and Blood Out" and has now proven to everyone who has seen his work his potential to become a critically acclaimed filmmaker with true artistic control. Something that few filmmakers can afford.
