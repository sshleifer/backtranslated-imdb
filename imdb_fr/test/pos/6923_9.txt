This film is a joy to watch and should succeed on DVD and video. I guess you really have to be Irish to appreciate some of the subtleties such as the accent, the familiar expression and the sartorial sense of some characters, but let me assure you that when Dylan Moran poses as "Barreler", the most people are familiar with this imitation of Dublin because we have many characters in our beautiful city who look, act and talk like that! The simple comedy employed and the genius of Michael Caines acting alone are worth it, but beyond that, the plot is fantastic, the scenario is fantastic and the dialogues quick and catchy. A perfect light entertainment movie without the crazy humor of Jim Carrey.
