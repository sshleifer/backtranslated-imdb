I am very grateful that the small university town of Abingdon, Virginia, near Bristol, TN. and where is the famous Barter Theater where Gregory Peck has already acted - managed to gather a festival of art films and to show this film. Abingdon is two and a half hours from home, but the trip was worth it in every sense of the word. UZAK / REMANT is an amazing film, brilliant, shocking, emotional and captivating. As a Turkish-American, this film is not only a testament to life in Turkey. but on a larger scale, he tells the world what it means to be Turkish, whether one lives in Istanbul, Berlin, Montreal, New York or Omaha. It may take two hours instead of five minutes, but it's actually our Bob Marley song. There are so many wonderful scenes in this movie. It is very difficult to choose a few at random. But for me, a revealing scene takes place in a cinema Beyoglu (downtown Istanbul). The main character, played by Mehmet Emin Toprak, who unfortunately died in a car accident shortly after the end of the film, follows a very seductive young woman on the stairs leading to the big movie theater. She will see "Vanilla Sky". While the image of Tom Cruise is reflected in a glass, we have the feeling that the Turkish men compete with Tom Cruise for the affection of their own women, even if Tom Cruise is not found in Beyoglu. The scenes filmed through the shores of the Bosphorus are also very revealing because they symbolize beauty, but empty and desperate sinkholes, which are a painful reality of life in Turkey. In this film, the gulf separates lovers and families. A simple, empty package of Samsun cigarettes (Turkish brand) and a dying mouse jump from the screen like the seagulls did in the 1982 film "Yol" by Serif Goren-Yilmaz Guney. Many of Guney's films, including "Yol "," Suru-the-Herd "(1978 - completed by Zeki Okten) and" Baba-The Father "(1971), were considered by many to be the best Turkish films ever made. Without the sometimes exaggerated sociopolitical anger of Guney (notably in his last film, the drama of the 1983 Duvar-The Wall prison), "Distance" sums up in a remarkable way the essence of Turkish life. It is a feat for a director who, in my opinion, can already be proclaimed Turkish equivalent to directors such as Tarkovsky, Bresson and Ozu. I can not wait to see his other films!
