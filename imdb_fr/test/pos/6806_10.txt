My daughter has already written a review of this film in my sign ... but I want to add a few words. <br /> <br /> ?? National Velvet 'was one of my two favorite movies in my childhood. (The other being "The Wizard of Oz?") The cinematography, the acting, the script and the music all came together - it's such a wonderful drama that the heart can still bring tears to My eyes are jaded, based on a book by Enid Bagnold, the script has followed the book very well, the characters are thoughtfully created, it is easy to get involved emotionally in the whole family and the picturesque Irish village where they live.The premise ... a complete outsider believes in his horse and in himself enough to try his luck at the greatest horse race in the world ... is an inspiration to any youngster, especially a young girl of the 40s ... girls were sometimes ignored as human beings, not to mention athletes.It would be extremely hard not to appreciate its merit. <br /> <br /> But the perspective that I most cherished about this movie is innocence flawless of his moral message. It's almost magical to see how "apple and apple pie" movies were. I was really taken aback by the BDIM critic who asked ... "Has the world ever been so confident?" and then proceeded to reprimand the director for his complacency about overnight "unescorted" journeys involving the two main characters. My answer to his question is an unequivocal yes! The film world was so confident in the 40s. <br /> <br /> My grandparents remember taking my mother to this film when she was released. Then my mother took me to see this when I was young and my daughter was lucky enough to be born at a time when she could watch it several times on a videotape. Now we have it on DVD. He has been a family favorite for generations, even though generations of horse lovers. There was never any question of sex ... it is about becoming major! It's about believing in yourself and working hard to achieve your goals. In addition, if old game, it was not even money prize! It's about the little girl who understood that her horse had what it took to be the best. And yes, the director was indeed concerned about the lack of physical development of Elizabeth Taylor, because the book spoke a lot about the fact that Velvet Brown (the character of Liz Taylor) was forced to cut his hair and bind his chest so that she can become a male jockey. went to the big national steeple. It was a boys' sport at the time ... I think there have never been 12 women to compete in this race. It's almost insulting that anyone who takes the trouble to think about the Lolita thing about this particular movie ... besides, anyone who has had anything to do with a teenager and her horse will know that the only thing to which they never think with stars in their eyes have four hooves and a tail. <br /> <br /> And now, for a little anecdote ... the waterfall was made by the now famous "Horse Whisperer", Monty Roberts. I think he's mentioned in the film credits for his riding. <br /> <br /> I give this movie a 10 out of 10! I do not get tired of watching him again.
