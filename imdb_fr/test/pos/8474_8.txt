I agree that this film was spectacular. The way Jamie Foxx captured, not only the impression of Ray Charles, but the essence of Ray Charles really made the film. Her life has a great story and it's good that she is finally told. I also found an excellent interview of Jamie Foxx about this role by InnerVIEWS's Ernie Manouse on KUHT, Houston Channel 8. The link is http: //video.google.com/ videoplay? Docid = -3001837218936089620 & q = innerviews + jamie + foxx & hl = en. I encourage everyone to take a look at it, as it deepens the analysis of his role and his personal feelings about Ray Charles. The only problem I could mention with the movie is that the shooting style was rather bland at times, but in the end, I think it helped to make the story more realistic and keep the focus on the person, Ray Charles, rather than the movie Ray.
