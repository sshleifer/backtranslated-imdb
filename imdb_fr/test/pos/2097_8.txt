A bad war leader puts a city in pain and suffering. Shortly before, they call Daimaijin, the giant stone samurai. Daimaijin is coming soon and really gets the lord of war with all his slimy power. The culmination of revenge is really fun because Daimajin crushes the guys under his feet, crushes them with his fist and even pushes a point at the heart of a man.
