The last part of Kieslowski's trilogy based on the colors of the French flag finds the director at peace with the metaphysical and transcendent nature of the cinematographic image. In red, imagery is paramount, as is the obvious but clever color coding. However, rather than adhere to empty aesthetic artifacts based on the "cinema of the look", Kieslowski's Red is a multi-level and highly elaborate meditation on the nature of destiny and love. In red, love and destiny are intricate but complex notions, dictated as much by the whims of the human being as by the invisible parallel associations that seem to elude us. You feel that Red is really an allegory, a re-enactment of Prospero's omnipresent gestures in The Tempest, but it's more than his story appears. Red requires countless views. At each viewing, we discover something new that integrates into the already immaculate structure. <br /> <br /> Although red is Kieslowski's only masterpiece, it's best to see it in the trilogy. The elements of blue and white are referenced in red, which the interested viewers will appreciate.
