This film was a surprise. The synopsis of the plot seems weird, and stars Clint Eastwood and the great Geraldine Page. I did not know what to expect. There is this opening scene where the wounded soldier says that the age of 12 is old enough to kiss and then gives a child a long, very adult mouth-to-mouth kiss. The child takes her to the girls' boarding school where she lives. He takes advantage of the situation to try to seduce the director, interpreted by Page, his assistant and another student. Jealousy, sexual tension, incest, intrigue and the macabre mingle with this wonderfully original story. <br /> <br /> I read the other reviews here and I can not find much to complain about. However, I wanted to clarify a point mentioned previously that there was no nice character in the movie. I think there is one. The attractive slave woman successfully resists the soldier's advances in a scene that works well because it evokes the common history of slave black women exploited by white men. Even if her strength and lack of illusion are the sum of her experience, she is what I consider a nice character. She, more than all other women and girls in school, has a legitimate reason to participate in what happens at the end.
