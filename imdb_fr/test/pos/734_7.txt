Do not Look in the Cellar is a very smart and well thought-out exploitation film that has a bad reputation because of its inexpensive quality and poor quality of roles. Of course, this is not a masterpiece by anyone's criteria, but it's a very fun little B movie with a lot to offer and even a lot of scary scenes that will stay in your head. As I said, the acting could have been much better, but that's the case with most farms, so I can not complain. The story is clever and presents some remarkable twists that will let you guess. I thought gore was a lot of fun too. The old gore movies have something great, because they did not have a CGI yet, so they had to set everything up themselves. See this one for a good time!
