My first film Mamin, I saw it on IFC a long time ago, and I LOVED it. It sounded absolutely artistic, original, fun and hilarious. Not a minute in the film let me down or bore me, and I laughed a lot or had a smile on my face. I mean, this movie is really funny. But here's the trap: he is also very artistic and creative - if you do not know Yuri Mamin (probably, unfortunately, because many of his BIG films are not available here), he has a very original style like no other, and for me, it's not even my favorite movie (for now, it's the crazy one ("Saideburns / Bakenbardy").) Besides, I must say that as a Russian, this film is awesome because you really see what the Russians look like, and that's possible because it's a real Russian film for me, NOT a foreign film trying to be American or to appeal, Mamin did not sell (and he did not more, Gorko (1998) was as good if not better, is a true Russian style film based on communist social realism. <br /> <br /> If you liked this movie, I think you have a very good chance 'I love Mamin's other films, it's actually that I love many more than this one, I think this one is his The most accessible film is a Fountain, which takes place 6 years ago during perestroika. same actor in the main role and several other accustomed to Mamin that you recognize from Window to Paris; This one has a supernatural touch in the end but is mostly a realistic comedy, a great one. Viva Mamin, I hope that Criterion will connect all his films one day, he is still working and his catalog is great! See one of his films if you can.
