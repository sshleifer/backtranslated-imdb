One of the other commentators mentioned that after watching the episode of 1 Oz only, you'll be hooked. They are right, because that's exactly what happened to me. <br /> <br /> The first thing that struck me about Oz was his brutality and his flawless scenes of violence, which are part of the word GO. Believe me, this is not a show for shy or shy people. This show is not fistful when it comes to drugs, sex or violence. Its use is hardcore, in the classic use of the word. <br /> <br /> It's called OZ because it's the nickname given to Oswald's maximum security state sanctuary. It focuses mainly on Emerald City, an experimental section of the prison where all cells have glass facades and are facing inward. Confidentiality is therefore not a priority. The city of Em City is home to many inhabitants: Arabs, Muslims, gangstas, Latinos, Christians, Italians, Irish and others ... The fights, the death glances, the zany transactions and the shady chords are never far away. <br /> <br /> I would say that the main attraction of the series is due to the fact that it goes where the other series would not dare. Forget the beautiful paintings painted for the general public, forget the charm, forget the romance ... OZ does not joke. The first episode I've ever seen seemed so bad that it was surreal. I could not say I was ready to do it, but looking more and more, I developed a taste for Oz and got used to the high levels of graphic violence. Not just violence, but injustice (crooked guards who will be sold for a coin, inmates who will kill on order and do well, well-educated and middle class inmates are turned into sluts in prison because of their lack of street skills or prison experience) Looking at Oz, you can be comfortable with what is uncomfortable listening ... .if you can get in touch with your most dark.
