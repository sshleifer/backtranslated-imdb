"House of Dracula" is not such a bad movie and is sometimes decent. <br /> <br /> ** SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> Arriving at Dr. Franz Edelmann's (Onslow Stevens) home in his seaside home, Count Dracula (John Carradine) discreetly looks for a remedy against vampirism. He starts working on a potential treatment involving a blood transfusion. The werewolf Lawrence Talbot (Lon Chaney Jr.) arrives on his estate in search of a cure for lycanthropy. While working with both patients, he discovers a possible remedy in a mold found near the laboratory and, having searched the surroundings, he finds the monster Frankenstein (Glenn Strange) buried nearby. Becoming obsessed with revitalization, Dr. Edelmann is increasingly neglecting the demands of Dracula and Larry. After demanding that they be cared for instead of working on the monster, they blame each other. <br /> <br /> The good news: It was a pretty decent film. There is one main idea that is quite creative and imaginative. This is the first film to openly suggest the idea of ​​vampirism as a blood disease, transferable from person to person by the exchange of body fluids, which would be taken up by subsequent genre works but rarely as direct. . There is even a microscope slide of the parasite that is believed to be responsible for the disease. It works in some rather well-used ideas and appears as a clever idea, even if some of the execution is a little bland. The fact that each creature has at least one remarkable scene is a good idea. The Wolf Man has a wonderful scene where he transforms himself inside a prison cell into a questionable member of the research group and goes crazy. Dracula's initial appearance of resembling a bat and flying towards an elongated silhouette that sleeps and then comes in a human form is truly impressive. The rampage of the monsters is well managed and an appropriate amount of destruction is caused. The big bat that Dracula turns into always looks suitable for once, and is done very realistically. It's a totally decent affair. <br /> <br /> The bad news: There are several things that have not been so good about this one. The fact that the film combines so many intriguing and potentially interesting ideas that he really does not know what to do with it. There are several background stories that need to be mixed and that need to be clear enough to blend and look consistent. It really does not have any of that. The plot is rather fragile and does not really give preferential treatment to any of the stars, but rather focuses on one and then the other and includes the three at the end. Monsters seem to get engaged only for the smallest possible reason, which makes it a big distraction. The end is for once a big disappointment and seems quite as if it had been changed at the last minute. There are a few other things that were not that spectacular, and that contribute a lot to that. <br /> <br /> The Final Verdict: It's a decent film that manages to go through most of the time with entertaining style. The classic status of each monster's debut is different, but it's a pretty cool watch for monster fans and Universal movies in general. <br /> <br /> The current PG-Violence ranking
