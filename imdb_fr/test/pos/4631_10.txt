I think this movie is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. I think Debbie Reynolds is hilarious and the chemistry that binds her to Glenn Ford is perfect. There is not a moment of boredom in the movie and Debbie is beautiful as always. <br /> <br /> The story tells the story of a little girl, Maggie (Debbie Reynolds), who meets a penniless soldier, Joe (Glenn Ford). She takes a moment of dislike for him, but after he tears up his dress by accident, he returns it on the condition that she make an appointment with him. They end up getting married the night they have their appointment after a single kiss. Joe and Maggie move to Spain and find that they have nothing in common but a physical attraction. So Maggie proposes to live for a month, but not as a man and wife, which means that Joe does not have the right to kiss or sleep with Maggie, much to her frustration. A hilarious plot and a movie wonderful. Do not miss.
