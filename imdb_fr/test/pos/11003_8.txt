A relevant description by Spock of an all-powerful fop in the claws of who falls the crew of the Enterprise. It was an area of ​​space that our ship should have avoided: first, Sulu & Kirk simply disappeared from the bridge; A landing team follows them to the surface of an unknown planet and meets Trelane, a seemingly aristocratic man dressed in an outfit of a centuries-old Earth. But he demonstrates the capabilities of someone or something far beyond the human and does not fit into McCoy's medical tricorder. The officers managed to get back to the ship but, like a kind of cosmic penny, Trelane kept coming. He brings them all back, including a female company, to continue his games. The dilemma now takes elements of "The Most Dangerous Game" in space and there is an exasperating, even infuriating, aspect of the total helplessness of the crew in the face of such unbridled power. <br /> <br /> What really makes it a great episode is the memorable performance of guest star Campbell as an invading alien who does not know everything. His character is obviously a first version of Q, which was introduced 20 years later in the pilot of the TNG series. Trelane's confrontation scene with Spock stands out among all the strange dramas unfolding. As usual, Kirk quickly begins to look for possible weaknesses in his new enemy, although he is quite outdated. The answers to the question of exactly who or what Trelane is are in front of us all the time. So when we learn the truth, it makes perfect sense given Campbell's perfect play. He keeps on authorizing himself, curtseying in front of an unfamiliar audience, conjuring up things with a flair that's both contagious but not quite right - we can not understand everything at first, but something is missing here. Every few minutes his tone becomes sinister and the crew now seems seriously in danger. In a way, you can not take your eyes off him, you always wait to see what he will do next. Actor John de Lancie reproduced the same tone as Q in the Next Generation series.
