"Confirmed Dead" is an important episode of the series, as it introduces four new characters: the rescue team contacted by Naomi before Locke carries a knife in the back. However, as the quote from my summary in one line makes, their real reason for being on the island may be something else. All the new characters seem intriguing (especially Miles, a sort of exorcist / psychic), but it is still too early to formulate solid judgments. I felt this episode was a slight step back from "The Beginning Of The End" (no flash-forward at the moment, short-term flashback instead), but he still has his sensational moments and is gaining momentum towards the end. *** out of 4
