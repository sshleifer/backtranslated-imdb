When you think of the brilliant Australian comedy, you do not think about the shows of Skit (although I am rather biased towards a little Full Full of 80 and 90) or even sitcoms - you think about SATIRE! Something we Australians know really well. (For example: Front Line, the Micallef program) We know how to take the pi $$, and Hunter's War on Everything is a classic example of how to do it and do it really well. <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of Chris Taylor and Craig Reucassel for a long time. I remember listening to them on Triple J's afternoon show. They were and remain two of the funniest comedians in the world. <br /> <br /> Even though I was sad when they left Triple J, I was excited to find out how they were spending so much time, which forced them to leave. (They were doing CNNNN and Triple J at the same time, so I thought it was something a lot bigger) And what a HILARIOUS show is really amazing Chaser. Political and social satire at its best. <br /> <br /> I'm also happy to say that he recently received a MUCH better slot than on Friday night and that he was moved on Wednesday night just after Spicks and Specks. THANKS ABC !! Finally, I do not have to record it! :)
