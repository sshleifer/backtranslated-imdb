Since 1981, Nintendo makes excellent video games such as Super Mario and Zelda. Most ideas would become a bit boring after 20 years. The games created by Nintendo never seem to get boring because they always add something new. That goes from arcade games to Wii and I'm learning that a new version of the Wii is planned for 2011. What makes Wii games so different is the fact that you're doing something instead of sitting on the screen. sofa by pressing buttons. . <br /> <br /> And I have other good news. Super Mario Galaxy 2 is due out in 2010.
