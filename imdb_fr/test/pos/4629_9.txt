Well ... what to say. <br /> <br /> I think I'll start with a confession. I cried 4 times in my life. once when my father died, twice because of a girlfriend in high school and at the end of this movie. This film deals with the real problems of 6 schoolchildren and exposes them in a totally uncomfortable way to the sight of the whole world. I have never seen a movie dealing with the human emotional condition as well. everything from incest to incontinence is covered here and I doubt that there are many people who are safe from the sting of familiarity with at least some scenes. <br /> <br /> It starts with suicide. at 2:37 pm then without telling you who died, the story begins to be told at the beginning of the day. he follows the life of 6 schoolchildren until 2:37 pm. interchangeably, and edited with personal interviews of 6 teenagers, lets you know everything about their lives. their loves, their hatreds, their dreams, their desires, their secrets, their shame, their false confidence, their self-hatred, their corruption and their arrogance. the end result is a kind of "whodunnit" that tries to discover the identity of the suicidal before it is revealed at the end of the film. without spoiling anything, I must let you know. do not feel deceived by the end. it contains a very important lesson. <br /> <br /> And now, a warning. this film is certainly not for the shy. Many people came out of the cinema halfway when I saw it. Disgusted by some of its content. Or perhaps it is sometimes difficult to deal with the harsh truth of reality. That's what high school is for a lot of people. I am sure most would agree.
