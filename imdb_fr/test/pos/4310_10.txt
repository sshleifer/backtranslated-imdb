A unique mix of music, film noir and comedy - with some projected sex scenes. The French film Billy Ze Kick is the only other film I can think of with a fairly similar mix of themes and clichés, but it has a more surreal and offbeat approach. <br /> It's not that this movie would not be surrealistic or offbeat. The humor is sometimes quite subtle, sometimes flagrant, and often crosses the border in an offensive way. To give an example: in the chatter post-coitus with a prostitute, our hero Max Müller encourages him to reveal the person responsible for a recent murder using the words "Schiess los!". Literally, this sentence means "shoot!" in German, and that's exactly what a hidden assassin does in response. In other words, this beautiful lady was sacrificed for a play on words. <br /> <br /> Müllers Büro is also one of the very few examples of movies featuring fun sex scenes. Larry's romance is accompanied by the song "Ich will mehr" (I want more). While the song perfectly underlies the action, the meaning of his words changes several times, which suggests that at the end of Larry's inability to provide other services. The main love scene of the film between Max Müller and Bettina Kant lacks such subtlety - it's amazing, especially when Bettina's song slowly turns into a groan, of course, to the rhythm of the music. <br /> <br /> Unmissable unless you are one of the easily offended.
