Rock Star is not one of the best rock movies of all time in the "stairs to paradise" category, but it makes you "jump" from time to time because of its high energy level. The film is about a fanatic hard-rock band who becomes the lead singer of his favorite band. The story is based on the true story of what happened to the heavy metal band Judas Priest. If you think that this film is filled with a spiritual scenario and an intellectual direction, then you have "something else to come". However, what shook me all night was the beautiful rendition of Jennifer Aniston as a devoted girlfriend of the rock star. I could not say as much about the rock star herself; Mark Wahlberg was much better as a porn star than a rock star. I enjoyed the retrospective trip of the 80s with the shooting of the film. It reminded me of my adolescence where everything "felt like a teenage spirit". I guess the film deserves to be watched, but for you to watch it better, be sure to bring girls, girls, girls. *** Average
