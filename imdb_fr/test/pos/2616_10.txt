This episode is not inconsistent as another person said. the source agreed to help because he was not going to keep his word, if you pay attention ... she said after she (phoebe) agrees to stay there in hell, "get rid of she and her balthazor so that I did not commit to their future "... and also, he did not let COLE REMEMBER THE SISTERS AS PHOEBE ASKED FOR EXCHANGE TO ACCEPT THE PROMOTION, that's why PRIME DEATH, because she was hit harder than PIPER and on her head, and there was no PHOEBE to call LEO this time, and in the past, LEO said she almost killed herself . be careful next time! and there is no "TO FOLLOW ..." after this episode. it's the end of season 3, and in season 4, they can not show anything PRUE because they own the rights "PRUE", so producers should pay for everything they show. this is the last episode where she is!
