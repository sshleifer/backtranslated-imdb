Many critics have shown this film and the car chase a lack of respect, but they are well above average. Roy Scheider does a great job playing his best guy. a hard and brave cop who works hard to get the job done, despite the office drivers and politicians who should support him rather than embarrass him. (He played a suburban version of this same role as the police chief of the tourist town of Jaws.Not as rough, but the same "do the job despite the politicians" and a brave approach.If a man who does not know not swimming is terrified by everything in the water coming out on an old boat with a Wannabee of Ahab and a nerd, to face a huge killer shark, is not foolhardy, so tell me what 'is ...). <br /> <br /> Tony Lo Bianco is good as a surprisingly complex villain; most villains, in fact, have some depth and complexity. This is one of those movies that gets better with repeated viewing. Overall, it captures the atmosphere of parts of the city of New York: gritty, unglamorous, often dangerous, but full of energy. The story is sober, tight and subtle; he does the work without foreign elements. It may not be one of the greatest players of all time, but it's an exceptionally good movie. <br /> <br /> Everyone has their opinion on car chases. Mine is that this one is right up there with the Mustang vs. Dodge Charger Chase at Bullitt. The Pontiac Ventura / Chevy Nova looked a lot like the Mustang because it was a compact car chassis with a reinforced suspension and a powerful V8 block built into an engine compartment for a tasteless 6. The Ventura / Novas had little respect for the acceleration track, but with the appropriate suspension mods, they made affordable performance cars capable of handling both the road and the track. The screams of these GM V8s at the end of the evening are a music in the ear of the enthusiast. I heard this suit criticized for "imitating" Bullitt's lawsuit. The truth is that these are two works by the same master, Bill Hickman, who also choreographed and led for the hunt at French Connection. In addition to directing most car chase scenes, he created a sneaky, malicious presence and a good match with Richard Lynch as two extremely evil killers. <br /> <br /> Yes, the pursuit has often done, such as using 3 different roads from New York to represent Palisades Parkway, the end of the pursuit in an accident with an 18 wheel vehicle on a pavement reserved for passenger vehicles, and the miraculous timing that allows all pedestrians to avoid injuries. It's next to the point. Let's face it: movie car chases are "unreal" by nature. However, in Bullitt, The French Connection and The Seven Ups, Bill Hickman and Phillip D'Antoni have created much more realistic, and therefore more exciting, pursuits than the imaginary pursuits of flying, explosive, and explosive vehicles common in recent movies .
