Owen is inspired by "Strangers on a Train", exchanging murders. That's why Larry has to kill Owen's awful mom (Anne Ramsey, Oscar and Golden Globes nominee). Larry was convinced that Owen had killed Margaret and that he owed / wanted to kill Owen's mom, but everything ends well when months later, Larry and Owen bring books.
