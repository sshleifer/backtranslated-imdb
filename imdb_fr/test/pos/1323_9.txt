Mishima is one of the greatest movies ever made. Now, I think Paul Schrader is the greatest screenwriter of all time, but I do not really like the movies he's made about what I've seen (except this one and Affliction), but it's an amazing, disturbing and highly-rated movie. He follows the life of Yukio Mishima, the most famous writer in Japan, combining the last day of his life with flashbacks and his stories. I do not know how, but Paul Schrader manages to combine all these elements in a very artistic way. The acting is excellent, as is the photography and a perfect score of Philip Glass. Although confusing during the first viewing, it is one of the rare films to be enriched with each viewing. Really an underrated gem of a movie.
