This film is the most impressive Turkish film I have ever seen. "Okul" is probably the first Turkish horror film. I must say that the film excited me for some reasons. The first reason is that the story is impressive. I mean, at the end of the film, you have made all the details of the film, it makes the film attractive and the other reason is that no Turkish man has made such a film before. This shows that the Turkish film improves with time. Although the first trial to make a horror movie, it was really a success. I advise you all not to miss this movie ...
