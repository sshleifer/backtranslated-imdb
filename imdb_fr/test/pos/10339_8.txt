This is the kind of film that we initially chose to compose the video rental numbers ... only to discover an entertaining and pleasant movie underestimated !! The opening sequence of the police arriving in a dark and rainy house in which "the wife" committed a murder ... or is it ?? .... and the rest of the film seeks to reveal what really happened. ... OK ... the film is a little "campy" ... but has a good editing and a good dialogue ..... a professional acting game ..... often humorous ..... and the very last scene with the expression of the face is one of the best of the kind ...... deserves absolutely to be looked at ..... deserves at least a 7 or an 8!
