I just watched Eddie Monroe and was very impressed. The story was easily punctuated when the plot turned out to be a surprise ending. Comforting performances, action, humor and drama filled the screen. Topnotch acting by some talented Long Islanders. Super script. This is the best film that Fred Carpenter has made so far, he should be very proud of this work. Doug Brown's score is on the mark. Craig Morris is the next Tom Cruise or Brad Pitt. It's hard to believe that this is an independent, low-budget film. Just imagine what Carpenter can do with a budget equivalent to Hollywood. Paul Regina's latest film and we miss him a lot and are loved by everyone. He was a great actor, talented and talented, and a great human being. He will look after us all and we will never forget his dynamic smile and spirit. Congratulations to everyone who participated in this film. Some daring flight scenes, and humorous cameos to break the serious content. You will enjoy this movie, go see it!
