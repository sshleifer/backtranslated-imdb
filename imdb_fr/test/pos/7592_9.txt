Every Sunday is one of the most famous and valuable documents in film history, as it offers an invaluable look at the emerging talent of two of its creators. Deanna Durbin and Judy Garland, the most talented and beloved musical performers on screen. <br /> <br /> Although often cited as a screen test, produced by MGM to test the teenage appeal of studio contracted Durbin and Garland, whose options were supposed to be renewed, this assertion is not quite accurate. At the time of the production of EVERY Sunday, in July 1936, Deanna Durbin's contract with MGM had already lapsed and it had been signed by Universal immediately a month earlier, in June 1936. <br /> <br /> However , a provision from Durbin The contract with MGM allowed the studio to exercise an option on its services for a maximum of sixty days, provided that it has not yet started working on a photo in its new studio. While Durbin's first vehicle, THREE SMART GIRLS, was still not ready for filming, MGM chose to exercise its option and, although officially under contract with Universal at the time, Durbin found himself on the Field MGM to film this pleasant short film with Judy Garland, hope in the song of adolescence. <br /> <br /> This, along with Garland's much longer previous experience / professional training (which included appearances in several previous shorts), may explain why EVERY Sunday often seems to favor Judy Garland in place of Deanna Durbin, giving Garland more lines to speak and an original song ("Americana") to sing, while Durbin offers Luigi Ardiiti's classic folk art song "Il Bacio". Admittedly, it would be perfectly logical for MGM to favor one of its own contractual actors rather than that of another rival studio. <br /> <br /> Ironically, even though Garland's character is the most overtly proactive Two girls in this short film, it would be the Universal "Little Miss Fixit" screen character at Universal, who would propel her into the world of celebrity as the first "Teen Idol" in the world with her first vehicle, THREE SMART GIRLS, while Garland A more passive teenage image "at the sneaky wall" would usually see her in supportive roles alongside her partner's frequent screen, Mickey Rooney, and (in ZIEGFELD GIRL), the future editor Lana Turner.It is only during his fifteenth feature in the MGM series, 1942 'FOR ME AND MY GAL (who is also his first role fully grown up): Will Garland achieve the title and single-player status of the real superstar that Durbin instantly acquired six years ago? <br /> <br /> It is therefore completely inaccurate to claim that Garland was the only attraction the two girls' "superstars," while Durbin got that status from the press almost a decade later. in front of his rival MGM. The on-screen evidence strongly suggests that Universal was much faster at realizing Deanna's potential as a superstar than MGM did with Judy, and it is noteworthy that almost all of Garland's notable accomplishments at MGM, from of the superstar bill, for having designed vehicles specially designed to show his talents and appeal, be invited to plant his footprints in the forecourt of the Graumann Chinese Theater, receive an "honorary" Oscar in recognition of his talent, Deanna Durbin has received well before his contemporary MGM gift. <br /> <br /> Anyway, EVERY Sunday is a delicious and unpretentious musical short film, whose story line (Durbin and Garland use their singing skills to prevent Durbin's grandfather be removed by force from the municipal council). directs his Sunday concerts in the park), bodes the lines of the plot of Garland's two musicals "Let's Put on a Show" with Mickey Rooney and 100 MEN AN of Durbin D A GIRL. Unlike Garland's later films, BABES, the short film never deals with the unsubstantial narrative in a serious way and, as a result, its "eleven minutes of time elapses". <br /> <br /> Of course, the true magic of ALL Sundays is the observation of the already remarkable performers / screen presenters of Durbin and Garland at the very beginning of their legendary career. Even at this early stage, both girls had a remarkable on-screen presence and are totally natural and unaffected in their presentation as singers and actresses. Garland explodes loudly from the screen with vitality as she literally writes the lyrics for the song "Americana". As she walks through the number with the appropriate hand gestures, Judy literally chews the words of the song as she fucks her mouth and drools her eyes in her eager eagerness to show what she can do. <br /> <On the other hand, Durbin's presentation of "Il Bacio" is much wiser and more moderate. Although quite appropriate for his "classic" selection, Durbin's performance of the Arditi Waltz is much more typical of the "stand-n sing" type than Garland's physically emotional ride. Nevertheless, although "diva in miniature", Deanna does not attack herself, with her candid eyes, her dazzling smile and her naive rendering, she easily holds the screen with "Baby Baby" Judy and their delicious duo "Americana" in the short film. The finale is all the more regrettable as producer Joe Pasternak never realized his dream of associating Durbin and Garland in a musical feature film (Universal refuses to lend "Number One Asset" Durbin). <br /> <br /> An invaluable document of the emerging talents of two remarkable and absolutely unique talents. See this one if you have the opportunity!
