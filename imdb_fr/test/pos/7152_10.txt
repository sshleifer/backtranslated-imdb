seen this film and totally adored, the characters are great. it's really my kind of movie. This film does not bother me. I love independent movies, they are so much more rewarding. my husband and I really enjoyed Jay's style. If you're an open-minded person who loves thought-provoking movies and loves conversation after it's over, you'll love this movie. Of course, the film will walk on some feet, but who cares that these people will probably not see this movie. it's amazing to see the characters evolve. Jay Floyd really captured both sides of the table. Applause applause Jay, I hope you work on another movie.
