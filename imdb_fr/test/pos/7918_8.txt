It is important to realize that Eisenstein was a committed Marxist filmmaker, carrying very specific theories about what the film could do and how. <br /> <br /> It is simply useless to negatively compare Alexander Nevsky with a similar period in the United States; this film comes from the oldest film school in the world, from another continent, from a totally different approach to cinema. <br /> <br /> To appreciate this film a little more, try to get acquainted with the theories of editing Pudovkin and Kuleshov, for example, or read Wikipedia's entry on Marxist film theory. If you really feel bold, you can even explore the triadic forms of Hegelian dialectics. <br /> <br /> It follows that if you watch this film without some understanding of Eisenstein's ideas and ideals, you probably will not succeed. he. In Alexander Nevsky, the main characters do not play themselves, they are supposed to be distillations of the character of their nation. Nevsky and his generals are deliberately shown larger than life because they represent stylized and heroic aspects of all the Russian people. <br /> <br /> The actors' game is not made of wood, it is supposed to be slightly handled. This represents a school completely different from the more naturalistic and narrative style that Hollywood was rapidly adopting. Eisenstein's films are specially designed * to be unrealistic. If something seems a little "obvious", whether lighting or language or a pose taken by an actor, it is so. Eisenstein was one of the first supporters of the film as an art form and not just as entertainment. <br /> <br /> If editing sometimes seems like a shock of images, well, that's the idea. The films are designed to contrast with each other. Eisenstein's films contain and incorporate elements of a political / philosophical argument, namely the Marxist dialectic. <br /> <br /> So, sit down and shout for Russia and its supporters at the loose nobles and the Teuton invaders, and enjoy the difference.
