SEPARATE LIES is a film so elegant, intelligent and stimulating that I could have seen Tom Wilkinson forever on screen. The locations in the English countryside, the wonderful London locations, the interiors, the stylish wardrobes and of course the writing and the dialogue have made SEPARATE LIES a thrilling adventure. <br /> <br /> That said, and maybe it's just an American point of view, as the British are so much more sophisticated in managing their sexual escapades, I had a hard time watching Tom Wilkinson to stay by his side, while his wife was happily going on a sexual journey that brings him very little joy and creates much despair for her husband, with the caddy who is Rupert Everett. Yes, I saw the weaknesses of Wilkinson's character - his goal of perfection, his desire to put everything in his place - but in Emily Watson, she should have looked deeper into her true character and her strong goodness to achieve that. she had thrown away. <br /> Tom Wilkinson makes SEPARATE LIES a powerful film watching him feel all the pain, embarrassment and desperation on the screen as his wife goes off with another man. And he made the trip to SEPARATE LIES, understanding his faults, kissing his wife, despite everything that happened, and taking her back to London. Well done Tom!
