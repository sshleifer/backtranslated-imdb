Johnny Crawford is terrific in this film where a troubled teenager is becoming a generation in the midst of cultural and spiritual upheaval. Billy Graham does a good job of portraying life in this sweet, sometimes nerdy, but heartfelt film. It gives us a glimpse of not only the social scene but also gives valuable and sound advice that is worth today for morality, decisions, the gap between generations, meetings between teenagers (some statistics presented in this film are stunning statistics today). Just to see Billy in his youth, it's worth seeing. It's a nice film. It made me realize that human nature does not change, even though hair, fashion and language can change, humans are still struggling with the same problems they have struggled with for thousands of years.
