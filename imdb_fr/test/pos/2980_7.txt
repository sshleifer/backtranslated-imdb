I have not seen this movie since it was released in a movie theater and I have been looking for it ever since. At the time I was 12 years old and the story excited me; and NOW, the end escapes me. It was the young love that captivated me the most, not to mention John's voice and Taupin's words. The story (at the time) hit my psyche. I'm a lover of sentimental films and it's still in my head after 35 years - it's as good as that. Place yourself in adolescence and give free rein to your fantasies. If this movie did not excite your curiosity, then you were too old. I can not wait to see him again (even at my age)! If nostalgia is in your place, I'm sure it's an interesting movie to watch. His innocence is simply amazing and his simplicity is so easy and enjoyable.
