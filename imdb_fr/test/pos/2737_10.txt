I remember this caricature for over 50 years - what is the resilience! It was funny and creative; I hope my children and grandchildren would have seen it. He ranks just as high with Winky Dink - another favorite. I was delighted to learn that one of the creators later worked on Rocky and Bullwinkle. These early shows had a lot to offer, unlike today's cartoons. Today's cartoons seem to suggest that something special, a magic formula or a talent is needed to succeed in the face of perverse or dangerous circumstances. The first caricatures did not deal much with evil - it was a much milder and safer time - they allowed us to develop our own talents and character.
