This film is what most actors in the industry have forgotten how to do: family entertainment, which means something nice for people of all ages. Everyone, from toddlers who love colors and pretty bunnies to their grandparents who understand the references of adults, can appreciate this particular Wallace & Gromit. <br /> <br /> This film has a direction as good as the one I have ever seen, and I literally think so. It also contains small pieces of humor and each scene has so many humorous details in the background that I will have to buy it, if only to be able to read all the panels and flyers of the W & G world. <br /> <br /> I plan to see this movie at least twice as much and then buy it on DVD. You should see it too.
