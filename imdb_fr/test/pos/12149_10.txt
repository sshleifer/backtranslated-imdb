One should be able to fall into the "All Hazards Class" only by chance; it should be on the list of "best black films", including IMDb. <br /> <br /> Lino Ventura is as good as ever; Knowing his delicate and delicate family situation gives more weight to his almost inexpressive face and his brief dialogues. The sobriety of Belmondo's performance under the firm direction of Sautet only shows to what wonderful actor he could - and should - have been. "The All Risks Class" is totally minimal, dry and cold, without the artistic Melville decor, its pretty faces and luxury cars. It's almost black film meet neo-realism. The few hard words of Davos to his children, describing their secret life from there, catch your throat until the end of the film. <br /> <br /> The last sentence of the film - a voice-over telling the end of Davos in ten dry, dark words - leaves you with a hard punch in the belly. <br /> <br /> A real gem in the big crown of French film noir.
