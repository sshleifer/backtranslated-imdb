It's a mystery for me to know why I did not catch up with this masterful 1950s caper movie ?? shot black black so far, but I'm certainly happy to report that he did not disappoint. I have not seen any of Jules Dassin's American films for several years, but on this basis, I may come back soon to "Brute Force" and "Night and the City". <br /> <br /> Jean Servais, a name unknown to me but a familiar face in his weariness and coldness, has just completed a long stay in prison. do not do well in the right life. An opportunity arises: an easy multi-million dollar flight that can be done at night without fear of being discovered by a few men. The tight shooting of the flight, half an hour of total silence, is what people remember most about the film, of course, and it is actually quite remarkable; but I liked the location of the final semi-finished shooting, once the theft was made worse by one of the thieves' big jaws; the excellent sanded portraits of Paris in black and white; and Servais channeling Eddie Constantine and Humphrey Bogart in his extravagant but brutal performance. <br /> <br /> It may be a little too sentimental in the end, but it's one of those classics that really lives up to its reputation as pure entertainment, even if that he says about the human condition is not really deep nor prompting reflection; The score of George Auric at the same time modernist, romantic and jazzy is another strong point.
