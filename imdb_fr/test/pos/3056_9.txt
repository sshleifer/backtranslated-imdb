Utopia, made in 1950 in France, was the latest film produced by Laurel and Hardy. With the duo's bad reputation for their post-1930 productions, I was expecting this film to be awful. Although certainly not up to their "vintage" comedies, I was pleasantly surprised. It's visible, and in some parts really funny! And certainly, the plot is the same level as what you expected. Some gags are derived from their previous work, but if you consider that this film was their first for five years after their latest Hollywood-produced movie, "The Bullfighters", the routines are executed with confidence, as you can imagine. Some scenes are not worth much, but the interest of this film is that some scenes are funny and therefore absolutely priceless. I particularly enjoyed the bedtime scene. <br /> <br /> I felt sad at the end of the film. Our heroes are left on their own deserted island. It's a metaphor for the truth in real life. Hollywood and the audience of the day had recorded the stars in a desert island of memories, and this film would become the last image. Ollie died seven years later and Stan died fifteen years later. Stan refused an offer of appearance in "It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad Mad" in 1963. What a shame it was - a color film, just two years before his death. However, his health was probably not in good shape. <br /> <br /> These boys are probably the greatest comedy performers of all time and, although the film is far from their potential, it's always an honor to watch them. appear in the film for the last time, and touching the echoes of their talent.
