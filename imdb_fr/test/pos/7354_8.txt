After the return of the "horror movies" (Scream is not scary!), I did not have much hope for this horror movie at low budget. But I was positively surprised! Man it's scary !!! The first 2 stories are just great. The first concerns a couple of newlyweds driving in a dark forest with their RV, when they come up against a violent ........ (watch the movie)! The second story is about a disgusting man who is obsessed with a little girl, who is alone at home for a night ... I know it does not sound special but it's scary. I promise you. The last story is not scary but at least not bad. It's a biker and a ghosthouse. In fact, the stories are based on real urban legends (I guess Kevin William can also steal ideas). Rent this movie, it's good !!! I would say it's the scariest horror movie ever!
