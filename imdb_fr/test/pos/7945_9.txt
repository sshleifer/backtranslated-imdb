I saw this movie in the early 70s and was mesmerized by Judy Geeson. For me, this reflected the clandestine nature of Rod Steigers, an irrepressible obsession for the young and extremely sexy self-taught hiker played by Geeson. <br /> <br /> You could not feel a little sorry for the woman, played brilliantly by Claire Bloom. I was really disappointed to see that the original montage may have been lost and that it is unlikely to be published on DVD. <br /> <br /> I challenge anyone who has seen the film, and the strong message that it is not too much to be absorbed by the three main characters, I would have liked to see him again, if nothing else for a purely nostalgic reason. <br /> <br /> Go back in time, some 35 years. <br /> A real classic.
