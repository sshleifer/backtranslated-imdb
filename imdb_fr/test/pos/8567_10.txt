H.O.T.S. Proof that one day the film industry said "F-OFF" to censors and made movies with everything they wanted! In today's world, this film would be too "extreme" and "extreme" to be placed behind a velvet curtain. Although BestBuy has several copies on their rack at $ 5.99 (in case someone wants to get one)! The film was brilliant in its own way, in that it mixed humor into a T & A movie loaded with Playboy Playmates! Unlike most skin films, there was a plot. However, that is not why you will look at H.O.T.S. <br /> <br /> H.O.T.S. is a university film that reminds me of Revenge of the Nerds movies, in that it takes a group of "ordinary people" and places them against the richest prepps that most people can not stand! The only difference is that the "Nerds" of this movie have a much better chance of getting laid in the air! I notice that some people would assign a low note to this film, which is for me an ignorant! Obviously, this is not meant to win Oscars or break the barriers in the movies. If you are looking for it, then watch what critics choose for you! You have to understand the fact that this movie was actually a fun plot, a decent acting game (for the most part considering the genre) and a lot of girls undressing! H.O.T.S. This is one of those movies that you watch to forget the current problems and the daily stress, and to laugh and have a good time! If you're looking for a fun college-based movie with enough skin to turn a pink Miata into a straight line, then you should definitely watch H.O.T.S.
