This film aims to do something very special, but also not to do certain things. In short, its premeditated trajectory is definitive: to treat the idea of ​​coping with death (with very few choices and all the bad ones) as serious and real rather than as a casual or amusing thing. In search of this realism, he avoided certain conventions such as obvious arcs and hooks. This does not concern the characters as much as the human condition. It does not matter what the actors would do ... What would you do in their situation? <br /> <br /> Open Water may have been a starting point for this film, but it goes much further. Unlike this film, it does not deceive the public in the end when you discover that there are not really sharks per se. This has a real monster, not just the idea of ​​a monster and not just an animated character. It also has great production values ​​given what these ingenious filmmakers had to work with. And again, unlike the other movie, it has an exhilarating and brilliantly rendered action at its peak. And let's not forget the presence, we say "dazzling", of his youngest star on the screen. It can prove to be a discovery.
