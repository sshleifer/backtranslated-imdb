It may not be Oscar material, but it was a very funny movie. I have always been a fan of Eddie (Edmondson) and Richie (Mayall). "Bottom" and "Young Ones" were legendary television series, and it was time for them to shoot a movie. Some of the things they're getting ready are brilliant, from the pencil in the background, to the rubber pants, and the famous phrase Richie says when he falls and a candle he's carrying falls in the eyes. He tells Eddie "Candle in the eye, candle in the eye", and Eddie, the naive he is, sticks the candle in his eye. I can not forget when Eddie is on his motorcycle and he needs to urinate .... It was an excellent comedy not to be taken seriously, but the film lacked a ridiculous end. <br /> <br /> Overall, an excellent comedy, full of laughter and many false green vomit. A 9/10. <br /> <br />
