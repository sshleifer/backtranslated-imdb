Monkees, surprisingly, are my favorites. Yes, they could have been the original rock band; a gimmick that certainly exceeded the limits in the 21st century. However, their music resists as some of the best of the 1960s had to offer. Last Train To Clarksville, Dreamer Believer, I'm a Believer, (I'm not) Your Stepping Stone, Valleri and Pleasant Valley Sunday are great songs, written by good songwriters like Boyce / Hart, Neil Diamond, Goffen / King and John Stewart. Although they were neither great musicians nor songwriters, their on-screen presence was nice and appealing, and some of their own films were actually decent. Their V show is dated in 2007, but I still look at it sometimes as a time capsule of life in 1966-1968; This magical and dangerous period in the history of the United States. <br /> <br /> However, as we all know, the future of Kelly Clarkson suggests things to come, the Monkees did not want to be considered puppets for their record company. Despite their average talents, they wanted to write their own songs, produce their own albums and embark on tours. Unfortunately, it turned out to be a disaster; Especially when Peter Tork chose Jimi Hendrix as the first part that was canceled because of the theft of the series and heavy sexual suggestions in his music in relation to the content of The Monkees G-Rated. <br /> <br /> However, the last nail in the coffin of the Monkees (until 1986) was the infamous film movie Head. Head was written by Bob Rafelson and Jack Nicholson while they were apparently very high on the Mary Jane. The film receives bad reviews and brings in only $ 16,000 at the box office. Today, the film is a cult classic, ahead of its time and delivers a message on what the youth of spirit had in mind in 1968, Summer Of Anger. <br /> <br /> The head really does not have a plot. Basically, one to four of the Monkees change scene from scene to scene without rhyme or reason. They go from eating in a restaurant, to seeing Davy Jones being beaten up by Sonny Liston, to a western, to being sucked into the void, to performing at a concert, and so on. The film essentially offers oblique views on what was wrong with American society. The Monkees do not care about commercialism, the war in Vietnam, American politics, censorship, establishment and greed. You have to read between the lines to see what were the targets of derision. <br /> <br /> The Monkee spend a lot of time at certain intersections of the film, symbolizing the perception that their record company has seen; like nothing but toys for them when it was time to record another successful album. A scene where they are more than 16 to 4 in the western scene could be the symbol in front of the session. Musicians, songwriters, record producers, etc., who controlled their careers and the cannon they shot at them, that's their way of saying "Begone!" . <br /> <br /> The movie is really a psychedelic trip to see. The flashy tie-dye colors, the hypnotic concert and belly dance scenes and the perverse images are everywhere. The acting is actually very good but it was biased, as I like The Monkees T.V .. A small soundtrack includes "The song of the porpoise" and three songs written by the Monkees themselves. <br /> <br /> The film sometimes has hilarious scenes; although maybe they were not supposed to be. Mickey Dolenz hitting a coke machine that did not give him soda or his punches in the boxing scene (I mean, he was a nervous guy who probably weighed no more than 135) made me to laugh. /> <br /> All in all, this movie is a must for all fans of Monkees. I think a lot of people will feel that this movie is "above their head", but those who are obsessed with the 60s and society at the time will find an excellent time capsule.
