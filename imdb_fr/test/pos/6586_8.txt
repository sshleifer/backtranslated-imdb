For Estonians, Finland sometimes appears as a land of dreams. A country where many of us want to go to work or start their own business. Find love, start a new life, etc. But ... Aku Louhimies realized this brilliant piece that shows that everything is not so good in Finland too. That Finland can be as good as Paha maa (The bad land) than any other country. This shows that people can be as miserable in their lives as we everywhere else. That sometimes there is nothing good. This film shows why Finland is one of the first suicidal countries. It's not easy to live in the north. The cold climate changes us. I am more and more attracted to Finnish films and this one is very good. The acting game is great too. Jasper Pääkkönnen has become one of the best Finnish stars. Be wary of the sex scene (if you have small children) and a little depression that could come after the movie! 8/10
