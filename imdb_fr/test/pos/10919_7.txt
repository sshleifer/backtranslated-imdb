In & Out was a funny comedy with good performances by Joan Cusack, Tom Selleck, Matt Dillon and Kevin Kline. The thought that Kevin Kline is gay was very funny. If I were him, I'd hate to say that I'm gay at his own wedding with his family, his friends and his future wife. It would happen very rarely. I also liked a lot when he was dancing when the voice of the radio spoke to him. I would say that In & Out was a stupid comedy with lots of laughs and laughs. It's a recommended comedy and Kevin Kline had a great performance as a gay. Believe me, this movie will please you. <br /> <br /> 7/10
