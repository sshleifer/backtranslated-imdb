I feel helpless as this film is brilliant. Kieslowski is a writer, a philosopher; and although he is an excellent filmmaker, his greatness lies in his writing; and "Red" is his paradigm. This film is a metafictive study of the artist's judgment in the creation of his fictional world; how an artist can try to redo his life - even his - through his art, even though he can not escape the idea that, no matter how he mixes with his story, it is always a fiction and a new world, always charged with its unreality and the reality of life that he tried to remake artistically. And magically, all this is not small, to the detriment of a wonderful story about the mysteries of love and destiny and the characters who live this story, this prejudiced destiny. If I had to choose, I could name the biggest film of all time.
