I'm glad Cage changed his name to Coppolla and got this role on his own. Light, no deep thought is needed, but a nice article on opposites that attract - even if his parents are still hippies ... Capture the voice of the early 80s - the groan of the valley and the funk of the 'other side. We can see the beginning of Cage's talent.
