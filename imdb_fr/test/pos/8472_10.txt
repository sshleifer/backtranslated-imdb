Ray is one of those movies that makes you pause. In fact, you think about what you heard or what you read about this man, and it does not even close. On my first visit to Ray, I forgot I was watching a movie where I felt like a voyeur watching the life of this man through a window. This film is so captivating that it draws you in and involves all the emotions you experience in an emotional roller coaster ride. When it's over, you do not want to do it again soon because it has that kind of emotional punch that other movies are lacking. Jamie Foxx has earned his Oscar and rightly so his performance is spectacular and should be considered the reference by anyone who wants to do a biography as soon as possible. This film is as good as its subject deserved at the same time the classic title and the legend.
