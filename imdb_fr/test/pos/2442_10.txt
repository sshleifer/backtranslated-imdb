This is the Australian television series. It's a classic. Stories and actors are excellent. Who can forget Picker and his gramophone or Chet in an ambush? This is the cult television. The Australian actors of the series were the best of their time and have immortality in The Outsiders. What can I say timeless adventure. The music and the song are fantastic. The closing credits begin with the close-up of the wheel, and then Keir asleep gets jostled and the long shot just can not be much better than that. The 13 episodes are just as solid in depicting the Australian myth and I think that's what this series did. It does not matter that the two main characters are strangers, I think it's the key to the series and the reason is good.
