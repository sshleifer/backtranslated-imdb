I attended the screening of "Fierce People" at the Woodstock Film Festival 2006. I hesitate to call it "premiere", since it was shot in the spring of 2004 and its world premiere took place at Tribeca in 2005. That year she played in several festivals. The liberation seemed imminent, then it disappeared. Poof. Faded away. Or, he appeared to the audience of the film. Rumors of theatrical release or DVDs have arisen from time to time, but all have proved unfounded. Then, this projection was announced. Maybe we can call it a "re-premiere?" I certainly felt like witnessing a buried treasure. And what a treasure it was. <br /> <br /> I guess we could describe the "ferocious people" as a drama of maturity. But it also includes elements of comedy and tragedy, as well as mystery. And a little stuffing thrown in. In short, the real life. This makes it difficult to categorize, which places it more in the category of an independent film as opposed to a Hollywood movie. But its high production values, high budget and star cast seem to contradict the independent label. Let's call it a hybrid. And, maybe, that's why he was "lost". This defies categorization. <br /> <br /> Meet Finn Earl (Anton Yelchin), age 15, whose father is absent. In fact, Finn never knew him. But he sees it and hears it through the collection of home movies sent from South America. Papa is a renowned anthropologist and made a name for himself by settling with the Yanomani, the tribe of "Fierce People" who live to kill and procreate. All their activities are built around these two "tasks" and Finn is captivated. Mom Liz (Diane Lane) is also somewhat absent. Although physically present, she is lost in a world of cocaine and alcohol. So Finn becomes an adult in his lonely little world with his movie reels. <br /> <br /> One summer, Mom decides to take her with her to the wilds of New Jersey. A massage therapist, Mum entrusted wealthy client Ogden C. Osborne (Donald Sutherland with a tour de force) and invited her for an extended home visit to her lavish estate. The Osborne "tribe" includes an assortment of rich and eccentric villagers, servants and idiots among whom Finn will find himself in the context of his own anthropological study. Will his experience with daddy's films help him survive life as a visitor to this tribe? Will he be accepted? Or will he be considered a stranger fighting simultaneously with his own identity as a teenager? That is the subject of fairy tales, and I suppose that would be the case, without the dark belly that the director Griffin Dunne and the writer Dirk Wittenborn breathed into this magnificent story. Interrupting films at his father's house, Finn must relearn how to be the teenager he never had the chance to be, stop being the parent of his mother, allow his new mother sober to to be his parent and learn to take responsibility for becoming an adult as it should have been from the beginning. Yet he needs this transformation in a dark and dangerous world where playing with fire is a folly for this fractured family. <br /> <br /> This is primarily a story-based film, and Griffin Dunne has emphasized it as much. in the intro of the film. He bought the rights to Wittenborn's novel at the time of writing, and Wittenborn's script comes to life in the hands of the magisterial Dunne, which is a work of wonder. <br /> It's also largely a character-driven movie, and Sutherland has never been so successful. His stunt while Osborne stuns people around me and will probably leave you astonished. The character of Diane Lane finally presents so many personalities that it is hard to imagine that another actor is doing as well. She is breathtaking. But most of all, "Fierce People" is Anton Yelchin's film. He has a long resume as a child actor but very little as a teenager. Other than the little-known "House of D" (also a jewel), he is best known as Byrd on TV "Huff". In January, he will be seen in "Alpha Dog" (also on the shelves since 2004, a movie I saw at Sundance this year and in which he is the "heart and soul"). His performance here far exceeds what one would expect from a young man. She is simply spectacular. <br /> <br /> This complex and offbeat movie has been out of sight for a long time. "Fierce People" is a treasure filled with shadow and light, comedy and tragedy, joy and pathos, but above all wonder.
