Brian Foster, electrifying actor of electronics and director of the film "Land of the Lost" by Wesley Eure, creates a computerized watchdog called C.H.O.M.P.S. (acronym for Canine Home Protection System) for his boss, Ralph Norton (beautifully portrayed by Conrad Baain), whose home security business is in full swing. A rival company hires two criminals unfit to get their hands on C.H.O.M.P.S. this task is easier said than done. Director Don Chaffey tells the touching story of dopey at a steady pace, maintains a friendly, silly tone, and portrays silly gags with considerable flair. In addition, the players in the game are having fun: the adorable Valerie Bertinelli in the case of Casey Norton, the sweet fiance of Brian, Chuck McCann in the role of the scammer Brooks, Red Buttons in the role of his partner, Bracken, Jim Backus in the role of CEO, Mr. Gibbs, Hermoine Baddel as the beautiful old maid Miss Foster, and the AIP's 60s opera, portray a regular, Larry Bishop, as a macabre and duplicated tailor, Ken Sharp. Better still, the titular dog is a delight: C.H.O.M.P.S. jumps through fences, walls and windows with incredible agility, performs acts of exceptional strength, runs faster than a deer and even performs some nifty martial arts moves. A subplot on an awesome neighborhood dog named Monster provides some extra belly laughs (Monster is voiced by an uncredited guy with a deep, serious voice). The sequence of animated opening credits, Charles F. Wheeler's brilliant cinematography and Hoyt Curtin's brilliant and exciting disco score are all solid. A cute little movie for kids.
