Helges best movie by far. Very funny, very surreal. If Bunuel shot a movie starring Buster Keaton in the role of Krusty the Clown, he would look like this. <br /> <br /> The outstanding performances of the cast are already known from other Schneider films, including Helmut KÃ¶rschgen as a friend of 00Schneider. (Andreas Kunze who plays the woman again in this one is a little embarrassing). And of course, Helge himself as Nihil Baxter is absolutely amazing. <br /> <br /> P.S: If this movie had a good merchandising, I would really like to buy a replica of this painting "Holz ist".
