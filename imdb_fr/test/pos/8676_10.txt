I heard an interview with the main actor who said that the film was not meant to be a horror movie but that it would describe it as a mental horror. I strongly agree with that. <br /> <br /> We do not know why he goes to this place, but everything is monotonous, no bright colors, no honest smiles, nothing personal. Everything is orderly and everyone seems happy to live this kind of life. From the beginning, our "hero" seems to be misplaced and feels it himself. <br /> <br /> What makes this film so important and so good is the remarkable similarity to life in many big cities or even in countries nowadays. You must work, you are not supposed to inform your colleague of your weaknesses, you show your wealth, your car, etc., and most importantly, you miss the true love of children's lives. Of course, in this film, you do not see children or old people - they are just not part of a strong worker society. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this movie to everyone - and make sure this utopia does not happen true!
