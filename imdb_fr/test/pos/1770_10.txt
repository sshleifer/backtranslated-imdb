The distribution of this Rigoletto production is excellent. Edita Gruberova sings Gilda beautifully and passionately. Luciano Pavarotti also sings wonderfully. Vergara is a beautiful Maddalena; Fedora Barbieri is a famous older singer who sings maid Giovanna. Weikl sings Marullo; Wixell sings both Rigoletto and Monterone. As a Rigoletto, Wixell is probably the most convincing acting singer in this set, which is hard to beat by great singers. Kathleen Kuhlmann in the Countess. All directors are well known and world renowned. <br /> <br /> It's an exciting Rigoletto, both visually and musically. <br /> <br /> I have it on DVD disc and laser disc. You should have it too!
