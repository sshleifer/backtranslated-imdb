First, if you're not a fan of the low-budget horror genre, do not bother with that. You really have to be a fan to get the gag. <br /> <br /> These are basically moves about snakes .. on a train. Many of them. <br /> <br /> There is an old curse and a crazy ending that I will not spoil. The gore effect is full and really disgusting ... but the movie is mainly a gag gore about snakes that scare a group of people trapped in a train. <br /> <br /> The suspense is built Well, there are memorable scenes and well composed .. some actors are a little hammered (attention surf guys) but it's not really the goal .. Give a chance to this movie. Know what to expect and you will not regret it!
