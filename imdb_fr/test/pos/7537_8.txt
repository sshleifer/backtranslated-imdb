About as funny as the 1950s British comedy can become, THE BELLES OF ST TRINIAN'S has almost a gag per minute ... and at 91 minutes, it's a great time. Other films I also recommend from the same period are THE TITFIELD THUNDERBOLT and THE GREEN MAN. In fact, any movie with Alistair Sim or Terry Thomas, George Cole, Richard Wattis or Joyce Grenfell or any other combination is a delight. In ST TRINIAN'S, we get a double dose of Sims playing two roles with this hilarious disdain that he constantly leaves on his face. Joyce Grenfell as Ruby Gates (oh my name, this name!) Interprets her jolly hockey sticks constable-incognito to hilarious perfection. The best bursts of laughter probably come from George Cole like Flash Harry (coming out of a bush when we whistle over) and various visits from Mrs. Fritton (Sims) in the classrooms in reaction to the explosions ("Oh poor Betty! ") Or the production of scientific laboratories" just send a few bottles of it in my room ". Each part of the film is funny characters, their costumes, antics and the frame. There were suites but the first three were the best: including this one, MURDER BLUE AT ST TRINIAN'S and later in color: THE GREAT ST TRINIAN'S ROBBERY TRAIN.
