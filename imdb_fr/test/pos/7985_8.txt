What can I say, this movie is amazing. it has its flaws, like every movie, for example, flickering tombstones in a graveyard, a slide clearly visible during the penguin death scene, Max Shreck loses his heavy coat in a split second between the company's plans in image consulting, Batman loses his black eye make-up all of a sudden so he can reveal Bruce Wayne to Catwoman, the dialogues being recorded but rendered and spoken differently than when they were spoken initially, and Catwoman knows suddenly how to use a whip without any training whatsoever. These defects are minor compared to those you would see in Batman, for example, where the diviner can obviously be seen waiting for his tail or Val Kilmer's hair changing between shots. <br /> <br /> What makes this film so deserving 8/10 is great because the performances are absolutely extraordinary. Michael Keaton resumes his role as Batman and has a lot more to do in this movie. He looks more comfortable in the role the second time and is tied with the performances of the bad guys. Danny Devito is the perfect penguin. I really like the conversion of the penguin into a grotesque penguin instead of the non-threatening character of the comic book or the TV series, because the character has more depth and a much more interesting story that stems from the basic need of the family and to feel accepted and wanted. it gives us a bad character for whom we feel sympathy because he has been rejected to be what he is, it is not his fault. Michelle Pfeiffer is excellent as a Catwoman. she is teeming and sexy and she is also a nasty person for whom we may feel sorry for the way she is victimized. Christopher Walken is a big bad villain and a character so interesting even if he is not in the batman universe. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is much better than the first and Danny Elfman is more likely to show it. out of his musical talents this time around. The sets are extraordinary. They are detailed, catchy, sinister, gothic, unique, dark and many other adjectives can describe how incredible they are. the costumes and makeups are excellent and, of course, a lot of work has gone into making them. All the work is worth it because the Batsuit is better, the cat suit is superb to look at and the make-up and effects of the penguins are so convincing. the penguins look very realistic and are played wisely. The script is really good and the scenario in my opinion is plausible. Overall, because of all these factors, this movie deserves an 8/10 and remains my favorite among all the batman movies.
