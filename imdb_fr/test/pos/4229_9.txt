I was expecting it to be like the others, trying to be scary - ends up looking silly. Somewhere along the line, the writers surely understood that and so took the film in a totally different direction, essentially ignoring the other films. It looks like a different movie rather than the fourth entry in the Child's Play series. The new idea works, which is by far the best of the series.
