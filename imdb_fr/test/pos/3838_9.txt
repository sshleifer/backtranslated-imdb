Lovable characters, beautiful animation, songs with dynamite ... all that, and cute kittens too. There is a lot of great humor, but no real threat, so do not worry about your little ones. The two farm dogs steal the show, even if they only appear in two scenes. The work has a linear quality that can put off some people, but I find it charming.
