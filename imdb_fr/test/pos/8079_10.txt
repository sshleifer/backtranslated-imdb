In the year 2000 (remember, it was two years ago and not four), two men were motivated to create the most miraculous work on this side of the Mississippi. <br /> <br /> Thanks to Jere Cunningham and Tom Flynn, the whole world can now enjoy Second String, a delicious TV movie telling the story of a gang of ragpickers (and the title) being pushed into the starting position due to a bad oyster order. <br /> <br /> Due to the motivation of director Robert Lieberman and last-minute QB of Buffalo Bills, Dan "Give em em Hell" Heller (portrayed by Canadian actor Gil Bellows), the very common snake Super Bowl Bits-bitten bills are in the ultimate position. <br /> <br /> With an intriguing mix of internal and external conflicts, a love story, a camaraderie that only the beautiful sport of football can bring, and a general theory that the oppressed Second String is an excellent movie worthy of watching every possible moment of its broadcast on TNT. <br /> <br /> The only thing that could be a problem in this production is the spelling of the name of the costume designer, Jenifur Jarvis. <br /> <br />
