Probably one of his less known films, he suffers from the same lack of visibility as Salvador in being one of his best. <br /> <br /> Written by and featuring Eric Bogosian, Talk Radio tells the story of a man of opinion a telephone host who disturbs the wrong kind of listener. The film is important and has a lot to say about the issues of freedom of expression and the degree of freedom that should be its, and you can easily say that it started as a play. Know what you are doing before sitting down to watch the movie and everything will be fine. <br /> <br /> There is not much to do in the actors' game since Bogosian is pretty much stealing the film, he writes with permission to fumble, I could not take my eyes off him and that was part of the fascination of many listeners; people who hated him did not want to extinguish their actions in case they missed something. <br /> <br /> Not for everyone, but a very good drama and, overall, a very good movie.
