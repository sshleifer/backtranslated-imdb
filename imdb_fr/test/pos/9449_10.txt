It is a classic American film combined with comedy, romance and dreams. you can say, "There have already been a lot of this kind of movies. but believe me, you'll find it's a good choice because it's well done, scripted and played. Amanda Bynes is just incredibly amazing! she is funny, cute and charming both inside and outside the screen. she is the man indeed !!! the message I receive is to pursue your own fairy tale. what I mean by "fairy tale" is not the one with prince and princess, but says "faith". that is, it tells us to keep your faith, your dreams and things that make you regret all your life if you do not do it. one of those movies you can not miss in your life.
