The film invites comparisons to Shakespeare. Mandarin is beautifully written and spoken, and the plot is intricate and intriguing. Gong Li has never been so beautiful, never the glory that China has been better represented on the screen. The balance between the political unrest and the personal intrigue that Gladiator has hinted at but never really delivered is unequal here. Simply incredible.
