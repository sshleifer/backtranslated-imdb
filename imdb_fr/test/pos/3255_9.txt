Light spoilers <br /> <br /> ... and it's "the top ten of all time". I stumbled upon "Two Hands" by accident (maybe it made it all the more special - no exaggerated expectations) on IFC one night, and I could not believe I had never heard of it . Now that Heath Ledger is more and more famous in the United States, I'm sure its availability is increased. At the time, I was talking about the film to friends, and no one could find it anywhere other than the IFC's occasional screenings. <br /> <br /> Anyway, in the genre of black comedy / gangsters, that fits well with my other favorites, and everyone in the movie really seems to end up with what it deserves . Bryan Brown is hilarious as the main gangster who makes origami with his grandson and plays scrabble with his henchmen. The fate of the car thief at random is also hilarious. Even Heath was pretty good there. At the time, I vaguely remembered him from an ephemeral Fox series called "Roar". Hopefully Gregor Jordan will do another shot, but as far as I'm concerned, it's his best at the moment.
