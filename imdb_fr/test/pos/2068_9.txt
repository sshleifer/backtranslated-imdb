Amazing, amazing, amazing. What more can one say? Jacobi is the best Hamlet to have ever etched the scene and captures every inch of the character. Each nuance and element of Hamlet is well described. Some people have complained about his age, but honestly, you can not know it when you watch the movie. At least he looks radically younger than 40 years old. I only wish that a more dignified Ophelia could be found. Her game is passable but she does not watch the game. The only real exceptional performances come from Jacobi and Stewart, a great Claudius. The rest of the cast is good, but Jacobi is what really raises this game show.
