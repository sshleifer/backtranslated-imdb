Snakes on a Plane was a film so excited that it was both inevitable and a little crazy to try to release another film with almost the same title the same year and even less the same week. By reading other reviews here, I see the results. Many people are crazy. Mad because he does not have the best special effects. Mad because he does not have a star cast. Foolish because they wanted to see Samuel Jackson say, "I'm fed up with these things - Er F * ^ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ^ (^% -Ing Train "! <br /> <br /> Well, it's certainly not the version of Samuel Jackson, and maybe that's good. <br /> <br /> Snakes on a plane were lost between the crime movie and horror, a family action movie, and a bloody, bloody film about death Saturday Night Live's artists laughed as Jackson swore enough to have a grandmother cover her ear and, to the extent possible, the children would be traumatized by the violence. <br /> Snakes on a Train knew exactly what it was, it was a horror movie. made inexpensively on a train, missing a step in its plot or intention while the "on a Plane" version stumbled upon itself in the first scene. <br /> <br /> I appreciated the pleasure No limit that Snakes took Plane had to offer and I admit that the "... we" train "was a little dry. But hey, in the trade, it was a cool and unexpected story. This little horror movie could have been a lot more wrong than it was. <br /> <br /> For that, he gets a 7 out of 10.
