Danton was a hero and one of the founders of the French Revolution of 1789. This film is shot five years later and the revolution has turned into an ugly thing. While the revolution initially promised freedom, the small committee charged with leading the country is extremely repressive and a dictatorship. Danton and his friends were unhappy that the country was not better off in 1794 than before they got rid of their king, so they began to criticize the government. The film begins as the printer who creates critical pamphlets about the government is beaten and his business is destroyed. So much for "freedom, equality and fraternity"! Thus, after being silenced in this way, Danton et al. Begin to publicly criticize the government. Finally, Robespierre (the head of the committee) and his acolytes prepare charges, organize a trial and get rid of dissent. Some mentioned that the Polish director Wajda also wanted it to be a criticism of his own nation - which at the time was Soviet-dominated and very repressive. It makes sense when you see the film unfold - especially when the government destroys any dissent "in the name of the people". <br /> <br /> The acting game is good, the story compelling and I have no major criticism to make about the movie. However, I really wish the end was treated differently. Especially because, apart from history buffs and the French, it is unlikely that we will not know that this execution helped to put an end to the government. AFTER this purge of Danton in April 1794, Robespierre himself was executed in July 1794 because the country had just enough. In addition, the French survivors knew that they too would face the guillotine if this disease system remained in place. A sort of epilogue would have been good, like showing the soldiers the coming of Robespierre. He reacted by trying to kill himself first, but he managed to tear off only part of his face - still alive, he was guillotined shortly thereafter. It would have been a small dandy epilogue and could have been done in about five minutes. However, not showing a connection between Danton's death and the fall of the government is a strange thing to omit.
