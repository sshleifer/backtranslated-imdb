I have great memories watching "Robin of Sherwood" on TV when I was a child (but I think I only saw the episodes of Michael Praed for some reason). And recently, my brother bought the new DVD-Boxes of the complete series. It was great to see him again, and it's the best of all Robin Hood movies and television series. The distribution is fantastic and the places mixed with the music of Clannad give a very special feeling. Personally, I think Praed is the best of both Robins, but Jason Connery was a great choice to continue the series. Ray Winstone, Nicolas Grace and Robert Addie play Will Scarlet, the sheriff of Nottingham and Guy de Gisburne. Too bad a fourth season never took place and I also learned that the writer Richard Carpenter was actually planning to make a feature film following the events of the series. Robert of Huntingdon (Connery) could finally marry Marion (Judi Trott), or maybe Herne the hunter could resurrect Robin de Loxley (Praed), and he could get revenge on the sheriff. As mentioned before; if the producers of "Robin Hood: The Prince of Thieves" would have been smart, they would have had the cast of "Robin Sherwood" and would have turned the film into a kind of sequel to the series. As Ray Winstone says in the bonus, it would have been nice to see them as old men, as in "Robin and Marian" by Sean Connery. Who knows, we will perhaps see this perfect interpretation of the legend in the future. In any case, we can now watch our favorite series again and again!
