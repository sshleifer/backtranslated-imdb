"Cover Girl" is the best musical ever made by Rita Hayworth. We will always remember Mrs. Hayworth for "Gilda", however, the next film would be "Cover Girl". The story is great. This is a dancer who wants to be a cover girl and who makes a big one in show business. She does it without the help of her talented boyfriend dancer / director (Gene Kelly). Mr. Kelly has the opportunity to choreograph music numbers. The dances are spectacular. It's fun to see Phil Silvers, a comic, doing the musical numbers with Mrs. Hayworth and Mr. Kelly. <br /> <br /> The support cast is perfect. Lee Bowman is lucky to be an interesting third wheel, the other boyfriend.
