Minor Spoilers <br /> <br /> In Chicago, Grace Beasley (Kathy Bates) is a housewife married to attorney Max Beasley (Dan Aykroyd) for twenty-five years and to a hysterical and psychotic dwarf stepdaughter , Maudey (Meredith Eaton). Grace loves singer Victor Fox (Jonathan Price), who will present a TV show in Chicago and give five spots in the front row of a TV promotion. Kate calls the show and wins a ticket, when Max simultaneously asks for the divorce, claiming that their life is too monotonous. Grace becomes depressed and, when she goes to the show, the public is informed that a Chicago serial killer, using a crossbow, has killed Victor Fox. With a broken heart, she decides to fly to England at the funeral of Victor Fox. There, she realizes that he is gay and becomes the friend of his former comrade Dirk Simpson (Rupert Everett). They return to Chicago to try to find the killer. This film is a delightful comedy drama, original and strange, with weird characters. It has huge potential to become a cult movie, with the presence of Julie Andrews and Barry Manilow themselves and a joke with Nicolas Roeg's masterpiece "Do not Look Now", when Maudey is wearing a raincoat red in the subway of Chicago. . The beginning of the film, where Jonathan Price sings "Hitchcock Railway", is wonderful. I repeated it four times in a row. The cast presents a magnificent performance starring Kathy Bates, Jonathan Price, Rupert Everett and the unknown Meredith Eaton. Indeed, this film is an excellent entertainment. My vote is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Amor a Toda Prova" ("Love to the proof")
