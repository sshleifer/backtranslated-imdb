This movie dates from the 1980s and that's what I like so much in this film. He does a great job of conveying the feeling of this strange decade. The reality that Russian nuclear weapons could erase you at any time. Reagan at the White House told everyone that everything was fine, as more and more social programs were destroyed. Young people dropped out of school, but not as much as their 1960s parents. Young people continued to go to school, they smoked so much that their sensibilities were dead. Nothing affected them, not even the death of one of their classmates in the hands of one of their friends. It's odd to realize that the murder was wrong, but you do not know why. Watching the characters face the crime is fascinating and tells a very sick society. Glover is awesome, Keanu is awesome, Hopper is amazing. One of the most memorable films I have ever seen.
