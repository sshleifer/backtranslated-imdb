I would suggest that Only the Valiant is one of the most original, intriguing and weird movies that Peck ever made; bold, surprising and one of his rare Best Western (- no, no, of course, not really a western, but a military chronicle, which is sometimes better). It's a rather weak budget, but, oh, very original and striking. This is one of those pleasures that a real buff sometimes receives; movies that no one has told you yet exist. You say, "It sounds intriguing or interesting" and exceeds your expectations. <br /> <br /> In total, the script shows an unusual level of maturity for westerns - and that reminded me anyway. obliquely from ULZANA; it is also a suspense quite simple. <br /> <br /> Peck looked daring to be a young, tough officer, a little dark and stoic; and there are a lot of unexpected touches - like the blonde kissing and flirting with the one she has decided not to marry, maybe a sense of justice and retribution towards her. <br /> <br /> ONLY ?? is more than just a military tale, it's also an action drama, a suspense movie, an action thriller / thriller, the weirdest combo imaginable; a group of soldiers in a special mission to thwart and stop a possible attack of natives ?? - the senseless decision not to take all available troops to the place where these natives could be arrested ?? but only a handful of people ?? - and this plot never takes a crappy road ?? as most would and would have done ?? The interest for humans, for men, for their reasons and their actions, never fades. <br /> <br /> A word about Peck himself; he plays brilliantly, and although I usually find his famous films tasteless and boring, on small outings I find all of Peck's gloomy, even scary glamor intact. He was an unusual star. <br /> <br /> I gladly recommend this extraordinary film.
