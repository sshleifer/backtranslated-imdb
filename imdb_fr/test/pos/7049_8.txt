I know it was a crazy movie, but I enjoyed it a lot. This is one of the experiences that make me smile when someone says "Bill Murray". I almost always like movies involving outsiders, and this movie has more outsiders than you can count on. It's a nice movie overall - some adults are not well packaged, but laughter is more tolerant than brutal, as is often the case with many teen movies. Rich children on the other side of the lake are being beaten, but no one I know is interested. I never went to camp, but I did some things that were a little parallel and most of the "bits" and tricks were true. They were sometimes even underestimated, but I'm sure it was an accident. The actors played well, with Bill Murray showing clues as to what he would become. It's not Groundhog Day or broken flowers, but, hey, a good, crazy laugh should be appreciated these days, but then ... it does not matter ...... ........... ..............
