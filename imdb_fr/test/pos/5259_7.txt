Mary Haines (Meg Ryan) a rich woman discovers that her husband is cheating on her with a younger woman (Eva Mendes). She does not know what to do and her friends Sylvia Fowler (Annette Bening), Edie Cohen (Debra Messing) and Alex Fisher (Jad Pinkett Smith) try to help her. <br /> <br /> OK - there was no reason to redo the 1939 movie. It's a real classic and does not need to be updated and redone. Naturally this has been done. This has had some of the worst reviews I've ever seen for a movie. I like the original and I've seen it a LOT of times - I constantly compared it to that. Now it's not a classic, but it's not so bad. <br /> <br /> ** MINOR SPOILERS !!! ** First of all, the story is old and has been (badly) updated. Really, a man who cheats on his wife hardly shocks today. Meg Ryan (a wonderful actress) is pretty terrible here. His face seems unable to change his expression! I could not believe how bad some of his scenes were. Eva Mendes is mean too - but it's not entirely her fault. Her role is poorly written and she has to compete with Joan Crawford of the original. The character Smith (a tough lesbian) collapses in an operating room. It's funny ... but it shows that a strong woman breaks up instantly in an emergency. The script also inserts awkward passages in which Ryan speaks to his daughter about his identity. In these moments, it looks more like a movie of life than anything else. <br /> <br /> Now, the good - this movie retains the original's decision to NEVER show a man on the screen. This film is about and for women - men are not necessary (BTW - I am a man). Bening is just awesome as a Fowler - every time she's on screen, the movie makes a big leap. Plus, Smith is just wonderful - she does not downplay (or downplay) her lesbian character. We have fun too but she is not in this situation. Bette Midler is simply hysterical in a small role and Cloris Leachman takes the role of housekeeper. Management is good too - especially during a fashion show sequence. I heard that director Diane English would have had a hard time directing her first feature film, but that's not reflected in the final product. In addition, there are some clever references to the original (mostly some lines) that have been inserted without problems. <br /> <br /> I saw this in front of an audience full of women (there were some guys but not much) and they loved it The movie ends on an operating room sequence that made scream everyone. So - it was not necessary, but it is not the disaster that people say. Plus, people say we do not need a movie with all women. Well, why not? I see a lot of movies with all the guys in the cast and no one's complaining! Ignore complaints and bad reviews and see this. With a better performance of Ryan, I could have given him an 8 or a 9 but, in the current state, I can give him a 7.
