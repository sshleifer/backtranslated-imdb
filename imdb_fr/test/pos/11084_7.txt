I'm not a fan of Sean Penn, but unlike my German colleague whose review is here, I think he was perfectly chosen to embody the neurotic and degenerate character of this film. He perfected all the nuances and reminded me of several acquaintances who had similar tastes in "leisure chemistry". I saw this film, but once, 10 to 15 years ago and it's the only part of the film that has been engraved forever in my memory. I do not say it very often, but in this case I will: Bravo, Sean Penn! As for the scenario, it is based on facts. It is tragic, then, that people sell the secrets of their country to their enemy at the time. Once again, Penn showed what you can do if you disagree with the administration. Use the freedoms you have, paid for in blood; do not break the law.
