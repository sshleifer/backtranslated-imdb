This less known movie with Roy Thinnes (of Invaders) is actually what I consider a lost jewel. This was done at a time when history was more important than special effects (although the effect was good enough for its time). One scientist believes that there is another world in Earth's orbit directly behind the sun. Since the sun always blocks it, we can never see it from the Earth. Roy Thinnes is chosen to go on a mission to this world. I do not want to tell the rest of the plot because it will give the rest of the movie. Let's just say that there are real surprises. <br /> <br /> The film is British and has that good British touch of acting that was part of a television series like The Avengers.
