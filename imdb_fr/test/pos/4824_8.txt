I saw part of this movie on the Sci-Fi channel, but I missed the end. I bought the DVD to see the whole movie, and I'm happy to have seen it. <br /> <br /> A young mother and her two daughters settle in a house in a lost corner of their husband, who died of an illness. It's very run down, but the three women get the most out of it. The teenage girl (Scout Taylor-Compton) is warned by a boy from the zombie region who goes out at night. She ignores him, but since he has a cute friend, she joins his group. Meanwhile, the youngest daughter (Chloe Grace Moretz) makes a friend in a zombie girl of her age named Mary. It turns out that Mary and several other children died in a mine in 1913 while working as children. Now that they are zombies, they attack and kill anyone who is not a relative by blood. <br /> <br /> This film was directed by J.S. Cardone, whose previous films include The Slayer (1981) and Shadowzone (1990), two films I did not like in the least. That's why I was surprised to have really enjoyed this movie. The film is deliberately rhythmic, which I liked. This allows you to know the main characters, most of whom are friendly. The zombie kids have been used at least since George Romero's classic night, Night Of The Living Dead. Nevertheless, I found interesting zombies using tools in this movie. It seems that Cardone has finally found the right script and the right cast. Only the stereotypical scenes of teenagers smoking, drinking and getting by in a parked car bored me. <br /> <br /> Taylor-Compton also appears in the Halloween remake. Moretz appeared in The Amityville Horror (2005) and the horror movie Room 6 (2006).
