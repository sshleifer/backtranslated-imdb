THE ADVENTURE OF CHIPMUNK <br /> <br /> There are some movies that I could watch all my life and I do not get tired of, and this nostalgic favorite is one of them. THE CHIPMUNK ADVENTURE was an attempt in 1987 to bring old favorites to the forefront of animation, this time on the big screen. At a time when Disney dominated the film industry in terms of animation and ticketing, THE CHIPMUNK ADVENTURE is one of the best animated films that Disney did not produce in the 1980s. > The story is simple and basic, Alvin, Simon and Theodore compete in a race around the world with the Chipettes (Janette, Eleanor and Brittany). However, as chipmunks face exotic dangers, they do not realize they are the pawns of a large diamond theft. <br /> <br /> THE ADVENTURE OF CHIPMUNK has never been and never will be a film that skyrockets thanks to a captivating scenario. And for people who did not like him in his childhood, the film will probably never be more than a movie of animation at the same time pleasant and forgettable. But for me, it will always be a little-known masterpiece. There is something in the movie that clicks for me like few movies do. <br /> <br /> Every song is fun, optimistic and safe. Among the highlights, the Chipettes play a slightly risky Arab dance to calm the snakes. There is also a very sweet song in which the Chipmunks sing about traveling the world and we have the chance to see them on major sites around the world. One thing about Chipmunk's characters is that, despite potentially boring vocals, songwriters have always been able to write catchy songs without ever being squeaky. This film is no exception ... if you ask me, it has one of the best animated soundtracks of the 80s. <br /> <br /> Every joke is cute, sincere and fun. The pieces between the bad guys and a pampered puppy are very funny. And the shock of seeing the Chipettes almost forced to marriage by an emperor child is also true. The comedy manages to play constantly with the children so that they miss nothing, but everything remains charming for the adults with enough nostalgia to entertain them. <br /> <br /> It's really a fun trip that is completely humble in its ambitions. The ADVENTURE of CHIPMUNK never aims to be more than it is, a harmless pleasure. I'll be the first to admit that this is a skewed criticism because I have such nostalgic penchant for THE CHIPMUNK ADVENTURE that I could never give her a bad review ... but nonetheless, she fills me with such childish happiness. by looking at him. Everyone has his favorite random since childhood that no one knows, and for me it's this movie. And any movie that I can watch over and over, whether I'm 5, 12, 23 or older, is a big film for me. <br /> <br /> ... A- ...
