I think it's the kind of movie you like or hate and I'm not really into making artistic movies. My mother rented "mullhuland DR" the other night and I almost ran away, ah. But I love this movie. <br /> <br /> We recorded "The Beat" one night when we had just left the band and we got a big movie that way by accident. Recorded this tape and watched a lot. I finally had the VHS to add to my collection. I watched it several times and at one point copied the poems. I even tried to preform a scene for my high school theater class. She said we could do all the scenes we wanted and delete the vicious words. She refused to let me do it. If it could upset my drama teacher, he must be good :) Honest, she never treated me the same way. <br /> <br /> I liked the acting, it turned out to be very true and honest. It was not clean and polite, but it was better than that. It was true, how everyone really behaved and displayed emotions, not like Hollywood. It was great to play especially for the one playing Rex. <br /> <br /> The story was original. Not only are the characters drawn to his world, but so are you. It's not your typical person who meets and rescues children from disadvantaged neighborhoods through a film of knowledge. Simple attention and friendship make things a little better. <br /> <br /> The only thing to do is that even in the 80s, there was more gun violence and less simple stuff like rock throwing, but that little something innocent did not film. <br /> <br /> I think it's a must. you'll love it or hate it, but in either case it does have an impact and it's a good movie you'll remember and talk about later.
