This is not a "real" James Cagney vehicle, as his on-screen time is exceptionally slim. Frankie Darro plays the hard kid Jimmy Smith, the leader of a gang of street thugs sent to a reform school with some of his rogue friends. Cagney plays Patsy Gargan, a gang leader himself, who occupies a symbolic position as deputy commissioner. When he discovers the brutal treatment of the reform school, he is forced to make major changes with the help of the nurse in charge of the reform (Madge Evans). <br /> <br /> THE MAYOR OF HELL evolves quickly and is always entertaining after all these years. The distribution is complete: Dudley Digges, Arthur Bryon, Farina Hoskins, G. Pat Collins and Allen Jenkins.
