I like this film because it has a good approach to Buddhism, for example, the way Buddhists are concerned with all kinds of living things, combining fantasy and real situations; in some places, the photography is very good and a lot of messages about freedom, like the hawk episode, always staying focused at all times, even in difficult situations. , his acting shows us how people who lived in this kind of culture try to resist when Miyagi takes him to a Buddhist temple and slowly changes his mind. And of course, Pat Morita has always been awesome
