Leaving aside the disadvantages and weaknesses of the film evoked by other viewers, I must say that it seemed to me a film about power, which in my opinion is one of the most seductive illusions. I saw the drama of an emperor and people. It seems to me that the director wanted to ask the question of what is the advantage of the nation and what is the price of "happiness" for all. Is there a justification for the benefit imposed and the "happiness"? How much can be lost for the security of the nation and the peaceful existence? Does the idea of ​​a powerful potential empire deserve to be reduced to misery and kill thousands of its citizens now? It seems to me that the emperor himself does not know the answer and tries to learn it all the time of the film. He is desperately torn between these desires and at the same time psychologically harassed by the discovery of his true origin. He seems to hate his subjects half to have to give up his father and his love, to love half people as a good emperor should. No wonder his actions are controversial and his emotions are confused. It seems to me that as a film presenting the problem of the power of man over other men, the film is a success.
