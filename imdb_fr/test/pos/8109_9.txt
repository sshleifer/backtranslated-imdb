..this film was made when Hitler (and Mussolini who is also in the film) was at the top and many politicians and even the Roman Church closed their eyes to the brutality and evil of Nazism. Especially in the United States, many people did not understand what was really happening in Germany and Europe (Charles Lindenbergh, for example). It would be like today that a great actor would make a parody of Berlusconi or Chirac. Chaplin may have made many mistakes in his life, but it is truly a masterpiece of humanity and, in my humble opinion, a great demonstration that he was a brave man. The film is funny and profound, the final speech has a terrible force and is always updated. I think this film is one of the best ever made.
