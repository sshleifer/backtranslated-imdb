Uncle Frank is the uncle of everyone. This documentary covered all aspects of aging in America, loneliness, humor, irony. Uncle Frank and Aunt Tillie were extremely generous in sharing their life experiences with the public. The director did an incredible job capturing the small and large pieces that made up their lives. Thank you to everyone who contributed to the making of this film!
