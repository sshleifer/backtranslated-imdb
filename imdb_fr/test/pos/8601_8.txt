Until the final credits, this film was shot in 1989, because all elements of its production were designed to look like the 1960s - the acting, characters, sets and props all had an aesthetic of yesteryear . <Br/> <br /> The film opens with the moments before the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima and the consequences of this tragic incident for a family: a young woman, Yasuko, who lives with her aunt and his uncle. Even in black and white, and using rather primitive special effects compared to modern standards, but nevertheless emotional and effective, the representations of the immediate aftermath of the bomb are quite horrible. Family members become unrecognizable from each other, others look like zombies as they roam the streets in shock and shock. <br /> <br /> The title refers to the precipitation that fell shortly after the bomb, mixed with radioactive ash, and which Yasuko is caught. Rumors that Yasuko would be in Hiroshima at the time of the attacks would have an impact on her marriage prospects and it was later learned that black rain was indeed responsible for diseases. The film is not only about the physical effects of the bomb on the Japanese, but also the social and psychological damage it caused. <br /> <br /> I found the film compassionate and a fascinating journey into a unique culture. While the film is primarily concerned with the pain felt by a family, the movie's soft political message is relevant today and probably forever - wars have horrendous consequences and should only be committed when absolutely necessary . It is said that history is repeating itself and that the current leaders of the "Coalition of Volunteers" have learned nothing. Although the atomic war has not resurfaced since 1945, other deadly effects have also occurred. This film is convincing.
