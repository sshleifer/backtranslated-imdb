Obviously, Ponyo can not be considered a stupid animated film that a studio could produce to survive. It's far from it, and it can easily be described as a captivating and beautiful cinematic experience. <br /> <br /> Miyazaki has indeed another masterpiece. But for many, this was said to be the least of his accomplishments in film making, partly because of his "stranger factor" that was not there. It is true. Morals and ideas that are not so obvious in his previous films are very present in this image. Ponyo is not too difficult to understand or understand. I think his idea was to make a children's movie as well suited to adults as their children, and that it's not too complicated. He accomplished that perfectly and did not lose substance along the way, which is why he gets a 10. <br /> <br /> In addition, the film itself is so captivating from the start The way she is presented is so beautiful, she sometimes marveled at me because I remembered how they were all drawn by hand by Miyazaki himself. I have not been so enlightened and happy after watching a movie since I saw Some time ago (another movie not to be missed). Everything about Ponyo was absolutely beautiful and breathtaking; even the music was pure perfection. The only bad thing I have to say about it is its dubbing in English. Do not get me wrong, they were good too, but I had seen Ponyo about two weeks before his national release, and I thought that in some areas I would have liked him to keep some of his Japanese dialogue (not all she also appreciated the "English way"). Overall, everyone should see Ponyo; it's absolutely flawless and in another league of film making. Finally, and do not stop at that, but I would not be surprised if Ponyo gets a nomination for the best film, because there are now 10 films that can be nominated for that. It's just that good.
