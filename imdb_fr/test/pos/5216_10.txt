I thought it was an excellent movie. Gary Cole played the role of a soldier who feels trapped and dissatisfied with his wife who fabulously simulates his death! Overall, I found the movie awesome, it's certainly not a boring plot! It's sad to say, but I think a lot of men could have that feeling. I think he should have just divorced and asked to be transferred to the place of the extreme where he had gone, but he felt there was no other way out, so he simulated his death. I thought it was great that Cole's real wife was playing the woman with whom he was unhappy in the movie. I think what the guy did was a bit extreme, but the movie was still awesome! The recommend really!
