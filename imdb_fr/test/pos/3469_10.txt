Until I saw this movie, "life is beautiful" was my favorite movie of all time. This film is all that a good movie should be. A superb scenario, an unparalleled acting and direction that does not address the sentimentality that the subject tries to leave or leave without the emotional impact it requires. This film contains the taste that could not come from Hollywood and lacks the pretension that would come from France. A wonderful film, even above the caliber I expected when I saw the logo of handmade movies. I do not need to go into detail, because the previous articles cover everything that makes this film to be seen by everyone on this planet.
