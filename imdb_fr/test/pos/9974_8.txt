"The Merchant of Venice" is one of Shakespeare's best-known plays and is still played regularly at the theater. Incredibly, however, this film seems to be the very first English version designed for the cinema rather than for television. A number of versions were made in Britain or America at the beginning of the cinema, but they were all silent. <br /> <br /> The reason for this neglect of the piece can be related to sensitivities related to the alleged piece. anti-Semitism, a subject that has become even more sensitive since the Nazis came to power in 1933. (This may explain why all previous versions were made in the silent era, in 1908 or 1922 it would have been easier to describe Shylock as a simple villain than it would be today). Yet, in my opinion, the film is not anti-Semitic at all. It must be remembered that, during Shakespeare's lifetime, there was no established Jewish community in England; Edward I had expelled the Jews at the end of the 13th century and they were allowed to return only at Cromwell's time, about forty years after Shakespeare's death. As far as we know, Shakespeare has never traveled abroad, so it seems quite possible that he himself never knew a Jew personally or experienced the effects of anti-Semitism. The play does not simply deal with the Jewish question, it analyzes, among other things, the corrosive effects of religious prejudices. In fact, it may be a coded examination of mutual antipathy between Catholics and Protestants in Tudor England (something Shakespeare would certainly have had first-hand experience) and a call for greater tolerance between them. <br /> <br /> Then as now, traditional anti-Semitic stereotypes have always portrayed Jews as misers, but Shylock's main sin is not greed; if it were so, he would certainly have accepted Bassanio's offer to pay him six thousand ducats, which is double the amount borrowed by Antonio. On the contrary, Shylock's sin is anger, and the root of his anger is the way he and his fellow citizens are treated by the Christians of Venice. Not only are Jews generally considered as second-class citizens, but Jewish lenders such as Shylock are particularly vulnerable to abuse, even though the services they provide are necessary for the Venetian economy. The play shows the effects of corruption of prejudices. Not only do such views corrupt Christians who hold them, but they can also corrupt Jewish victims of abuse. The vindictive character of Shylock is out of proportion to the wrongs he suffered. By spitting on him and calling him a dog, Antonio behaves like a fanatic, but fanaticism and fanaticism are not generally considered to be crimes worthy of the death penalty. In addition, Shylock seeks revenge on Antonio not only for the undeniable wrongs of Antonio against him, but also for all the wrongs, real and imaginary, that he has endured at the hands of the Christian community, such as marriage of his daughter. to Lorenzo. <br /> <br /> It's the merit of the director, Michael Radford, and his star, Al Pacino, to have understood all these problems. Pacino's Shylock initially has a kind of angry anger that is gradually giving way to vindictive rage and finally, after his humiliation in court by Portia's reasoning, to pathos. We clearly see that he was the instrument of his own destruction, but we can always sympathize with him. In my opinion, none of Pacino's performances I've ever seen matched the one he gave in the first two "Godfather" movies (not "Scent of a Woman", for which he won an Oscar , and certainly not "Godfather III"), but 'The Venice merchant is the one who comes closest to these criteria. The brilliant Portia by Lynn Collins is the other theatrical performance that expresses her lines with great clarity and simplicity, while highlighting the intelligence and resourcefulness that make her character more than a romantic heroine. I was less impressed by Antonio de Jeremy Irons, who seemed too passive. Antonio is a complex character. at once a loyal friend, a melancholy contemplative, a bigoted religious and an enterprising capitalist. Although Irons grasped the first two of these aspects, it was difficult to imagine his Antonio spitting on someone of a different faith or engaging in risky business ventures. <br /> <br /> Radford's interpretation of the play was attacked by the "Daily Telegraph" film critic who, while admiring Pacino's performance, hated the period's scenery and maintained that Shakespeare had to to be placed in a contemporary setting if it is to have a "relevance" for a modern audience, citing a recent theatrical production that put the action on stage in Weimar, Germany. I strongly disagree with this approach. Theater and film are quite different media, and while there have been some striking modernist approaches to Shakespeare in cinema (Trevor Nunn's "Twelfth Night"), a traditionalist approach is often the best. (I preferred, for example, Zeffirelli's "Romeo and Juliet" to Baz Luhrmann's). The idea that we can only appreciate Shakespeare in a modern appearance is pure intellectual laziness; we are not prepared to make the effort to see our greatest writer in the context of the Elizabethan society that produced it, but rather to prefer him dressed as an ersatz man of the twentieth century. <br /> <br /> Radford's traditional approach not only allows us to understand that bigotry and revenge are age-old and universal problems, but is also a striking film. In the play, the scenes taking place in Venice itself are characterized by a turbulent action; those settled in the country house of Belmont in Portia are happier and more peaceful. In the film, Venetian outdoor scenes were shot against a background of gray and misty skies, similar to the look in "Do not Look Now". The interiors lit by candles, with their faces brilliantly lighted against a dark background, recall the effects in chiaroscuro of a painting by Caravaggio; I suspect it was very deliberate because Caravaggio was a contemporary of Shakespeare. Unlike dark or foggy Venice, the scenes of Belmont (shot in an enchanting Palladian villa on an island by a lake) were characterized by the sun or a peaceful moonlight. <br /> <br /> This is one of the best adaptations of Shakespeare in recent years; a smart and attractive look at a complex game. 8/10. <br /> <br /> Some errors. We see a black swan on the water in front of Portia's house. These birds are native to Australia and were introduced to Europe only after 1596, when the film was shot. In addition, Portia's portrait in the lead coffin is painted in the manner of the Florentine Botticelli, active about a century before that date. Lynn Collins perhaps evokes a beauty of Botticelli, but it seems unlikely that a Venetian lady of the late sixteenth century was painted in the manner of Florence at the end of the fifteenth century.
