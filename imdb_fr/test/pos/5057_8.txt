This film was an amazing homage to anyone who has experienced this kind of pain and suffering. The acting was not the best, I admit, but he was passionate about his message: sending people to jails without even a lawyer or some sort of lawsuit is cruel and unusual. They even had a damning trial for Saddam, so why do not all suspected terrorists have a fair trial and hearing on why they were labeled? I'm coming out of the movie, but I think it's worthy of note about this clumsy and twisted government idea. The way the film tells the story and the story is a big mystery. All the movie, I was trying to connect the girl to the plot and it's very obvious in the end. There is no doubt that the staging was incredible, but the only thing that mattered to me was not to put as much emphasis on the character of Reese Witherspoon and to fight for the ideal she held, a lot of jumps. Otherwise, it was rather amusing and most importantly, it caught my attention and my interest during the two hours that it passed.
