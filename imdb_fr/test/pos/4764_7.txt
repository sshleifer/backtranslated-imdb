I'm not very good at "cop" movies, but this one is supposed to be a classic. When I found it cheap, I bought it and stuck it on a shelf, so I could watch it yesterday and I loved it! Now you can have New York, but as a backdrop for a film like this, in winter, it's perfect. Roy Scheider is a member of the elite police task force called The Seven Ups, made up of 5 people fighting undercover crime. In an opening scene, they retrieve a shoebox filled with money from an antique store, distracting the scammers with the routine of "bull in a porcelain store". But this is only the beginning. It looks like there are two guys, pretending to be cops, kidnapping some mafia guys and holding them for ransom. Richard Lynch is one of those handbags, and he is still terrifying. When one of the Seven Ups, pretending to be a limousine driver at a funeral, gets scrambled, he is beaten and stuck in the trunk of a car, which may lead to one the most exciting lawsuits I've ever seen. . It's amazing how light the traffic in New York is for the pursuit scenes, but it's still pretty amazing, because Scheider follows the two kidnappers through what I suppose, the Bronx, and then on a turn, then finally, Scheider's car stops abruptly. in one of the most overpowering finals at a hunting scene I've ever seen. Be that as it may, since the policeman eventually dies, Scheider and his men are suspected because the police commissioner is so unaware of their activities that he wonders if they are about to kidnap evildoers , so of course, this kind of thinking must be smothered. in the bud & Scheider is relentless to get to the bottom of things. Overall, a decent policeman action / drama is not really my thing, but I liked this one. Look for Joe Spinell (Maniac) in a small role. 7 out of 10
