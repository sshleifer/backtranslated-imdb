I suspect there are several cuts of this doc that go around. The copy I saw was mainly about Joe's erotic films and referred to his horror production by the way. Many X-rated movies are presented in their glory. The legendary images of "snuff" from EMMANUELLE IN AMERICA (cut breasts) enjoy a generous projection time. <br /> <br /> The interviews of the very friendly Joe is informative and candid. He is a modest, articulate man and speaks of his interest in shocking audiences, of why he wanted to mix eroticism and horror, and why he may be responsible for the fact that one of his performers have become gay. <br /> Her friendship and The working relationship with Indonesian beauty, Laura Gemser, is evoked, as is her indifferent attitude toward hardcore filming. <br /> <br /> Joe D'Amato embodies an incredible period of past continental cinema. It's great to see a documentary dedicated to him and for his remarkable and unique work. <br /> <br /> RIP, Joe.
