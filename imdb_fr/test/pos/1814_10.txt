We still really like the movie and the soundtrack of "Valley Girl". I owned it on video for an eternity and I exhausted the soundtrack. I have several friends with whom I meet and we have "80's Raves" - parties where we meet to play 80s music and broadcast "Valley Girl" on the big screen - and we are all in our thirties now . We have an IMPOSING time. <br /> <br /> Everything is having fun, you know?
