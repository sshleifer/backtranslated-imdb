First of all, I vaguely remember having heard this story in elementary school about six or seven years ago. So I know this story well. <br /> <br /> Many things have changed however, and there are many differences and errors (sometimes unnecessary) in the movie that fans will not understand. <br /> <br /> However, overall, I really like this movie. I saw it for the first time near Christmas about 2 years ago (ie the first part), then I resumed everything last Christmas probably on the same channel. <br /> <br /> I was very impressed, sometimes it can be a little exhausted and long, but with an engaging story, a decent acting (especially Frosty Fonda and Hobbs) and beautiful landscapes , costumes and little touches of magic make this movie a really special movie - that really reminds me of Christmas. <br /> <br /> Despite the differences from the book, I think the film does well to incorporate new themes and ideas (the seasons with autumn, winter, etc. with a new character from thief to represent the fall) all the while surprising and brilliantly executed. <br /> <br /> I live in the UK, so I was looking forward to the DVD. Fortunately, I saw an advertisement showing a series of free DVDs offered in the Daily Mail newspaper. Normally not, so I had the problem yesterday and finally my DVD. If you missed it and want this rare DVD for Region 2, I suggest you collect the chips in the Daily Mail and send them as your DVD will be delivered before Christmas. <br /> <br /> For a little escape this Christmas season, put on your fire, sit back and watch it, because you and your kids will probably enjoy this fantastic movie. If you do not have it, it will probably be rebroadcast on Channel 4 this Christmas, so save it!
