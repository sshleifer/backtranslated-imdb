An extremely sweet tale of Shakespeare's play (and much more obvious about it than Forbidden Planet). Cassavetes is always a pleasure to watch, and even more so with Gena Rowlands who shares the spotlight. His interpretation of Prospero's role is well suited to the kind of rudimentary omniscient expression he brings to history. This is particularly prominent in a scene where, after spotting his separated wife and lover in a motor boat, he creates a storm (accompanied on the soundtrack of an appropriate selection from the film "Go" by Stomu Yamashta) . This is just one of the moments in the film where the line between reality and fantasy fades and the viewer feels that magic is more possible than one might think. Add to that an excellent performance of Raul Julia, as well as a good work by Susan Sarandon, Vittorio Gassman and Molly Ringwald, and the film becomes a nice treat to fill the space behind your eyes.
