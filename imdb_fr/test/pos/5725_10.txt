As a result of my personal research on the "final cycle" of 2012 presented by the Mayan calendar system, I think this film should be seen just as much as "What does the sound know?" Some may think that high-level scientific issues should only be communicated at the doctoral level, "talk", "The elegant world" breaks down these barriers. The visuals and the selection dialog facilitate the understanding of this walk in the history of physics. There are many messages in this film, the least of which is that academic science must always be ready to review what is taught. Certainly, the science of pure discovery is beautiful because there is always something more exciting to put forward if we have the courage to look for it in the face of "established" science.
