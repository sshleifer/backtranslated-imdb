Post-war England, the dawn of the "atomic era". However, the anxiety of a young schoolboy eager to live his first "kiss" can not be bothered by something as unimportant as THE BOMB. It was a delightful, if not educational, look at young love from a teenager's point of view and his 1940s world. Free from political correctness and preaching messages, this film exposes the viewer to the world that only the mind (and hormones) of a young teenager can create. Wonderful subplots keep the character's interest, such as "Gregory's Daughter," and many well-stuck shots help keep the images from that era. This is a very good story for anyone, young or old, who has already <br /> been in love or who has always wanted to be. Has he ever had his wish? Look and see.
