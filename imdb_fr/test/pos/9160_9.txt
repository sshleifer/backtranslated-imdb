American war movie buffs may be bored with this skull, but this boredom is born of ignorance. Guerrilla suppression operations are always like that. Sit down and wait, find prostitutes, get drunk at the base, ride and deal with the businessman, kick a prisoner, conceal the murder of the street vendor by the Green Soldier. Then, boom, there are two trucks of fuel and for 10 minutes, a battle of small arms with a machine gun of big caliber. Then wait for the soldiers to prepare a way to knock down their fortress, and eventually kill some civilians doing it. If reality does not work for Western viewers, there is always Top Gun or Rambo (Realistic Top Gun? Nope) <br /> <br /> The best part of Afganskiy Izlom Realism is the way all planes drop like confetti. They had to do it because Carter and Reagan gave the Mujahideen so many missiles. In addition, the Mi-24 wave was excellent, a better helicopter attack than Apocalypse now. The sight of their falling and shooting missiles was a scene of imminent "death from above" for whoever they were aiming for. <br /> <br /> It's funny to see how the Soviets managed to make an honest movie about Afghanistan a year after they left, but it took six years in the United States. Afganskiy Izlom is just as real if you apply it also to the occupation of NATO. Someone will always take the gun and shoot you because he cares more about the earth. It's a film that Westerners should watch. Unfortunately, I do not think anyone has ever done subtitles in English; I could have to do it.
