It's such a beautiful movie! Not only does it depict war, it also has friendship and love. Slama's life is filled with sadness, every aspect of his life has collapsed. I can only imagine how he would feel when his friend made the ultimate sacrifice. <br /> <br /> I see a slight similarity to "Pearl Harbor", which also refers to two pilots falling in love with the same woman. However, this film is much better because it does not portray the woman as unfaithful and easy going. The friendship between the two men is also much more convincing and well constructed. I really recommend this movie to everyone.
