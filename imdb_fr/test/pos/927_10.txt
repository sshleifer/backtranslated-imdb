The trilogies are very interesting. Some come out at once (Lord of the Rings), others weaken gradually (The Matrix), others get lost in the darkness (Blade, Back to the Future), but some keep the genie, this light seemingly growing that floats beyond the surface of its impeccable exterior. Case and point: "Trilogy Three Colors". The last chapter of the trilogy is the most philosophical and the most stimulating. In "Blue" we had a more amazing and more character-centric plot. In "White", it was more of a light and narrative story, in which we listened more than anything the characters say. "Red", however, is centered on the "what if" and "how are you doing". It questions our own destiny and focuses primarily on the past and the future rather than the present. <br /> <br /> This chapter is about a young model who crushes a dog and brings it back to its owner. She quickly discovers that the dog's owner is actually a cynical retired judge who spies on his neighbors' phone calls with advanced spy equipment. The three films in the trilogies have basic intrigues, but bring much more to the story. Think of "Blue", the story of a woman facing the loss of her loved ones. We are constantly shown ideas about contemporary French society and how it reflects the behavior of the character. "Red" does not only concern a young woman who finds refuge in the life of an old man, it is also about chance, hope and destiny. <br /> <br /> Irene Jacob interprets the character of Valentine Dussaut, who discovers in the beginning the old man (Jean-Louis Trintignant), whose name we never find, extremely egocentric and disgusting. Although thanks to a reflexive analysis and her voyeuristic intentions, she learns that the judge would be the perfect man for her, if only he was 40 years younger. Irene lives in front of another younger judge, who looks a lot like the old man. This is the "What if" that continues to turn in the film. What if Irene was born 40 years ago? The old man would have been his perfect match. But what if the young judge is actually his ideal partner, since he looks so close to the older man. Valentine does not know it, but Krzysztof Kieslowski suggests it subtly in almost every frame Irene is in. We are constantly struck in the face by his presence, as a suggestion of the fate of Irene. <br /> I mention that the old man has no name for a reason. This reason is because it is very symbolic for the general theme of history. We must compare the former judge to Auguste (Jean-Pierre Lorit), the young judge, in more ways than one. We learn that the old man once had someone he loved but she escaped. In another scene, we see Auguste heartbroken, the love of his life taking flight with another man. There are constant reminders to know if Valentine will ever meet this man. Even if they cross each other without realizing each day. There is also the motive of the phone, for Valentine it's a way to stay sane and to update his life, for Augustus that's what leads to his sorrow, and the old man, it's the only thing he has left. These three elements serve to darken the psychology of the characters. It's a kind of statement about who they are and who they are. <br /> <br /> The three films "Colors" defend a certain principle, the most common in France. "Blue" means Liberty (to be personal), "White" means Equality (to be accepted by more than one) and "Red" is Fraternity (socialize, learn). And although this last chapter is clearly centered on the principle of brotherhood, Kieslowski makes sure that he also integrates the other two, in order to connect the three stories. For example, we see the old man trying to reach out to Valentine and enlighten him with his espionage equipment, which reflects the principle of equality. We also see towards the end that Valentine is thinking about herself and is more self-conscious than others (do not pick up the phone when Michel calls), a clear example of Liberty. And once the three principles are established, Kieslowski connects all the characters in the most sincere final scene. <br /> <br /> "Red" indicates where you could have been if you were older or younger. It's about whether someone is perfectly perfect for everyone and if only one person can change your life. The last chapter of the most impressive trilogy of all time, this film breaks the barriers of realization and narration. It's not just about our modern life, but where life could and should be in our time. And although the film is more subtle than "Blue" and "White," he boldly exclaims from a declaration of love and compassion. <br /> <br /> It's hard to imagine that "Red" was Kieslowski's latest film, and that he died at such a young age. Nevertheless, the trilogy will always remain his masterpiece and we will always remember him for his work, which ranks first among the ranks of Bergman, Fellini and Wenders as a remarkable director who has never been rewarded by a Oscar. Kieslowski, we missed you!
