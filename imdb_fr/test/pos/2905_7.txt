"The Egyptian" is placed under the reign of one of the most fascinating figures of the ancient world, the Pharaoh Akhnaton, who, thirteen centuries before Christ, attempted to introduce a monotheistic religion, Atenism, in Egypt Ancient. The main character, however, is not Akhnaton, but rather the fictional Sinuhe. Sinuhe is mysteriously floating in a basket on the Nile and was adopted by the doctor, Senmut, and his wife. When he becomes an adult, he follows his adoptive father into the medical profession, working first (like his father) among the poor of the city, but he gets noticed after he and his friend, the ambitious young soldier Horemheb, The life of Pharaoh during a hunting expedition in the desert. Sinuhe is appointed doctor of the court, but becomes obsessed with the Babylonian courtesan Nefer. Sinuhe ruins himself not only in a vain attempt to win his love, but is also dishonored when his failure to do his homework means that he is unable to save the life of Akhnaton's daughter. <br /> <br /> Sinuhe fled into exile, where he succeeded as a healer in neighboring countries, but returned to Egypt when he learned that a Hittite plot was about to invade. Although Akhnaton readily forgives her previous faults, Sinuhe discovers that the country is in turmoil. Pharaoh's attempts to introduce a new religion led to civil strife between his followers and those of the priests of the ancient polytheistic religion. He is by nature too peaceful to take steps to deal with the Hittite threat. Sinuhe is implicated in a plot by Horemheb, now a general of the Egyptian army, and Princess Baketamon, sister of Akhnaton, to overthrow Pharaoh and replace him with a more effective monarch. <br /> <br /> The weaknesses of the film stem mainly from two romantic secondary intrigues. During the film, Sinuhe is revealed as the lost son of the previous pharaoh and half-brother of Akhnaton and Baketamon. He might surprise a modern audience that she falls in love with him; sibling marriage was not necessarily considered incestuous by the standards of Egyptian kingship, but the public standards of 1950s movie theaters were generally less liberal on this point. In any case, the love triangle Horemheb-Baketamon-Sinuhe is a useless complication and damages the role of Baketamon in the film, that of the voice of Realpolitik, cynical with cold eyes. <br /> <br /> The sub-plot Nefer, which occupies most of the first hour of the film, is crushed and excessively melodramatic. Nefer is morally devoid of value, but fascinating and the role required an actress of great beauty and great dramatic skill to make her credible, especially as Nefer fulfills the difficult task of moving Sinuhe away. of a woman as beautiful as Jean Simmons (who plays Rival of Sinuhe for his affections). It is therefore unfortunate that the role was attributed to an actress as ridiculously inept as Bella Darvi, whose only qualification was to be the owner's mistress, Darryl F. Zanuck. Darvi was not only a wooden actress, she also spoke with a strong foreign accent, made even more incomprehensible by a slip. She was not even particularly appealing compared to two legendary movie beauties, Simmons and Gene Tierney, who plays Baketamon. <br /> <br /> The film is better if it focuses on its main political and religious themes. The other actors are better than Darvi, although Peter Ustinov, as a servant of Sinuhe, Kaptah, makes the same mistake as in "Spartacus", that of trying to give a comic relief to a film that does not need. In any case, his voice was too patrician for a role of "comic servant". <br /> <br /> Edmund Purdom, a little-known British actor, was pushed into the leading role when Marlon Brando retired at the last minute. , but more than adequately fills the shoes of the great man, even if his style of play was very different. He takes up the challenge of showing the changes in the character of Sinuhe, ranging from an uneducated idealist to a crazy idiot to an embittered cynic for the enlightened visionary of the final scenes. Victor Mature has never been the most expressive actor, but he is perfectly suited to the role of Horemheb, a concrete and realistic man of action. He is better here than in his other epic of 1954, "Demetrius and the Gladiators". Simmons is beautiful as beautiful as the merit. <br /> <br /> Michael Wilding (who until now has been known as the second Mr. Elizabeth Taylor) interprets Akhnaton as a true philosopher king who ends up as a kind of sacred idiot. His inability to make difficult decisions makes him an inappropriate leader, but he has a prophetic vision of peace and justice that gives him an air of moral grandeur far beyond those who hope to replace him on the throne. Although Aton has more in common with the Supreme Being of the Deists than with the Old Testament Jehovah or the Trinitarian Christian God, there is a very deliberate attempt to draw parallels between Atenism and the Christianity. In the film, the athenistic symbol is "ankh", probably chosen because of its resemblance to a cross, but it was actually a common Egyptian hieroglyph for life, which is not peculiar to the at√©nisme. The language of Akhnaton often has a Biblical sound; his comparison of himself with "whistling wind in the desert" recalls "the voice that cries in the desert" of John the Baptist (hence the title of this review). The discovery of Sinuhe in the river is parallel to the story of Moses in the Old Testament. <br /> <br /> At the end of the film, Sinuhe, who became the heiress of the spirit of Akhnaton's death, reaches a moral grandeur of its own. The message of the film is that even if we need concrete men of action like Horemheb, we also need visionaries and thinkers ready to ask the question "why?" Despite all its faults, "The Egyptian" is an idealistic and human film in its approach to religion and politics. 7/10
