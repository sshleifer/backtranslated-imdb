This is how I interpreted the movie: First things first. There is not a single scene in the movie where you see the villain (Taylor) torturing or nailing Ben's hands to the wall. However, the same can not be said of girls. At the end too, you see Taylor disappear while walking. Looks like the message was "There was no Taylor". And the whole movie was a product of Ben's imagination. In addition, there was no scene during moments of torture where none of the girls confront or are in the same setting as Ben. It was Taylor all the time. But in reality, Taylor was Ben. If it were two different people, then why was there no scene showing them both in the same frame during this horrible time? But of course, before that, you see them both and THAT can only be Ben's imagination at work. Moreover, when Ben was released from prison, the text on the screen clearly indicated that Ben's story was unrealistic and that there was no place as he had explained it (read mine, the cars etc.) Even after Liz Hunter leaves Kristy and comes back to find Ben, she does not find him. Why??? Because Ben (Taylor) was looking for girls. Instead, Kristy has all the time in the world to check the webcam, photos, etc. from Taylor (Ben). <br /> <br /> One way or another, everything comes down to one fact: Kristy and Liz both knew that Taylor was Ben. So my conclusion is that Ben was schizophrenic and that the film in which we see him, as well as Taylor in a frame, was only the product of his imagination. Otherwise, if there had really been a Taylor, they should have found out, given all the detailed explanations of Ben.
