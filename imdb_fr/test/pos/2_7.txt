My criterion for measuring the ability to watch a movie is if I feel uncomfortable. If I start to change position and notice that my buttocks are painful, the film is too long. This film was not nearly boring. Predictable in some parts, certainly, but never boring. <br /> <br /> All other branches of the military have written love notes about them and have seen their recruitment levels increase, why not the Coast Guard? They are significantly underestimated until the day your boat sinks. <br /> <br /> The movie was very fun and fun. Kevin Costner is perfect as an aging macho who does not know when to stop. However, I was very impressed by the performance of Ashton Kutcher. I have never liked it, I have never watched any of his TV shows and I have always considered immature ... well, punk. In this film, he does a great job! He is well on his way to being a leader. I think the film that was presented to us had to be an approximate montage, because about two thirds of the film, the film became very grainy, the sound level dropped and the microphones were seen everywhere. Representatives of the film also attended the hearing looking for public reactions, especially parts of the film that we did not like. <br /> <br /> ***** POSSIBLE SPOILER: The reactions I gave relate to aa few lines at the beginning. Kevin Costner goes home to see his wife, Sela Ward, pack his things and move. He says, "Maybe I should be the one who moves." And she answers, "No, you do not know where there is anything in this house, I should be the only one to leave." That makes no sense: if she knows the layout well, Costner is right, it's him who should * leave *.
