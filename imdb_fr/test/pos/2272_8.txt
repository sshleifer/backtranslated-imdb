It is precious. Everything Is Illuminated is sweet and sublimely funny right from the first line of delightful dialogue. Oh, how I was waiting for it to happen to Austin. If Elijah Wood is still as charming as Jonathan Safran Foer (the author of the novel Everything Is Illuminated), it is Eugene Hutz (interpreter of the guide and Ukrainian translator of Jonathan, Alex) who really steals this film. Alex is a Ukrainian hip-hop-lovin dancer who, along with his grandfather, helps Jonathan find the woman who saved his grandfather's life during the Second World War. The Ukrainian countryside has never been so breathtaking. I think to put away everything and move to the former Soviet state. <br /> <br /> However, the tone of the film changes when Jonathan and Alex finally meet the woman they are looking for and Suddenly, this adorable comedy turns into a heartbreaking historical drama about a Jewish village that was wiped out during Nazi occupation. Everything is illuminated about the history, heritage and wisdom that can be gained by discovering the past. It's perfect.
