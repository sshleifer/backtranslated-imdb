Some people do not like Led Zeppelin, but fortunately, the number of people who do not do so is very unbalanced. I am the proud converter of 2 or 3 Led Zeppelin fans and the only reason I could do this is because of this DVD. <br /> <br /> For one, how can anyone listen to "Stairway to Heaven" or "Immigrant Song" without falling in love with Zeppelin do not exceed me, but play the guitar and dislike Page. .. It's like being a Christian and not loving Jesus. My friend was like "Led Zeppelin is bad!" and I thought, "Oh yes, look at that!" After about 2 minutes reading the selection of pages on "White Summer / Black Mountain Side", it was stuck on the screen and never said anything bad about Zeppelin since. <br /> <br /> In this case, you did not follow the procedure I call this DVD the Led Zeppelin Bible. Held high by followers and used as a converter for unwashed pagans. <br /> <br /> Of course, it lacks things like "Over the Hills and Far Away", a good version of "Immigrant Song" and myself I did not need version 2 of "Whole" Lotta Love ", but damn it, I'll take them. <br /> <br /> Because there is nothing but "The Song Remains the Same" to compare that also gave him a 10 and even if there was more to compare too I would have always given a 10.
