A hilarious comedy of best director, Oz Scott. The list of television icons from the eighties goes on and on. Milano (Who's The Boss), Yothers (Family Links), Stone (Mr. Belvedere), Robinson (Night Court), Jackee (227), D'abo (Wonder Years), Walston (Mr. Hand !!!) . It's one of the funniest movies of all time. Outline, meaningless secondary intrigue, cheesy, bad play. This is a group of high school students who need to pass the drivers edition. Night Court's Mac needs them to pass their final exam, otherwise they will be fired. Beautiful performance of Brian Bloom in the role of Riko Conner, a rather cool guy, but it is nothing compared to B.D. Kiki de Wong (pronounced kee-chee). A good movie for all ages, too bad it's good.
