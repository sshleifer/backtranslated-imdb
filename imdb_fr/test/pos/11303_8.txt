For once a Barbie movie is good. I'm 18 and I'm embarrassed to say that, but I'm addicted to these movies. I hated Barbie when I was younger but the movies I love. Shiver is so cute and I fell in love with him. He is so cute as the polar bear and totally in love with Aiden. Oh man, I'm in love with Shiver. I love Annika's determination not to give up hope and ultimately it works. I love this movie and I hope they will be good. Barbie & Swan Lake is another brilliant film. I would recommend this movie to kids of all ages (even boys) because the movie is so good and I'm hard to please. Barbie and the magic of Pegasus is an enchanting and exciting film.
