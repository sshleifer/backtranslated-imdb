Wildman's senior advisor, Tripper Harrison (Bill Murray in his first lead role) presided at the various crazy messy North Star summer camps. Tripper befriends Rudy, a sad and lonely and unsuited kid (a great Chris Makepeace performance). Director Ivan Reitman tells the amusing comic vignettes of the wall at a breakneck pace and keeps an attractive and good-natured tone throughout. This film cleverly recounts the summer essence of summer: making friends, making love, joking, competing in the sport with a rival camp, singing bonfires and, of course, in the must-see Urban legend about the psychopath killer fleeing the hook hand. The joyfully happy feeling of joy that this image generates is positively contagious. Plus, humor is always awkward and sometimes rude, but never too mean or mean. Better yet, there is a surplus of pure heart that goes well with this humor (the warm relationship between Tripper and Rudy in particular is truly touching). The actors play an obvious role: their glorious gonzo and their galvanizing presence make things change all the time (his crazy ads on the PA are absolutely derisory), not forgetting Harvey Atkin, the poor owner of the camp, Morty, Kate Lynch and the devious Tripper the old flame Roxanne, Russ Banham as the lovable Crockett, Kristine DeBell as the sweet and cunning AL, Sarah Torgov as the fierce Candace, Jack Blum as the klutzy nerd Spaz, Keith Knight as a big cock, Larry Finkelstein, Cindy Girl as like Wendy, and Matt Craven as hip material. Donald Wilder's cinematography gives the film an attractive sunny appearance and ingeniously uses wipes. The catchy and melodic score of Elmer Bernstein is also the case. A real riot.
