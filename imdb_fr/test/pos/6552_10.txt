Uzumaki enjoys a formidable reputation in the Lovecraftian circles and I now know why. <br /> <br /> Uzumaki is based on a manga title (which, incredibly, would be better than the movie) and follows the strange events that preceded the typhoon an isolated Japanese city. I will not tell you anything in this film because it is a must-see movie. I watched it for the first time last night and was blown away. It's one of my best movies of all time and Pans Labyrinth is the best fantasy film (literally and photographically) released in the last decade. <br /> <br /> This film is very lovecraftian in nature without formally having a direct link with the myth of Cthulhu. This was done in the same way that Lovecraft composed his stories; it releases power while an aura of "something is wrong here" intensifies during a dark phase for terror and, ultimately, for horror through subtle progressive changes in the soundtrack and cinematography. It is indeed a "strange tale" par excellence. <br /> <br /> Simply beautiful.
