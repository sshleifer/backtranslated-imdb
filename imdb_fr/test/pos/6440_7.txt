In 1850, in Yorkshire, a chimney sweeper was falsely accused of theft by his twisted master and fled. He falls into a treacherous local river and is transported to a submarine kingdom, where he makes many friends and saves the mythical Water Babies of a devil shark. <br /> <br /> According to a book by Charles Kingsley, this is a beautiful children's film, half real action and half animation, which represents both a dark and evocative representation of the Victorian era and a terribly enjoyable underwater adventure. These are really two films in one, which complement and combine to form a much richer whole. The animation of Tony Cuthbert, Jack Stokes and Miroslaw Kijowicz is beautiful, as are the photography of Ted Scaife and the music of Phil Coulter and Bill Martin. Pender has the quality of a rough diamond as a fish (literal) out of the water - I like the moment he is at the top of the house, sees all the chimneys and shouts "Blimey !!" above his voice. Mason and Cribbins are the dirtiest and meanest brutes you could ever hope to see in a costume drama (if you want to see real Victorian values, do not look at Sense And Sensibility, look at this), and Whitelaw, Pertwee (who only fifteen voices) and Percival are all excellent. That's how a good children's movie should be: a good old singalong pleasure, but also a little thoughtful, sad and scary. Cockallorum high !!
