I laughed a few times during this movie, but take a quick look at him and you would think it was something else. I love the rhythm and the way it burns you slowly at the sight of these paintings of incredible beauty. Andersson gives us something else here. Shows us something I have not seen since his last movie. His composition is exceptional and, thanks to his method of fixing the camera and staging, he opens the door to humanity and gives us a look that reflects our own life, our little life. It's a powerful thing. It is the simplicity with which events are unfolded that creates the opposite sense of complexity. Everything in front of the camera is anything but simple. Andersson is extremely attentive to the details. I think most scenes, if not all, are sets built from scratch, according to his designs. I can not recommend this movie too much. For me, it took me to a place and I came out of it after witnessing a frayed and beautiful world, hungry and pained, barren and beautiful. Both foreign and familiar. This film is brilliant and affirms life. I know because I came out smiling with a wonderful feeling. It took him seven years to do it. If he only realized this film, he would always be among the best.
