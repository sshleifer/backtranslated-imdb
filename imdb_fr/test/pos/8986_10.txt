I caught him a few times on television in the late 1970s. He only played late at night (after midnight). <br /> <br /> Peter Lorre plays a kind and happy man whose face is disfigured in a fire. Rejected by his girlfriend, he remains alone and filled with despair. He turns to crime and ends up having a lot of success. He makes a mask to hide his disfigured features and falls in love with a beautiful girl (Evelyn Keyes) ... who is blind! He tries to get straight to the point ... but he can not escape his life of crime or the hatred of his own bruised face. <br /> <br /> A film without a budget. Very short (runs only a little over an hour) but well done and superbly played by Lorre. This has a lot more depth than you would expect from a B quickie image. Ankers especially takes the thankless role of "girl" and makes her character fresh and attractive. This has unfortunately disappeared from television and has never been put on video or DVD (as far as I know). TCM showed it recently and it was great to see that the film still holds. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
