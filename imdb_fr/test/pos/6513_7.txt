"Miss Cast Away" is a funny trifle, which dispenses with the development of the plot or the character to collect as many gags as possible. Best appreciated with a wide audience who is open to such entertainment and maybe, drank a few drinks. Most jokes are based on current events. This film could become, in the years to come, a time capsule of the references of pop culture of the turn of the 21st century. <br /> <br /> Converting from 30i to 24p The footage creates a jerky appearance in some parts, including the first aerial shots. <br /> <br /> The appearance of Micheal Jackson is indeed a strange non-sequencer event. But, for my part, I find it encouraging that Mr. Jackson has shown an interest in one of his protégés, even after he (the director) has passed the cute-preteen-boy stage. <br /> <br /> Work effects is not as bad as a suggested exam. Most of the work was done by a crew consisting of a facilitator consisting of host William Sutton, whose name appears to have been omitted from IMDb credits. His work is an extraordinary achievement and really helps fill the gaps in this film. I hope he has finally been paid!
