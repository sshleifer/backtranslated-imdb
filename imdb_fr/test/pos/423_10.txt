I like "Hack". Think of the "Lone Ranger" as a taxi driver of the 2000s, a decent but flawed guy, doing his best in Philadelphia while trying to solve problems from a troubled past, and you have the synopsis. David Morse is almost perfect like Olshansky. He helps people, but instead of "Silver" in the Old West, he drives a taxi in the streets of Philadelphia without giving any money bullets. The support cast is first class and well above average. Sometimes, the spiritual dialogue reaches almost the level of the classic 70's series, "The Rockford Files". This show deserves a return, hopefully, in a better niche than Friday 21h (Eastern time).
