It's a nice movie. It's very realistic for the "wonderful world of music", I went there and did it. This shows a human element in every character and realism that no one is perfect. These amateur musicians were not so bad. Cleavon Little's character, Marshall Tucker, was very well played. Marshall was not a saint himself. Here, he was paid to do a job and he gave these guys a hard time about everything that was in the van during the climb. You do not bite the hands that feed you. I can not believe that a player with the jazz experience he has, says he does not know any of Dixieland's songs. He has a keen sense of predicting chord changes on tunes he does not know. Not common, but not unheard of either. He delivers a true and harsh message at the end of the film when he says to the clarinettist: "It's not a religion, devotion is not enough." At this level, he's right, although I think the clarinetist could have handled the work. He trained well and the vocal accompaniment music was not that hard to read. Very nice film.
