Everyone told me to see "Cactus Flower" and that's what I finally did. What a wonderful film - the perfect relay for a terrifying Sunday night / Monday. Matthau and Hawn were good, but Ingrid Bergman really did this movie - after all, it was really for her. The real big players can do it all and Miss Bergman proves it. She shows us - during a movie - a range that few people display during their career. The scene in the disco was as hysterical as it was touching. Even as the film drew to its obvious conclusion, I found myself cheering on Miss Dickinson as if she were the Boston Red Sox. Fortunately, she did a lot better (no pun intended). ;)
