Are we allowed to interfere in the daily lives of our fellows? Is it possible to interfere in their intimacy, to penetrate into the interiority of their thoughts violating the privacy of their own home without being blamed? The filmmaker raises doubts about these seemingly resolute, almost comprehensive questions about Judge Jean Luis' destabilizing decision to reconcile himself to his own isolation through fragments of lives diverted by him. <br /> <br /> "Three Colors: Red" is based on the concept of "UNIVERSAL COMMUNICATION DESIGNED AS THE HUMAN DESIRE OF A WINDOW OPEN TO THE WORLD". The phone can be considered as the main character of the story: after his performance in "Dekalog 9", he gives at the beginning a reminder to the audience of Kieslowski, followed step by step in his fast race around the world. The director studies in depth the faculty of communication of human beings, without taking a final position on the ethical side of individual behavior. Once again, he reminds us of the unpredictability of future events, carefully exposing descriptions of life's strange journeys and recourse, separated from each other by a considerable number of years. Unexplainable combinations that converge strangely in a series of continuous and disturbing situations. - Some books falling on the sidewalk. - One of them opening on a fatal page, predetermining the fate of a future profession, as in the past. - glimpses of daily life that meet only fleeting, ideally accompanied by their attachment to the fictional musician Van den Budermayer. - Human fortunes marked by the most unfortunate coincidence. <br /> <br /> In this work deserving to be seen with the eyes of our heart rather than those of our spirit, we can witness a dialectical game between Judge Jean Luis' (Jean-Louis Trintignant) and Valentine Dussaut (Irene Jacob, perhaps the sweetest actress of our time, alongside the beautiful Winona Ryder), in a generational conflict between the experience of a tired old man and the conscious immaturity of a man pretty girl about to face the steepest path of her ascending path. Kieslowski speaks of "dialogue tests" between a disappointed human life and an unconscious youth of its future, between a soulless misanthrope and a spontaneous girl, full of good sense of disinterestedness. <br /> <br /> And the final parade when the humidity A smell of tragedy still persists in the air. All the main characters of the trilogy are obvious, saved by an accidental stroke of luck thanks to the intelligently written providential scenario, transmit us the extreme greetings of this master of cinema entirely used by his great passion for the cinema. There remains only a feeling of bitter regret and emptiness to remind us of the existence of a void impossible to fill. Goodbye KRZYSZTOF. YOU MISS US SO MUCH!
