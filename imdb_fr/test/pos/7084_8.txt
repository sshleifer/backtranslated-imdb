One True Thing proves that it's the characters who make a movie. Streep will surely receive an Oscar nomination for his role. A true drama, One True Thing is a great example of film making in the late 1990s. There are still people who care about doing and watching movies other than big blockbusters with special effects of a million bucks. It's not the best picture or anything ... do not be stupid. But the amount of emotion that was delivered by both the actors and the writer hit me like a shockwave. I cried twice in this film, which says a lot about a 24 year old man.
