Do not be fooled: this is not yet a tired example of Girls from Outer Space claiming to be the French ski team coming to Earth to collect as much sperm as possible, although the synopsis may suggest the opposite. This film is a jewel, an absolute jewel that has enriched my life since the moment I saw it. Hilarious, exciting, action-packed and incredibly erotic, "Ach jodel mir noch einen" is a Euro-Madcap Tour-De-Force, an extremely underestimated Bavarian classic. <br /> <br /> Stop everything you do and run for rent, or better yet, BUY this movie immediately.
