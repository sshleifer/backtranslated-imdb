I'm a big fan of big, noisy, trashy, completely stupid action movies like The Rock, Con Air, etc. All are very fun to watch, but when you think about it, extremely ridiculous. IN THE LINE OF FIRE tells a story and she tells it well. With plausibility, excitement and suspense, he has also addressed several important moral issues that make you think. The last shots of the movie are Eastwood and Russo sitting together on the steps of the White House, watching the pigeons on soft and peaceful music and I felt a deep sense of satisfaction. It was because I was interested in the characters and I was happy for them that their story came to a happy conclusion. It was like a true story. As an aging secret service agent, tormented by the fact that he did not protect JFK on that fateful day in Dallas, Clint Eastwood is fantastic. He brilliantly conveys his paranoia and his personal need to stop his opponent. On the other side of the spectrum is John Malkovich, a frightening predator who tortures Eastwood about what happened in 1963 by openly explaining his plan to kill the current president. This Oscar-nominated performance really puts you in the shoes. Throughout the film, Malkovich speaks to Eastwood as if they were friends. He does not threaten him, he does not lie to him, he does not make fun of him, but he tortures him with unbearable friendship until the last moment. In addition to this exciting main plot, a charming love affair involves Rene Russo, another agent and Eastwood. Despite the age difference, they have great chemistry on screen and the director does not let this film dominate too much, but keeps it as part of the backdrop that works well. In summary, I like this movie because it has a spirit.
