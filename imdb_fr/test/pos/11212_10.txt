I need about a year now after watching this movie to write about it. Lord knows I wanted it. After witnessing it, I knew I had seen something that I had never seen before, but I did not know why. Now, after thinking for a long time, I know these are the characters I can not help but think. <br /> <br /> Distant briefly and slowly tells the story of a parent (Yusuf) who comes from the rural to live briefly with a wealthy photographer (Mahmut) in the city in the hope of finding a job. However, it becomes clear that after Yusuf's assumption of seaman and his job prospects are slim, he is really looking for something else, a reason to be in his life . <br /> <br /> Throughout all this soul searching are taken through seasonal environments that are filmed exquisitely. The context in which they unfold makes the scenes more powerful in two scenes in particular, when a girl that Yusuf followed suddenly finds herself with her significant other, and the look of her face as he looks in a basket of fish and it is reflected on his tortured face. This scene in itself must be one of the most beautifully filmed pieces I witness. I do not know how long. <br /> <br /> In the end, Mahmut also has his own demons, but eventually confronts his parent. that he does not really try to find a job and that he is obliged to ask him to leave, in a very simple scene but who has the feeling of having a broken heart. <br /> <br /> The viewer has a lot to think about and reflect on for those two people who can be intruded on. The pace of this film should not discourage you, it is really worth every second to take your breath away. <br /> <br /> Rating 10 out of 10.
