This broadcast of the classic musical "Sweeney Todd" does not do justice to the production, but still remains exciting. <br /> <br /> First of all, the most enjoyable aspect of this version is the production design, set on the surprising hatch. Then the staging is excellent, until slashing. <br /> <br /> The main fault here is in the performances that people give. Oh, they're believable, all right - but it's pretty frustrating that no one seems to be heard in time in a song as fast as, say, "Kiss Me". In fact, the actress who plays Johanna is not only shifted, but also slightly shifted. And Angela Lansbury's slightly accentuated Cockney accent is a bit irritating. One last thing too - what is so bad about Judge Turpin's "Johanna" performance that she is banned from the American theater, but not from the "A Little Priest" cannibal anthem? <br /> <br /> Otherwise, it's an excellent production. It's a pleasure to watch people do what they like - and I do not even talk peripherally about "meat pies with a touch".
