Although this episode shocked the Tourette Syndrome Association, others found it funny, while others thought it was a bad way to start the new season. <br /> <br /> This episode was funny and shocking. South Park has made history their first episode with the most uncompromising words, unless you consider the film an episode. <br /> <br /> I liked how they made fun of Chris Hansen and his TV show Predator. I did not like the idea of ​​how they thought Chris Hansen would do a tourette show and let a boy talk and hit the Jews. <br /> <br /> One thing I did not like was the way South Park thought that people with the Tourette Syndrome would just be letting out such hard language. I saw people with Tourette Syndrome on TV and they were not just talking dirty words. Unless I'm wrong.
