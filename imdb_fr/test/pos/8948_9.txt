I saw it in a taste and it does not seem like it was released in the United States. Nevertheless, it was one of the most enjoyable little comedies. This concerns the rivalry between two funeral directors in a small British town. The plot [of the film] gets a little crazy in the third act but the characters are very nice and memorable. <br /> <br /> The acting game is great in all areas. Sure to be neglected in the crush of blockbusters, it is a film that is worth the detour. I know I will try to see this again in cinemas and / or buy the video.
