To begin, I did some more research on the film. First, Jules Dassin directed and played this extremely imaginative and different black crime movie. Secondly, it was a very low-budget film, created in the Renaissance at the height of the film noir. Third, the jewelers where the robbery was attempted is a real jeweler. Rififi's producers have asked them to film their films in a surprising way (I quote Jules Dassin in a recent interview on the subject), "surprisingly, for some unseen reason, they were delighted at the idea that a detective film unfolds in their store) <br /> <br /> It's impeccable characters and a plot that fits so well with their environment.To add to that, I'll say this, some may say that it it was a typical Hollywood movie, on the contrary Lay the basics of the plot of a Hollywood detective film. <br /> <br /> Laslty, I would like to say that I support this new idea of ​​a movie where not only one side wins, but the other side does not win It must always be the right game For once, I can say that a movie is not predictable! Ten stars!
