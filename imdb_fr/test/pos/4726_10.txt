This is one of the most underrated films of the 1990s. If you allow yourself to identify with Patricia Arquette, you will discover that it is a very moving story in which a woman finds herself sense of his life and finds a new will to live. <br /> <br /> Arquette's performance is courageous because it is deliberately "wooden" - it's a way of defining the spiritual death of his character, his total lack of desire to be alive . She moves in life like a zombie because her family has been murdered and she does not see the meaning of life. What is moving is how, during the course of history, she is awakened - by the Burmese landscape, by the beautiful quality of its inhabitants and its landscapes, and by the primordial choices it is forced to confront . <br /> <br /> Boorman supports it visually (and Hans Zimmer supports it with one of his finest haunted scores) with a camera often static and with a propensity to photograph through glass, windows, screens -brise, etc. like Arquette ... until she finds herself at the bottom of the jungle and has to choose whether to fight for her life or not. <br /> <br /> I also recommend the 1954 film THE PURPLE PLAIN. It's a similar story in a similar setting, and makes a compelling comparison.
