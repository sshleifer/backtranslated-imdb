The story of Tom Garner begins with his great funeral and is told through a series of elegant flashbacks told by his faithful life friend, Henry. Henry and his wife discuss whether Tom was a great man and a genius or villain without any value. The film is beautifully written, interpreted and directed, and I highly recommend it. <br /> <br /> Tom was the fabulously wealthy and prosperous owner of a great railroad. He dominated his board and his competitors, terrorizing his employees, slaughtering strikers. Tom's ambitious wife, Sally, was responsible for all of Tom's successes. When he met her, he was illiterate and completely satisfied with his work as a trotter for the railroad. Sally teaches him to read and supports his work on the tracks while Tom goes to school. He began to climb the ranks of the railway hierarchy until he took the presidency. <br /> <br /> But when Tom becomes a business mogul, his marriage to Sally gradually falls apart. His spoiled son despises him and he rubs a much younger woman (the aptly named Eve), with predictable catastrophic consequences. In his professional life, Tom is a total success. in his personal life, a disastrous failure. Like the character of Hearst in "Citizen Kane", Tom symbolizes the best and the worst of the capitalist system. <br /> <br /> Spencer Tracy is great in the role of Tom Garner and commercial scenes sound with authenticity. Colleen Moore is also excellent as Sally; both are aging well in multigenerational history. The film was written by Preston Sturges, but is nothing like the ball comedies for which Sturges became famous.
