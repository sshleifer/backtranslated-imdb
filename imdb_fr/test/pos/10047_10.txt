I saw this movie at Christmas and what a great movie! It tells the story of Custer (played by Errol Flynn) during and after his release from Westpoint. Although I've heard that the movie was not very accurate historically (Hollywood never was), I still enjoyed getting to know it because, anyway, I knew very little about the events real. <br /> <br /> I thought that Errol Flynn was brilliant and has since become my favorite actor! Her role alongside Olivia De Havilland was brilliant and the end was fantastic! I was almost moved to tears as he and Ned Sharp (Arthur Kennedy) walked towards their death on a little big horn. <br /> <br /> I had always known that Errol Flynn was a brilliant actor, just like my father's favorite actor. and I grew up watching movies as a child. But it was only when I watched this film that I realized how awesome it was. <br /> <br /> I will give 10 out of 10 to this movie !!
