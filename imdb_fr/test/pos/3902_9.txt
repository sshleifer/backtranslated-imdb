Written by William H. Macy, from the novel "A Travesty", the best and most difficult to find Donald E. Westlake. * Very true to the story, the movie stars Macy as an unlucky man who goes too far above his head after attempting to conceal an accidental death. Costars Adam Arkin and James Cromwell in good supportive roles. The strength of the film lies in its complex storyline and acting, especially Macy's, who regularly and deliciously breaks the fourth wall here and does it every time. A good scenario with a lot of black humor, this one hired me enough so that I look at it three times in the week since its release. Prepare to put aside your critical faculties and make a strong and bipartisan "wheeeeee!"
