This is a romantic, albeit nerdy movie that is one of my favorites of all time. This is one of the many CLASSICS of the 80s of the genre "Pretty in Pink" or "Some kind of Wonderful". <br /> <br /> Nic plays the traditional punk guy in love with the traditional valley, Julie, the preppy girl. It is a comforting love story that makes you win the girl's victory. <br /> <br /> Certainly, most of the actors are void, but ... <br /> <br /> I've been in love with Nic since he saw this in the theaters and saw almost all the movies he's been to since. He really grew up as an actor but it's obvious in his first film that he had LOTS of potential. <br /> <br /> If you like 80's movies, you'll love this classic. <br /> <br /> Go rent it !!!!!
