In France, Xavier (Romain Duris) is a young economist of twenty and over who is seeking a job in a government department through a friend of his father. It is advisable to specialize in the Spanish economy and language to get a good position. He decided to apply for a European exchange program called "Erasmus" and move to Barcelona to improve his knowledge of Spanish culture and language. She leaves her girlfriend Martine (Audry Tautou) promising to stay in close contact with her. Once in Barcelona, ​​he is temporarily hosted by a French doctor, Jean-Michel (Xavier de Guillebon) and his lonely young wife, Anne-Sophie (Judith Godrèche) whom he met at the airport. Later, he moved to an apartment with international students: English Wendy (Kelly Reilly), Spanish Soledad (Cristina Brondo), Italian Alessandro (Fédérico D'anna), Danish Lars (Christian Pagh) and the German Tobias (Barnaby Metschurat). Then Belgians Isabelle (Cécile de France) and Wendy's brother William (Kevin Bishop) join the group. Xavier learns Spanish and discovers friendship and love through his experience abroad. "L'Auberge Espagnole" is one of those films whose viewer becomes sad at the end. The story is a delightful and amusing story of friendship and love, in a globalized world and a unified Europe. This very charming movie made me feel good and happy, even though I have never lived in a student republic. The newcomer William causes the funniest situations in history, with his big mouth and his short brain. In addition, it is interesting to note that students living together have a new approach, different from these stupid American fraternities and their stereotypes, common in American films. My vote is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Albergue Espanhol" (Spanish inn ")
