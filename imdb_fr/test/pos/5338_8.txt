If you have not watched the movie yet, but like comedy, buy it or at least rent it! The fact that he won, the animation Oscar, is not a coincidence! I have not watched many other Wallace & Gromit movies (in fact, I think I only watched one), but the humor is very distinctive ... and some would also say very British. In a good way of course! <br /> <br /> The story will only be an excuse for all upcoming jokes, but even if it's not the most elaborate, it still works (by the way, my niece guessed to have seen the one of the big surprises to come, I did not do it, bravo to her; o)). I think after watching this one, you will go looking for other W & G movies, which are there. Enjoy!
