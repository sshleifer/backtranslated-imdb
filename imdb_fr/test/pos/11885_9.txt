My young aunt is unique in many ways. It is first of Hui Ya-Hung's (Kara Hui) first action film. Secondly, she was fighting after undergoing surgery a few days before the shoot. Third, this film is out of the chain. <br /> <br /> The film begins with Wang Lung Wei trying to take the inheritance of his brother. Her brother then asks Kara to marry her so that Wang can not take the treasure. The story is pretty good, leading everything to its proper place. <br /> <br /> In action, what can I say that has not already been said for movies like this, or The Disciples of the 36th Room, The Victim, or even the Magnificent Butcher . The fight scenes are what the sales movie is, and this one will have no problem doing it. Liu Chia Liang and Wang Lung Wei have engaged in a fight that must be seen to believe. Why did not these two men fight each other, it's beyond me. <br /> <br /> I do not want to ruin anything really, but you have to see My aunt to be full of enthusiasm. My only complaint is that Yuen Tak has not been used as wide as in 3 Evil Villains, or even in Invincible Pole Fighter (8 Diagram Pole Fighter), to see absolutely in the cinema. 9.2 / 10
