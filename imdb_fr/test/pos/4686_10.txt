The greatest compliments of this other commentator at IMDb have wondered why this series "was not stuck" in its day to last longer, like many other series of the 80s. <br /> <br /> This n It is not true that the series would have worsened if it continued. <br /> <br /> At the end of this comment, I will comment some thoughts on the other achievements of the film, rather: on the attempts of the legend of Robin Hood. <br /> <br /> First of all, Robert Addie (Gisburne), you are among us all, you live forever. <br /> <br /> Nothing is as much fun as the two, if you will, three seasons of this absolutely unique series. And at the same time absolutely agree with the mostly new and revolutionary discoveries of Terry Jones's historical documentations on Egypt, Greece, Rome, Konstantinopel, the Goths and Barbarians, and the Middle Ages and Crusades (... yes, THE Monthy Python- Terry Jones): <br /> <br /> If you've seen these brilliant and funny Jones-Docs, you'll better understand all that's going on in history, Carpenter, the writer of the Robin of Sherwood series (being the brother of John Carpenter, who did "The Thing", their third brother makes music), meant to tell us. <br /> <br /> The writer of "Dick Turpin", "Catweazle" and the first two seasons of "Robin Sherwood", called "Kip" Carpenter, is my lord of the film. He is better than anyone who criticizes his "sword and sorcery" or "defective" item (from Sherwood Webring's Robin) in this series (which I can not see) or who have other unfounded criticisms about it. . existed a lot at the time and still now. <br /> <br /> That's why when you get to know this "Sherwood Robin" better, you'll be stern. At first you will hate the third season. And it's not just that: I myself went through this, and in addition I took the first two seasons deep in my heart - DESPITE the fact that Robin's actor Praed left this series, because after the series In case of resounding success, he is offered a role probably better paid in a series absolutely ridiculous Canadian entitled "The new adventures of Jules Verne". The title already reveals the emptiness of the whole project. Praed was looking for money, not glory, he did not stick to his band and his parents, I mean, as actors. <br /> <br /> Actors who personally represent the sequel "really", in our famous era and the legendary faces and characters of the Robin legend. The potential of this series could and should have been allowed to flourish further without any level of degrading historical content and message, or rebellious precision about current political issues. <br /> <br /> Again, it's mandatory to say: A change in the lead role was forced by Praed's silly decision to let Robin de Sherwood for a series of idiot remakes of the Verne Tales and brilliantly woven in the filming of the story. Anyway, it's still a disaster. <br /> <br /> Anyway: if you know anything about it, and Connery may have been really announced by his father, but the young Connery does not have any at all " chased Praed ", how I thought prejudicially in the first place, so we can absolutely enjoy the 3rd season. It's sad to note that the screenplay was no longer written by Superman Kip Carpenter, so we no longer have this critical and free historical context like, for example, in "The Witch of Elsdon" or in "The King du Fou ", two episodes of the first series which is A) funny, B) historically educate and C) brilliantly acted. === <br /> <br /> "Do not trust the lion!" <br /> <br /> Unlike many other characters who wished him death to gain their own power, Richard Lionheart, shown in RoS and as in real life, was an authority greater than John or others, but only used it for his misconception of the crusade and the war against Normandy in France. He had slaughtered and massacred many more than tens of thousands of Christians, Muslims and Jews during the "holy" crusades, and his soldiers even devoured the children whom they had slaughtered from hunger or poverty. On top of that, after being captured by the Saracens (Muslims) in the crusades, Britain was unbuttoned for ransom, 100,000 marks (at that time, the 11th century, comparable to about 30 billion - 30,000 000'000 .- Dollars of current value), to recover it safely, then he just spent a month in England to return to Normandy (in France, where the Norman invaders were first) for the Crusades (on learns only in the episode "The King's Fool"). For this new crusade, a kind of revenge on his capture, Richard Lionheart "drains the country of money again" (quoted in the mouth of Clive Mantle, when he tells Robin that he is critical even with the king ). Robin criticizes Richard's non-social decision about the war, addresses Richard himself and says, "The poor have given everything to free you, how CAN you ask for more?" - Richard: "... give me your courage and your strength, not your words!" ... Later, in private, Richard orders the assassination of Robin ... <br /> <br /> The crusaders were therefore the real "barbarians". <br /> <br /> PS: Already when I looked at Kostner in '91, I got angry, because afterwards, I discovered in a history class at school that Richard was not a student. man as good as the one illustrated by Sean Connery during his stint at the end of "Prince of the Thieves". Well, as Terry Jones would say: It's a lie, a treacherous lie! "Sean is humorous and charismatic, and his son is doing a better job than expected during the third season of" Robin of Sherwood ". <br /> Once again: Praed is, according to my information so far, the one who left Sherwood for a stupid series of Verne that no one will ever remember or who has a brain.
