Hayang Miyazaki's latest and eighth film for Ghibili Studio, "Gake No Ue No Ponyo" is a wonderfully amusing and imaginative look at childhood. At a time when movie animation seems to have been dominated by Disney / Pixar's masterpieces, it's both refreshing and comforting to know that Miyazaki still relies on traditional animation drawn from hand to tell his charming and enchanting stories. <br /> <br /> The story revolves around the friendship between a magical sea and a goldfish and the human child she meets on a curious outing to discover the human world. The human child, Sosuke (Doi Hiroki) lives in a small house on a cliff overlooking a small port city in southern Japan (based on Seto Island) where he lives with his young mother, Lisa (Yamaguchi Tomoko) . Sosuke names the strange goldfish "Ponyo" and takes him to the daycare / care center for which Lisa works. Ponyo is certainly not your typical goldfish, and is soon beginning to adapt and take on human aspects (she develops human speech and an appetite for ham meat) by taking blood off a cut on Sosuke's finger. <br /> <br /> Yet, as Sosuke and Ponyo begin to develop a bond, Ponyo is taken over by his father, Fujimoto (Tokoro Joji), a former human who has rejected the surface world and is now trying to recover. and develop magic elixirs extracted from the sea that help repair and rejuvenate the world's oceans. <br /> <br /> Ponyo's desire to become human has become so strong that Fujimoto is unable to contain her and she takes a more human and escapes from her aquatic world and returns to see Sosuke. <br /> <br /> During his escape, Ponyo unwittingly unleashes Fujimoto's cache of magic elixirs, which releases all kinds of magical sea creatures that cause a violent storm in the seas surrounding the city of Sosuke. Desperate to resolve the Ponyo rebellion, he quickly appealed for help from his beautiful wife, Ponyo's mother - the water elemental, Mother / Sea Lady (Amami Yuki). <br /> <br /> As in his previous films, Miyazaki's "Gake No Ue No Ponyo" addresses various themes related to ecology and environmentalism, focusing this time on the health and vitality of the world's oceans. . The opening sequence is sometimes sobering when Ponyo encounters a scraping ship scraping the ocean floor, discovering mountains of garbage and debris. One can understand the anger and frustration of the Fujimoto character, who has spent his entire life trying to repair the damage caused by civilization to his oceans, while viewing it as a daunting and almost fruitless endeavor. <br /> Enough, can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film. It is both bizarre and scandalous but at once charming and curious. Obviously, Miyazaki wanted to capture the meaning and style of a child's imagination. The artistic style has the appearance of pencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and whimsical. It's almost like a children's color book. <br /> <br /> The children actors Nara Yuria and Doi Hiroki do a fantastic job as Ponyo and Sosuke. They bring an adorable charm to their roles. Nara Yuria, in particular, looks so cute as Ponyo that it's no wonder that Sosuke, of Doi, falls in love with the magical girl. Yamaguchi Tomoko (Shichinin No Otaku, Swallowtail), a former girl from the countryside, also plays very well in her role as Lisa, Sosuke's modern mother. I was a little disconcerted at first by her character, because I thought at first that she was the elder sister of Sosuke. It also did not help that Sosuke kept calling him "Lisa" rather than mom, but I suppose it may be a sign of the times and an indicator of the modern Japanese family (in the animated series Pencil Shinchan, Shinnosuke also refers to 80's comedian, Tokoro Joji, sounds totally different from the serious Fujimoto, but does not wisely give his character a naughty or wacky cartoony, although we do not know his character, former actor and pro-actor Nagashima Kazushige (who plays Sosuke's father, Koichi), also offers an interesting vocal work.The opening theme "Umi No Okasan" by the Japanese soprano Masako Hayashi is simply beautiful and moving, however, the theme "Geke No Ue No Ponyo" Fujimaki Fujioka and Nozomi Ohashi is light and fun and evokes the images of a traditional Japanese nursery rhyme. in a brilliant sequence, the soundtrack takes on an almost Wagnerian operatic sound with music that sounds like "Die Walk√ºre". <br /> <br /> The film is not perfect, however, and suffers from moments when the central story of Ponyo and Sosuke takes the back seat to some of Miyazaki's overwhelming visuals. I would have liked to have more time to explore the Fujimoto story as well as the relationship between Sosuke and his father. <br /> <br /> As "Kiki / Majo No Takkyubin Delivery Service", "Howl Mobile Castle", "Momonoke Princess / Momonoke Hime" and "My Neighbor Totoro / Tonari No Totoro", "Gake No Ue No Ponyo "is another Miyazaki classic that is a wonderful treat for the eyes. Like a modern fairy tale, the film tells a timeless story of friendship and love that will surely be cherished in the years to come.
