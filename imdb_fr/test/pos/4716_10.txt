I saw Beyond Rangoon about 20 times, it was as good as that. At first, when I watched it, I saw the story of Laura Bowman, but after several screenings, I realized that it was also a parallel documentary. I thought of Aung San Suu Kyi and the struggles of women to stay strong in the face of uncertainty, danger and sadness. I would also put history and politics on the list after looking further, because I had learned a lot about the past and present of Burma and could only guess at the future. This film is not just a movie you will want to see, it's also a movie you'll want to own. It is a film that could easily be seen by the whole family, but not for children under 13 years old. However, the educational benefits of this film can not and should not be underestimated.
