Although the story is light, the film flows so well and its visual is so quiet and poetic that it could almost carry the entire film. <br /> <br /> The film consists of four interconnected stories, covering different aspects of attraction. between man and / or woman and how often he is ethereal. Their true desire always seems to be something they can not cling to, it will sink like a handful of sand. <br /> <br /> I thought the most intriguing story was the last one where the woman was more inaccessible, the more the man wants it. This corresponds to his deep love for God, who is infinitely out of reach, but never closer to his heart. <br /> <br /> A very good movie. 7/10
