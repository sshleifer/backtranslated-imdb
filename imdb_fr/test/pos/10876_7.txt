In fact, I was satisfied when I played this game. The graphics were something new. The missions were great. But again, I felt that I wanted more from this game. is pretty good but not as good as his others Maybe it's just because I'm in the games as a Resident Evil, Dead Rising and that kind of games. So it could be better but that Natalya was a person I hated absolutely about this game. She was irritating and dying all the time and she could not run either. I recommend this game to those who love FPS games more than me. 7/10 STARS
