This film will probably not please some, because the horror is largely mental. But there is a little something for almost everyone, including some really cool abduction scenes with aliens. The film makes extensive use of the mythology of extraterrestrial abductions, while showing a little more intelligence on some facets of the kidnapping myths one might expect from a film. Jillian McWhirter is excellent in what must have been a grueling performance.
