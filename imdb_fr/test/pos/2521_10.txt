I saw this masterpiece for the first time on VHS 10 years ago, and the powerful interpretation that results from it on the angry society, the one that weighs heavily against established companies, has remained in my heart since then. The director Hector Babenco is such a good humanity, who finds a delicate angle to tell how urbanity kills the childhood of children from the class of poverty. Even excluded children have their sweet innocent dreams. But the corrupt reality never leaves a chance ... <br /> <br /> Thanks to the publishers for the recent release of the DVD, I can now keep this beautiful film in my favorite collection.
