This film reminded me of the live dramas of the 1950s - not like the recent "Failsafe", which seemed more like a stuntman, but a TRUE moral drama that was both engaging and challenging. Anne Heche is more than credible as an army officer having an affair with her superior, played by Sam Shepard, and Eric Stoltz is wonderful as his advocate defending him against the armed forces. I found myself waiting for their business to start, if only because they are so beautiful together. This film is apparently based on a true story, and it is comforting to be asked to think about real problems for change. <br /> <br /> Directed by Christopher Menaul, who also shot The Passion of Ayn Rand (with Stolz) and the Prime Suspect series, this film with panache and style not to be missed.
