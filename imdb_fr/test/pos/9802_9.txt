My point of view on the end. Bobby died at the hands of his father-in-law. Mike had tried to get Bobby out. Only a child could think that it would be possible to build a machine capable of flying. Bobby is dead ... Mike, as a child, survived by creating an alternative ending in his mind ... about how Bobby left ... Mike made a plane that landed him. Children who are victims of sexual violence and violence often create another world in their minds to survive. <br /> <br /> It was also great to see my old neighborhood housing. We called it San Jose Boulevard and I lived right next to where this house was filmed. It was so strange to see that they filmed inside the houses ... not studios ... It was my kitchen, my bedroom and my living room. And those hills ... we were riding them when we were kids ... looking at our little valley ... seeing a glimpse of the bay. Was a real nostalgia trip for me.
