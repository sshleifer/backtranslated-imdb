I was ready not to like this film, and the first 10 minutes did not do anything to quell my fears. It starts with two high school gangs clashing with bad kung fu. A scenario found in countless other Korean movies. Ho-hum. Add the fact that the story was written by the same guy who wrote "He Was Cool" (which was barely passable) and, well, I thought I was in for 2 hours indefinable. <br /> <br /> But don't give up so fast! "A novel to their taste" was directed by Tae-gyun Kim, who also directed "Volcano High" (which I thought was very funny). Anyway, "Romance of Their Own" is soon turning a corner for the best. A high school girl who has just moved to Seoul is at the center of attention of two potential contenders. Each type has its merit, and we do not know which (if any) would be the right choice. <br /> <br /> The following is not your usual love triangle for teens. Emotions are complex and, even if you do not agree with certain choices or actions as the film unfolds, you can certainly understand why the characters created them. <br /> <br /> The film asks questions to the characters and the audience. Who do we choose? When is a person forced to make a choice (and is it unfair to someone if they seem to be guided)? Once you (or your heart) have made your choice, how do you react (and how should you react) when new information appears and sheds new light on the situation? There is a scene, very close to the end, very subtle but that perfectly summarizes what I think would be a real reaction instead of an excessive "film reaction". The subtlety is in a character in the background of the scene. Recent events and revelations have left him confused and emotionally overwhelmed. Basically, he does not know what to do with things. Instead of letting him "play" something, or look stunned, he just stares at a fixed point unable to react or say anything. It's like someone has unplugged it. His reaction seemed right and I enjoyed the scene. <br /> <br /> As in most Korean films, there is a mix of action, bravado, burlesque and melodrama. Korean films often take steep turns (see "Sex Is Zero" for a good example), which can be a shock for the uninitiated. Go ahead and get started with this one. Love it, love it or hate it, I think most viewers will be able to understand and appreciate the actions and reactions of the characters.
