It could not. <br /> <br /> From the dialogue to the stunning special effects that this movie has been a joy to see all along. The immediate sensation of Antarctic bitterness, the character affinity that builds at the grassroots level before real action warms up, and the cunning finale are one to make it one of the most the most memorable and enjoyable movies ever. <Br /> <br /> Facing a long list of films that have tried to exploit the theme of visitors from another planet, The Thing comes in first and laughs. Who can forget the perfectly synchronized dialogue and the chilling special effects? Special effects much more impressive than the computer-generated images we see today. For my part, I found that some of the most enjoyable aspects of the film were the way we were introduced slowly to each member of the team and how they all had distinctive traits. It was not just a senseless film of bloodshed, uprooting, horror. This film had the feeling. Emotion. <br /> <br /> I really can not recommend this movie. I have not seen anything in his class that is close to the match, not to mention the improvement, the almost perfect acting and timing used in this cunning feat of cinema.
