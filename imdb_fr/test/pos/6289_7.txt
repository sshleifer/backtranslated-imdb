This is the only Pauly Shore movie you should see. OK, it's the only one I've ever seen, and I think I've made the right choices. I normally find Shore Shtick tired, but he is very funny in this movie. In fact, the scenario is pretty funny and Shore does not overwhelm the other actors with his ... How do you call that? Antics? Anyway, it's a funny movie, so ultimately forgettable. --Frink-3
