Ernesto is a man who earns his living by deceiving other solid citizens of their hard-earned money. With Manco, an older, more experienced man, he brings out capers that help him make a good living, but that does not make him a rich man. Enter Federico, an older man, more experienced in the art of deception. Together with young Ernesto, they are a winning combination. It only lasts until Pilar, Federico's former love, appears in the picture. <br /> <br /> This Spanish film directed by Miguel Bardem is of a clear and pleasant tone. Other, better quality caper movies have been made with much smarter storylines than this one, but the movie is easy to take and sometimes has many fun situations. <br /> <br /> This viewer will see Federico Luppi in anything, even reading the phone book! It's an actor. We had the privilege of seeing him in Buenos Aires doing a great job before his international film career. As Federico, he does what he does best. It is impossible to imagine anyone better in his role. Ernesto Alterio, the son of Hector Alterio, is a young actor who promises to have a good career. Victoria Abril makes fun of Pilar by getting involved with these crooks. Miguel Alexandre, a veteran actor, is as good as Manco.
