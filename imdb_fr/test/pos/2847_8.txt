Okay, maybe not perfect, but it was pretty close. This movie jumped from the crime drama to the goofball romantic comedy, and vice versa, so quickly that it appeared to be two different movies that were played simultaneously and then replayed at the end. But they did it smoothly and some in the theater found that the bloody parts (like the scalping scene) were also funny. I almost throw up, but I guess it's just me. Greg Kinear is perfect as a soap opera actor. He has the ability to interpret these dramatic drama scenes with good facial expressions and vocal intonations. His scenes with Betty look like "Sleepless in Seattle" or another romantic comedy like this one. You almost forget that Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock are looking for Betty. Morgan Freeman's fascination with Betty was rather frightening, knowing that he could practically be his grandfather, but the scenes where he talks with his picture are really worth laughing at! Chris Rock's performance looks rather like wood, but he has his moments. Renee Zellweger is as nice as Betty, the adorable maid with the brutal and unfaithful husband who treats her like filth. It is very unlikely that she got a job in a hospital without real references, but, hey, it's a movie, go for it! Her roommate, Rosa, also shines, as a woman who cares about Betty, but does not really know how to handle Betty's illness. And finally, there is Crispin Glover. As a fan, I naturally thought that the film could have been funnier if it had been more present. No one else has the same style of play as Crispin, and the argument between Chris Rock, Crispin and the sheriff about the drama is hilarious. I guess I say that I really liked this movie! If you can stand the blood, the violence and a lot of vulgar language, it's worth watching and it will give you a lot of laughter!
