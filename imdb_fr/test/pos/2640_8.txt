Great movie party, after the adventures of Bill & Tom, two high school friends at both ends of the spectrum. Bill (Eric Stolz) prefers to lead a righteous life, while his friend Tom (Chris Penn) does not take anything seriously, except partying all the time. When Bill leaves his mother's house to live alone, he faces many problems, from his girlfriend to his brother to his owner. Meanwhile, his friend Tom moves to maintain the rent but continues to upset Bill's life. This film is a non-stop comedy from start to finish and is one of my personal favorites. Soundtrack introduces the guitar virtuoso Edward Van Halen throughout the film, as well as cameos from rockers Lee Ving and Ron Wood. The legend of the porn star of the 70s, Kitten Navidad, also appears! The classic film of the 80s is worth several looks. There is now only a DVD version awaited! If you enjoyed this movie, take a look at "The Last American Virgin", which is similar to "Wild Life". I note both highly.
