I think it's a very good classic monster movie for the family. The mole, what a machine! The great beaked creature, the flying green lizards, the Ranthorincus / Maya or whatever, and the ape-men speak of them telepathically. The battle of rubber men is fighting for a doll at breakfast, humm! delicious! Class, what else can I say? How would they do a 2002 remake of it?
