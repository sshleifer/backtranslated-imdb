He is an excellent drummer of the war years. <br /> <br /> John Mills directs a fine cast of British film B pillars in a solo underwater attack against a fictional battleship. <br /> <br /> Filmed in black and white, it is well paced and also well placed since a war was going on at the time. It shows how much the authorities have taken positive propaganda seriously. <br /> <br /> The mission aspect of the film takes place in real submarines. Things are narrow and claustrophobic. The actors look appropriately dirty and sweaty without being too offensive to the heroic palace. Other commentators have already drawn attention to the little authentic details, such as keeping the boat balanced and forgetting to read instruments, as well as the activities of the engine room. <br /> <br /> This is probably the first film in which debris (and a dead German) is blown out of the torpedo tube to deceive an enemy destroyer. And this is the ONLY time I see part of the ship exposed pretending to sink - a risky gamble if there is one. <br /> <br /> I'm a bit skeptical about whether a submarine is submarine or not. could work its way through a cable net. The submerged speed was barely twice that of the speed of human walking, and the net would have had a lot to "give". In addition, the engineer was at the same workstation and operated the same levers both on the surface and submerged. That too seems implausible given that diesel or electric engines were used and that they were in different parts of the ship - or at least I am told. for my tastes. But then, it was a propaganda effort, and clearly contained a subtle message to civilians that could have a negative impact on the morale of the service and, consequently, on the war effort. <br /> <br /> These negations aside, it's a little fun. little adventure. Nowadays, movies of such a vintage tend to be screened in the afternoon, while much more modern and substandard movies are broadcast in prime time. But then; it is no longer politically correct to mention the war in the presence of our European friends (too many of them have a guilty conscience), or of our own leftist fascists (none of whom has ever fought for the freedoms that they take for granted). <br /> <br /> As an underwater film, it is eminently collectible. Better than 'The Enemy Below', I think, although less demonstrative. Not as authentic as "Das Boot", far from it.
