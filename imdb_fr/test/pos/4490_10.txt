"Five characters in search of an outing" must clearly be one of the most intelligent and successful episodes of the "Twilight Zone" because of its abstract ideas and thoughtful plan where characters must search to discover their identity and end as a surprise. You have a military major, a dancer, a bagpiper, a clown, and tramps waking up together at the bottom of a wall and no one knows how they got there and they do not know who they are. Thus, the episode begins with a very interesting drama and suspense from the beginning, making it a fundamental quest for the interest of the viewers and asking them to know the characters, the true identity and the antecedents. In addition, the episode adds even more intrigue in the fact that it places different types of characters with different views and lifestyles, all with a common goal of escaping life and finding an identity. , and a very convincing peace for the viewer. It is only at the end that I do not want to spoil for those who have not witnessed a surprise fall! Proving that you will often want to stay where you are in your little protected world and get away from the mass of others' worlds, because you will see that the characters are loved differently by people in a very different form. Really great and cleverly made a real shock surprise that shows the viewer the unexpected and cruel destiny that sometimes occurs when you search and search.
