I loved this movie and I loved the love part with Cool and the girl ... Rachel (?) 4gut her name ... honestly, I was interested only in those. I liked them in the movie, I want to see more movies like that. but please, do not finish the sad ends where they can not be 2gether! = (it made me cry ... but the romance between them ... the plot the trauma all was great.) I was just more in Colby and Rachel. ha ha =) everything in this movie was thrilling to keep you glued to your seat. because I was sure. Honestly, my only personal desire would be more centered between the couple (Colby and Rachel) and at least a decent end. I hated the end, better could have been more thoughtful, not forcing Coolby to death and the birth of a son of Rachel. The end would have killed the movie.
