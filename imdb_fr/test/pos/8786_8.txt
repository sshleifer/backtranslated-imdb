Barry Kane (Robert Cummings) is wrongfully accused of sabotaging a hangar manufacturing aircraft for the war. He runs away, meets Patricia Martin (Priscilla Lane) on the way, and joins him to find and bring to justice the real criminals. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of problems with this movie. Robert Cummings was a good actor, but he is totally wrong in this role. Priscilla Lane is pretty but has never been a good actress; history does not make much sense (and works longer than necessary); he wears his patriotism too much (but that was done while the Second World War was in full swing) and there is no end. It should not work, but it works. <br /> <br /> It's full of odd lines and characters that you are definitely interested in. <br /> <br /> For example: Lane tells Cummings to fall in love), "I wish I could meet you a hundred years ago" (???? !!!!); Lane COUNT a villain for his lunch and Cummings and Lane briefly join a circus troupe while they are on the run. In addition, Hitchcock's management was (as always) simply brilliant: he launched truly amazing plans and sequences, including the highlight of the Statue of Liberty. <br /> <br /> This is not a classic Hitchcock movie, but it remains very good and deserves to be caught.
