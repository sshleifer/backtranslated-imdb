I recently saw House of Wax and I must say that I really enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> it's one of the best horror / thriller films of recent years, if not one of the best and most entertaining. <Br /> <br /> I heard many people denigrate the so-called slow start and the development of the character that occupies the first 45 minutes of the film. <br /> <br /> but if the film plunges into the dead, the public and critics would have blamed the film for not having honest characters they did not care. <br /> <br /> as well as for the development of the characters, I think it worked very well. <br /> <Taking into account my own and others' responses (reading messages on the bulletin board), many people ended up wanting the characters to live, and I noticed that many people mentioned Paige Edwards (Paris Hilton). taking into account Warner. The brothers were selling his death, it's a surprise. Many audiences have come to congratulate her on her survival. <br /> <br /> Speaking of hunting / death scenes, they were some of the most inventive and suspenseful I have been witnessing for a while and I appreciate each one a lot. <br /> <br /> the game in the movie was absolutely perfect, I could not fault it, especially Paris Hilton, I found it very decent and I hoped it would get more than 25 minutes of movie in a 120 minutes film; however, her pursuit scene has made up for that, and believe me when I say that Paris can act with fear (Look at the scene where she hides a car from Vincent and he passes in front of her ... the look of terror on her face looks VERY real). <br /> <br /> Overall, I give House of Wax the maximum number of stars, for the value of entertainment and suspense, and even gore ...... the only criticism is that I wish that at the commercialization of the film, they did not reveal the list of deaths and who dies and who survives, as I would have done ten times better not to know if the person pursued would live or die and a horrible death. <br /> <br /> can not wait for the DVD, but go see it at the cinema as long as you can, it will not be the same in your own room, but if you wait for the DVD, watch the movie in black without interruption, trust me, you will not be disappointed.
