I had heard about John Garfield, but I did not know him. I loved this film. I have never heard of it. I just took it at random. John Garfield is a boxer in the movie. He had been in real life too, so he knew his role. He was a fugitive throughout the film. Someone killed a man. His character was blamed. He is friends with a family who has questions and is not sure what to think about them. All kinds of minor plots ensue. My favorite was the scary swim scene in a water tower where the water was deep and where a Dead End Kid could not swim AND none of them could go out. John's character saves the day. The Dead End Kids have been great as friends and followers. One of them to the end. Ann Sheridan played the family's daughter and John's future love interest. She was credible, but not nice in my opinion - the only weak link in the movie.
