I attended a screening of this film, unsure of what to expect from Kevin Costner and Ashton Kutcher; both delivered less than memorable performances and movies. Although the underlying "general" scenario is somewhat familiar, this film was excellent. Costner and Kutcher both delivered powerful performances playing extremely well for each other. The human weaknesses and strengths of their respective characters have been incredibly played by both; The scene where Costner confronted Kutcher with his personal reasons for joining the Coast Guard's elite of rescuers was the most memorable emotional moment of the film. The "specific" scenario was an education in itself describing the personal sacrifice and physical training that the Coast Guard's elite rescuers had to follow to prepare for their unique work and responsibility ... saving lives at sea. The special effects of the rescue scenes were extremely realistic and "breathtaking" ... I have not seen such rough seas since "The Perfect Storm". Co-star Clancy Brown (HBO's "Carnivale" - delighted to see him again) played the captain role for the captain of the Kodiak (Alaska) Coast Guard Base in a strong and convincing role as a leader with the necessary ice water in the vein. The film wonderfully, and ultimately, gives long-awaited exposure and respect to the Coast Guard; the audience applauded in the end.
