I took a group of young people the same age as the protagonists and we all liked it. I agree with the other post, the guy from Wilson worked a thankless script in a big minor character. It's good to have a movie for a certain demographic age (too old for PG, too young for R). It also shows how they think and maneuver in college. You had to like how good Jimmy Buffet had been as a teacher. He kept us adults awake. The level of questioning authority of the children has been kept reasonable. Their motivations were specific and did not resemble those of some DATs. rebel. The setting and the music were beautiful. All in all, if you liked Holes, it's really similar.
