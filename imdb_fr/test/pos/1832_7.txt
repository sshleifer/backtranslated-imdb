I'll start by saying that I've always been a fan of Bonnie Hunt .... She always adds life to all the characters she plays and she did a remarkable job in her directorial debut. <br /> <br /> I have to admit it's a chick movie ... But keeping that in mind, it's a wonderful story, it's touching a lot of emotions and all kinds of reactions. <br /> <br /> This movie describes real life as people with real life as situations. (I must exclude the coincidence that makes up most of the film) <br /> <br /> It's a love story ... not just about a man and a woman, but about the love of family, friends and loved ones those of the past. (Even pets). <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed it. Well worth the rental or purchase.
