Dirty Dancing follows the story of Frances 'Baby' Houseman (Jennifer Gray) and her family as they spend the summer at the Kellerman Family Summer Camp. We see her discovering herself as she falls in love with dance instructor Johnny Castle (Patrick Swayze). <br /> <br /> The film is full of wonderful dances (hence the title!), good music, and fantastic landscapes. He treats some difficult issues with dignity and grace, and, of course, has (shocking spoiler here!) A happy ending, wonderful, feeling good! You know how it will end from the beginning, but that's not really the problem here. The goal is the trip, a journey that touches all members of the family. <br /> <br /> This is one of the movies I have to watch every time he's on TV ... no matter how I already have it. memorized!
