I love it I love it I love this show. Whether you say it's because I'm crazy about brain or not. I think this show is very entertaining and entertaining even if sometimes the uncle of Bam, Bam scares me .. so, on the whole, I give this show a perfect critique. And so I really think that if you like the kind of humor "which is silly", this show is for you. It's really fun to see the faces on the pranks and there are a lot of musical guests coming to Bam. Buy this cause it rips! You should buy it. Yes. And Bam's brother is in the CKY band and they are really good and sometimes come to the show. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is .. look at the show please.
