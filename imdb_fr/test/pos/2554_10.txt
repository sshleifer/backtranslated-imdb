Chop Shop is a hidden treasure in theaters! I can not begin to describe how wonderful the performances of this film are. This film is for anyone who wants to watch a compelling story and see an example of what contemporary movies should look like. <br /> <br /> This film is about a young boy, Alejandro "Ale", who lives and works with his teenage sister, Isamar "Izzie" in a tiny loft in a car shop. The story takes place in a part of New York City (which I did not even know, Willits Points) where there are countless dumps and body shops. Bahrani tells the story of two forgotten children who hoped to be able to support themselves by buying and repairing a food truck. <br /> <br /> Ale earns money by helping an auto shop, and Izzie helps in a food truck; both, however, make extra money on the side. Ale sells pirated movies and stolen car parts; Izzie comes back to sell. Their lives are surrounded by dust and sadness, but even though the two witnesses live and survive hardly in their hostile world, their love for one another is never tainted by the dirt around them. And sometimes, they are able to laugh and enjoy the moments of their childhood stolen by the reality of their struggle to survive and stay together. <br /> <br /> The best comparison I can make for Chop Shop is that the juxtaposition of an innocent love between family members in such a gloomy atmosphere is as powerful as Pasolini's Mama Roma, combined with the difficulties he was experiencing growing up too fast in a hostile environment, as in the Mouchette de Bresson. <br /> <br /> Having co-written, directed and edited both this film and his first film, Man Push Cart (which has won awards around the world), Bahrani is a complete filmmaker. <br /> <br /> I can only hope that his films will not be hidden treasures for long!
