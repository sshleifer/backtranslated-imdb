DMHS! is one of the funniest and funest budget movies I've seen in a while. Director Jeff Smith (who was also co-writer, director of photography and editor) clearly shows his love of the under-appreciated horror movies of the 80s with this movie! Anyone who loves the tricky situations, absurd situations, zany characters and stereotyped horror movies of the 80s will love this ironic tribute to the past. <br /> <br /> STMD! definitely up to the qualities described in the poster, and more. It contains all the "excessive violence" and "free nudity" that recalls these entertaining horror movies of the 80s that we all love. I had a great time watching STMD! From the 80's outfits worn by the stereotyped characters, to clumsy blood splashes, I simply could not get enough!
