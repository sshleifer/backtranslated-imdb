This is one of the best sequences of the moment and a very good film too, even if there were errors, but I still appreciated. This time, Charles is not fighting just one or two attackers, but an entire army of them. Death Wish 3 has a lot of great action scenes and I've enjoyed every second of it. Director Michael Winner knows how to make a good action movie like this. Jimmy Page provides the music. Producers Golan and Globus still work there and Charles Bronson still plays well for Paul Kersey. This film also gave the impression that Michael was trying to end the Death Wish series and I can not blame him and I love the Gun that Charles uses. Death Wish 3 is one of the best movies of 1985 and can not do better than that. <br /> <br /> I give that 9/10
