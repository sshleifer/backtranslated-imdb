Probably the most recent gay-oriented movie I've seen. C. Jay Cox put his finger on it. His way of dealing with issues related to faith, family, and sexuality was very well done. The cast was perfect. Wes Ramsey did a fantastic job of winning the character of Christian and Steve Sandvoss will put you in the role of Aaron. Both have brought incredible realism to the roles and impacts of these issues on young homosexual men. As a gay man growing up in a very religious environment (although not a Mormon), the identification with Aaron's character was phenomenal for me. Highly recommend this movie to anyone, faithful or not, who is interested in how young gay men cope with family and friends in an often hostile world. By the way, the music of this movie is great! Another great work from C. Jay Cox.
