I did not read the book "Scarlett" and when I watched this mini-series, I enjoyed it very much and thought it was not necessary to compare it to GWTW. The story may differ from the book, but who cares is a movie. Even in credits, it's based on the book, it's not the book. The film is clearly underestimated with the critics that other people write but can not even spell the names of the main characters correctly. <br /> <br /> The acting game in Scarlett seemed superb to me. Joanne Whalley and Timothy Dalton were excellent. They took the characters and gave them a touch. Now, as far as people go, they compare them to the great Vivian Leigh and Clark Gable. They have obviously done fantastic things, but the main roles in this film are completely different people who have their own playing methods and should not be under pressure from what people have to say. If you wanted some actors to go well then you should have made the film, I'm sure other actors would not be as successful as these with the chemistry and intelligence that they brought to those roles. The actors stood out by their size and Jean Smart steals the scenes with his genius of comedy. <br /> <br /> The film scene was very beautiful and it was great to see Scarlett go see all these places in the film as she causes problems and other things. So the scene in which Scarlett speaks at her father's grave was very dramatic and I now thought there were two GREAT actresses who brought Scarlett O'Hara to life. Not only Vivian Leigh, but also Joanne Whalley. <br /> <br /> The film and the book may differ, but you should not take to heart for the present film as a sequel to one of the best movies ever made, otherwise you will think it must be like Gone With the Wind and you will not like this movie. But it's an underrated classic that does not look like GWTW, it's his own movie. Also keep in mind that "Tomorrow is another day" ...
