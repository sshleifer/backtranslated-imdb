I was amazed by the quality of this film, especially after seeing images of the barely adult director - all my 140 books (?)! Really, a boy making a movie about a boy. I can not wait to see more of Luke Eberl's films. <br /> <br /> I thought this one was a bit too long. Too much time has been spent to show that Connor was unsuccessful (and unwilling) to act on Owen. Caleb did not try hard enough. Owen, being so young, could have easily moved closer to Caleb and later decided that it was not his preference. And Owen would still have learned the "precious lesson" about corruption and politics. Instead, he did not have a chance to learn about his sexuality. And what about poor Caleb? Owen could have had a good influence. <br /> <br /> Although the film aims to show Owen as a hero overcoming perverse corruption, I felt sad for him. He was offered the opportunity to have fun boy-boy with Caleb, who was extraordinarily beautiful. Owen did not have to accept the proposed political perversion. But he could have tried to have fun with Caleb and leave when he wanted to. It was clear that Owen was in charge - no one forced him to do what he did not want to do. But he could have had more fun, and with a very enthusiastic boyfriend. <br /> <br /> I hope Luke makes more movies where the attractive young characters have more fun.
