It was perhaps inevitable that with the onslaught of "slasher" movies in the early 1980s, some good films could slip through the cracks. This is a great "rare" film by Jeff Lieberman, who ensured his cult status with his memorable 1970s films, "Squirm" and "Blue Sunshine". <br /> <br /> Five young people head into the mountains of Oregon (this film was actually shot on the spot) to go camping and check the deed of property on a plot that one of they acquired. In a short time, they will likely be terrorized by a cumbersome murderer with incredibly terrifying laughter. <br /> <br /> "Just Before Dawn" is visibly more ambitious, "artistic" and smarter than some slasher movies. Lieberman actually stuffs the characters - at least two of them anyway - as much as a 90-minute film will allow. The film has real moments of suspense and tension, and actually abstains from graphic gore, except for a murder at the very beginning. <br /> <br /> There is an above-average cast here, including Oscar winner George Kennedy, a ranger who has naturally become a little flaky for being alone in the desert since too long. Jack Lemmon's son, Chris, Brian De Palma's future regular, Gregg Henry, blonde actress Deborah Benson (it's a pity she's not a better-known performer, judging by her work here), Ralph Seymour ("Ghoulies"), Mike Kellin ("Sleepaway Camp") and Jamie Rose ("Chopper Chicks in Zombietown") complete the cast. <br /> <br /> Some of the clich√©s are interesting and the music score of Brad Feidel (now the best known) for his theme "Terminator") is obsessive and atmospheric. <br /> <br /> It is worth it to be drawn to the important scenario reversal that occurs after about an hour, although for a moment about 75 minutes involving heroin and a tree and the killer is almost comical; this can actually remind the viewer of a cartoon! One of the most clever is the final sending of the murderer, which I had never seen before in a horror movie and I probably will not see again. <br /> <br /> I did not give him 10 out of 10 because I can not honestly be so scared. But it's still an interesting slasher that deserves to be rediscovered. <br /> <br /> "This act does not mean anything, son, these mountains can not read." <br /> <br /> 9 / ten
