One of the most successful shows in the history of television is back. Now, I admit that I have never been in the original series ... Well, I have never looked at it at all. But the new series is impressive. <br /> <br /> Sci-Fi presented the first two episodes, "Rose" and "The End of the World", this weekend. We meet Rose, a twenty-year-old employee who is being chased by remote-controlled mannequins. She is saved by a mysterious stranger called the doctor. Using the Internet, she finds a conspiracy lover who warns her that death will ensue wherever the doctor goes. When his geek boyfriend, Mickey, is replaced by an impostor, the Doctor informs him of a plot to use the Earth as fertile ground for most of these plastic monsters, which he fought in time and time. space, traveling in a Tardis disguised telephone booth style police. <br /> <br /> She helps him save the world - otherwise there would be no show - and decides to join him. But when he puts his life in danger, he is upset and wonders if his company was worth the risk. <br /> <br /> Although the special effects are a little lame and some scenes are a little hectic, "Doctor Who" is (after two episodes aired in the United States) an intelligent and well written work. Apparently, the second season has already aired in the UK so I predict the same success here.
