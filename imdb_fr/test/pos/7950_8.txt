How would you feel if you only had a few weeks to live? This film helps you know through the eyes of a guy who is facing this situation. He is said with sympathy and without much emotion. Some might think it's rather slow - but I think that adds to the realism of the film. Some might see this as a love story, but I think it's secondary to his last days through his eyes. The loves of his life are part of the end of his life and give him more impact. Light and sweet, the film tells the story in the same way as life. Without clich√©s and with unexpected events on bottom of pass. If you love your movies with realistic emotional sweetness, this may be for you.
