The tracking of this image will only grow over time. Better than all the best candidates for a photo in 1997, it rewards repeated viewing. I have seen it three times now, so I know. Anderson has been compared to some of the great American directors (Altman, Scorcese, Tarantino) and he may have these influences, but it is likely that after a few extra films, he will be considered part of this short list. <br /> One last word: Julianne Moore's "Amber Waves" will resonate in memory long after the other characters of the film of the 90s have erased. The best performance of the year - in none of the four categories.
