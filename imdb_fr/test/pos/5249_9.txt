It's an extraordinary film musically. I felt horribly wrong that Rodrigues died in 1999, even before I could see it live. To know that she performed a wonderful Lincoln Ctr. concert in 1991 and that I may have been there, but it was not painful beyond words. <br /> <br /> I just bought my first Amalia recording. Although the music recording is fantastic, in this film, being able to SEE her face and her tremendous expressiveness and passion as she sings those songs of terrible sadness is wonderful. It's a bit like seeing the face of Mary rocking Jesus in her arms in the Pieta. Watching it at the cinema reminded me to witness a similar extraordinary Mercedes Sosa concert in the mid-90s at Lincoln Ctr. Listening to Mercedes singing, I felt in the presence of an extraordinary spiritual and musical strength, which contained an impressive primal power. Some segments of the music of "The Art of Amalia" are touching, such as Caetano Veloso paying homage to Amalia and singing one of her solo songs in front of a crowded concert hall. The music segments also reflect the incredible international sweep of her musical repertoire and the connections she has created with w. fans around the world. There is a segment in which she claims to have played in all cities in Italy that have a scene! <br /> <br /> In another section, Amalia talks about her fight. mouth cancer and how she came to New York to commit suicide in a hotel. Yet, watching Fred Astaire's films, she gradually became convinced that life was worth living and she turned away from killing herself. Unbelievable! Later in the film, she very bravely and directly confesses to the interviewer that if she had conquered the world musically, her personal life was one of pure sadness. She admits she has never been happy. It's unbearably sad to hear that, but I really want to keep w. A singer imbued with the fado tradition (which translates as "bad destiny" or "bad luck"). In addition, we can not wait to learn more about her personal life: what made her so sad? what were his disappointments? <br /> <br /> "The Art of Amalia" is a little disappointing in other important areas. My disadvantages: show 20 to 30 complete songs in the film, but only provide a translation into English for the last, seems to be a loss (unless the film is intended for a Portuguese audience, which I can not imagine ). Seeing the deep pain on her face as she sings and not understanding the lyrics is a disappointment. Regarding the other disadvantages: there is virtually no biographical documentation on Amalia's family history. There is a 20 sec. extract w. she sings w. his mother (it's absolutely grandiose). There is a brief reference to his parents who move fr. the campaign in Lisbon. I would have loved to see a movie from the village where she came from. The interviews as they are are almost solely w. Amalia herself (and some close friends). It's a good subject, but not great. There are no interview subjects who are experts in Fado or Portuguese culture and society, so we have no deep understanding of his musical roots. <br /> <br /> In short, it's a wonderful film that anyone interested in Amalia should see. But it is not a perfect or definitive work on the subject.
