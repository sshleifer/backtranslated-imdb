One of the best "guy" movies I've ever seen must be the wind and the lion. Gad, the scenes ... <br /> <br /> Raisouli bandits swarm on the wall ... An enduring British gentleman calmly raises tea with Candice Bergen and drops three with a Webley revolver in his coat . A whisper of the ghost of the Empire ... Let's not forget! Lest we forget! <br /> <br /> U.S. Marines disembarking from long and long gone _Brooklyn_. They wore Krags, it should have been Lees, but, oh wow. And the Winchester 97 is making big holes among stubborn natives and even more stubborn and unfaithful Europeans ... <br /> <br /> Raisouli - Sean Connery, wow! Wow! ... wondering "What kind of weapon does Roosevelt use?" <br /> <br /> Teddy Roosevelt - Brian Keith, oh yes! "he asked" What kind of Raisouli pistol does he use? "and writing yet another letter of anger to Winchester about the stock of his Winchester 95. <br /> <br /> Raisouli, armed with a sword ... A Prussian cavalry officer, holding his gun and firing his sword ... Honor, it's something dead, a world gone, but Raisouli would never have flown a plane filled with children in a building ... <br /> <br /> Milious at top of the wonders of Milious, and on DVD.
