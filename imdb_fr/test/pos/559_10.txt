I saw this movie last night on HBO and I did not expect to become addicted: I usually fall asleep when I watch HBO. But it happened and you too. It is a tragic documentary (winner of an Oscar 2002) on the murder of an elderly tourist in Jacksonville, Florida, as well as the investigation, arrest and trial of a 15-year-old boy. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie today and get an idea of ​​how we have progressed as a society. This film deserved an esteemed Oscar - you will be moved to tears.
