I'm not one to like these cartoons (eg, Pokemon, Dragonball Z, Naruto), but Zatch Bell is different in my opinion. Zatch Bell is more exciting, has better characters and does not focus as much on some kind of weapon or Mamodo as much as the episodes I've seen, such as the episodes "Big Brother Kanchome", "Zatch vs. Kiyo" .Zatch Bell really focuses on the life of the strange Zatch, the Smart Kiyo, the Clueless Suzy, and the WeIrD Ponygon.Zatch Bell is probably my favorite cartoon for the moment, but I encourage others to watch 1 episode, you will surely love it! <br /> <br /> -Robbie H.
