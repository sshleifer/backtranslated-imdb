When this movie was released in 1995, I found it incredibly good. Especially with Sandra Bullock. After watching his brilliant performance in Speed, I was ready to watch any of his films. <br /> <br /> Back to the Net, it was a movie that keeps you in suspense.All, I enjoyed so I give him a **** on *****.
