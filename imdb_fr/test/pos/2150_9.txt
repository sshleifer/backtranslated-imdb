This small, hard-to-see picture was presented at the Mods & Rockers 2007 festival. It's a wonderful and affectionate look at Harry Nilsson, who uses many famous faces that pass interviews, rarely seen television shows and behind-the-scenes footage of Nilsson at work. There are even some shots of "Son Of Dracula". This film is the latest and fitting tribute to one of the most beautiful voices, the most intelligent songwriter and the funniest man of popular music. It is a crime that the name of this man is not as well known as some of the songs he has written and / or performed. His friends tell incredibly funny stories about this talented Hulk with a subconscious desire for self-destruction. As a bonus, you'll even have Eric Idle performing the song written for Nilsson's last album in the closing credits. It's funny, it's sad. This is not in general version. If this image is playing anywhere near you, see it!
