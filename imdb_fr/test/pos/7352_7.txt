Okay, "pretty good" does not scream, but I was surprised at how much I enjoyed Campfire Tales. While this is by no means a classic, the directors involved have some idea of ​​the suspense. Fears do not fall on you, but the directors rely on the climatic moments. The film is based on popular urban legends and ghost stories. The editors have pretty well updated the tales and twisted them just enough so that the usual endings still have punch. The best shorts are "The Honeymoon" and "People Can Lick Too", I enjoyed both, because they have a good suspense throughout each story. "The Locket" was a good ghost story and the summary of "The Campfire" is very good too, with the difference that there are too many twists in the end. The only disappointing segment is "The Hook", which is good because it is quite short anyway. Overall, I give it a 7 out of 10. There is suspense, which is lacking in most horror films today, and a good acting. This may not be the case with Halloween and The Exorcist, but it's a good little movie that is well worth the price of a rental.
