044: The Big Trail (1930) - published on 24/10/1930; accessed 4/5/06. <br /> <br /> BIRTHS: Richard Harris, Harold Pinter and Robert Atkins. <br /> <br /> DOUG: In Hollywood, Raoul Walsh unveiled his latest film, The Big Trail, a western-looking western on the other side of the border, featuring actor John Wayne, aged 23 years old. In 1930, we see many "firsts" but few "better" ones. In addition to the first John Wayne movie, here we have the first widescreen movie (although we only watched the full frame version). It is interesting to note that the decision to film on the big screen was essentially the same reason why the big screen became popular later: to compete with television, which had not yet appeared in the trade but remained an emerging curiosity. Still, this movie was extremely good, giving us a heartbreaking look at trekking in Oklahoma. The opening title cards let us know that this is a western of the most traditional type, about America, the land, who should live there, etc., and that it is an excellent demonstration. Walsh offers us amazing images of the wagon company in the desert (when they reach a cliff, they have to chain each wagon one by one), and we also get a secondary plot of revenge involving Wayne chasing the man who killed a of his friends. (I think I remember something similar in Stagecoach). Wayne's cowboy routine is at least partly there and will certainly evolve in the following movies. Since this film represents all of Wayne's work in the early 30s for the Odyssey, we will not see his face again until Stagecoach, but once we see him, we'll see him until the end of the Odyssey and beyond. <br /> <br /> KEVIN: Ah, our first western sound and John Wayne's lead role. It's Raoul Walsh's The Big Trail. This review will be short because I've been watching it for weeks. I enjoyed this movie, but it was far from being a masterpiece. The generally predictable adventure has had some surprises, such as when the brain of the bad guys, Red Flack (Tyrone Power Sr. in his last role) is killed mid-way; I thought he'd be the boss at the end, but it was finally Bill Thorpe (Ian Keith). I remember I did not like the way Breck (Wayne) kills Thorpe and takes revenge in the end. I understood that this was what he was supposed to do in the story, but I did not really like his reasoning when he tells Ruth why he should do it. I think he had a much greater responsibility for the hundreds of settlers he drove in the hard west. <br /> <br /> Last film viewed: Animal Crackers (1930). Last chronological film: Soup to Nuts (1930). Next film: The Golden Age (1930).
