It seems to me that many people do not know that Blade is actually a superhero movie comparable to X-Men, Daredevil, Punisher and others. All these heroes (and in the case of the group of heroes X-Men) have this in common that they were all conceived in the magical world of Marvel. Blade was originally a normal person (in a blue outfit) who hunted vampires because of a personal grudge and ended up fighting Dracula himself and he was for lack of a better word boring. So boring in fact that the character has been put aside and has never been used in the Marvel universe. At least until it's reinvented. <br /> <br /> David Goyer made a genius gesture by taking the character of Blade and transforming him into a black knight dressed in leather. He can not accept all the merit and much of that must also go to Stephen Norrington who, with his distinct visual style, brings out the best of the character. The character of Blade (Wesley Snipes) is pretty amazing in this film and mixes martial arts and Batman as darkness. Snipes is very good as a main character and manages to bring out the character's duality and inner demons. He is, however, a fairly rigid actor, both in voice and posture, and is only interesting enough for a film (which is clearly seen from the lower sequences). Kris Kristofferson is also good and gives life to the tormented character of Whistler with energy and sense of timing. Bushe Wright, however, is quite weak as a main woman making her character relatively flat and lifeless. Donal Logue is quite funny and manages to do a lot of things with a minor character. Also worthy of mention is the German Udo Kier, who brings a lot of finesse and style to the vampire race, probably born from his experiences as a Dracula player. Stephen Dorf plays the best actor in the film and his scary performance as a deacon Frost is one of the best screen villains I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> The story is good and, in my opinion, renews the genre vampire (something that has not been done since Robert Rodrigues's From Dusk Till Dawn) by adding many contemporary elements and in now the atmosphere of comics. Saying that the movie has a comic feel does not mean that the movie is unrealistic. Far from there. Many efforts have been made to make the film look as real as possible. Including effects that are good enough for their time. I found the "dusting" of the vampire very pleasant. Instead of adding a lot of blood when a vampire dies, Norrington chooses to let the vampires disappear spontaneously, which is great. The fact that the overall effects have been well done adds to the credibility of the film that otherwise would have fallen flat. <br /> <br /> As stated earlier, Norrington has a very distinct visual style that sets him apart from the other directors of the following Blade films. Del Toro is almost as qualified but I prefer Norrington's style. His style gives the film a very special look and feel, but most of all, it gives the atmosphere of the film. A very tense dark atmosphere that works very well in harmony with the main character and the story. In addition to the visual style, the music works well and adds a lot to the atmosphere of the film. <br /> <br /> In summary, Blade is a very entertaining film that probably should have had an 8 on my part, but a few annoying flaws (which can not be revealed without spoiling the film, suffice it to say that many of them are near the end of the film) cause the film to be adjusted with a high 7. <br /> 7 / ten
