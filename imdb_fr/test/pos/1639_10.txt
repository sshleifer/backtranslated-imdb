Ok, it was just great. I hope the rest of season 1 has been so strong. He really needed more episodes like this one. <br /> <br /> The distribution worked perfectly, even if they were nothing at all during the day. The writing was fantastic, as was the editing. Excellent work in all accounts. <br /> <br /> The episode was thrilling, suspenseful and let you guess until the end. This is what most MOTW episodes had tried, but had failed so far. <br /> <br /> The first episode FIVE stars for me. Really good, almost like a movie. I did not even remember that it was so good. I think it's even better than the big horror movie called "The Thing".
