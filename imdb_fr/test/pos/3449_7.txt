This film has a lot to recommend. The paintings, music and naked buttocks of David Hewlett are all beautiful! Intrigue, a story of redemption, forgiveness and courage in the face of adversity is also very interesting and touching - and not predictable, which speaks volumes about a movie nowadays. But, the acting is mediocre, the direction is confused and the script is just strange. I often had the impression of trying to be a parody, but I never understood what it was to try to be a parody * of *. And if it's not a parody, well, he's still a movie with a huge potential that he did not realize.
