It is a profound and moving work on the creation of art, which is uniquely human and can not be produced by nature, the cost of genius and the search for transcendence and what ultimately constitutes the family. that is to say all of us. I was very moved by Nathaniel's family discussion with his sisters about their father's weaknesses, which took place in a beautiful house that seemed to radiate the heat created by Lou. And although Esther seems so cold in her discussion of Lou's inability to make money, you can understand how much she has had to counterbalance her impulses at many points in her life. Nathaniel did a great job showing how everyone in Lou's life was integrating and completing it, becoming as much a part of his job as his own genius. Yes, or perhaps most importantly, our failures make us what we are. And of course, there are the buildings. I only knew Lou Kahn by name and I did not really associate his name with his work, it's a proof of grace. Maybe one day there will be a building where we will all go, and it will certainly look like a Lou Kahn building, perhaps the undeveloped temple of Jerusalem. Maybe there is salvation
