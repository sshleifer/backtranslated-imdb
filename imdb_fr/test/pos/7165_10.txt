A sad reality of post-Soviet Russia is that the well-being of the people has not changed much since Soviet times. As we can see in "Window to Paris", most people are still so depressed, while they are encouraged to go after the money. <br /> <br /> Then everything changes for the music teacher Nikolai Chizhov (Sergei Dontsov) after he finds a window that leads to Paris. He and his friends are naturally surprised by what they find. This movie has one of the funniest discussions about Elvis Presley and Edith Piaf I've ever heard. So watch this movie. You are sure to love him. It is sort of a forerunner of "Being John Malkovich".
