Walter Matthau is best remembered for the long series of comedies he did with his equal comedy partner, Jack Lemmon, from THE FORTUNE COOKIE at THE ODD COUPLE II. But people tend to forget that in the late 1970s he appeared with another partner in two films - a female partner. It was Glenda Jackson, the English double Oscar winner, who demonstrated her comedic skills against Matthau for the first time in HOUSE CALLS, then in HOPSCOTCH. Matthau's role was slightly larger in both films, as his characters were more central in the storylines, but the chemistry between them was pretty good. If you ever want to see two pros show how crazy sex can be, watch Walter and Glenda play Charley Nicholson and Ann Atkinson to see if two people could have sex on a bed under the law. old film code rule of both parties each having one leg on the floor! Never has sex been seen from a clinical and mechanical point of view. <br /> <br /> Matthau's Charlie has just been widowed before the movie started. He had only one woman in his life, his wife. So now he is the eligible single. He is also the main surgeon at the hospital where he works, but the chief surgeon is Dr. Amos Weatherby (Art Carney). Carney is apparently senile (there are moments later in the film that show he turns on and off his senility - see the scene where he crushes Richard Benjamin's car). Amos must be re-elected (Charlie is his closest competitor for the job - if he wants to). However, Amos manages to convince Charlie to let him keep his job for reasons of self-esteem. <br /> <br /> One day, Charlie notices Ann in the hospital. She had a slight accident and sat in bed, but Amos put her in a cage like a device (which Charlie has been noticing for over 20 years). He gets her out of the camera and romance soon. She joins the hospital staff, but she criticizes Charlie's willingness to respond to Amos' needs and some of the selfish tendencies she sees in the hospital's doctors. <br /> <br /> The difficulties faced by Amos cause the death of a wealthy hospital boss (Lloyd Gough), owner of a baseball team (his biggest innovation being the separate admission costs for double headers). Amos tries to calm the young widow of the owner of the team by delivering the eulogy to the funeral service (the line in the summary above is the line of peroration of the eulogy). However, she is still determined to continue (her lawyer, Thayer David, says the hospital is the most incompetent he has ever seen). Amos suggests that Charlie convince the widow to convince her of this expensive lawsuit. But how will react to that? The film is quite entertaining and has been so successful that in addition to giving Jackson and Matthau a sequel, it has also led to a television series.
