Of Slaughter's two films, it's the best and even if it's hardly a complex Schindlers list, it's really funny. All men are good or bad and women are only Hos and are emotionally in need, for example Slaughters Girl. It's also very funny and The Pro must be the funniest pimp of all time, you can not do without these hats, purple suits, gold chains and patois jones forever. The best part is where he has the harem around him: "Make yourself a whore, UNNASTAN". Everything about him is larger than life and reminds of Morris Day in Purple Rain. Jim Brown also proves that he is a private cock for all the girls and that he once again knocked the white ass in all directions. The scene of the car is very unrealistic that they survive unscathed, but hey it is the cinema. Certainly the best blax movie and he surpasses Shaft (1971). Even the first film is very good.
