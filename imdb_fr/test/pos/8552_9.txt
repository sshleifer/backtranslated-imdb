Living in Romania, the very realistic setting of the scenes and the great care given to local details by the director almost amazed me. Anthony Queen's performance is absolutely fantastic and the rest of the cast is doing a great job supporting it. The film takes a little knowledge of the East-European context to be fully appreciated, but it still remains an excellent performance with some memorable lines. the end is perhaps a bit too melodramatic, but it's actually the way people are in this part of the world. The scenario is excellent because it presents the horrors of the Second World War in the most original way possible - no blood, no battlefield. Still, lives are broken and the smiles you get from time to time throughout the film are quickly killed by the realities of the war that affect the characters.
