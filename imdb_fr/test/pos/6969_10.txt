Ghoulies IV is perhaps not the best of the series, but it's not so bad. If you do not take it seriously, you will enjoy it. <br /> <br /> It's nice to see Peter Liapis come back as Johnathan Graves, who stopped using magic and became a detective, but still thinks about what happened in Ghoulies. <br /> <br /> The plot tells the story of a woman named Alexandra, Johnathan's ex-girlfriend, who breaks into a museum takes a red gem, using the gem she wake up his boyfriend named Faust who is the dark side of Johnathan but he needs the gem to enter the real world and John is sent to hell. <br /> <br /> Something is wrong and Alex loses the gem, so she must find a new one, because she leaves the bridge that is still open and two small Ghoulies, Lite and Drak, appear. These are not real Ghoulies, because they look like guys in Troll costume wearing a mask, but it does not matter, because they are humorous in places. <br /> <br /> Lite and Dark must find Johnathan as he can. bring them home so they cause chaos as they try to find Johnathan. Another difference is that the two Ghoulies are good, unlike those of previous films. <br /> <br /> I found Ghoulies IV very good, but this movie may not please everyone, check if you like bass. low budget movies like Troll 2.
