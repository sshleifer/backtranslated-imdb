The best thing that can be said about the movie "Traffic" is that it has drawn attention to the British mini-series "Traffik". As many people have noted, the current film suffers from the impossibility of telling the story to account for the short attention span of viewers and the processing time of movie theater owners, who measure success. of a movie by overpriced food sales. <br /> <br /> I recorded this mini series for the first time in 1990, after its broadcast on public television. The entire series of documentary style is deeply tragic and doomed because the characters are all heading towards their destiny. The most powerful of the three stories is that of the Pakistani family forced on the city to find a way to keep the body and soul together after the poppy was burned by the army during a show of force organized for the benefit of men. Western policies. The family's difficulties are similar to those of the family of "City of Joy" rickshaw extractors. The farmer ends up finding work, but he compromises his pride and honesty. <br /> <br /> The Pakistani part of the film is of particular importance for today, with the fight against the supporters of Al Quaeda, and helps to better understand the support for such movements among the poor in Pakistan. and Afghanistan, who rarely receive money that would go to these countries. The film highlights that farmers only barely see 25% of aid, which is supposed to encourage them to grow other crops. <br /> <br /> The inability of the United States to see anything other than the black and white - the good guys against the bad guys - it's interesting to see another view where there is no black and white , only shades of gray. <br /> <br /> Spoiler possible to come. My only problem with the story was that, rather than continuing as before, as in real life, it was a fiction, we had to finish with the "bad guys" to know what was waiting for them. Apart from that, it was a beautiful work of the kind that we see too rarely. The cast was exceptional and the German and Pakistani venues helped give the film a "different" feel (what a change it made to see the Germans as not so bad in a World War II film).
