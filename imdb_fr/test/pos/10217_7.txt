Let me say right away that I'm not a particular fan of this kind of film, but Nightbreed fascinates me with a message about perspective. <br /> <br /> At the time, people who lived in Midian would have been called Zombies, the undead. And according to what Clive Barker has given us to some members of humanity, Craig Sheffer was born with the potential to become a part of this world. <br /> <br /> Psychiatrist David Cronenberg first looks like a mild and moderate professional. Has a fanatical mission to rid the world of the Nightbreed. He incites the police to kill Sheffer, but Sheffer goes to a cemetery called Midian, where the Nightbreed gather and live underground. <br /> <br /> Sheffer also left a girlfriend, Anne Bobby, who still has feelings for him, even after his death, and is now part of the undead. She tries in her way to be a bridge with humanity. <br /> <br /> The creatures of Clive Barker look a lot like macabre beings and do not particularly like humans. But it's obvious that if humans leave them alone, the Nightbreed does not bother them too. <br /> <br /> Your sympathies are definitely going to the Nightbreed, especially after seeing a fanatic like Cronenberg and redneck police chief Charles Haid action. <br /> <br /> Clive Barker has been a gay man for some time and some have suggested to me that Nightbreed was a metaphor for homosexuals. I can see where it would come from, especially since there are many people who do not even see gays as human beings because they are taught this way. <br /> <br /> Granted Nightbreed is rather bloody. with a lot of gratuitous violence, but it also makes you think and I like how Clive Barker overturns traditional theology and makes Craig Sheffer a kind of messiah for Nightbreed creatures.
