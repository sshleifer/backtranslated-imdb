Hmmmm. I am a little lost here. I mean, I know that I loved Death Bed, I know that I would spread the gospel of Death Bed to all my friends and acquaintances, and if you read this, I urge you to see Death Bed, but I can not really say why. This is perhaps the secret of its charm. <br /> <br /> Land? Well, sort of. There is this bed that eats people (and fried chicken, apples, flowers, suitcases and anything else sacred that approaches) by sucking them inside his mattress filled with digestive fluid. Among his almost unlimited powers, Bed has the ability to keep Aubrey Beardsley's mind behind an image to watch and tell the film's events. Various people then meet in the abandoned Bed Manor (Bed's habit of eating anything that moves gave the place a bad name), and lie down to make love, take a nap or because that they feel bad and are being eaten. sometimes having trippy dreams first. And in the end we have the explosive final confrontation between Beardsley, Bed's mother (you must have been there), and Bed. <br /> <br /> That sounds pretty simple, when I say it like that, does not it - well, except for the Aubrey Beardsley part. But something seems constantly shifted, and the story seems to slide from one scene to another, even when one indulges in cheap laughs or strange gore effects. Imagine that Bunel is crossed with Bergman, then left in a large ferry from Herschell Gordon Lewis. The tone of the story goes from horror to fairy tale, comedy, existential meditation, without slowing down - an incredible achievement for a non-budget student film shot in the Detroit area. <br /> <br /> All in all this, a breathtaking little movie that, most likely, no review can ever do justice completely. See for yourself.
