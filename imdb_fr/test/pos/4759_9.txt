I was born in '68 with little parental supervision over what I watched on television (in the '70s). I always liked this movie (and the French Connection) and I always tried to catch it every time it was turned on (check the Sunday TV guide in advance). I bought it on DVD a few years ago and I have watched it twice since then, and I must say that I still loved it !!!! Roy S. was a great actor of the 70s (Jaws is one of my favorites, Marathon Man, etc.) and, although the 7-ups movie is not an Oscar-worthy movie, it places you precisely in a , early 70's, just like French Connection) and gives you some awesome characters and a glimpse of cop's life back then. And yes, the car chase is one of the best ever.
