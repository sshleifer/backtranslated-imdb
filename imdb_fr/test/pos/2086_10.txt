This film was full of suspense and was well done, the black and white effect made it a great mystery. Fay Emerson (Hilda Fenchurch), twice married to famous musician Skitch Henderson and son of Elliott Roosevelt (son of FDR), fell in love with Zachary Scott (Ronnie Mason / Marsh). Ronnie wins the hearts of all the ladies in the photo, even Mona Freeman (Anne Fenchurch) and proposes marriage whenever he can. Rosemary DeCamp (Dr. Jane Silla) (famous television actress in the small cities of the 30s and 40s) warned the ladies of the sick spirit of Ronnie Mason and the violent childhood he had when she had grown up, which had caused his love / hate relationship with women. Fay Emerson and Zachary Scott would have been big stars with more rewarding roles, but their lives were short. This film is beyond criticism, it is a very great classic film of 1945 that many generations have been able to see and appreciate!
