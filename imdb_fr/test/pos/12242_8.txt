Spoiler alert <br /> <br /> I have never seen any comments on a movie, I disagree with more than the comments made by people about it. We could learn critical views of this film. As an educational film, I like it a lot because it teaches "how to succeed"! We do not watch movies to learn; we usually look for entertainment. As entertainment, I rate it low: the end is dark and intellectual / cerebral. This conflict translates into my eight stars. The film follows Jane Craig (Holly Hunter), a television news producer. The network executive presents Tom Grunnick (William Hurt), who will be studying for the live news presenter position. Tom immediately charms people with humility. Another potential news presenter has been waiting for years for his opportunity on the air, Aaron Altman (Albert Brooks). Altman knows all the reports, inside and out. <br /> <br /> The head of the network wants Grunnick on the air and Jane argues, saying that Grunnick is not ready, he does not know the news. They do not listen to him. Forced to put Grunnick on the air, Jane contacts Altman for news and retransmits Altman's comments in an earpiece at Grunnick while Grunnick speaks. We see the contrast between Altman / Jane Craig's words and Grunnick's, as Grunnick cleverly reworked everything that Altman and Jane Craig say in her ear to make it understandable, sympathetic and entertaining. Altman has a chance on the air and network leaders are forcing him to seek help from Grunnick, the new guy. This new guy (news engineer) trains him? This is something that Altman does not see as justified, but reluctantly agrees. <br /> <br /> Grunnick trains Altman and is enthusiastic about noting hundreds of flaws in appearance, sound and vocabulary. Altman had never considered these things before, when he became an expert on news. The complexity of understanding what Grunnick taught him causes Altman to have a panic sweat attack ("Flop Sweat") while on the air. Grunnick eventually became the main anchor of the network and Altman resigned before being fired. But Grunnick fails in her attempt at love with Jane Craig, as she discovers from Altman, that Grunnick sometimes simulates the circumstances to make people look like him. This disables it. It sends the message that in relationships, we want authentic people who do not try to make us like them. <br /> <br /> This film sends the message that making people appreciate you is the most important skill in a job, but this is especially true in Broadcast News. There are many who say it is the abandonment of TV News and that Grunnick is a handsome guy, but silly or any style, but without substance. The opposite is true: Grunnick possessed very complex skills and intellect to get people to love him, including the mental presence of knowing exactly how he appears and what he sounds, when he is filmed (he trains Altman to give a word in each sentence). The Grunnick flaw that costs him the relationship with Jane Craig, is that he is too motivated to be friendly and will simulate a situation. Many people call Altman very smart or brilliant. Altman played by Brookes is not as smart as Grunnick and the "Flop Sweat" scene shows that his mind can not handle Grunnick's on-air complexity. Altman is irritated by the fact that he knows the news and Grunnick has succeeded more by making people love him. There are also people who say that these things are exclusive to the TV news industry. The concept that winning friends is the most important skill in a job is obviously not popular, but my experience shows that this is the case in most jobs. As an education on how to succeed, this film is fantastic, although unpopular. Educational, yes, but it has no uplifting end.
