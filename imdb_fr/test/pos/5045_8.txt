"Autumn Spring" tells the misadventures of a Czech-style pilgrim with a walrus face, about 78 years old, who misleadingly deceives and mischievous all those who know him with his evil ways while his wife organizes his funeral meticulously. The centerpiece Hana (Brodsk√Ω) shows us how to get babies to kiss you when you're 78 and how to feel good in an elevator and to be thanked for this gesture. He walks his way day after day in that warm, glowing look. The creative, amusing, but socially unacceptable ways a man enjoys life while refusing to be relegated to the old man's house. "Autumn Spring" is a subtle comedy with messages for all ages that will appeal to more mature foreign moviegoers. (B +)
