Unlike some of the old commentators, I was (and still are) a big fan of the Carpenters. Face to face, Christmas would never be Christmas without the carpenters. That said, I think the film has described Karen's life, but not her excellent. The movie was nice to watch on TV in prime time, but the content was a bit short. I suggest that you all consider getting some of the Carpenters special offers presented in the 1970s. You can not believe how much Karen was a great thresher. Cynthia did not capture the extent of Karen's talent. In addition, Karen was beautiful but had a bad hairdresser. My choice for playing Karen is Hilary Swank. I'd love to see a more detailed story, because Karen had more to tell than when we listened. We've just started. I have tons of new music from Carpenters, and it's absolutely excellent. (His California Dreamin song is to die for).
