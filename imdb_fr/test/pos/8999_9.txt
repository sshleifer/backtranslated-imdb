I think many of the American baseball movies are among the best films ever made. When this film was in production and heard, it was described as a rugby film. I had read articles about the Highland team in the newspapers, but I did not expect much from this film about a sport that did not interest me. <br /> <br /> Last night, I watched it "on demand". and loved it almost as much as my favorite baseball movies. Ryan Little and the actors and the team did an amazing job. Neil McDonough was particularly convincing. As a "bad father", he showed great finesse and a bow of subtle but moving characters. <br /> <br /> I also appreciated the island players of the Pacific. I was fortunate to know many of these people so well and this film captures their spirit and wonderful culture. A look back at how the Islanders' culture became a key element of the Highland team would have been a great addition to the film. <br /> <br /> Some rather dubious films were recently shot in Utah. It's good to see a quality film like this one from Beehive State.
