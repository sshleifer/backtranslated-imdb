I have been watching Attack Of The Show religiously for about 6 months (maybe more, but not much). Olivia fascinated me a lot and I found Kevin very witty and the repertoire between them very good. Lately although it is starting to wear thin due to many factors for me. My first favorite segment is the first 15 minutes called Around The Net, which contains 5 video clips that you'll find on a site like Youtube, which are usually fun, or people inadvertently hurt (some intentionally). Uh, when we look at it 4 to 5 times a week, we see the same thing again and again, I really did not see anything so beautiful and I can only laugh at people who break their necks and are paralyzed at many times. Colbert Report wants to be with his politics too, if you do not live in a blue state and you're not an automatic liberal, that humor is getting old too, McCain is old, yeah yeah, whatever. Libs do not have the courage to make fun of themselves, because they are not smart enough to realize that they would be delighted to have a sense of humor that allows them to make fun of themselves. themselves. So we have the same old vids of wounded people that we are supposed to keep laughing at, then a leftist political humor who never laughs at himself by his own weakness. I will keep watching since I look at work and that's it, hoping I'll be entertained, but it's getting a little old. I liked the replacements of Chris and Alison, they changed in fact of rhythm. maybe this show could make the host rotate. Olivia, who at first was really funny at first, has resorted to this constant pouting reaction and she is getting older, lol. 7 out of 10; this will keep you in a young state of mind, which is good if you are a baby boomer like me (mid-forties). Maybe a caricature of the day would be another segment they should be doing because they could use a ton of things.
