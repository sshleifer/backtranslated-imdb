I have no more words to describe the beauty of "Cranes fly", but I will still try to write about it. It is a powerful and delicate love story that takes its place in the Second World War. This is the classic story of lovers (Boris & Veronika) separated by war and what separates them. The images in the film are so beautiful that you will be carried away - the technique of the film is in perfect harmony with the emotion. <br /> <br /> Few scenes directly represent the war: A bombardment - wind, lightning, explosions - which will have important consequences on the life of the main protagonist, Veronika, who is waiting for the return of Boris; and there is another scene on the front where we will be confronted with an emotional / visual hurricane showing images played in Boris' mind. Another scene is the leitmotiv of the film and gives its title: cranes flying in the sky. This image symbolizes nature and its seasons and highlights the film's latest message: Do not lose hope and fight for a better future. <br /> <br /> Kalatozov is a great director, this film is visually beautiful and it also deeply touched me. It's not just pure technique. <br /> <br /> Tatyana Samojlova is perfect as Veronika. What more can i say? The film transcends the time when it was shot - the action takes place during the Second World War. But it could have happened anytime, anywhere. As long as there are wars (big or small), the film and its message will remain relevant.
