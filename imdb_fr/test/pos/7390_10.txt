"It's funny, your worst nightmare always seems so far away!" <br /> <br /> The characters of Dark Habour, a married couple (Alan Rickman & Polly Hunter) and a vagabond (Norman Reedus), embark on a game full of hidden sexual energy and betrayal. Sometimes tempting breaks increase tension and leave plenty of room for interpretation. Good acting and a story that, if you do not use the brain, will leave you confused. You have to look at least twice. The very strength lies in its unconventional character and in Alan Rickman, of course. Those who love it will love this movie. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: This is not a typical movie in prime time, but it's done!
