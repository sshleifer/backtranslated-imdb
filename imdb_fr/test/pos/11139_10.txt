Good work! Was very exciting and had great stunts. A show that really rocked. It was a great job for everyone who worked on it; and especially the role of Bobbie Phillips. It would have been great on the big screen. Would like to see more of these movies of the week or maybe a weekly series. It was great entertainment and I'm glad I watched! By far the best of the three. Keep up the good work with UPN and Bobbie Phillips. I'm going to look for the next one.
