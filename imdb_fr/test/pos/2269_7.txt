"All is illuminated" is a simplified interpretation of something more than half of Jonathan Safran Foer's novel. This version focuses more on the changes that have taken place in Eastern Europe since the Second World War until the post-Cold War period and the bond that unites the younger generation in this story as a family memory. <br /> <br /> Liev Schreiber, first director / adapter, retains some of the romance and language conflicts of the novel, mainly thanks to the wonderful Eugene Hutz as a Ukrainian tour guide seduced by the United States. It is so catchy that the film becomes more his odyssey in his country and his family as he moves from his comfortable environment in sophisticated Odessa to the heart of a cynical and isolated country that has been ravaged by conquerors of the communists and now capitalists. , with both Jews and non-Jews as rubbish. As funny as his opening scenes are when he establishes his cheeky bravura, we later feel his fish out of the water in his own country when he tries to ask his way to the local yokels. <br /> <br /> Shreiber uses Elijah Wood, as an American tourist, as a cog in a visual array, because his character is less verbal than as one of the narrators of the book. He and Hutz play well until the conclusion becomes more sentimental in this simplified plot. Once the story of the grandfather has taken over in the last quarter of the film, wonderfully and unpredictably interpreted by Boris Leskin, the younger generation does not seem to suffer catharsis, because it has just arranged closure. <br /> <br /> Schreiber does a great job visualizing the human need to document history. Professor Yaffa Eliach is one of her advisors. His remembrance style of pre-Holocaust Shtetl life through artifacts clearly inspired the look. He is very powerful and efficient. <br /> The Czech Republic replaces Ukraine and production design staff have been able to find memorable symbols of change in cities, villages and countryside, because today it is mainly a road movie and long driving scenes hang around a bit. Schreiber retains some of the symbolism of the book, especially the moon and the river, but after cutting out the parts of the book that explain them, they look pretty or disturbing to the atmosphere and no longer represent the time nor fate. <br /> <br /> As W.C. Fields would have predicted, the dog steals most of his scenes for easy laughing. In general, Schreiber opts for more poetry than the book. It is irresistibly touching, especially for those who have not read the book, but less morally and emotionally messy. <br /> <br /> The film is enormously shot by its wonderful soundtrack, which includes songs and instruments from the Hutz manouche. on traditional tunes, on contemporary titles, on Paul Cantelon's Klezmer fusion score. <br /> <br /> This is not a film about the Holocaust in itself, but a kind of mirror image of the "lifestyle" that evokes the memory of a time charged with meaning, but which resonates more with those who have an emotional connection with this story.
