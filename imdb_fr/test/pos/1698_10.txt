Is it the full moon tonight? OH! No matter, they can change when they want this drug! What was I thinking if it's the full moon tonight ?! Damn <br /> <br /> I really like this film, there's romance, suspense, horror and hot stuff;) I love the first half of the movie when the guy avoids the girl to kill herself by throwing herself to the rubber band and catching it. It was very cool. The decor of this film is in the city of love which is Paris in France. The graveyard scenes are nice, it gives you chills not to know what's going to happen or who's behind the walls. The scenes that make you jump from your seat are really cool. Even they had me on these scenes. His friend who died and the girl he killed in the graveyard but still shows up as the main character (sorry for missing his name) were really funny. The actors did a good job as well as the makeup teams. The party when they're all partying in an abandoned church, I can not believe people would do it because even though it's an abandoned church, it's still God's house. I bought this movie a long time ago and I do not regret it. I am a fan of horror movies. I give this film 5 stars out of 6. For people who are open and who likes movies like this one, try it, you might like it.
