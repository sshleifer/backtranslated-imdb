For the most part, love movies are never my cup of tea. But Valley Girl is one of the few love movies that I can not only watch but also enjoy. Nicholas Cage is awesome in her first role and Deborah Foreman is cute beyond belief. There are side stories that tend to get confused, but not enough to diminish this movie.
