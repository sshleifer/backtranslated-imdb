Nobody said that in "The Big Trail" and I thought it would be natural. Nevertheless, it was one of the best westerns I've seen and I'm a big fan of Gunsmoke horses and movies. The scope and user-friendliness of this image are simply breathtaking and, as one person mentioned in his commentary, it resembles the 3-camera triptych of "Napoleon" (1927). Nowadays, the cost of production and, in particular, distribution by the thousands would be prohibitive, but Raoul Walsh did his job. <br /> <br /> The cast was excellent, though John Wayne was better when he just bragged around. In particular, Tyrone Power, Sr. was a perfect villain - I had never seen him before and it was his only talking picture. Ian Keith was a snake, but El Brendel is an acquired taste like comic relief. It can be funny or boring, but especially the latter - and it shows up at the most inappropriate moments. <br /> <br /> It's a bit too long and it took some time for the Indians to introduce themselves, but is also close to a documentary about the obvious destiny and as faithful to life as you will see and a must for moviegoers, whatever their preference. By the time the settlers arrived in California, I was exhausted.
