After reading some of the uncomfortable remarks of earlier, I had to put my two sous. This show was NOT, despite what Essex's idiot thinks, the worst thing ever on television. I think most current TV shows are much worse (when will that stupid "reality" in fashion end?) And there's no show I can handle. Give me the stuff I grew up with. I am a 1965 baby and I am not ashamed to admit it. <br /> <br /> This show has been my favorite for almost 30 years. I was in high school when it was originally aired and I think it helped me keep up all these miserable days. I was so inappropriate at the time and "Fantasy Island" seduced my imagination. As I was an aspiring writer at the time, it gave me incredible opportunities to do the job. What a wonderful place! I will not say he did not have his faults. Sometimes the scripts were pretty bad and some problems seemed trivial; but it could be good too, and it was great to watch and it still is. As for the cheese factor, well, I think it's unfair to label every product from the 70s as being corny. There were a lot of good things at the time and it was among the ranks. (By the way, most seasons were aired in the 80s !!) My favorite episodes are those of seasons 2, 3 and 4. Most of the time. <br /> <br /> To those who denigrate Herv√© Villechaize for his French accent and his small size: Growing up and learning something! It's so easy to make fun of when you're "normal" and "perfect". This man has made the most of what he has been treated in life, and if you do not like it, it's just difficult. Have a little compassion. He has been dead for 15 years and it is easy to kill someone who can not defend himself. There is no shame now. <br /> <br /> I like this show. So, it seems dated. I hate to tell you that, but we had no special effects or brilliant Blu-Ray discs. We were lucky to have video recorders. To live with. Accept it for what it is, and it's just fun. "Escapist TV" describes it perfectly, and that's what it was for me: an escape from my real rotten life. And it's always fun to watch.
