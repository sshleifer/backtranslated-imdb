Black Water, co-directed and written by David Nerlich and Andrew Traucki, is very simple in its execution but effective. This low-budget Australian film will unfortunately not get the recognition it deserves, because, in terms of the characteristics of creatures, it is one of the best on the market. The configuration is rather basic; Grace, her husband Adam and younger sister Lee visit mangroves in the Northern Territory when a saltwater crocodile returns their boat and leaves them trapped in the trees. The entire film talks about their survival as the crocodile watches the ground waiting to hit. Unlike Greg McLean's Rogue (another 2007 killer movie), Black Water is not meant to entertain the audience by guessing who will be eaten, hoping and praying for the three to go out safely. <br /> <br /> The three unknown actors do an excellent job with quite demanding roles, knowing that it was filmed on site with a real crocodile instead of CGI. The characters act realistically in the situation and the dialogue seems natural and not forced. The suspense is built throughout the film, we do not see much of the creature but the simple fact of knowing that it is close is quite terrifying. This is very recommended if you like original and (mostly) scary horror movies. <br /> <br /> 4/5
