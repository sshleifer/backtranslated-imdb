This movie is the real action at its best, so it does not get better then. This is one of those movies that you can just watch looking at some really good non-stop shooting and killing, plus some great lines to go along with that. My favorite is that there's only one guy who goes into that old couple's house and steals a TV or something and goes straight to them and shouts, "I'll come here when I love !!!" and just before jumping out the window, he shouts "Anytime !!!" I mean it's a classic, you have a choice, you can watch this crappy Will Smith try to play an action movie or watch one of the Masters Charles Bronson !!!!
