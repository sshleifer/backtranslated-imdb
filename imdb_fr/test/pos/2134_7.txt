This great film was never broadcast in my city so I never had the opportunity to watch it before the end of the 80s, when I saw it on German television. I was expecting something of a disaster and instead I found a great western played well with great localization work. The tiny tube could not really damage it and this 4-hour movie is almost boring, so I hope to see it again on the big screen. What a show it would be! Do not miss it, if you ever have the chance. Unfortunately, the mistreatment of "Heaven's Gate" when it opened ruined the career of Michael Cimino. He has gone from the passable ("dragon year") to the annoying ridiculous ("The Sicilian") and stupid cries ("Desperate Hours"). .
