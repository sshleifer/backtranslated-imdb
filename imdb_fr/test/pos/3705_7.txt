When her elderly mother, Emily (Jeanne Bates), is attacked by her tenant Nestor Duvalier (Brion James) and turns into a cannibalistic monster, television reporter Clay Dwyer (Mark Thomas Miller) strives to keep her dear old mother to satisfy her hunger. /> <br /> Although the plot summary above evokes pictures of sad and overflowing horror tracks such as Flesheating Mothers and Rabid Grannies, Mom actually turns out to be a refreshingly fresh version of the werewolf / vampire / Zombie Mythos (what Emily becomes is never really clear, but it's not nice!), as well as a touching study of the close bond between mother and son: the dedication of Clay to his mother leads him to give up all his other responsibilities. , including his work and his relationship with his pregnant girlfriend Alice (Mary Beth McDonough), while Emily's love for Clay finally pushes her to self-destruction. <br /> <br /> Technically, the film could be sharper, with more style and better effects (the creature moves are very brief, not to disappoint), and some more experienced cast members frustrated by terribly old-fashioned performances (yes, Brion James and Stella Stevens, I'm talking about you); fortunately, however, the strong emotional flow in the well-constructed story is enough in itself to ensure that Mom is an effective, compelling and sometimes shocking story - one that I do not hesitate to recommend to those looking for something of a little different.
