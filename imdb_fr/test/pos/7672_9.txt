I came across this site looking for a video or DVD of the 1959 version of Porgy and Bess with Sammy Davis in Sportin 'Life. If someone finds this on a movie format at home please let me know. I talk to my daughters all the time about things that they think are new and have already been done. We went to see a versioned theater a few years ago and I could only talk about this movie. Unfortunately, my daughters do not remember seeing Sammy Davis Jr. in any production, although they have heard of him. Needless to say, they do not know the other big actors in the movie. It is a major oversight not to have this classic film (because of the distribution) on a domestic film format for collectors and for future generations. Anyway, in my opinion, this version was the best!
