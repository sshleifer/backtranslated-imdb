A rather interesting look at some characters of the growing middle class in India. Although India is modernizing rapidly, its culture is not keeping pace. This film is about the patriarchal society, where women are not yet really free citizens. A land of arranged marriages, men who attend mistresses with impunity, and women supposed to tolerate all this, will eventually fail. I was impressed by Nandita Das, who was very attractive and played her character seriously. But I was even more impressed by Shabana Azmi, who, from what I understand, is a longtime Bollywood character. His silent beauty and his discreet psychic suffering were excellent. The lesbian subtext of this film has never been particularly erotic or titillating. (Darn!) Worth a look for those who are interested in very different cultures.
