Thank God, there are movies that do not follow the same old Hollywood crappy formula. I think that the digital revolution and the DVD revolution actually make it possible to get a better job, even if you have to dig harder to find it. I love it when a film takes its time to train you deeper and deeper in its emotional depths. It was really like going on a journey through the soul of America and this soul is disturbed and confused. What really surprised me was the way they used Martin Luther King's speeches on Vietnam and allusions to his assassination in a way that hit me hard. I choked each time I heard his voice. I've heard about it, of course, but the way they used the speeches here made me feel like I understood his message in a way that I never thought about. <br /> <br /> What can you say about a film that has heavy statistics on war, oppression and a call to compassion at the end of it, where a credit analysis would be habitually? In fact, there is no credit in the film. You must access it by selecting them in the features. In a way, it made me think a lot. Overall, I can not say enough about this DVD. Brilliant.
