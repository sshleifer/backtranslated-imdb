Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon, both of us missing, proved once again that they were a team dedicated to innovation and writing hilarious moments. This film is just another example of this. <br /> <br /> This time, they play two brothers-in-law who land on a ship as dance teachers on board. <br /> <br /> Of course, their boss is a perfectionist and miserable named Gil Godwin who only likes to harass these boys. It's hilarious to see Lemmon give Matthau a little dance lesson and how he dances a touching rumba with the owner of the boat, McLanahan Street. <br /> <br /> Too bad the other dance instructors, Hal Linden and Donald O'Connor so little to do, but their parties are asking for it. Matthau crushes for Dyan Cannon, on board his fellow gold-digger, the outrageous Elaine Stritch. Unbeknownst to them, Matthau has no money either. The Lemmon widower falls in love with Gloria De Haven, more beautiful than ever. <br /> <br /> The film belongs to Matthau and Lemmon and will serve as an additional tribute to their illustrious careers.
