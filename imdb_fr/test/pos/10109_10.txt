The beauty. Terror. Poetry. The horror. Innocence. Guilt. <br /> <br /> Maybe that's about all I should write in this commentary for A TALE OF TWO SISTERS. The best thing to do is watch this movie without knowing anything about it. I did not even know one thing about the story of the two girls when I went in this movie. I just had a look at the nice cover, I did not even read the synopsis on the back and I inserted it in the DVD player. I only knew that he had won several awards at festivals around the world and was highly recommended. <br /> <br /> The cover of the DVD said "The scariest movie since THE RING, THE GRUDGE and DARK WATER". The scary part may be right, but you can forget the rest, because the only thing that A TALE OF TWO SISTERS has in common with this movie is ... a ghostly apparition with long black hair. It's even a bit unfair to compare it to these famous Japanese movies, because this Korean movie has a lot more to offer and is actually a bit more complicated and clever than these other movies. <br /> <br /> This movie is just great. a little masterpiece, and here are some reasons (without telling anything of the plot): The film itself caught me off guard at least twice with intrepid surprises. And just when you think you've had the conclusion (whether you get it or not, it's not relevant at the moment) and you think the movie will end ... the movie continues a little longer . The cinematography is amazing, using bright colors during the day and dark tones at night. The work of the camera is excellent, the director sometimes choosing impressive angles, even innovative. Some shots are pure poetry (eg the top-shot with the two sisters at the lake). All this looks very elegant. There are only four main characters, but the plot around them is intense. The story itself begins a little slowly, but the tone and the emotions are very varied. There is even a scene (when the girls took off towards the lake) that suddenly reminded me of the memory of Peter Jackson's HEATTEMENT CREATURES. But when the horror begins, it's pretty effective. There are also some surprises surprises successful. Damn, I jumped off my couch. The score is great, and at times when it's not supposed to be scary, I could not help but notice that it had some sort of Italian feel. A bit strange for a Korean movie. But nevertheless, a good score. Particular care has been taken in the details of this film, including a perfectly balanced surround sound. <br /> <br /> I also think that calling A TALE OF TWO SISTERS a horror movie does not give her enough credit. It's more of a mysterious horror drama that works both psychologically and supernaturally. Whatever your point of view, this is an Asian horror that is among the best. It may not be gore, but sometimes it gets pretty scary and the subject is quite disturbed. So, if you have not seen it yet, find a copy, insert it into your DVD player, follow the motion and make sure to give this movie your full attention, for about 110 minutes of its time . <br /> <br /> Here, I hope I did a good job by praising it without spoiling anything.
