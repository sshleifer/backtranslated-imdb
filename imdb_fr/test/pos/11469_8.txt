This film had a lot of ups and downs ... The scenario is strong, while telling the story of Ma 'Barker growing up, and then her misadventures with her boys and the FBI..Theresa Russell is very talented and her beauty shines even through, like Ma Barker, in Public Enemies. The management of Mark L. Lester, although not as good as in "85's Commando", was still very interesting. <br /> <br /> Eric Roberts plays an ephemeral role as a security officer, become a thug (and Ma's Lover), and Alyssa Milano plays a prostitute, who is part of the gang. Frank Stallone, a thug who helps the gang, and while one of his exploits causes trouble to a boy of Ma, he goes himself in the final So, so to speak ... <br /> <br /> > I was perplexed, intrigued and captivated throughout this film ... Then I wonder what movie all those others who voted so low have watched! .. For all those who were wondering .. Umm, the FBI was actually so bad at first, did not have machine guns like the outlaws, and so were pretty disadvantaged, every time they came in shootings with gangs of that era ... seen the 30s, I felt that it was more realistic than many other movies describing this era ... It may be a kind of sinking atch, but just have too .. enjoy !!!
