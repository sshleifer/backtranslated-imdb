I like everything about the family. <br /> <br /> My favorite family characters are Brian and Stewie and I love the episodes where he's mostly devoted to "Road to Rhode Island" (Season 2), during their interactions very well. The comments they make me lose my head. Peter's behavior is also very funny because some of his activities "are so brilliant that they are delayed". The dubbing is excellent, especially Seth MacFarlane, who provides the voices of half of the Griffin family, as well as their nefarious neighbor, Glenn Quagmire, and the way he manages this range (especially with vocals). I just do not know it. He deserves his two Emmy for providing the voice of the awesome baby Stewie. Adam West also steals the show with his funny and crazy crazy regular character, the mayor of Quahog. What I like about Chris (expressed by Seth Green) is that what he says shows that he takes after his father in matters of intelligence and common sense. <br /> <br /> The only thing I found annoying is that UK Fox has decided to change the seasons to increase DVD sales, which in no way reflects the program but the marketing . <br /> <br /> If you like Family Guy, I highly recommend Seth MacFarlane's other project, American Papa, which uses a different style of humor but remains extremely hilarious.
