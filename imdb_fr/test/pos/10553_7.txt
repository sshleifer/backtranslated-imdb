I have a problem with the snobs of the film that consider Americans as coarse semi-literates unable to appreciate the subtlety of the most sophisticated Europeans, French, Italians ... just about everyone who, of all time, of which English is a foreign language. If the humor in "My father the hero" is different from that of "My Father this hero", it is because the sense of humor in the French is different from that of the American. No better, not "smarter", but different. If you think it is derisory for Hollywood to "borrow" from French cinema, just consider how much French cinema borrowed from Hollywood in the first place. Where would Belmondo and Delon have been without Bogart? Truffaut without Hitchcock? Jerry Lewis - Not known for his subtle and cerebral style, he is idolatrous in France.Go ........ Mr. Depardieu is exceptionally good at the divorced and unlucky father of a 14-year-old girl on vacation together Bahamas. Unbeknownst to her, she introduces him to other people in the hotel as her lover to make herself more interesting for a boy she watches. Not surprisingly, complications ensue. There are "tributes" to "Carte Verte" and "Cyrano de Bergerac" inserted in a fun way and M.Depardieu goes hand in hand with all this - very nicely. He makes a good impression of Maurice Chevaler with "Thank Heaven for little girls" which is actually funny and rather moving because his audience, who thinks he is in love with the 14 year old girl, gets up and leaves two by two while he is shaking, perfectly unaware of what is happening. When he returns to the end of the song to greet the expected applause, the expression of his face is priceless. Without him, the movie would actually be very average. With his huge shaky character dominating the screen, he is very entertaining. No pecs, no six-pack - just a real human being.
