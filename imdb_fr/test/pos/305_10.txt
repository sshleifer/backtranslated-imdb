The films appear to fall into two categories: films that reinforce existing social values ​​and beliefs and those that challenge them. This film is a 180-degree shift from the idealistic rhetoric described in such offerings as "The Longest Day" and "The Green Berets", which are more like Disney fantasies. The apocalypse now! project, production and the resulting film, is "Heart of Darkness" updated in a psychological horror story of the post-modernist variety of the late 20th century. The actors and the team who worked there could probably relate to the terrifying places that the human spirit can reach. This is the fate of Joseph Conrad's original character, Kurtz, who entered literary writing in 1901 and was subsequently referenced in TS Eliot's "The Hollow Men" (Mistah Kurtz, he died) in 1925. Although it is not possible to speak directly of Conrad's "Heart of Darkness" (1901) or a firsthand account of the Vietnamese experience, "Apocalypse Now!" presents itself as a masterpiece that has pushed on the envelope of cinematographic potential. "Apocalypse" does not only deal with the "horrors" of war, such as "Platoon" and "The Deer Hunter", but with darker sensitivities of human nature revealed by the gross and degrading clashes of large-scale violent conflict. Revelation now! is not so much perceived as experienced. <br /> <br /> The essence of the film is the journey of a well-trained secret assassin, Captain Benjamin Willard (Martin Sheen in a show of strength), aboard an American army boat crossing a nameless river to the heart of Vietnam and Cambodia, where few Westerners would ever walk. His mission is to put an end to Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando), an officer of the special forces division of the career army who was the darling of the US Army until he became AWOL and renegade in the deep unexplored jungles between Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia. The classified official report indicates that the colonel went crazy, but as events unfolded, another event occurred that was much more terrifying than mere madness. Sheen's mission is to finish the colonel with the American public without it being wiser. <br /> <br /> The film is rather episodic. The course along the river is composed of several vignettes, while Sheen and his team meet different autonomous "aspects" of ground-level warfare. The American public of the 1970s had probably never seen this kind of film before, with the possible exception of "The Deer Hunter", released the year before. The first, and one of the most notable, is a helicopter battalion led by Col Kilgore (Robert Duvall in an Oscar-nominated performance), from the cross between General Robert E. Lee and Richard Wagner. He likes to play "Ride of the Valkyries" by Wagner's "The Ring" when he bombs defenseless villages. His phrase "I love the smell of Napalm in the morning" is one of those lines mentioned in the annals of cinema. Other encounters include an amphitheater where enlisted soldiers will be entertained by Hugh Heffner and the Playboy bunnies. <br /> <br /> Despite all the production disasters that have prevented the staging of these images, the remarkable aspect of this film is its pace. The original version (not the latest version of Redux) does a good job of construction until the viewer is emotionally prepared to face the culminating confrontation between Willard and Kurtz. The strange speech between Willard and Kurtz is worth the price of admission alone. And some of the clichés of Sheen and Brando in some places are some of the darkest and most terrifying images ever produced on a film. Even the likes of Clive Barker, Wes Craven or David Cronenberg have nothing to do with Coppola in terms of horrible pictures. Brando's Kurtz in a particular scene is so terrifying that most other horror movies seem tame by comparison, which comes from the recognition that the horror does not come from outside but from within . <br /> <br /> Without giving too much away, Coppola's culminating solution is one of the most innovative cinematographic revelations. According to the documentary "Hearts of Darkness", Coppola feared that the inevitable final scene would become melodrama and that the atmosphere of the film's darker hues would be compromised. He did not know how to make it work until his wife encouraged the director to attend the ceremonial sacrifice of an indigenous ox with whom Coppola used extras in scenes with Kurtz in "his" village. After watching, Coppola has come to an end, and it's one of the most disturbing and beautiful scenes in American film history. Love it or hate it, no Western spectator will be the same after seeing this scene. <br /> <br /> This film is not for everyone's taste, just as Conrad's original novel is not the kind of book that will be read by plane. . Most American viewers have trouble absorbing violence and the futility of violence. It's the bare exposure of aspects of the human condition that seem so far removed from the suburban American life that makes this film difficult to handle for the average moviegoer, which is as it should be. Coppola did not make a family photo. However, if the viewer understands his widest point, there is a lot to be learned from Apocalypse Now! If you're looking for a cinematic experience to reaffirm pre-existing attitudes about American sensitivity and heroism, stay with John Wayne. But if you're ready to be driven to places where you've never been, even beyond the rhetoric of "woes of war", "Apocalypse Now" will take you into a world you never thought you'd ever visited before, and the troubling part of that is that you can recognize it.
