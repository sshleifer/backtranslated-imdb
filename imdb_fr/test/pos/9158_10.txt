If I remember correctly, my family wanted to stay at home the night of "Nichols" (Mondays "Tuesdays" on NBC?). For James Garner, it was a superb vehicle, very well written, very good casting for the whole. His character is very similar to the "Support Your Local ..." movies: A retired player with a mysterious past settles in town and experiences adventures every week. In fact, it seemed pretty obvious that it was the same character. He was just a charmer of a TV show. A sleeper, like "My World And Welcome To It", who may have been his contemporary - I forget it. I sincerely hope that these shows are available on DVD. It was just a good tv. Maybe "Briscoe County Jr." get closer, but only by a mile.
