An incredible movie, I just saw it and I already want to see it again. I had never heard of Derek Jarman until I saw this movie, but now I'm looking forward to seeing others. The film adopts a new perspective of The Tempest in Shakespeare. Jarman would certainly have appreciated him for his use of the themes of the play such as love, magic, darkness and atmospheric tension. Okay, okay, there may have been a bit of nudity in the movie that I did not really anticipate, but that did not offend me, it just surprised me and made the more unpredictable film.
