I just discovered this obscure horror movie of the 70s while browsing on YouTube. For a low-budget effort, there are many fascinating moments in progressive steps leading to a surprisingly shocking finish. Although a woman is constantly removing her shirt, the fact that she is a nymphomaniac makes these scenes important for the story and that there is a scene with the young man with curly hair who tries to seduce her and who excites me before he retired. made it screaming with anger. The young nurse who comes in and gets hired seduces herself and I'm not surprised she posed for the Playboy cover. Some characters are very irritating and some scenes seem ridiculous. In most cases, however, do not look in the basement (this is the title I saw on YouTube) provides enough drama and thrills for an entertaining movie B.
