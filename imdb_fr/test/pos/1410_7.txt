At the same time, John Russell was playing with rancher Nathan Burdette, trying to free his bad brother, Claude Akins, from sheriff John Wayne in Rio Bravo, where he was working on the other side of the law on television . These years were probably the culmination of Russell's career, his most famous on-screen role and his most famous television role, Marshal Dan Troop of Laramie in Lawman. <br /> <br /> Russell was policing Laramie in the same way that James Arness did at Dodge City on Gunsmoke. Unlike Gunsmoke, Laramie never developed all the minor characters that gave you the impression of Dodge City at the time. Instead, he focused on Russell doing business and learning law with his young MP Peter Brown. <br /> <br /> Brown plays MP Johnny McKay who is a very respectful young man, constantly referring to his boss. Mr. Troop. It was very convenient with an iron, but tended to be impulsive. Fortunately Marshal Troop was there. <br /> <br /> The other regular in the series was Laramie's Kitty Russell, Lily played by Peggie Castle. This is where Lawman looked most like Gunsmoke. There was a tacit agreement between Russell and Castle that even the smallest of children could not miss. And I was not the smallest child when Lawman was in the first race. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Peggie Castle developed addiction problems after the end of Lawman's race. I remember a small obituary marking his death in the first half of the seventies. She was a beautiful woman. <br /> <br /> Lawman was a foolish Westerner from this golden age of adult television westerns. It was one of the best.
