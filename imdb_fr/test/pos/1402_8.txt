It's a very strange film for Harold Lloyd - at least about the sweet character he played in movies in the 1920s and 1930s. Snib Pollard and he are scammers instead of robbing all the blind . In a particularly successful con, Chester claims to have lost a "very precious ring" and a little later, Harold finds it because a stooge is also looking for the ring. The ring, of course, is an inexpensive ring, then found by Harold, but the lark's greed is so great that he "convinces" Harold to say nothing and sell him the "precious" ring, then they fled to enjoy their luck (?). Again and again, they find nonsense until meeting a woman who is herself a scammer (who works with a guy who makes false sessions). She arranges a clever scam and takes all the money they have stolen - and has a policeman at her side to make sure to give it to her. <br /> <br /> As luck would have it, the two crooks stumble into the lady's shady business when no one is home. Soon, the lady comes back and messes up the spirits, revealing many sneaky tricks to punish them for their bad manners. <br /> <br /> All around, it's a completely strange and artificial film, but also extremely funny, because the jokes work very well and Lloyd and Pollard form an excellent team. In addition, although weird and strange, I liked to see Pollard dress like a lady.
