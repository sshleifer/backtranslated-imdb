Wow .. I just saw this movie on Sundance Channel, and it's really weird. I may not be a movie expert, but it's probably the most bizarre movie I've ever seen as a movie lover. <br /> <br /> The one who proposed it had a great imagination. I'm a bit of a fan of Japanese dramas and there are often drama actors in movies. the first film for Kirie and Shuichi. I must say that if they are really starting out here, they are doing a very good job. <br /> <br /> Kirie was a very nice character, I thought she was easy to understand. She was kind and good-hearted, maybe not the most popular girl, but kinder than some of the other girls looking for attention. She was also pretty classically. I hope she will make more movies, but it's been a few years so she may not have such projects. <br /> <br /> The end was strange. I will not reveal anything, but the rest of the movie's quirk was a little shameful. <br /> <br /> Very weird film, but very imaginative and unique. I recommend it to Japanese horror fans, even if I warn you, it's a lot more weird than Ringu. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, I would give it a 7.5 out of 10, for its originality, imagination, good characterization, above average game and just intriguing.
