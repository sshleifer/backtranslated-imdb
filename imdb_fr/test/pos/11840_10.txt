I think this show is great !!! I love and I love Fabian (not romantically) but if I were there, I would totally support Fabian as Haley and the other girls, yeah !! I mean, if they are good, why do not you want to fight them !! Fabian is the only one to have the courage to confront people and say what he thinks, not just stay and suck it !!! FABIAN 100% !!!!! I also like Haley, because she's a normal girl who does not want to be with cows, insects and grass everywhere, and who sleeps in a hot bed with servants, I mean, if you have luck and money, why do not you do that !!! and Fabian too, Fabian brought a pizza and just like 2 or 3 people said thank you, I mean he spent money !!
