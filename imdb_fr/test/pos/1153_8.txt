One of the previous reviews of this film ends with "Only for the big fan of main actors or the fans of romantic movies / adventures Holywood ...", as if it was not a sufficient reason to like it ! Anyone who, after watching this film, complains about Connery's accent, lack of historical likelihood or realism of political motivations, or any other extra-cinematic concern, simply does not like movies. Watch it and be amazed by the power of the two stars, exoticism, romance, photography and music, as well as the daring adventure of a true escape movie. This is proof that Hollywood can "make them as before" when it really wants it. A solid 8/10.
