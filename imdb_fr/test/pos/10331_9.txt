This film should have easily been called a film <br /> <br /> that best promotes understanding between human beings. <br /> <br /> It can be quite boring to even try to understand that a young Jewish girl from the South could house an escaped German prisoner of war. <br /> <br /> Kristy McNichol paints an astonishing portrait of the unfortunate young girl thirsting for acceptance and love. Michael Constantine gave a remarkable performance while his difficult father and Esther Rolle, as a maid Ruth, gave a superb performance rewarded by an Emmy as a comprehensive maid catching up with these events. <br /> <br /> Bruce Davison describes the German who is supposedly not guilty of Nazi atrocities. This is how his role appears. He escaped, but joined the German army and could have been a member of the Hitler Youth Movement. <br /> <br /> The action takes place in 1944 in Georgia, in a rural area. The inhabitants are full of prejudices. Even the FBI inspector acts as if he wants to get something out of the Jews. Note the opposite interpretation that McNichol is in bed and Davison is hunted down and finally shot. It is interesting to see that the company considers McNichol a traitor for harboring an escaped prisoner of war. The film also deals with an extremely complex relationship between father and daughter. The explosion of Constantine at his daughter's end is an acting game. As a mother, Barbara Barrie has little to do. It was annoying that she was stereotyped as the typical Jewish mother with that shade of lipstick on her lips. <br /> <br /> Made in a memorable way and deserves to be watched.
