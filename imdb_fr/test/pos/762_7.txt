Honestly, I thought it would be a ugly film, Rupert Grint, RON, playing in a different Harry Potter movie, was actually very hard to imagine. But at the beginning of the film, it was shown that this guy had talent, I mean, is the best actor of the HP trio, by reference, did you see Emma Watson trying to act? Or what about Daniel? Both lack experience even though they played in a million Harry Potter movies. Ben, his character is a very shy boy, unable to show his true feelings about everything, his contempt for his dominant mother and the anger felt towards his father who is unable to defend his unfaithful wife. Julie Walters was absolutely brilliant! Her portrayal of an old retired actress trying to live with the shadow of her past as she tries to remember the Shakespearian sonnets is absolutely beautiful! In addition, it seems that many young people are wasted in religious acts without meaning.
