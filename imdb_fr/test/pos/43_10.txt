One of the best, Lackawanna Blues <br /> <br /> An excellent movie, excellent distribution, great music, it's one of those movies that's so good that at the end of his life, you'd like that lasts another 90 minutes, I will look at this one a few times. <br /> <br /> This is one of those films that have been gripping you from the beginning, twisting and hitting you emotionally throughout the movie. The casting is extraordinary, without the slightest hint of discomfort on the part of anyone. You have the impression that you really take all that into account. The sets, costumes and music of this period were the subject of special attention. The relationship between the characters we meet is both simple and complicated as the movie progresses, but Ms. Merkerson's consistent performance is so powerful that the film ends before we have had time to satiate ourselves with these wonderful unsuitable. To choose a person other than "Nanny" is an injustice, because we have very good performances of great veteran actors, including: <br /> <br /> Jeffery Wright, Jimmy Smits, Terrence Howard and Delroy Lindo. But Marcus Franklin, Macy Gray and Merkerson make this experience a wonderful experience. <br /> <br /> The movie is fast moving and short of current standards, but it's definitely one of the best movies you can do. I'm going to see this year. If you like good vintage lyrics that will challenge you emotionally, you will pull on your heart, you will lift with joy and you will stomp at the same time, so this film is for you. I showed it to several friends and they all want my copy, that means everything, the film is also good. Discover it for yourself. <br /> <br /> danceability-1, Amsterdam Holland
