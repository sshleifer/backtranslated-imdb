Following the advice of a friend, I bought this film. I really like computers in general - that's why a 1995 film about identity theft on the Internet could not be forgotten. I had some bad reviews about it, but in the end I was not so disappointed: the story, although classic, is rather interesting and had to be really new at the time it was released in cinemas. I was pleasantly surprised when I discovered that, contrary to what we usually see, the actions performed by computer are somehow realistic because they use Windows 3.x and normal computers. The narration is median and does not bother the viewer. The end is typically American. The performance of the actors is generally correct, Sandra Bullock irritates me generally with its behavior "oh my god why me", but this time, it seems to have been controlled. I would recommend this movie.
