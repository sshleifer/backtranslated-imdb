I saw this film at the Rotterdam Film Festival and was pleasantly surprised. Photography is so elegant and beautiful, and the story is not quite your average Mafia movie, in fact, this story is rather in the background. It is rather the personal journey of a middle-aged man trapped in an existence that he was forced to live. The actor, Toni Servillo, is superb, he excels this "quiet man". The little girl, Olivia Magnani, is the granddaughter of Italian actress Anna Magnani and lives up to the family name. <br /> <br /> If you're waiting for your typical Italian movie where everyone shouts about big families, it's not your movie. There are not your average shots and it's worth it to see this one.
