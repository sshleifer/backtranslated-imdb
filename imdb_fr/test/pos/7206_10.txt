It's really a movie "to see". The excellent director Alain Chabat (also acting as CÃ©sar) has managed to capture the essence of the "Asterix Adventures" (the French comics on which he rests) and create a comedy that is both fantastic and intelligent the world of animation films. This film is so funny, so full of jokes (both visual and spoken) that you may need two or three projections before you notice them, between your laughter. The only drawback is that a non-French public (or at least a non-French audience) might not receive all the "private jokes". There are so many dialogues impossible to translate, situations directly related to comics or to the French way of life, which makes the pleasure less pleasant. However, the beautiful image, the amazing waterfalls, the music, the totally crazy atmosphere and the excellent acting still remain to be seen. All the actors are great, but the film would not be the same without Jamel Debouze, Gerard Darmon and Edouard Baer. And please, NEVER compare this wonderful film to the previous terrible movie based on the same comics: "Asterix and Obelix Against Caesar" and directed by Claude Zidi.
