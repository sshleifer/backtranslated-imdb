It lasted several years despite the late hour. <br /> <br /> Like many police dramas of the 80s, it seemed cold. Both physically and figuratively. This is not a bad thing though. And the (obviously) weak budget actually played in his favor. Gritty at a time when "slick" was in the spotlight. <br /> <br /> The enveloping segments of Allan Royal while the journalist gave him a slight advantage. <br /> <br /> The only actors I remembered were Scott Nylands (Earthquake) and Tony Rosato (SCTV). The cast of hardly known people was a good thing because you could see the band as a whole and not as a group of people supporting a "star". And yes, it's a young Clark Johnson (Homicide) at a recurring place. <br /> <br /> I hope a DVD will be released in the future. Does anyone want to go?
