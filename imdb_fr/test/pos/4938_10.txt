It's a good movie to watch with a good friend, boy / girl friend or family. Basically, one of those movies that feel good that you want to share with your loved ones ... without all the bullshit that you find in many American movies feel good. This film is light but makes you think and you will laugh. <br /> <br /> Just a very simple but universal plot. I think most people could have some relationship with this movie. The characters in the movie are incredible and the actors do a great job aspiring you in the movie. And the film is completed throughout the course with a realistic and realistic Jewish humor. I watched the movie for the first time last night and now I want to own it. :)
