I play Final Fantasy 7, and this movie is great as the game. All fans of Final Fantasy will love this movie. <br /> <br /> The music is fantastic and the story is good, but the best of this movie is that the visual effects are amazing. The characters are equal to the game and this detail is good for the fans. <br /> <br /> It is not necessary to play the game to love this film, everyone can enjoy it, because the story is different and easy to understand. I buy the DVD because it's EXCELLENT, IT'S 100% ADVISABLE, if you do not see this movie, what are you waiting for? believe me, you will fascinate me
