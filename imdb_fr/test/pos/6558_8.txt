Anyone who loves Twin Peaks lynchian quirks or HP Lovecraft fans who know that the most scary things are familiar things will really appreciate this movie. Do not look at it as a horror movie in the Western "Western" sense, but rather as a Grimm fairy tale. It's gore and certainly for 16 and over, but once you start looking at it, you too will find yourself vortexed. Certainly one of those movies that stays with you a few days after watching (I'll never look at my snails again in the same way!)
