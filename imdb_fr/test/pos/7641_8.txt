I watched this movie on Horror Channel and was very impressed by the atmosphere and the gothic tone of the movie. As a big fan of everything about vampires, I'm always happy to see a new variant of the vampire myth, in this case, a ghoul-like creature residing in another dimension of Lovecraft. The director has done a brilliant job in conveying the dark mood of the subject, using the decadent art scene as a backdrop for what is essentially a love story spanning time and space - the pure love of friendship opposed to the thirst for blood and life. by the vampires in the story. The characters in the story are transported to another dimension through a mind-altering substance, where a vampire creature with changing shapes appears to grant them the desires of their hearts, while emptying them of their vital essence. There are certain analogies between addiction and loss of control, and the way it affects a group of friends in an artistic circle. I really enjoyed watching the two main male characters in the story, Chris Ivan Cevic and Alex Petrovich, two pretty, attractive guys, who are always a positive point in a vampire story for TV viewers! The special makeup and creature effects were well done, and the vampire dimension's scenography was very effective. In summary, a nice version of the myths about vampires, recommended to all those who love their vampires with intelligence and not just in action. The only thing that was missing to make it even better would have been a little more eroticism and nudity, as that would have suited the plot and themes.
