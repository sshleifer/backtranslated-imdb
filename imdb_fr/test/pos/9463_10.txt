OK, now at the beginning, I thought it was going to be another old-fashioned romantic comedy, which held the comedy but it was not. I mean, how could that be with the fabulous Amanda Bynes watching her! She was amazing, really funny and still so beautiful! The boys were also in great shape, a major reason to go girls! The plot is heavily based on Shakespeare's play "Twelfth Night" because it was extremely similar, there was even a spider called malvolio, which belonged to the malvolio character. The script was really well written and well assembled and it was very witty. The football skills were also incredible, it even made me think of playing football myself! Anyway, it's a light film about young romance, which is very confusing! Go see him!
