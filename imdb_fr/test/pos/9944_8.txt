I noticed that many people criticize Opera for reacting in the way Betty reacts to the murders. I think they base these complaints on how they imagine a "normal" person would react. The problem is ... Betty is not a "normal" person, due to traumatic events in her childhood. She has problems long before the film starts ... and by the end of the opera ... in my opinion ... she became totally helpless. <br /> <br /> ------- -------------- SPOILERS -------------------- --------------- ---- You must keep in mind that when she was very young, she witnessed the murder of her mother's lover at least one brutal murder while his sadomasochistic mother was watching him. <br /> She was raised. by a woman who gets her sexual release tied up watching girls get hacked, cut and strangled to death. This does not guarantee a healthy family life. I think it's pretty easy to conclude that her mother would have used all kinds of emotional manipulations and negative reinforcement to make sure her daughter never crashed against her. It is also likely that at her impressionable age, Betty was deeply puzzled by what she saw. Is it just something that adults do, etc. <br /> <br /> Betty obviously looks at her mother ... I mean ... she has become an opera singer like her. If mom likes it can not be bad, can it ... mom can not be bad, can she? She could not tell the police with her mother or that mysterious hooded man she associates with her mother. <br /> <br /> Betty has a lot of deep emotional issues. It's been years since her mind tries to hide the memory of what she saw her mother do ... but it continues to appear on the surface, manifesting itself in the form of horrible nightmares, cranial migraines, 'addiction to relaxation techniques, and sexual frigidity' She associates brutal violence / bloody death with intercourse at the subconscious level. There is an internal struggle between Betty's party that confused murder / sex and the part of herself that believes these things are wrong. <br /> <br /> After seeing her boyfriend murdered by the hooded man ... she calls the police but refuses to give her name. The part of her that thinks the murder is false forces her to make the call, but the part that is ambivalent will not allow her to admit her personal involvement. The ambivalent part of her takes control before she can go all the way. So she walks away from the phone in the rain ... and when she is taken care of by the director, she is surprisingly calm, not as upset as one might think of a "normal" person ... because her part that has been Since her childhood, blocking objects blocks the horror of what she just witnessed. <br /> <br /> The situation in his life helps to create a stalemate in Betty's psyche. Her career as a singer begins to bear fruit ... she will become a great singer as her mother. But will she become like her mother anyway? In a darker way? Or will she be able to go her own way? Add to this the reappearance of the hooded man murdering everyone around her. <br /> <br /> It is only when the hooded man kills the character of Daria Nicolodi that Betty really plays an active role in defeating the murderer. Here is someone who loves Betty, who has supported her wholeheartedly in her new career, which is actually a maternal figure in Betty's life since her mother's death. Imagine how terrible it would be to lose your real mother, and then to see the woman who most closely resembles a mother being shot through the eyeball. <br /> <br /> I could go on ... but I'm used to it. Most of what I say is that Betty's character is much more complex than most critics who have already wanted to accept it. <br /> <br /> Opera is one of the best ... and not only for the visuals (although they are really beautiful) and not just for the inventive murders (although they are). There is a depth here ... and attention must be paid.
