Okay, it was not the biggest horror movie I have ever seen in my life. Despite the fact that the budget is reduced, the film is rather decent. Monsters are unique and believable. Heck, they're even a little scary in the scenes where they show them briefly wreaking havoc on this poor family. Although, when you end up seeing the monsters completely, you really think "WTF!" These immense things are after them ?! " The only part that really bothered me was when * sniff * they killed the kitten! Not the cat, noooooo, why? Seriously, if you are looking for hardcore and gore violence, this is not the movie for you. Go rent The Hills Have Eyes or something. If you have young children, I would not recommend looking at this with them though; would probably give them nightmares about the trolls in their room.
