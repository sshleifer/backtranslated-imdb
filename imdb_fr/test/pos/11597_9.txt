If you go to the cinema to entertain yourself, to have fun, not to miss your time, be sure to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> If you go to the movies to enjoy the depths of human, real people's feelings, to explore the characterism of personalities, if you go to the cinema to absorb great photographs, be sure to place this film is very high on your list, preferably in first place. This experience is deeply rewarding, leading the intelligent viewer to reflect on the meaning of life itself. With "Mar Adentro", Alejandro Amenábar surpassed what he did best and even redeemed some deviations in his previous films that seemed a little Hollywood. This is not the case of this visual poem set to music: Hollywood could never approach the effect of this human and human story inspired by tingling. <br /> <br /> Do not under any circumstances interpret "Mar Adentro". as an apology for euthanasia; This story, based on the real life of the Galician fisherman Ramón Sampedro, is a heartfelt cry for life and love, a quest for human compassion, for understanding emotions. Sampedro was an intelligent and articulate man who, after being a victim of a diving accident off the Galician coast, was sentenced to bed in the next 27 years. 'Condenado a vivir' (2001) (TV) was the first version of this man's life that I have already commented on. However, Amenábar has remarkably succeeded in portraying this man, with his enigmatic permanent smile and witty sense of humor, in an articulate and intelligent manner. <br /> <br /> And Javier Bardem rose to the challenge, took up the challenge -on, complete with a Galician accent, producing an electrifying, captivating and captivating performance, so that the actor and the fisherman become merged to become the same person on the screen. Here, indeed, it's an opportunity to take off your cap and gently mumble "hat". Bardem is led by a magnificent cast including Belén Rueda, Lola Dueñas, Mabel Rivera, Celso Bugallo (Los Lunes al Sol) (continued) and Clara Segura, with accents from Galicia and Catalonia. <br /> <br /> Amenábar produces beautiful dialogues as these six people meet face-to-face or in groups, with excellent chemistry, demonstrating that this young Spanish director of Chilean origin is an artist who knows what he is and how to get his results; his overall concept of the film includes his own music, interspersed with pieces of Beethoven and Puccini on Sampedro's record player. <br /> <br /> When viewing 'Mar Adentro', I found myself a few times comparing it to this one. film with Stephen Daldry and his masterpiece "The Hours" (qv). I am referring to how dialogues work with tension and passion and in this precise sense of timing in each scene. <br /> <br /> The photograph of Javier Aguirresarobe is superb, as usual. As I mentioned elsewhere on IMDb, he does not just film events and scenes: he captures even the feelings and the atmosphere of the moment, skillfully captures in the eyes, the light and the shadows, so that his work behind the camera is both another player in the story. A superb artist. <br /> <br /> 'Mar Adentro' is another monument in the history of Spanish cinematography, among the five or six best works of art produced here in the last 25 years. This film is located next to cinematographic works such as "El Sur" (qv), "Los Santos Inocentes" (qv), "El Abuelo" (qv), "The Lengua de las Mariposas" (qv), "Las Ratas "(qv), 'To Los Que Aman' (qv), and I think I have to add 'Te Doy Mis Ojos' (qv). <br /> <br /> Superbly orchestrated story of a real man and those who loved him around his bed: not to be missed.
