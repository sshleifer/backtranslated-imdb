A long and rare feature film from Kinski: Crazy Johnny, a crazy crazy sex seeking in San Francisco. Kinski's character is obsessed with raping a sexual predator woman in the Old West, who only has to steal, rape and kill. This film can be a big disappointment for many fans of Spaghetti Western but not for many fans of Klaus Kisnki. Overall, there were two things to do: a superb performance by Klaus Kinski and an excellent score by Stelvio Cipriani. <br /> <br /> Another story that needed a lot more work to be impactful but fun to watch! <br /> <br /> It would be nice to see this movie redone in the future. Since most old movies are redone nowadays.
