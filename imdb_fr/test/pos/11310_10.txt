"Medusa: Dare to Truthful" is an incredibly funny parody that goes wonderfully with the original "Madonna: Truth or Dare". Julie Brown's brilliant creation crushes Madonna's hugely entertaining documentary (though it was not really bold, insightful, straightforward, or truthful) with fidelity to detail right down to the packaging. I highly recommend it to fans of Madonna, Julie Brown or anyone who loves sharp, intelligent parody.
