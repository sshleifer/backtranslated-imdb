Super movie. Post-apocalyptic films are raging. This one is no exception. Keep pace and interest without a hint of dialogue (mainly through a good character development). The fight between Reno and the hero was tight. I also liked using rock paintings and medieval weapons to show how primitive and wild man had become without his technology and his guzzaline. The connection between the beginning and the end was a little bulky, that is to say that I had trouble understanding the distances between the hotel and the opening sequence. In summary, the progression of the character, the design, the story without the dialogue and, more importantly, the desolate landscape still appreciated from a post-apocalyptic wasteland.
