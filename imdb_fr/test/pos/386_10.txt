"Strangers on a Train" was one of those classic movies that I had always heard about, but never got to see. I finally watched it a few weeks ago and, as always with all of Hitchcock's films, not only has it stood the test of time, but it has by far surpassed most thrillers made today. You can see here the inspiration for future action movies - the decisive conclusion with the uncontrollable carousel and the two villains facing each other make me think of the big action sequence at the end of the movie "Speed." From Jan de Bont. "Of course," Strangers "is forty years older than" Speed ​​"and contains no modern special effects, but the visceral thrill is there - Hitchcock was a real genius. <br /> <br /> Not so subtle gay Bruno's side (Robert Walker in an astonishing performance) has taken shape in many other psycho-stalker-figures in future films.Consider it as a male version of Jennifer Jason Leigh in "Single White Female". Guy's existence before even meeting him on the train - it almost feels like their contact is not accidental - and he's soon completely obsessed with it. <br /> <br /> Hitchcock loved the elements oedipials of his films (see also "Psycho" for more blatant nuances) and there are many here Bruno hates his father and wants him to die so that he can be with his mother, his effeminate means and his homosexuality obvious had to go to censorship in 1951, while gays were not "allowed" to be shown on the screen - yet, Hitchcock effectively gets the message across when we see Bruno in the living room on the phone wearing a very non-masculine dress, flirting with Guy and answering his mother. <br /> <br /> The deep layers of this film make it a fast thriller that you will never forget - unfortunately, it is redone as a big budget Hollywood production, but after seeing the original, Honestly, I can not imagine anything that surpasses the thrills of this film.
