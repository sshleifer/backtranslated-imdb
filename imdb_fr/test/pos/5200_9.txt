Bloody wonderful. Recommended by a friend who knew I loved Thomas Kretschmann in The Pianist and Downfall. I loved the flow of the story - how the characters came out of hope and valiant ideals through shock, fear, disintegration, despair and utter destruction. A first-rate anti-war film that must have caused a sensation in Germany. Not a moment of pride for anyone and the study of a lost generation. This film was excellent for conveying the withdrawal of ground troops and hammering out the total futility of trying to control the untamed nature and psyche of Russia. If I did not know it, I would have thought it was a Russian film, it was so fatalistic. What an end without compromise. A pieta.
