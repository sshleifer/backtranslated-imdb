This film focuses on a young woman praying to help her family and friends when they encounter difficulties in life. This made me think of other films like "The Song of Bernadette" and "Francis of Assisi" and has a very strong influence on the Catholic faith in the film. Ann Blyth is very charming as a first student in a Catholic school and later as a young woman who buys a statue of St. Anne (which is the name of the street I live in, by the way) and makes many prayers for holy intercession whenever problems arise in one's life. Frances Bavier (Aunt Bea of ​​the show Andy Griffith) and Edmund Gwenn (of Miracle on 34th Street) play with his family. One of my priests told me that my sister looked like Ann Blyth and that the two names were identical. A good family film that comes from a time when life was a little simpler.
