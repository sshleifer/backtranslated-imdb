As a passionate carpenter fan, I really liked this movie (although the wigs leave a lot to be desired!) And I agree with many comments, that some areas of his life were absent or unaddressed. It does not matter - it leaves your curiosity well and unsatisfied, so I went to find out more. I must recommend a book by Ray Coleman - Carpenters - The Untold Story. The book is an intelligent reading and unlike the film, it is "real" and down-to-earth. I hope you like it. I remember Cynthia Gibb from her years in Fame and Gypsy. She is a singer (and dancer) in its own right and I think it was the advantage needed to create the character. Some other actresses may have had trouble with that. It is unfortunate that the film did not go further in its history. After all, it's the title of the movie, but I feel like we've learned more about Richard, but I guess like any good performer you should always let him want more!
