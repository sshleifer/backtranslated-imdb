This film is a fascinating example of Luis Bunuel's storytelling abilities. It is a comedy that is not a comedy and a social drama that is not a social drama. Although I did not think it was particularly funny, it made me laugh. Also, although you can never take Bunuel too seriously, the film made you think of religion and its importance in the lives of some people. Bunuel tells the story of a Catholic priest, attached to his faith like no other, and the viewer witnesses what happens when the priest's unchanging commitment to serve others is put to the test. As usual, Bunuel's target is Catholicism, but I do not think he tried to make fun of the church as he often does. At least I did not take the film as a mockery of the institution. I think he's trying to make an interesting point about the fact that religion could be a nuisance in modern society. Not because faith is bad in itself, but because people still struggle to defend this concept. Message aside, I think it's one of the most intelligent works in Bunuel. Francisco Rabal is superb as a priest. Certainly one of the best films of the filmmaker.
