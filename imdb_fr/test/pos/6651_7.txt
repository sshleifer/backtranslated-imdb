Its basic premise is based on the American Civil War, but it's finally a love story. We start at the beginning of the war when the main characters (Kidman & Law) know each other visibly and there is an obvious attraction: they have a passionate kiss on the day of his departure for the war. The main objective of this film is that the character of Law returns to Kidman and his struggles to achieve it and his struggles to survive until his return. The reason he can not convince us is that we do not see enough of this relationship before Law's character goes into battle - it's hard to believe the assumption that two people so much aspire to each other. they had so little contact. Everything else is going well, Renee Zellweger and her current father and her entourage are pretty additions, as is the threat of the gang chasing deserters. Of course, it's a long film, but it's interesting and the cinematography is excellent. An honorable attempt that does not quite do it, but nevertheless deserves a watch.
