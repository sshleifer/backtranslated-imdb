I do not know why all the critics say it was a bad movie, it's one of my favorite movies of all time. Tommy (Chris Farley) and Richard (David Spade) are a good match. Tommy is the stupid who has spent seven years at university, eventually passing with a D +. Richard is the smart kid who has been hated by everyone in school. How can you not laugh when they both sing The Carpenters "Superstar" with passion and suddenly the hood gets up? All in all, it's a good movie, I recommend it.
