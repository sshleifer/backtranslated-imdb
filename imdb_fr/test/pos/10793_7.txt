I tend to be inclined to watch movies about people who choose to break through the barriers of censorship and express what they really want to express. Barry's character by Eric Bogosian looks like Howard Stern, but he is much smarter. The character himself is very fascinating. As Oliver Stone movie, I guess I was expecting more. The film sinks a little in the third act. Moreover, it is quite obvious that "Talk Radio" is based on a play, with its long dialogue scenes. But overall, the movie works. Bogosian is excellent in the lead, and the fact that he also wrote the play on which the film is based probably helped him. If you want to watch one of Stone's greatest movies, I suggest you watch "JFK" or "Salvador". It's not his best work, but a good movie anyway.
