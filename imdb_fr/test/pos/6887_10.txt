This program is a favorite of our family, and we think it MUST be released on DVD by seasons !!! The title of "Promised Land" is very appropriate because it is a positive statement about all the good that remains in this great country and the people who live there! It is a type of "God Bless America" ​​program with inspiring stories, old-fashioned values, down-to-earth characters, truthful and encouraging messages, beautiful landscapes and a good humor and drama. writings. It's a show that the whole family can enjoy and enjoy - regardless of rude language, adult themes, rudeness, violence, etc. every time again when they are finally released on DVD!
