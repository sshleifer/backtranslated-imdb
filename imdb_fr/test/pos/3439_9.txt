"Jaded" addresses the complex issue of abuse: perpetrators and victims. Between small hands, he would have degenerated into an erotic thriller designed for direct video shooting. However, this director managed to create a multilayer textured study with a different point of view. <br /> <br /> Since the director / scriptwriter is a woman and the main detective and D.A. are also women, this could have become a very anti-masculine film. It's not. Being a sexual predator is gender neutral. The nudity of this film is not erotic. Rape is brutal and non-sexual. We are interested in the victims and not in a titillation. <br /> <br /> The gifted cast rings true. For a film so little known, I was surprised by the quality of the performances. They are good. Carla Gugino and Rya Kihlstedt are incredible. <br /> <br /> This film has somehow gone astray. Maybe it's too smart for his own good. It's a "should see". Strongly recommend. Sexual thriller of a person who thinks.
