Super movie. Good game, a wonderful scenario. It's exciting to know what people think and how they react to the situation in which they find themselves. Too bad for the end; a "page" of text about Nynke's life, instead of moving pictures, was a bad choice. I hope this film attracts a lot of people. it's worth it!
