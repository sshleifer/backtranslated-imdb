This film is a funny little private detective story, as they are no longer made. Everything is there: Tom Conway is the suave detective called The Falcon, Goldie Locke (his name) is his weak acolyte, Louisa Braganza is the damsel in distress, and of course, there are the maids, the teacher with the secret formula, the villain who wants the formula, and the police inspector who is after The Falcon. There is a murder and the Falcon is involved. The landscapes are the nightclubs, the expensive hotel rooms, a luxury train, the suburbs and beautiful cars. Go watch this little gem when you see it on television in the afternoon!
