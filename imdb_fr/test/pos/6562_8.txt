I really enjoyed this film. It effectively combines humor, fantasy and a few moments of horror with a solid film making the effort of Higuchinsky. Bright images and a very original story about the spirals. The only complaint I would make is that he had some dark moments and was not as daring as he could have been. I still give a solid score of 8 out of 10. The United States should take note of this film and other beautiful Japanese horror / fantasy films recently distributed and available on DVD of Region 1. In fact, the Asian cinema in general presents some of the best movies that have been ignored by the American public because they are hard to find. I highly recommend people to go for these treasures, they are hard to find, but once you find them, you'll be happy to have done so.
