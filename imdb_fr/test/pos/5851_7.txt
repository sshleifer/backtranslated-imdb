Rating: 7 out of 10. Directed by Barbet Schroeder. If you like Hitchcock's "rope", then you'll love this movie. Sandra Bullock, the star of "Murder by Numbers", is Cassie Mayweather, police detective with psychological and yet brilliant troubles. His partner is Sam Kennedy, a non-discriminatory detective played by Ben Chaplin. <br /> <br /> Teen killers are high school students Richard Haywood (Ryan Gosling) and Justin Pendleton (Michael Pitt). These young psychotics are ready to prove their superiority by committing the perfect murder and fleeing, but the proximity of the capture is exciting and exciting for at least one of the killers. <br /> <br /> The characters the chief of police, a deputy prosecutor and the high school janitor on whom the killers associate the murder. The film reminds me of various "Hitchcock" movies that have been crossed with the TV show "Law and Order". We see a lot of police work and it's really interesting to see what clues detectives follow and which ones they do not do. <br /> <br /> The other plot of the film relates to the past and the incarceration of Cassie Mayweather -mari. Most viewers found this aspect of the film useless and slow, but I found it particularly intriguing in the story. <br /> <br /> "Murder by Numbers" is a well-designed film if you are looking for security. , or should I say dangerous, murder mystery. For more thrills and suspense, try Se7en or Hitchcock's Dial M for Murder.
