A hundred miles away from the scene of a grizzly murder in a small American town, Jill Johnson (Belle) settles for a babysitting night. With the sleeping children and a nice house to relax, she locks the door and sets off the alarm. But when a string of strange phone calls from a stranger says she "checks the kids," Jill panics. The fear of terror when she has the calls drawn. And what the police discovered turns the ideal guarding job into a 16-year-old nightmare. There are no other main actors in this film. Camilla Belle is the main star with a cute face. The day she arrives to babysit, she really has no idea what really awaits her. <br /> <br /> If I were in a house like Jill's, I would explore everything around it. The fridge would be the first person I would watch, but I am a man and I do not care for children. But what I found funny is the size of the house. I thought the film would be the same if the house was not so big? Everyone can get lost in this huge house, but this film needed a huge house. <br /> <br /> Camilla Belle has a cute face, a perfect smile, but it's like for a movie like this, the main actress needs someone's experience. I found Camilla not very good. I do not know maybe she thought it could be her decisive role. I like it, it's a cute girl, but to play a role in this film, you have to be someone different. <br /> <br /> This film was not scary. I also found this movie more like a "girls movie". I think the only reason this was published during the SuperBowl weekend is that the guys stay home and watch the game and the girls will see that. It also looks like a type of movie where girls will enjoy more than guys. But I liked this film but for what it is. The girls just like to be scared and scream. It was just a decent movie. <br /> <br /> Maybe someone could like this movie. There are many horror movies PG-13 that never succeed. It was at his own level. So I liked this movie a bit. I give him a 7/10.
