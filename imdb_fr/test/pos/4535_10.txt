Saint Schnikey! This movie is great! The duo of Chris Farley and David Spade is doing well together. My favorite parts are "Fat Guy in a Little Coat, Oh My God, Room Service and more scenes that will stay in the memories." This movie has a huge cult, I wonder why, which proves that even eleven years after Chris La Farley's tragic death is still popular and he plays the role of Tommy who will make you laugh every time you look at him.He is a great comedian and we miss him.They made more than 2 movies together.This movie is a purchase indispensable and should be part of the collection of all Snl fans.
