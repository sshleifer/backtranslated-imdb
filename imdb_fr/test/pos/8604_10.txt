This is a fairly faithful adaptation of Masuji Ibuse's novel, "Black Rain". Like the book, it is very moving and inspires reflection. The story revolves around a couple's attempts to see their niece marry successfully. They have trouble finding suitors because of a rumor that she was suffering from radiation after crossing Hiroshima on the day of the bombing. Well filmed, well played, moving, tragic, horrible and funny.
