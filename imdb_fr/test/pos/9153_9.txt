And nothing wrong with that! I wholeheartedly endorse the comments of Boblipton and Snow Leopard. <br /> <br /> I'm glad to see that this movie is available on American DVD - I've never read it to the end - I convinced the Goethe Institute here in London to show it in their season of Conrad Veidt, a few years ago - and to see him again. <br /> <br /> Barrymore is resplendent when he is engaged, as in this film, perhaps because of the sting of a renowned German actor a leaf. And Veidt is such a wonderful stage thief (does not he get his nose at one point?) This is one of the star movies that links "Dr. Jekyll" to "20th Century", "Grand Hotel Or "Midnight"; and "The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari" or "The Student of Prague" with "The Spy in Bladk", "Contraband" and "Casablanca". <br /> <br /> See!
