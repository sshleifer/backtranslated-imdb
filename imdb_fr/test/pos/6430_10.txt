It's only ten minutes, but I'd rather spend ten dollars in the cinema to see it than to see a full-length film currently being shot. it's a simple piece of the reflection of a man. He arrived as a young man in this place and was fascinated by a piece and the music that came out of it ... to his youth. the music is brilliant, the guitars have this jazz-room twang like the music of neil young in dead man. If you have the opportunity, watch this movie.If it's worth it.If Rutger Hauer made more movies like this, I think he would get more respect than he gets. Of course, this is not what Rutger would like to remember as an actor for. He also directed this film. 90's.I hope to see more of this rutger hauer because he is one of my favorite actors.
