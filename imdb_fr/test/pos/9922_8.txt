This is the standard price of a director who has been part of my favorites for a long time. <br /> <br /> Although it's very flat compared to many others of his works, but his Argento may be biased, but I'll give him a good review anyway. <br /> <br /> It contains a lot of good ideas. The subtle voyeuristic element. Needles under the eyes. The bloody and disturbing deaths. And the clich√© of Argento in flashback. <br /> <br /> Disadvantages: the heavy metal soundtrack, the acting game and the end of the film. <br /> <br /> The whole film is worth it for the birds of the theatrical sequence near the end. <br /> <br /> A pretty good movie Argento but he was better. Much better!
