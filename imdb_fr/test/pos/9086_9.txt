We can not be more afraid than Flatliners. This dark and deep film had a beating heart. The lighting is dark and will make you want to live an experience that defies death, literally. Keifer is in top form as he is today at 24 years old. He is a great actor and he plays a very convincing and shocking role that you will not forget for years to come. And what can you say for the rest of the cast? Julia is hotter than ever, Will, Oliver and Kevin light up the scene in this thriller that will keep you going. It's a refreshing sight to see a real thriller, with leading professional actors. You will not regret seeing this 2-hour seat bender. -JL
