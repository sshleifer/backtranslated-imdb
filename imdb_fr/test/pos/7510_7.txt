The Hospital is a film made ahead of its time. This film, produced by screenwriter Paddy Chayefsky, who entrusted us with the Oscar-winning movie "Network," deals with overworked staff, blatant incompetence, and bureaucratic corruption at a large hospital in the Manhattan conglomerate. George C. Scott, in a superb performance as Chief Medical Officer, is driven to alcoholism and a death wish as he tries to recover from a divorce, throwing his son out of the house, and worse, of a medical establishment where corruption and incompetence go before the care and healing of the sick and wounded. <br /> <br /> Mr. Scott endorses the film and viewers will be shocked by what they observe in this medical facility. You can feel the "pain" (pun intended) of what this hospital has done to him. The vivid images of the incompetence of this hospital are so vivid and powerful that you may laugh and be deeply disturbed from one scene to another. <br /> <br /> If only the film had remained faithful to this idea in a documentary way at the beginning, this image would be brilliant. Unfortunately, there is a Scott sub-plot that falls in love with the daughter of a senile patient. The patient murdered people in the hospital. This is where the credibility of the image becomes tense. Scenes of romantic dialogue add nothing to the image, and the patient with mental disorders, posing as a doctor, seemed to me totally incredible. A simple security call and a file check should have prevented the senile patient from committing the murders. It takes almost the entire film, before security agents are brought into the film to get the patient out of the hospital. I could not see ONE PERSON doing as much damage, even as corrupt as this hospital. <br /> <br /> In addition, the character of George C Scott is "overworked" (another word game wanted) because the script has too much to do immediately. For example, in 20 minutes you can accuse up to 20 different doctors and deny what they should have done or not done. With nurses and helpers, it's the same story. Someone's file was misinterpreted, somebody had taken a medicine, he died, the doctor operated on the wrong patient, while another doctor did the same thing, blaming a third nurse who was not on call because the second nurse was supposed to admit the patient was on coffee break. There is also a lot of dark and subtle humor with the same messages of incompetence and corruption conveyed to the viewer. <br /> <br /> This repetition of medical ineptitude is unforgettable. However, the subplot of murder is a distraction rather than a help for this film. When the movie focuses on the staff's incompetence and Scott's reactions to it, you're stuck on the screen. But the conversations between Scott and the crazy patient's daughter force the film to form a kind of mystery "Who Done it?" scenario that seriously affects the quality of the film. When the crazy patient revealed how he committed the murders, I asked myself the following question: Why did the producers need the sub-plot for crazy patients "find the killer"? I think the only purpose of Scott's personality in relation to the senile patient's daughter was to give him anyone to communicate with. The hospital should have maintained its scathing indictment of the medical profession by removing scenes of love and sick patients. He should have focused more frequently on the incompetent B.S within his walls. At a time when this film could have been phenomenal, the stories of sub-plot make it very good instead of the great masterpiece it could have been.
