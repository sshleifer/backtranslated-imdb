Or if you have seen the trilogy "Evil Dead" and / or "Bubba Ho-Tep", know that his films are a total joke. With "The man with the cried brain", he will start all over again. In this case, he plays the role of an American businessman William Cole visiting Bulgaria - when will we see this country? - when a woman kills him. Thus, the strange scientist Ivan Ivanov (Stacy Keach) replaces half of Cole's brain with that of a former KGB agent, leaving him a little like Steve Martin in "All of Me". <br /> Yes, the All movie is pretty much an excuse for pure nonsense. The real humor comes largely from Ted, brother of the director of "Evil Dead", of Sam Raimi, as Ivanov's almost mortal assistant, Pavel. The two men have a relationship closer to Laurel and Hardy or Gilligan and the skipper. <br /> <br /> So understand that this is a totally silly movie, and you will not be a little disappointed. I liked it, anyway.
