Count Laszlo (Ralph Fiennes) has just been transferred to a hospital in Italy during the Second World War. He is horribly burned by an ambush. His nurse Hana (Juliette Binoche) takes care of him, body and mind, because she fears, with reason, that he can be a very troubled soul. During his care, the count begins to tell Hana his recent past. He appears to have worked for the government in Africa, where he met a beautiful married woman named Katherine (Kristin Scott Thomas). Although they tried to avoid each other, they fell in love. After a brief affair, Katherine called his departure, leaving the count sorry. Still, the two would end up in heartbreaking circumstances. Meanwhile, Hana falls herself for a man from Sihk on the British demining team. Yet the war is raging relentlessly. Can love exist when the world is boiling? It's a great movie, based on a novel that is as fine but complex. The plot has many stories that are beautifully woven, each poignant beyond description. The script itself is elegant and contains many memorable lines. Fiennes is beautiful, both burnt and a man who thought that love was a myth. Scott Thomas is also very good as a woman who fights against his passions. As for Binoche, she deserved the Oscar that had been presented to her, because her nurse is a shining example of hope in a desperate situation. The landscape is beautiful, as are the costumes, the direction and the production. If you missed watching this movie, fix it soon, very soon. The English Patient will remain one of the greatest cinematographic achievements of the coming centuries.
