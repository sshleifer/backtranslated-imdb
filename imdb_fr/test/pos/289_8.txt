I have to admit that my expectations for this movie were low. But I was surprised to find it entertaining, interesting and fun. It's an entertaining thriller and not so much a horror movie. There were times that made my hair stand up! Even better, however, were the very funny, sometimes hysterical, very comical moments of the movie (you'll know which ones I'm talking about). There are also some interesting special effects (and humor and special effects are not necessarily separate). <br /> <br /> The acting game is overall very good, better than a typical horror movie budget. The main role (Jackie), in particular, and many of the smaller side roles (such as the lawyer, the couple living next door, the pizza delivery man) are well played. If they had not been, the film would not have captured my interest and I would have lost my faith in the story. It is a good thriller interesting small budget and is really worth it to be rented!
