The first of five films by St Trinian (although the latter is usually reduced) is based on the schoolgirl characters of artist Ronald Searle and presents the wonderful Alastair Sim in the role of Millicent Fritton, director, as well as his own brother. Much of the humor is dated, but curiously touching and outrageous in today's computer world - girls drink, play, smoke and then are sold to wealthy Arabs, while still being responsible they are marauding through England. Perhaps because the films have been regularly watched on television, St Trinians still inspires disguised evenings and club nights. The films have recurring characters, including PCs Ruby Gates (Joyce Grenfell) and Flash Harry (George Cole). The forerunner of the entire series is a charming film entitled "The Most Beautiful Days of Your Life" (1950).
