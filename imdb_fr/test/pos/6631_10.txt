I should not be surprised when critics miss the most obvious things in works of art because they are human beings, and the vast majority of human beings are lazy by nature. That said, the simplistic idea that Ingmar Bergman's Ingmar Bergman's 1968 film Shame (or Skammen) is just an anti-war film seriously undermines the reputation of this highly complex and highly nuanced film. Compared to his more cinematic predecessors, Persona and Hour Of The Wolf, Shame is apparently a more classic film, in terms of storytelling. But the key word is apparently, because if it lacks the psychologizing bravery of Persona and the horrible homage of Hour Of The Wolf's horror film, it's one of the best movies ever made about the war and not as a anti-war film. , nor a pro-war movie. As such, he must be included alongside Wild Strawberries as one of his greatest films, as well as one of his best scripts, if not the best. <br /> <br /> Although it is apparently a more psychological exterior film than the pre-made films, it really says much more realistic things about the human psyche and the will to survive. Max Von Sydow and Liv Ullman perform Jan and Eva Rosenberg (perhaps a nod to the infamous American spies, which many European intellectuals have deemed innocent), two musicians who played for the local philharmonic orchestra before the start of a war, and they withdrew to live on a small piece of land on an island, just working in a greenhouse. The country in which they live is not named, as is the island they live on, although the film was shot on the small island of Bergman, Bergman Island, at the northern tip of the island Swedish from GÃ¶ttland. It seems that their country has been at war for some years with an invading country, or perhaps engaged in a civil war with rebels from another province. All this remains deliberately vague, because this war is supposed to symbolize all wars. This is reinforced when the film starts with matched wartime quotes at the time of the credits. These include quotes from Hitler at the time of Vietnam, as well as American military personalities. After the first scenes that describe the prosaic nature of their rural life, then the arrival of the war, where even old men are called, an airstrike ravages the lands of the Rosenbergs, while the enemy jets fly overhead. head, throwing bombs and what appears to be chemical. weapons of an orange agent like nature. A plane is hit and a skydiver jumps and hangs in a tree. Jan, who begins the film as a coward who cries, refuses to help, so Eva leaves alone. Jan joins her and they discover that the pilot has been shot down. It seems to be part of the invasion force, even the rebellion. A group of government soldiers soon stop at home and ask questions about the deceased driver, then advise the couple to leave their home because the invaders are nearby? there are bad interpretations of the film at the micro level, such as that of the Bergman scholar Marc Gervais, who provides the commentary of the film on the DVD of the film. Like many other critics, he claims that Jacobi is a Quisling, who collaborated with the Invaders. But this is clearly and obviously wrong, because Jacobi is with the initial fascist government. As proof, the invaders are repulsed after invading the Rosenberg lands and fired their agitprop interview. We know this because the government that questions them later about the fake interview and the words put in Eva's mouth consider the film as an alleged proof of their betrayal, and Jacobi works clearly with them, the fascist statists of Big Brother. Secondly, Jacobi is responsible for deciding which inhabitants of the city are sent to concentration camps, collaborating with the invaders, and the Rosenbergs, again, are part of the spared. Thirdly, in his seduction of Eva, Jacobi tells him that his son is on leave from the army and that, if he was an invader, he would not speak so happily that his son is in the service of the State . In addition, rebel forces are not official armies and do not grant official permission. Finally, Filip is clearly with the rebels or the invaders of the Organization and why would he have killed a colleague? <br /> <br /> What Gervais and other critics interpret in such a blatant and gratuitous manner and squarely miss a key of this kind and the obvious point of this film challenges their ability to discern all aspects of all Bergman's films. It's a wonderful and awesome movie, and very high in Berman's canon, but it's disappointing how so few critics and viewers have really understood his complex message, preferring to opt for the inexpensive, lazy assumption and easy to be. simply anti-war, and a fairly simple movie in comparison to its two more spectacular predecessors. And this, in the long run, is the real shame of shame.
