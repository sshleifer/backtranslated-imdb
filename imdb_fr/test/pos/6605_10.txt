Dogtown and Z-Boys <br /> <br /> Summary: Dogtown and Z-boys is a documentary about a group of revolutionary teenagers who changed the world of surfing and skateboarding in Venice (Dogtown), as we know today. With their low swinging style, they embarked on a journey influenced by Larry Bertlemen that would have led to countless successes and some failures. After the Dogtown articles were published in a reinstated Skateboarder magazine, the sport was reorganized and the members of the Zephyr skateboarding team forgot about Jeff Ho. They wanted to spend the summer holidays all their lives by joining other skateboarding teams to pay them like movie stars. Jeff Ho (owner of Zephyr Surfshop) and Craig Stecyk (photographer) were the original skateboarding team of Jay Adams, Tony Alva, Stacy Peralta, Bob Biniak, Chris Cahill, Shogo Kubo, Paul Constantineau, Jim Muir, Peggy Oki Nathan Pratt, Wentzle Ruml IV, Allen Sarlo and David Ray Perry. All original members, with the exception of Jay Adams and Chris Cahill, are still in shape and practice surfing / skating. Jay Adams, at the time of the documentary, was serving his sentence on drug charges. Chris Cahill, at the time of the documentary, was last seen in Mexico. <br /> <br /> Themes: The themes of this documentary are a little one-way, but if there was one clear theme would be that even children can trigger revolutions. Other themes, such as partying in the past, can lead to an unsatisfactory future, and by planning and taking care of one's assets, a very rewarding future could be at hand. <br /> <br /> Other works: Stacy Peralta (writer and director) has a rather large variety of documentaries that he has written, produced or directed. Most have a common theme of surfing or skateboarding, such as Riding Giants, Sk8 TV, The Bones Brigrades and Lords of Dogtown. He has also shot American-themed movies, such as: Influences: From Yesterday to Today, Crips and Bloods: Made in America and The 70s: The Decade That Has Transformed Television. <br /> <br /> Topics: Dogtown and Z-boys are the original members of the Zephyr skateboarding team, excluding Chris Cahill. Peralta included Jeff Ho and Craig Stecyk in the interviews. Other topics include people who grew up in the 1970s reading Dogtown articles and skateboarders. Skaters in the Dogtown area, but not the team, were interviewed. <br /> <br /> Editing: The editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion. There were scenes where the subjects spoke so that the audience could see who was speaking and get an idea of ​​the character, but they immediately cut into archive footage that would explain what the speaker was saying. When a song could better explain the emotions of the subjects, such as when Jay Adams' unhappy life was a topic of conversation, Neil Young's Old Man was played, which caused many emotions. Sean Penn was the narrator of the film and he explained the transitions throughout the film. The film was presented chronologically from the creation of the Zephyr surfing team to the creation of the skateboarding team, to all Z-boys leaving the team to join other skateboard companies or start their own company. <br /> <br /> Cinematography: the film was shot in an interesting way. The film of the talking subjects was all in black and white and all the archive footage of the Z-Boys surfing or skating was in color. Of course, the footage of the 70s was grainy, but it only reinforced the film. Respondents were mostly shot in the same area, but all were outside. All the images were very well controlled, even the archive footage, which I found very surprising. <br /> <br /> Music: "Seasons of Wither" - Performed by Aerosmith "Toys in the Attic" - Performed by Aerosmith "Generation Landslide" - Alice Cooper "One Way Out" - Performed by Les Lollipops and the Allman Brothers "Roses Brothers" and "Whipped Cream" - performed by Herb Alpert "In the void" and "Paranoid" - performed by Black Sabbath "Godzilla" - Cult Blue Oyster "Aladdin Sane" and "Rebel Rebel" - David Bowie "Fastcars" - Buzzcocks "Gut Feeling" - Devo "I'll give you money" - Peter Frampton "Funk 49" - James Gang "Ezy Rider" and "Foxy Lady", "Freedom" and "Bold as Love" - ​​Jimi Hendrix "On the Sidewalk" - Jan and Dean "Achilles Last Stand" and "On the Road to Nowhere" - Led Zeppelin "Six Underground" - The Pimps Sneakers "Surfrider" - The Most Lively "Cat Scratch Fever" and "Motor City Madhouse "and" Wang Dang Sweet Poontang - Ted Nugent "We and them" - Pink Floyd "Bad Boys" - The contenders "Maggie May" - Rod Stewart "I want to be your dog "and" Gimme Danger "- The Stooges" The Children of the Revolution "- T-Rex" Bad Reputa "Thin Lizzy" Disco Inferno "- The Tramps" Hannah "- Rob Trower" Rocky Mountain Way "- Joe Walsh" The Old man "- Neil Young" The Barn "- ZZ Top <br /> <br /> The music in the movie make the movie. Each of these songs contributes to what subjects say and evokes emotions that would not have been thought otherwise.
