I'm really sad that this movie is causing so much negative criticism. I think it's a nice little comedy and really funny. The humor in this film is rather warm and innocent and I like it. I also like the Madonna character and I do not agree that she played herself. She created a character and a sympathetic. <br /> <br /> My favorite scenes were the battle scene at the top of the car sinking and Madonna crossing the fence in disguise to claim her love. The humor in the movie has a slightly realistic touch and this may not be everyone's cup of tea. But that's their problem, not the film. <br /> <br /> I found this film healthy and sunny. In fact, the day I saw it for the first time, I was incredibly sad for some reason and this film lit up my day. And Madonna can act. Just remove your glasses of negative thoughts.
