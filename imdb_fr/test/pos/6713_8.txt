Tobe Hooper (a recent hit with "Poltergeist") is aiming for the sky this time around. "Lifeforce" is an adaptation of "The Space Vampires" by Colin Wilson. The scenario of 'Alien's Dan O' Bannon and Don Jakoby) varies a bit: I was told the futuristic scenario and Hailey's comet was added to coincide with its actual passage through the Earth a few weeks after the release of the film ( so I've read). <br /> <br /> The story concerns a shuttle mission (Steve Railsback commander) sent to investigate Hailey's comet as it passed through the Earth. Everything happens without a hitch, but when you reach the comet, you discover that an alien ship is hidden in the coma of the comet. The team studies the massive structure and discovers bats-like dried creatures. Looking deeper into the ship, there is a chamber containing three humanoids (two naked men and a naked lady looking too) in strange stasis coffins. The crew returns to the ship with the humanoids and a bat creature in tow. <br /> <br /> A little later, the ship returns to Earth, but NASA can not make contact and another shuttle is launched to check the status of the mission. While docking with the Churchill, one discovers that a major fire apparently killed the crew and all the data concerning the flight. But the three humanoids remain. However, we learn that a life capsule has been launched but that we do not know where it is. <br /> <br /> Soon, they discover the origin of the stranger when the very attractive queen of vampires space emerges from his sleep to easily seduce the life force. men around her. If you suck it in the face, it will make you love and if you do not eat after two hours, you will dry up and become dust. The goal of the three is to drain enough of the essence of the population to sustain it, as well as their boat, for their journey to the next planet. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, the commander survived. entered the gondola (the crash does not touch Texas less) and now has a psychic connection with her royal queen and is able to use it to find the hidden queen while she and the survivor are trying to bleed London from their soul . <br /> <br /> Tobe Hooper (from "The Texas Chain Saw Massacre" (1974)) does an admirable job in what must be his biggest production to date. The production brought together many good technicians from the film industry. Production Designer John Graysmark (recently released from "The Bounty (1984)") uses the four stages of Elsree Studios to create the spacious interiors of the ship and others. Director of Photography Alan Hume returns to science fiction after a stint in "Star Wars VI: The Return of the Jedi" (1983) and three consecutive episodes of James Bond. Hume uses all the elements of the widescreen frame with the beautiful effects. Oscar winner John Dykstra, an innovator in the revolutionary effects of the original "Star Wars" (1977) manages to push the limits by creating highly creative and spectacular effects using lasers. Heck, even the maestro Henry Mancini, gives the film a memorable title theme that gives this hybrid sci-fi / horror a touch of adventure. In the actor's department, Steve Railsback and newcomer Mathilda May (queen vampire) fall on their shoulders. Railsback always brings an advantage to the characters he plays and can play asses just like anyone else. This happens when her mind deteriorates when the queen tightens her soul. The beautiful French actress May does not have many lines (there were more than ten?), But her presence often naked never gets old and you must congratulate her for having the jingle bell to shoot. Almost everything the queen is there to do is to feed herself and to do it, she needs to seduce you with her sexual presence. Work done and where do I register as a victim? I really appreciated how they tweaked the old vampire shots and still managed to make it look fresh but still easily recognizable. Almost everything is explained here: bats (their real form looks like a big bat), coffins (stasis fields look like these), transformations (they scan your mind and can be anything what), a massive sexual attraction (Miss May ??. Duh) besides they even include the old stake waiting for the heart (this time it's a bit of a lead dagger for the energy center slightly below the heart). The only thing they did not address is religion, but I think the vampires who use the cathedral at the end of their stay might be a nod and nod. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell (yeah 800 words later) 'Lifeforce' is a great combination of sci-fi and horror that pays tribute to the vampire theme while adding very different wrinkles. The effects and scale of the production are sufficient to maintain the engagement of the types of summer movies (at least at the time) and fans of horror and science fiction. 4 out of 5
