This film has almost everything. The action is cool, it's funny, 2 great men leaders and a really nasty villain that I hated REALLY. Not many movies have bad bad guys. Just mainly cartoon villains. He really deserves a powerful kick. <br /> <br /> Jake Scott really has the talent of his father to know how to make great graphics. The management is irreproachable and exudes an irresistible feeling of lightness. I do not usually like movies shot in the past, but I liked it a lot because it makes me boring like many other period movies (Sense and Sensibility, Age of Innocence and the absolute worst ... Duc). It will restore your faith. Thank you especially Craig Armstrong's incredible score. The music is both atmospheric and ethereal and in the action scenes, it is very exciting. <br /> <br /> The DVD is in Dolby 5.1 and has a very granular and muddy anamorphic image.
