Once again, Elmer is faced with the dilemma of who to shoot. Bugs of Daffy. He does not know what season it is and Bunny and Duck arguing that help does not matter. Although Bugs proves that he is again the smartest using Daffy's reverse psychology in a more and more subtle way. And when it's exhausted, he does his cross-dressing thing. Daffy panics and asks that the rabbit be killed. Although Elmer is too stupid, he is desperately in love with this bunny thing. Elmer is really to blame for all this. If he was not so stupid, he would know it's REALLY duck season and just blow Daffy. But poor old Daff can not believe the absolute absurdity of the situation. His cruel plans of wrong direction were thwarted by Elmer's silence. Daffy is so shocked that he even goes home with Elmer to blow himself up in his living room. <br /> <br /> Poor Daff. He reigns!
