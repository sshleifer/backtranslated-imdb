Certainly, Alex has become a bit spicy, but they remain (for me) the biggest rock trio of all time. I highly recommend this DVD to all fans. <br /> <br /> I was very disappointed that they canceled their next concert in Munich (logistics) and regretted not having made the effort to see them elsewhere. The DVD is a small consolation - the main incentive to acquire an appropriate DVD playback setup. <br /> <br /> Na√Øve maybe, but I still do not understand the meaning of tumble dryers on stage; I would be grateful for any clarification. <br /> <br /> Cheers, Iain.
