Recently, I had the pleasure of seeing this emotionally charged film by director Mani Ratnam at the Toronto International Film Festival in 2002. I awarded my highest award from the Film Festival to this feature film. Make sure you do not miss an opportunity to experience this cinematic gem ... but be forewarning: this film will make you shed a tear if you belong to the species known as homo sapien! A 10 !!
