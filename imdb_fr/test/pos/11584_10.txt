As I expected, too many critics of this film (professionals and amateurs) focused as much, if not more, on the ideology of the film. This is because The Sea Inside (aka Mar adentro) is a film about euthanasia. In particular, it is the true story of an infamous Galician named Ramón Sampedro, who fought for many years for the right to assisted suicide, to whom the Spanish Constitutional Court refused this right, and who - well, I do not want to ruin the end of the movie for you. <br /> <br /> Real life Sampedro has catalyzed a national debate on euthanasia in Spain. Now with Alejandro Amenábar (Abre Los Ojos, 1997 and The Others, 2001), producer / director / author / composer / publisher, "biopic", The Sea Inside, another rhetorical aid has been provided in the international debate on this burning issue . <br /> <br /> But as I constantly repeat (with deaf ears?), your opinion, favorable or unfavorable, on the ideology of the film should not affect your evaluation of the film. You are not supposed to evaluate the philosophical or political messages that Amenabar wants to make. You are supposed to evaluate the film, as a film. It may be a bit too idealistic, since none of us can possibly completely separate our assessments from our ideological biases, but idealistic or not, that's our goal. <br /> <br /> Let's forget for a moment the philosophical and political questions. . As a film, Amenábar has presented one of his most elegant and successful works to date. It does not focus on societal debates. It does not focus on the legal / political struggles of Sampedro. He focuses on Sampedro as a man, living his days confined to a bed in his brother's house. <br /> <br /> Sampedro, played here in an amazing performance by Javier Bardem, was quadriplegic. At the beginning of the film, he has been tetraplegic for 26 years. This state of affairs was caused by a diving accident, as Amenábar showed us through wonderfully drawn flashbacks - Sampedro was distracted by a beautiful woman, miscalculated the water, plunged into the back of the neck and almost drowned. As a quadriplegic, he eventually began to write poetry, some of which was published in a book called Cartas Desde El Infierno ("Letters from Hell"); in real life, Sampedro's book has become a bestseller in Spain. Perhaps taking the theme of Sampedro's artistic work as a theme, Amenábar created a film of elegant poetry. <br /> <br /> Most of The Sea Inside takes place in Sampedro's room. The focal point of these scenes is the complex and sublime performance of Bardem. As a quadriplegic, Bardem is limited to moving his head and talking. He mastered the subtle changes of expression and inflection to convey a deep character with a multi-faceted intellectual approach to life. Sampedro and Bardem and Amenábar often believe in philosophy in a sober speech, but there is always a mixture of naughty sense of humor, passion for aesthetics - including music and women, and sadness and sometimes even bitterness near the surface. Different underlying emotions sometimes manifest themselves as waves on the skin of the ocean. <br /> <br /> The people with whom Sampedro interacts most often facilitate this in a complex way. His sister-in-law, Manuela (Mabel Rivera), who has been the chief-in-chief since the Sampedro accident; his brother, José (Celso Bugallo), one of the vocal opponents of Sampedro's death wish, and with whom there is an unresolved underlying problem (it seems that it may have been Jose who saved Sampedro from drowning?); his nephew, Javier (Tamar Novas), who is perhaps the most understanding of him; a defender of the right to die, Gené (Clara Segura); a volunteer lawyer, Julia (Belén Rueda), whom he wished because she suffered from a degenerative disease, CADASIL (autosomal dominant cerebral arterial disease with subcortical infarction and leukoencephalopathy), and who would thus be more empathetic and with whom he fall in love; and Rosa (Lola Dueñas), a local woman who works as a DJ in a moonlit cannery, who has heard about him through the media, who wants to convince him to want to live and who falls in love with him. <br /> <br /> The essence of the film is made up of these characters who interact with Sampedro in his room. There are also some other auxiliary characters, including Sampedro's father, who is strangely distant, and a well-known and media-aware priest, Padre Francisco (José María Pou), who does his best to change Sampedro's spirit by the bias of philosophy / theology (in a scene often wrongly called "comic" - it has a comic element, but the scene is above all very serious). <br /> <br /> The fact that most of the film takes place in Sampedro's room ingeniously gives the couple significant changes in establishing a greater impact. Sampedro's room has a beautiful and large window which he says is satisfied as a point of observation of the world. Perhaps more importantly, he regularly imagines the window as a launching ramp through which he flies over the hills to the ocean, which he has always loved and which has been the most influential force of his life - he lived when he was younger and took his mobility. Amenábar presents us with a fantastic sequence of Sampedro imagining one of his flights to the sea. It is beautifully shot, with low angles (probably from a helicopter) from the rushing hills, until we follow a creek up to the open ocean which, in this film, represents freedom, infinity and natural forces. <br /> <br /> The other important change of scenery comes when Sampedro finally put himself in a wheelchair (he otherwise refused them, saying that they "made fun of his immobility") to appear before the court to plead his case. Amenábar presents us with a poignant and melancholy journey narrative, filmed subjectively, showing Sampedro looking at life and the world in action from the window of the car. <br /> <br /> Whether you agree or disagree with the legalization of euthanasia, it's hard to deny it. a well-played, well-written and well-constructed film. You may not believe it's a ten (and it's even more unlikely if you disagree with the legalization of euthanasia), but it's still worth seeing as a fine example of a sophisticated artistic film.
