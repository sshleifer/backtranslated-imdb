Jack Palance, (John Witting), was generally a villain in most of his films and in this film he showed his great acting skills beyond my expectations. John Witting returns unexpectedly to his son's farm after years and years of separation. Christopher Walken (Jacob) struggles to accept his father's appearance after spending the night in the family barn. Jacob's younger son and daughter greet their new grandfather and accept him as he is, a very old man at the end of his rope. Glenn Close, (Sarah Witting), delves into the character of John Witting and begins to reveal the truth about what happened to him during his years of absence from the family. It is a warm and loving film that portrays real events that occur in most families for generations.
