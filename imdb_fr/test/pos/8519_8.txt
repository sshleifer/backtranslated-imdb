Irvin Kershner's "Never Say Never Again" "Empire Strikes Back", a remake of the 1965 James Bond movie "Thunderball", does not surpass Terence Young's original, but this non-Harry Saltzman and Albert film R. Broccoli is well worth watching if you call yourself a 007 aficionado. Nevertheless, despite its scarcity of smart gadgets and the lack of a vibrant musical score, "Never Say Never Again" is considered a dramatic thriller Above average with high-flying performances performed by seasoned actors including Sean Connery, Kim Basinger and Klaus. Maria Brandauer, Max von Sydow, Barbara Carrera, Edward Fox, Bernie Casey, Alec McCowen and Rowan Atkinson. The film is full of surprises to be sold out of the credits sequence of invigorating title throughout its 134 minutes, generally exciting. Unlike the James Bond franchise with its breathtaking show moments, "Never Say Never Again" provides little of these scenes due to its prohibitive budget. Indeed, the film presents only three gadgets: an explosive ballpoint pen, a wristwatch with a laser and a well inflated motorcycle. In addition to Lani Hall's opening theme song, the score for orchestral music by composer Michel Legrand's "Ice Station Zebra" leaves much to be desired. Legrand does not reproduce any of these jazzy sounds that made John Barry's music memorable for the regular Bond franchise. Overall, "Never Say Never Again" seems to fit better into James Bond's first two films: "Dr. No" and "From Russia With Love" - ​​and "On Her Secrety's Service" for its more down approaching the earth to matter. <br /> <br /> "Never Say Never Again" presents Sean Connery's James Bond as a former 007 who has been through his day and retired from active service to teach. Ironically, Roger Moore was a year older than Connery and Moore's Bond films treated 007 as an active young man. Sean Connery seems to be responsible for making 007 a more mature secret agent and a number of changes take place in Lorenzo Semple's scenario that highlights Bond's age. At first, Connery had been pushing to play Bond without a hairpiece, but luckily, the wisest spirits prevailed and Connery wore a hairpiece. He looks tanned and fit and seems in better shape than he was twelve years ago, when he was rushed at the last moment into "Diamonds Are Forever" to replace John Gavin. Connery was working on another film and had gained weight for the role he was unable to pull out in time for "Diamonds Are Forever". At age 52, Connery still has a young vigor here despite the artificial demands of the screenplay. <br /> <br /> The action takes place as 007 alone tries to save a woman kidnapped on a deserted and isolated island. He sends several guards armed with submachine guns and releases the woman, but lets her stab with a knife to the side when he is not looking. It seems that this entire sequence was an exercise designed by Mr. Edward Fox of "Day of the Jackal" to test Bond's abilities. The new M does not share his predecessor's use of field agents. M decides that Bond must clean his system of all "free radicals" and has shipped 007 to the shrubby areas. At the field clinic, Bond notices a suspicious activity between a nurse and a patient and gets noticed by watching him. The nurse is the murderer of SPECTER Fatima Blush (Barbara Carrera of "Dr. Moreau's Island") and is responsible for making sure no one sees the US Air Force officer Jack Petachi (Gavan O'Herlihy of "Superman 3"). Petachi is part of the SPECTER plan of Maximilian Largo, a millionaire entrepreneur (Klaus Maria Brandauer of Out of Africa) to blacken the world powers by stealing two nuclear warheads. The perpetrators are implanting a double eyeball on Captain Petachi, who has access to very sophisticated computers and can order the arming of weapons. After stealing the weapons for SPECTER, Fatima Blush forces him out of the way by throwing his animal snake into his lap, then attaches an explosive to his ruined car and blows it up. Indeed, the first part of "Never Say Never Again", outside of the SPECTER planning conference, belongs to Fatima, who oversees Petachi's stay at the clinic and repeatedly tries to kill Bond, one at sea with sharks and later in a motel suite. with an explosive device. <br /> <br /> Finally, Bond meets the handsome blond Domino (Kim Basinger of "Mother Lode") and sneaks into Largo's charity banquet in a Monte Carlo casino where the two compete in an elaborate video game called 'Domination' to see who will rule the world. Bond wins and Largo now hates him twice because 007 is his only rival to Domino and a thorn in his side that even Fatima does not seem able to eliminate. Bond and Fatima fare after a motorcycle chase when he returns the favor and blows it up. Their first encounter in the Bahamas when she tied a device to attract a shark after him is rather lame. As in the original "Thunderball", bandits recover nuclear warheads diverted at sea, but only the warheads themselves. <br /> <br /> Bond travels to the Bahamas where he meets his diplomatic liaison officer, Nigel Small-Fawcett (not inferior to Rowan Atkinson of "Mr. Bean", who fears Bond kills someone and spoils the Of course, Nigel Small-Fawcett is the comic relief of the movie The CIA sends Felix Leiter (Bernie Casey) "This is the first time an African-American portrays Leiter. problems, especially that of saving Domino from Arab slavers, while Leiter and he save the world. "Never Say Never Again" is a richly respectable James Bond thriller with many neat touches, but it never generates the air of danger than the franchise of his films. "
