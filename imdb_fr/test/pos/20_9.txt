The many other comments on the film speak for themselves - I just like to add that we showed it last week at about 30 in our community cinema and it got an overall average score of 8.6. So we would recommend it 100% to the public today, especially if he can see it on a real movie screen and then talk to others, as our audience did. <br /> <br /> The power of the performances of the entire troupe was incredible and mesmerizing. Of course, Finney and Courtenay were really the stars. but everyone was well started. For our afternoon audience, the majority of whom are "seniors", the fact that the plot can be followed with such ease due to the clarity of the speech and the wonderful non-technical use of the camera and of sound has been a great influence <br /> <br /> What a pleasure, it is often said, to see a very good British film: still not dated to twenty years: not full of blood or guts: not confusing because panic camera shots, and back and forth through the stories of time: no lousy sex scenes. Such views have even been expressed by some younger people.
