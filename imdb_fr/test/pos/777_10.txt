I did not expect much from this movie and I was slapped. Julie Walters, Rupert Grint and Laura Linney play wonderfully as main characters in this movie. Any teenager can understand parental control and the desire to reveal who you really are, which is basically what this movie is about. This is what Ben (Rupert Grint) does when he meets retired actress Evie (Julie Walters) and begins to express her ideas with words. It escapes slowly but surely from its shell and becomes much less troublesome. Every spectator feels the ups and downs of the film and the theater is filled with laughter 75% of the time. The film satisfies everything and I hope it will be released soon in all theaters, because many do not have the chance to see the film unless you live in the big cities. It is to see absolutely!
