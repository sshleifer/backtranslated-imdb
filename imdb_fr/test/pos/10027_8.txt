If you keep a rigid historical perspective apart from that, this movie is actually quite entertaining. There is action, adventure and love, and one of the most important fights of the time with Errol Flynn and Olivia de Havilland in the lead roles. As this chart makes clear, the image does not miss out on purists who seek 100 percent accuracy in their stories. To go beyond, just put aside the story book and enjoy the story as if it were a fiction. I know, I know, that it's difficult to do when you consider Custer's last fight at Little Big Horn and that it occupies a prominent place in the history of post-civil war America. So, I guess there is an unresolved dilemma with the photo, no matter how you look at it. <br /> <br /> There is a lot to take here though for the two hours of the photo plus the duration. Custer's arrival at West Point is probably the first puzzle, going back as he does in a military uniform. Sharp's practical joke (Arthur Kennedy) who installed him at the major's headquarters probably would have caused them trouble at the time. <br /> <br /> Ironically, many scenes from this military play for comedy, such as in Custer's first encounter with Libby Bacon, then meet with tea reader Callie (Hattie McDaniel). I had not noticed it before in other films, but McDaniel reminded me a lot of another of my favorite characters, the actor of the forty, Mantan Moreland. So much so that in one scene it seemed that maybe it was Moreland who hid her in a dress. In this spirit, the owl scene was also funny. <br /> <br /> With regard to Flynn, it is interesting to note that a year earlier, he had interpreted J.E.B. Stuart in front of the representation of General Custer by Ronald Reagan in "Santa Fe Trail", competing both to attract the attention of Olivia de Havilland. In this film, Reagan has put none of the arrogance and flamboyance into the Custer character whose story remembers, while in Flynn's portrait, it's more than obvious. But that has nothing to do with Richard Mulligan's about the military hero of "Little Big Man" in the 1970s. Let's just say that one was a little exaggerated. <br /> <br /> The best thing to do is to see how Custer persevered to maintain his name and not risk losing his money for a risky business venture. This and his loyalty to the men he has led in battle with the discipline he has developed throughout history. The most moving was the final confrontation with his great rival Sharp, just before getting into the Little Big Horn, in which he declared that hell or glory depended entirely on his point of view. Earlier, a similar remark could have given us the best insight into Custer's personality when he said, "You take glory with you when it's time to leave".
