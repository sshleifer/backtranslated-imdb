It is not difficult to imagine what is the main problem of a screenwriter who wants to have 18 characters as well written with a screen duration equal to that of a film lasting about 90 minutes. It's almost impossible not to fall into stereotypes and that's also what author-director Ralf Westhoff does here. Very few characters can be recognized as people you and I know in real life, many of them are simply characterized with two or three attributes and remain vague. I'm aware of that, but I always think that "Shoppen" is successful, that it accomplishes exactly what it wants. It's a film with very well written dialogues, a very good performance and a film that made me laugh a lot. I do not think this film wants to do a thorough analysis of loneliness in our modern society, or that it wants to be a moral commentary on speed-dating. It's a film about something that exists and about people and their motivation to use it. Funny and entertaining.
