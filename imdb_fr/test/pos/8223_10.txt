Flight's glance and Bill Irwin's Bagatelles clown are some of the funniest representations (in terms of physical comedy as well as verbal and visual gags) that I have ever seen. My dad recorded this special show during its first broadcast in the 80's and my family has always loved it. We quote it in both directions fairly regularly. It is a pity that copies are not readily available for sale. I have a bad VHS copy I acquired from a specialist distributor a few years ago, but Mr. Irwin's performance deserves adequate DVD processing with a restored version of the original performance and interviews with the performers producers and other examples of modern films. clowning. <br /> <br /> Bill Irwin's talent deserves more visibility among the general public than in his wide-spread and limited appearances. I often share "The Regard of Flight" with friends and although I am always greeted with a little skepticism when I mention that it is a mix of clowns and vaudeville, I still have no one to come to to see him without loving him. . In case the powers on the IMDb list are in power, consider publishing this work and other work by Bill Irwin.
