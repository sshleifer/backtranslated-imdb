This film is probably not the funniest I have ever seen and it certainly does not have much reductive value. In reality, it is actually a collection of vignettes linked together by a cowardly plot. However, this "make-as-I-go-go" attitude actually works to the advantage of the movie. "Tommy Boy" succeeds as a comedy for the same reasons as SNL stars: Farley and Spade played: their impromptu mischief and chaos at the right time makes them funny despite their immaturity.
