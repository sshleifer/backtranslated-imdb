It's a brilliant film. The story begins in Romania, where Billy Crystal plays the role of agent who can convince anyone to do anything. There's a really fun scene here, where Crystal is a child and talks to his father, a rabbi who wants to eat pork (filmophiles may know it's a parody of Crystal's religion) . He is primarily a talent scout and he is trying to find a suitable villain for his latest film. After discovering that the whole film had a terrible crew, he accidentally falls into a small river. Believing he's dead, big hands come to join him. He thinks later that he is in heaven. He discovers that he is not, but that he is in a monastery. Believing that God saved him, he becomes a monk, seeking who saved him. He then finds a man 7 feet 7 inches, which he throws like the perfect villain (he also recites Shakespeare!). Watch the movie and discover the rest!
