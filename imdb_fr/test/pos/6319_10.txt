Although this film may not be the next Evil Dead (God, maybe he knows it will, he's only been out for a year). Well worth a look. Do not expect a $ 10 million movie. Because you will be disappointed. Expect to be entertaining, laugh and enjoy the experience. All in all, this movie is MUCH better than many, if not all, low budget horror movies. I have seen films that cost more than 10 to 20 times more than what this film cost and have been 1,000,000 times worse. The efforts made in this film weigh heavily on the setbacks he suffered because of a limited budget. Movies are made to entertain, and this movie certainly does. In fact, this movie could even open new doors for you. It's available on Netflix if it's not your local video rental store. So watch him, then decide.
