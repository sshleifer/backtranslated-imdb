Soul Calibur is stronger than ever before ... with the new character creation and the cruel chronicle of the sword mode on the house version. <br /> <br /> The arcade version is more complete, although the list of characters is smaller than the house version, this version is certainly the prettiest of the two, eliminating all the "awkward / unrealistic" fighting styles. from the house version. If you're disappointed in any way by the home version, or think maybe it's "too much", you might find Soul Calibur's much more fun and simple game in the arcade. Do you think you have what it takes to become a legend?
