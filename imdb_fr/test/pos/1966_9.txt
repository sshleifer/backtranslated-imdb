River's Edge is not a PLEASANT movie to watch, but it's amazing. After watching it many years ago, I honestly think it would still have the ability to shock if it was released or redone or something like that. Perhaps no film ever made captured the essence of young suburban inertia like this terrifying film. Since this is based on a true story, it's even more troubling. Very well played and just unpleasant to watch several times, but also a little known masterpiece and a really important movie. Should be an obligation to watch shown nationwide in all high schools. Fantastic.
