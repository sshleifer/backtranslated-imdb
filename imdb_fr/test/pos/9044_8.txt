This is a 1972 Disney film. At the time, I was eleven years old and I really liked this movie. Nostalgic, I bought the DVDs of the three series of Dexter Riley movies and even now, at 46, I still liked them. It was all about fantasy, magic and pure pleasure. And it always is! I did not know which of the three films was first, second and last. So now, I have the official dates. On December 31, 1969, the computer was wearing tennis shoes - July 12, 1972, you see it now, you can not - February 6, 1975, the strongest man in the world. I still think the intermediate film was the best. The special effects were incredible in 1972 for us kids. I really recommend it to all ages.
