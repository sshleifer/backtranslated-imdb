Oh, it's a great job, of course. In fact, this film contains many of the best cinema scenes, or at least Bergman cinema. Liv Ullmann and Max von Sydow live up to your expectations. Do these two give poor performance? Sven Nykvist delivers a masterful cinematography, although unconventional. The script is pretty good, especially in individual scenes. Sometimes the film is lagging behind and the pace is uneven, but probably intentional. <br /> <br /> So what's the problem? Well, the movie is too dark for its own good. The other Bergman films are just as dark, but far from it. Finally, I just gave up and started to get a little irritated. I was often deeply touched during the film, but in the end I did not feel involved. It's a good movie, but I doubt I'll ever see it again, or suggest it to friends. Or, if I suggested it, I would be very sure to warn them of the future. 8/10.
