The crew of an American submarine discovers that it is HELL BELOW when fighting in the Adriatic in 1918. <br /> <br /> Although it is almost forgotten, this excellent war movie offers always a solid entertainment, thanks to a literary scenario, superior performance and incredible credibility. action scenes. <br /> <br /> Robert Montgomery and Walter Huston embody submarine officers under the stress of war and who oppose quickly, with dramatic and tragic results. As Montgomery is in love with Huston's daughter, Madge Evans, in a well-played role, the situation becomes even more complicated, both on the ground and under the waves. The spectator is torn between the two strong characters, one governed by his heart and the other by the rules. <br /> <br /> Robert Young appears as Montgomery's friend. Sterling Holloway creates a brief and vivid portrait of a convicted sailor. <br /> <br /> Eugene Pallette as torpedo master and Jimmy Durante as submarine cook form a fun and humorous team and tell the story with a lot of laughter. Durante suffers enormously in the nose and her obsession with amateur dentistry leads to chaotic encounters with British tars. <br /> <br /> Legends of cinema will recognize Babe London as an obese Italian girl; Maude Eburne as the wife of a British admiral and Paul Porcasi as Italian admiral - all uncredited. <br /> <br /> MGM has given the film absolutely exceptional production values, with underwater sequences particularly well produced. The claustrophobic compactness of the ship and the inevitable tension associated with submarine warfare are accurately described. Other moments of unexpected drama (Montgomery and Miss Evans captured at the top of a Ferris wheel blocked during an air raid) and hilarity (Durante boxing a kangaroo) fit neatly into the film to offer an experience completely satisfactory viewing.
