I noticed that the official IMDb magazine qualifies Leland as a sociopath. I believe this diagnosis is obviously and profoundly incorrect. <br /> <br /> This is a film about the sadness and the ability of a teenager in particular to see the sadness in everyday life, because she waits on every corner. , in advance of the unfolding of the life that it impacts. A sociopath is a person who can not sympathize with others and who, while understanding the difference between right and wrong, does not care about this difference. A sociopath is a subject who is at the center of his world, in total disregard of the impact of his actions on his entourage. One of the defining characteristics of a sociopath is that a true sociopath does not have the ability to feel empathy - does not have the ability to feel what others are feeling and does not correlate changes in mood of others resulting from his actions. acts. A sociopath can NOT feel the pain of others, nor understand that the pain of others is the result of his own actions. A sociopath is a person who is not completely trained. A vital part is missing in the psychological and emotional makeup of a true sociopath, thus making him immune to "speech therapy" and other treatment modalities involving human interaction and the exploration of personal feelings. Sociopathy is devastating even when the subject is treated and placed in a highly structured environment designed to contain the damage that the sociopath can cause to others. Many sociopaths operate more or less normally and never make noise in the criminal justice system, although they tend to leave a trail of emotional debris in their wake. <br /> <br /> Leland Fitzgerald is not a sociopath. It is a person who is blessed (or cursed) with the ability to predict what he considers to be the inevitable consequences and results of human interactions. Leland literally sees the sadness etched in the eyes and faces of the people around him, as he slowly assimilates and interiorizes the philosophy that life is a waste and that people slowly succumb to the inevitable and inexorable fact that, lacking a better metaphor, falling apart. People who fall in love and embrace and hug each other today turn into "pathetic" older couples. Electricity in the eyes of Leland's "mother" (a rich New York-based company who loves Leland and invites her to the house she shares with her family when she arrives in New York, alone and determined to stay in town at the age of 12) disappears when she explains to him, during her last visit to New York, that she learned that her husband was cheating on her all the time, that she had obtained the divorce that he was heartbroken everyone, and that this loss is an inevitable part of growing up. His eyes still reflect the light, but the electricity that lit them once is gone. This scene - this belated explanation is imminent - is crucial to understanding why Leland is committing a seemingly wild and senseless crime (killing the delayed younger brother of his ex-girlfriend). Leland knows what awaits him for this little boy: a life of unachievable goals, where one teaches only words that represent a danger, never to know the love of another human being, never feel such love and never connect with another person. More than any other character in this film, this little boy personifies everything that Leland considers inevitable and horrible for the world. Leland's act - killing this little boy - is, for him, an act of mercy, committed because it was the only thing he COULD do in a world where actions can not change the results. While a true sociopath knows that actions can change outcomes, but does not care about the harm these actions do to others, Leland does. What most people regard as a barbaric and horrifying act is, in Leland's eyes, the only decent thing he can do to relieve the suffering of one person. <br /> <br /> It would be comforting to be able to present this as an explanation of Leland's actions - comforting, but incomplete. In the end, "blame" for Leland's actions is elsewhere. As is often the case, there are no easy explanations or balms to apply to the indignant soul. Why did not Leland learn something that even the most pessimistic people usually recognize - sometimes - just sometimes - people stay in love, and relationships succeed and even the saddest lives are transformed? For Leland, there is no middle ground, no central core to which he can withdraw and regroup. There is only pain and sadness. One is tempted to blame his arrogant and deeply displeasing father - the brilliant writer (played by Kevin Spacey) - for not being present at critical moments in Leland's development, but given the rogue malice of this man, it could have been to be a blessing. Finally, this spectator was moved by an immense feeling of sadness. Why was Leland doomed to see the world with a veil of pessimism and depression? Leland's character is mature - the present, for example, when he repeatedly insists that no one is blamed for breaking up his girlfriend - is both stoic and heartbreaking. Stoic, in the sense that it is absolutely authentic, despite the heated denunciations of Leland's teacher. But heartbreaking, in that it generates less understanding than despair. Leland's indifference to his destiny is only a reflection of the absolute certainty of his belief that nothing really counts. Nothing he does can change his destiny. <br /> <br /> This is not sociopathy. That is, if so, its opposite opposite ......
