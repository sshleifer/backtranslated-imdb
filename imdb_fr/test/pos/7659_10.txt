Beautifully filmed, the expanding spirit of exploration of Gypsy culture in the context of their music. Browse a continent and discover the incredible musical styles of various groups of gypsy peoples. It's a little misleading to say that this movie is not narrated. He is masterfully told by the music itself, the slender melodies and subtitled lyrics tell a story much better than a narrator. See this film.
