I first saw "The Knowledge" during a Thames Television marathon at one of Los Angeles' local independent stations at the time of its creation. I loved the danger with UXB. <br /> <br /> The fact that a film I saw more than twenty years ago is so good in my memory is a testimony to its originality and the quality of the casting's performances. <br /> <br /> I looked for a copy of the DVD here in the United States and found none. I finally played and bought a British DVD on Ebay and was delighted to find that there was no region code. So those of us who would like to see this little gem can get a copy.
