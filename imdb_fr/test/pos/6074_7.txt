The English Patient is one of those films that deserves the most praise. I say most often, because this film, although very serious, intense, deep and really thought out, still suffers from certain disadvantages. First, why, oh why are modern movies so long? It lasts more than two hours and from time to time it becomes very difficult to concentrate and follow the extremely serious plot. I say, if the movie was an hour later, it would only be good. However, we have what we have. Winner of several Oscars, The English Patient is always very good. It is a profound and insightful treatise of the human soul, of love and betrayal, of war and cowardice, of violence and courage. Ralph Fiennes is a superb actor. Her hero, neurotic and silent, is an enigmatic person, ready to do everything to save the life of her lover. He's great, even though half of the time he's crippled. He is the strongest link here. Juliette Binoche is as usual very convincing and sweet. She adds a lot to her excellent play and the storyline of the love affair with this Sikh officer. Willem Defoe, Colin Firth and Christine Scott Thomas are all here, all huge and very strong. And then there is the desert of Egypt, then there is a deep and cloudless sky, green groves of Italy. Nature is there, even when people are dying, bombs are roaring, landmines are exploding. The war is here too. It's obvious, terrible and bloody. Then there are corpses, horrible and bloody bodies, then naked bodies, adultery and everything. I do not know what to say. So much of a splendid actor's work, of realism, of brutality that the war brings. This is not a movie for relaxation. It makes you think.
