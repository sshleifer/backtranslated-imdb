Yes, it's Sean Connery who plays Bond again, who looks more alive than ever since the first time they made this movie, in 1965, when it was called "Thunderball". But the language is so strong in the cheek that one wonders if Connery does not use some tricks observed of his friend and more humorous successor, Roger Moore. <br /> <br /> Moore is my favorite Bond, but Connery succeeds strong case for himself in this unusual outing. "Never Say Never Again", James Bond's only serious film not to be directed under the aegis of the classic Eon Bond series, is an irreverent return to the well. Sweet in action, she is nevertheless strong in character and intelligent dialogue. <br /> <br /> Bond, we see him right away, is a man in disfavor. No matter how many times he has saved the world, his new boss thinks little about his fat lifestyle. "Too many free radicals, that's your problem ... Caused by eating too much red meat, white bread, martinis." "Then I'll cut the white bread, sir," Bond replied smartly. <br /> <br /> An early bout in a spa is the action's climax, with Bond and an attacker making their way. a kitchen, a bedroom and a laboratory before Bond finally disables his opponent, ironically without the help of free radicals. Humor is generously applied in the film, a little more skillfully than most of Moore's releases, although Connery seems to have more fun indulging in Moore's less egotistical example. <br /> <br /> Was it because he was making a lot of the crude? Or did it work for less stingy producers? Be that as it may, the screenplay serves his casual style well and the result is richer and more entertaining than Connie's two previous releases in Eon Bond, "You Only Live Twice" and "Diamonds Are Forever". <br /> <br /> The 1980s were not good for Bond, whether Connery, Moore or Timothy Dalton. Leggings, video games and ugly sports cars are all highlighted, and the sunglasses Bianca Jagger Klaus Maria Brandauer that we see dressed in his first scene are not favorable. Forget the first impressions. Brandauer's role as chief villain, Maximilian Largo, is one of the best of all Bond films. Brandauer pleasantly plays the threat and mania of his character. At one point he allows Bond to move freely in his meeting room, with a martini in his head, and his dancing eyes and his enraged and engaging smile make him a fascinating society. <br /> <br /> The best thing about this movie, Outside of Connery, is Bond's daughters, filmed with more attention to personality than most of Bond's films, a testimony of filmmaker Douglas Slocombe and director Irvin Kirshner. Barbara Carrera has been nominated for a Golden Globe for her role as the wicked Fatima Blush, as crazy as Largo and even more enjoyable to watch. It does not last the whole movie. you almost need to leave so you can focus on others. <br /> <br /> Kim Basinger's breasts and asses should have been accompanied by their own agents for the duration of their movie, but I'm not complaining. Basinger is a rare beauty who, in her first role as mistress of Largo, associates an incredible hotness with a childish vulnerability that brings out the Bond in me, and many more, I suspect it. (His lips and cheekbones are also very sweet.) <br /> <br /> This is not a well-constructed movie. It's an imitation of a better Bond movie with a neat story, a terrible score and a flat end. But he did have Connery, who proves it was the definitive position on the film's final secretive agent, even if he stole a page or two from my 007, Mr. Moore. The end result is quite fun, so I do not complain.
