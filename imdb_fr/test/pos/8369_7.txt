It's not the best movie you can see, but it's still very refreshing. Of course, he has his faults, his humiliating moments and, at the same time, he is different from everything you are used to living and is funny, only French can tell you. You may recognize a little Amelie's masterpiece when you see the opening. I give it 7 out of 10, but I recommend it anyway if you are tired of the usual boredom that you can rent in the video library.
