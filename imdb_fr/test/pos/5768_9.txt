I saw him when he came out for the first time and I thought it was a genius job. but I must admit that I was clearly a minority at the time. <br /> <br /> For me, the progressive madness of the owners of Guest House Paradiso only gets better, throughout the film, with one of the most hilarious. reaches its climax for a movie. <br /> <br /> But I would not recommend it to Mother. <br /> <br /> Lovers of comic-style humor will love this movie; there are hidden subtle jokes, but they are usually flattened quickly by a comic frying pan. Rik Mayall and Ade Edmondson are superb, and impassive, unsuspecting guests are also excellent.
