from the plot like Vertigo or Brian DePalma's Obsession, to Peter Chase's score that recalls the sounds of Bernard Herrmann, this little pearl seems to be seen shortly. Remarkable interpretation of Romane Boeringer and Vincent Cassel in a bohemian Paris of the famous Thierry Arbogast. A little cult! It is unfortunate that the only versions available on DVD are the French version and the English version. Directed by a controversial artist like Gilles Mimouni, it could be considered as a small tribute to the masterpieces of cinema. It is a French film, and like all, not for all, we could say a test cinema. Even if it has not been made public, it could be remembered for several reasons.
