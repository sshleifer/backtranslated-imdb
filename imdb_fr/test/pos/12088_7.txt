First of all, I want to emphasize that I really enjoyed watching this documentary. Not only was there good music, but the plans and editing were also wonderful. However, all these positive points about the film do not change the fact that it plays according to the orientalist clich√© of the "oriental occidental encounter" which disturbs many Turks like me. Okay, this film tells the story of Turkish traditional and contemporary music with great elegance, which is a good thing, which would show Europeans and ignorant Americans that this country is not just about killing Armenians and Kurds. However, the film's problematic is that it looks at what it defines as "is" the eyes of "the west". I mean, as a jazz musician says in the movie, maybe there is no east or west, maybe it's just a myth, a lie created by the leaders of the "western" countries in order to keep fear and hostility alive could continue to rule the world and "keep the money flowing"? <br /> <br /> Why do not you think about that?
