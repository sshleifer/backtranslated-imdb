I really liked this movie - not so much for the story (which was ok, but a little slow in places), but especially for the incredibly beautiful landscapes of Greece and the Greek Islands! Susan Sarandon is quite engaging as a carefree loving interest of John Cassavetes - a man "on the edge of the abyss". But the landscape! Oh oh oh!
