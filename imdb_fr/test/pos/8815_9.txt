This film was hilarious. It gave a somewhat comical glimpse of the British scene, which, if you really look at it, is a funny thing. The characters in this movie were so realistic for those of us who watched here at home that it was like watching a movie about ourselves. <br /> <br /> There were some pivotal scenes that really made this movie work: preparing scenes; the scene "Find me a real doctor"; the white background scene showing each character in a total wreckage state, ending with the infamous line "What am I saying?" and comedown-sunup scenes. I experienced these moments myself and hysterically laughed at my own ridiculous behavior. <br /> <br /> I can not give this movie a 10 because it does not correspond to Groove, which seemed out of place. this world, but it certainly has its moments. The staging and the work of the camera are superb, the special effects are worth mentioning and the acting is fantastic. <br /> <br /> After waiting a long time to see this movie, I'm happy to say that I was not disappointed. I hope to see more of the writer / director in the future.
