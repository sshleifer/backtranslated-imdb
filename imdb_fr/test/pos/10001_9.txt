As an amateur golfer who knows a little bit about the history of this sport, I was delighted by Disney's sensitivity to the problems of the golf class in the early 20th century. The film is a good description of the psychological battles that Harry Vardon has led in himself, from his childhood trauma of being expelled to his own failure to break that glass ceiling that prevents him from being accepted as an equal. in the English golf society. Similarly, the young Ouimet is going through his own class struggles, being a mere cadet in the eyes of high-level Americans who mock his attempts to rise above his rank. <br /> <br /> What I liked the most is how this class theme is manifested in the characters of Ouimet's parents. His father is a working-class drone who sees the value of hard work but who is intimidated by the upper class. his mother, however, recognizes his son's talent and desire and encourages him to pursue his dream of competing with those who consider him inferior. <br /> <br /> Finally, the golf scenes are well photographed. Although the course used in the film is not the venue of the historic tournament, the small freedoms taken by Disney do not detract from the beauty of the film. There is a Disney moment in billiards; otherwise, the viewer does not really think about Disney. The end, as in "Miracle", is not a Disney creation, but a story that only human history could have written.
