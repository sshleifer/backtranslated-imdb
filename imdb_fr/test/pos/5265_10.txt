As a screenwriting veteran at Richland College in Dallas and a former MGM screenwriter at the time of the Honest Films, I'm thrilled to have accidentally clicked Channel 33 in Dallas tonight and watch this enchanting film in which Betty White is GORGEOUS and makes a desire for the good old days really good movies before Hollywood starts to hit all that shit for teens. If a producer listens, I would like to say that we are enough people over 60 who will gladly pay a movie to see a film without arms, without killing, without special effects, without sex and without violence and just a good touching story of human relations that leaves you a warm feeling, as this film did for me.
