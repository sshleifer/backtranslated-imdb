The proof that it is not necessary for a film to have a multilevel story and other sophisticated elements to be a good movie. Although the story may spread in many directions, especially in a more sociological way (people are thirsty for money), it seems like it's perfect like that. Through many sudden changes, the viewer is led to the end, without unnecessary complications and without allowing the viewer to take their eyes off the screen. <br /> <br /> But playing for me is not so good. With the exception of Lindsey McKeon, the others were average, even worse. In some scenes, they just stare in front of themselves. With the exception of Lindsey who was more convincing. It's a very simple movie to relax and enjoy. <br /> <br /> 7/10
