This sequel is brilliant and is the latest film on which Donald Pleasance (Dr.Loomis) worked before his death. I loved the new direction taken by the film in the story instead of just Michael Myers who wanted to kill his family. I love all this series and apart from the first and second films, it's by far the best.
