Otto Preminger, director of "The Moon Is Blue", tackles an even more taboo subject in his controversial 1955 version, "The Man with the Golden Arm". While he had infuriated the Motion Picture Association of America by using the words "virgin" and "mistress" in his 1953 comedy "The Moon Is Blue," Preminger went far beyond what any movie had attempted to do with "The man with the skin". Golden Arm "since Dick Powell published his epic law and order" To the End of the Earth "(1946) on Countering International Drug Trafficking, based on Nelson Algren's award-winning novel 1950's uncompromising 119-minute black-and-white melodrama deals with heroin addiction.First, when Preminger's film was released, the Motion Picture Association of America did not issue its seal of approval, because the filmmakers have described drug addiction.This innovative film was considered the first major film to treat narcotics from the point of view of the dope diabol and actually showed the paraphernalia that junkies used to The production code stipulated that filmmakers should refrain from showing characters using illicit narcotics, but United Artists published this unique image of Frank Sinatra that reminded him ort√© more than 4 million dollars. <br /> <br /> The critical and commercial success of "The Man with the Golden Arm" eviscerated the Production Code. As a result, the MPAA has changed the code so that filmmakers can explore other taboo topics, such as drug addiction, abduction, abortion and prostitution. The film received three Oscar nominations. Oscar nominations went to Sinatra (Best Actor), Joseph C. Wright and Darrell Silvera (Best Artistic Decoration), Black and White and Elmer Bernstein to Best Music for a Drama or Comedy. Indeed, Elmer Bernstein has made a name for himself with his jazzy score. The producers had considered entrusting the lead role to Marlon Brando, but Sinatra beat Brando to the forefront. Eleanor Parker, Kim Novak, Arnold Stang, Darren McGavin and Robert Strauss shared the spotlight with Ole Blue Eyes. McGavin was particularly memorable as a sordid heroin trafficker, while Eleanor Parker embodied the protagonist's wife with a very dark secret that shocked her herself. <br /> <br /> "The Golden Armed Man" refers to the ability of the protagonist Frankie Machine to manipulate a deck of cards. Frankie distributes cards to Zero Schwiefka (Robert Strauss of "Stalag 17"), but he has been away from Chicago for six months in a federal hospital for narcotics, recovering from a heroin addiction. Frankie not only licked this habit, but he also learned to play drums and plans to embark on a musical career. Although Frank is optimistic about his future, he finds himself facing his past once back on his lands. Schwiefka wants him to treat again for him, and Nifty Louie Fomorowski (Darren McGavin of "Counter-Attack") is trying to encourage him to resume her use of heroin. Meanwhile, Frankie goes home to his disabled wife, Zosh (Eleanor Parker of "Escape from Fort Bravo"), who handles him with guilt. Frankie was drunk when he had a car accident and Zosh found himself in a wheelchair. Frankie arrives with high hopes and a battery, but Zosh sees no future for him as a musician and urges to return to work for Schwiefka. Frankie plans to go on a musical promotion and one of his friends, Sparrow (Arnold Stang of "My Sister Eileen"), rides a business suit in a department store for Frankie. After Frankie refuses to work for Schwiefka because he goes to see musical agent Harry Lane (Will Wright of "The Wild One"), Schwiefka turns Frank and Sparrow into police. Meanwhile, Schwiefka asks Brach department store to drop the shoplifting charges. The costume was worth $ 37.00. Frankie agrees to resume negotiations for Schweifka and the burglar takes him out. Shortly after, despite her resolve to avoid the use of heroin, Frankie breaks down and pays Louie the $ 2.00 for a repair. <br /> <br /> Finally, Frankie meets Harry Lane and the latter warns him: he surprises Frankie in the news that he will have nothing to do with him. What Frankie does not know is that Zosh has recovered her ability to walk, but she uses her guilt for the accident to hold him back. Zosh is also jealous of her downstairs neighbor, Molly Novotny (Kim Novak of "Picnic"), Frankie's former darling who drinks at a nearby bar called the Safari Club. When Zosh complains of headaches that Frankie inflicts on his drumming, Frankie installs them in Molly's apartment. Schwiefka and Louie plan a big game of poker with Sam Markette (George E. Stone of "Guys and Dolls") and Williams (George Mathews of "Gunfight at the OK Corral"), two great players who have heard about Frank and his legendary "golden arm". Schwiefka and Louie persuade a reluctant Frankie to negotiate for $ 250. After a first set of wins, Frankie begins to lose and he can not reverse his bad luck. In fact, Frankie spends about two days to treat. Exhausted, nerves pulling him to the ground and desperately seeking a solution, he falls apart on the second day and Markette and Williams catch him cheating. Louie refuses to give Frankie a solution, so Frankie knocks him out and ransacked his apartment for the heroine. <br /> <br /> Preminger does not punch in "The Man with the Golden Arm" and the film is rather disappointing. None of the characters here are sympathetic from a distance. Essentially, they are either scammers or jostled. Sinatra gives another dynamite performance as do McGavin and Parker. Admittedly, "The Golden-Armed Man" has lost much of its impact over the last 50 years, but it is still a historical film.
