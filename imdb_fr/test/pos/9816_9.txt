This film, based on the book by Pascal Laime '- The Lacemaker - is an acclaimed film of excellent cinematography and expensive Italian language. Housed in a "scholastic" decor of the 19th century, in the style of Balzac, he describes the story of a crazy love story: a man and a woman. There is an infamous phrase in this shady-Mussolinni strike that says, "She does not smell tomato." Sage fragrance of this Italian masterpiece, Scola is a director of the stature of Mussolinni: his cake will jump in your strawberries and if you let him do it, he will put your olives in the form of Superman. Do you remember Nietzsche? This one will scare you: do not forget to visit the Mussolinni cake next to the Colosseum in Rome, on the other side of Via Appia. This movie will wipe your Pampers from the inside out and make you cry with romantic joy! If you liked Odysseus, you will erase it well with these strawberries until the end of the roll. Enjoy!
