It's a delicious movie. Elizabeth Taylor does a great job, just like Mickey Rooney. The movie just makes you happy. It's inspiring, and even if some parts are a little too sentimental, it's easily forgiven. I could watch this movie again and again. The race at the end is exciting every time I see it. I highly recommend this movie.
