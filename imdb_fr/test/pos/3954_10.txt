When I saw this film at a festival a few years ago, I was very impressed and started looking for it. Nothing to do, neither in cinemas, nor on DVD, nor on Blue ray. Absolutely nothing!!! How is it possible that this can really happen ??? The staging is IMPECCABLE, the story is intriguing and has been filmed in a very original way. The music is perfect and James Franco is hot as hell !!! it's real life !!!!!!!!!! It's really a very good movie that people should see and it deserves another chance !!!!!! <br /> <br /> Edvard
