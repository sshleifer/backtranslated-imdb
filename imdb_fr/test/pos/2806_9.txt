I must say that this film was excellently produced and exceeds the ratings as a typical sci-fi movie! I enjoyed it .. it's a sci-fi movie, if you want a thriller, look at another channel .. that's what scifi fans want. Greatly produced by one of Sci-Fi's best producers, Scot Vandiver! OK, the special effects were not great, but what a nice distribution! We could have used a little more money for the effects, but again, what science fiction has big budget effects. Stop complaining and switch channels if you do not like these types of movies. Movies like Mission Impossible and Braveheart are great, but they are not science fiction movies. Sci fi produces excellent films like Sabretooth, Alien Hunters, etc. do .. keep them to churn!
