I think it's a very good movie and very funny. The story is so funny. The daughter Nicole brings her father Andr√© in very embarrassing situations In order to impress the boy of his dreams, the girl claims that her father is her lover. Just see !! Heigl is as beautiful as Nicole, perhaps too beautiful; I do not know why she would need to lie to hook someone up? Gerard Depardieu does very well in this comedy, he is so much fun to watch. If you like comedy and romantic film, you just have to see that !!! I think you can see this movie many times and you will always have a good laugh. <br /> <br /> To impress the boy of his dreams, the girl claims that her father is her lover.
