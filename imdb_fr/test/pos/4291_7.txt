Emily Watson and Tom Wilkinson together - what a treat! Rupert Everett and Linda Bassett complete the roles of supporting the quartet of lies and plot. Yet, at the heart of all this, each character maintains a hint of decency - the moral conscience maintained despite obvious contradictions. "The contradictions are the source of all movement and all life." As these words are true. Watson's Anne Manning is at the heart of this intrigue - she is the central consciousness on which the other three clung. She is undemoured decency. <br /> <br /> The circumstances of the lie are unique to each: one to defend one's professional name; one to hold back because of pressure from the family / partner; we just do not want to deal with the consequence; Ironically, you can not believe the truth and lie to save friendship. These are all precarious situations. This is where the plot lies - fascinating to watch how everyone approaches truth and lies. Contradictions, indeed. Despite the apparent disgrace, decency and the heart remain strong. <br /> <br /> The treatment of the subject and the way in which each character behaves are delivered with brilliance and simplicity. It's not sensational or complex like another "Where the Truth Lies" movie 2005. Credits from Fellowes' writing and the subtle performance of Watson and Wilkinson. There is some warmth that comes out of the seemingly audacious or frustrating lies. Underneath all, human frailty is not excluded, they were good enough to say. And over the course of history, the turn of events has brought satisfaction and smiles to the way the two Manning seem to have grown and matured in their relationship. <br /> <br /> You could say that there is no obvious action drama or thrilling scenes in "Separate Lies", but the plot is there and will hold your attention. Deserving production efforts include the cinematography of Tony Pierce-Roberts (a veteran of the Merchant-Ivory films) and the music of Stanislas Syrewicz, with an atmosphere and sound reminiscent of the composer Zbignew Priesner (directed by Krzysztof Kieslowski, including: Bleu 1993). It is a British film not to be missed. <br /> <br /> Emily Watson (Anne, The Wife): Beginning in 1996 with Break the Waves; Hilary and Jackie 1998; The 2000 Luzhin Defense; Gosford Park 2001; Punch-Drunk Love, Red Dragon, Balance in 2002. <br /> <br /> Tom Wilkinson (James, the Husband): The Full Monty 1997; The Governess, Rush Hour (as villain) in 1998; In the Bedroom 2001, Normal (movie on HBO) 2003, Eternal Sunshine of Spotless Mind 2004, recently under the name of Father Moore in: The exorcism of Emily Rose 2005 alongside Laura Linney. <br /> <br /> Rupert Everett (Bill): It's just lovely in "The wedding of my best friend" in 1997 against Julia Roberts and wonderful in "An ideal husband" 1999 d: Oliver Parker, a piece Oscar Wilde's theater. Recently as Sherlock Holmes with Ian Hart as Dr. Watson, in PBS Mystery: Sherlock Holmes and the case of Silk Stockings 2004. <br /> <br /> Linda Bassett (Maggie): she was very effective in as long as Ella Khan alongside Om Puri in "East is East" in 1999.
