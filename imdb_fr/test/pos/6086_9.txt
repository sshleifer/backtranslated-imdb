It is an oddly powerful and moving experience to see "The English Patient" after the death of Anthony Minghella. Most of his work is devoted to a breaking point. The endless moral struggle of those who, consciously, walk a very thin line. In "The Talented Mr. Ripley," Minghella leaves Patricia Highsmith's amorous Tom Ripley to bring the murderer to consciousness. In "Breaking And Entering", Minghella gives the character of Jude Law the need to confess and the rewards are extremely moving. Here, in "The English Patient", the characters in love are never very far from their feelings of guilt. Ralph Finnes and Kristin Scott Thomas are amazing. They strip their characters of any pretense in a convincing complicity with us, the public. Juliette Binoche is simply spectacular and her scenes with the wonderful Naveen Andrews are filled with a sensual "minghellian" innocence. Anthony Minghella gave us movies that were, in one way or another, this elusive mix of art and commerce. He was true to himself but thought of his audience. He knew how to press our buttons without betraying his. The opus of Minghella has something clear, honest and amazing. I miss him already but I am grateful for the reflection of his soul that he left behind him.
