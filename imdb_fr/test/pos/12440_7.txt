The happiest days of your life feature some of the greatest British comedy talent of its era, in a traditionally far-fetched, high-class fashion. In general, this is a sibilant visit to the stuffy English behavior, the girls-only school providing an ideal setting for passing encounters. Margaret Rutherford, Alastair Sim and above all! - Joyce Grenfell are all fantastic and make us laugh while expressing their horror at the situation. As the movie progresses, things get complicated with the school's visit to parents, a highlight for parents. <br /> <br /> At this point, I will mention again Joyce Grenfell and her wonderful character Miss Gossage. She is so extraordinarily innocent, stupid, excusive and ineffective that she seems to steal the entire movie. She laughs the loudest of the movie when she flirts with a male teacher ("Call me, sausage!"). <br /> <br /> Although some movies are slow or dated, and not always very engaging, maintains most of its brilliance and barely stops for romance. Good for a silly and harmless laugh. <br /> <br /> 7/10
