Taking place in 1794, the second year of the French republic formed after the execution of Louis XVI, this film describes the power struggle between the revolutionary leaders Danton (Gerard Depardieu, the best) and Robespierre (impressive performance of the Polish actor Wojciech Pszoniak). The moderate revolutionary Danton returned to Paris from his country of residence where he was deposed as chairman of the Public Security Committee the previous year by Robespierre. He opposes the "reign of terror" that resulted in the execution of thousands of citizens, mainly by the guillotine, suspected of being opposed to the Revolution. Danton is confident in supporting ordinary people and tries to persuade Robespierre to limit bloodletting. But Robespierre and the Committee fear that the popularity of Danton will lead to their overthrow and make Danton and his supporters judge for treason. This was the first French film directed by Andrzej Wajda after his arrival in France from Poland. Its Polish film company was closed by the government because of its support for the Solidarity trade union, which opposed the Polish government in the late 1970s and early 1980s. His previous film "Man Of Iron" (1981) dealt with the Solidarity trade union and its leader Lech Walesa, and it is easy to draw comparisons between Walesa's relationship with the Polish leader, General Jaruselski, and that between Danton. and Robespierre. Danton / Walesa is the voice of reason opposite to Robespierre / Jaruselski who maintains dictatorial power despite the loss of support from the people they claim to represent. The film is based on the Polish play "The Danton Affair" written by Stanislawa Przybyszewska in the 1930s. The film has been criticized by some for its static and theatrical nature. But what the film does is to focus on behind-the-scenes committee meetings and on the scenes in the National Assembly and in the courtroom rather than on the activities in the streets of Paris.
