I can not understand why people are surprised that this film makes no sense. It never made sense. (Duh!) The writers were completely exhausted at the time on Frodis.) It was supposed to entertain and mock, and both to perfection. <br /> <br /> Monkees are good actors. They would not have been hired if they were not good actors. Mike has a penchant for impasse and darkness, Micky is the best in psychotic comedy, Davy is a Broadway veteran and Peter made people believe he was as stupid in the real life. Do not tell me they can not do it, because they can certainly do it. <br /> <br /> They can also write. Of course, Jack and Bob get the single generic, but in reality, they had a big hand on this scenario of the Monkees, who were also in this smoky room. <br /> <br /> (It's absolutely impossible to ruin this film) Head is very highly symbolic. Among the most memorable elements, there is the black box, which was actually based on two elements: the image of Monkee to which the boys were linked, and the real black box on the lot Screen Gems where the group was kept between two takes. There is so much more symbolism in the film that I let you watch it and understand it. <br /> <br /> The music is great. "Circle Sky" is one of the best tunes of Papa Nez, and "Porpoise Song" and "As We Go Along" will charm you. If you'd rather be weird, then "Ditty Diego", "Can You Dig It?", And "Long Title" should be satisfying, great songs that they are. And then there's "Daddy's Song," a tribute to the days of Davy on Broadway, and the editing / color programming for this sequence is superb. (At least for '68.) <br /> <br /> Oh, for those of you who do not watch a "PG" movie, you miss it. Especially since Head was rated R in 1968. The rating was lowered about twenty years later! <br /> <br /> Where was I now? Oh yes, "We were talking about beliefs and beliefs and conditioning ..."
