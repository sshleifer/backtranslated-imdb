What was Archbishop Tutu's quote at the end of the film about a person's past? This film was very disturbing to look at in the sense that it was a true story and to think that humanity is still so cruel after all those years that make me feel ashamed <br /> <br /> everyone is human and everyone has the right to live their lives in peace and harmony <br /> <br /> live and let live <br /> <br /> if anyone knows the quote please let -Me Me Thank You <br /> <br /> This movie must be viewed much more publicly than real events as horrible as those shown in the film should be known to all, in the hope that things will change as soon as possible possible.
