Goldie Hawn's portrayal of a simple young woman, stuck in a love triangle with an older man, a dentist, plays with such Walter Matthau passion that she wins the Academy Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role, in 1969. <br /> The film, however, is another tribute to Ingrid Bergman. Rarely have we ever seen her in a comedy and she's totally downright mad here as a dedicated dental nurse who's embarking on a ploy for Matthau to tell Hawn they're married? <br /> such a joy to see Matthau and Bergman fall for each other here. Their story is an accidental love story in the making. <br /> <br /> As a friend of Matthau, Jack Weston is also fabulous as a project partner. Rick Lenz is also supporting Hawn's new boyfriend.
