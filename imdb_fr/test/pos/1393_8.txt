I saw this film on TV under the name of SCREAMERS and I liked it. I heard an interesting story about this movie. When Roger Corman released it to readers in the summer of 1981, his trailer service sent a trailer in advance that was not actually a film sequence. It is apparently a naked woman pursued around a laboratory set up by a monster. At the opening of the film at the drive-in, angry customers complained that they had not seen the film they had paid to see. The theater owners called Corman and said that their guests felt ripped off. Corman had to obtain copies of the sequence and send the film positive to the owners of theaters to merge themselves. Since the film was never part of the film's negative, it did not appear in a video, DVD, or TV show. Has anyone ever seen these pictures? Someone who saw this movie during a drive-in in the summer of 1981 remembers it?
