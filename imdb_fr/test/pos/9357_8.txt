When a man is found dead, a soldier becomes the main suspect. Without a doubt the best film to present three Roberts and all are in shape. Young is a cold-headed policeman who smokes a pipe and investigates the murder, Mitchum is the suspect's concerned friend, and Ryan is a well-guarded soldier with something to hide. Grahame has a brief but effective role as a femme fatale. The future Tarzan Barker is a bit like a soldier. This film deals with anti-Semitism, a topic also covered in "Gentleman's Agreement", winner of the Oscar for Best Picture, released the same year. It is solidly made by Dmytryk, which creates an effective film noir atmosphere.
