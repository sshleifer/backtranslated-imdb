It was such a good series for the blacks at the time. We liked it so much. It was the only show about black middle-class families at the time. Please publish this on DVD. I know a lot ... a lot of people still talking about the show. If so, I'm sure many young blacks will find it interesting and interesting. The show covered many topics such as racism, intra-racial discrimination, teenage pregnancy, sibling rivalry, single parenthood, peer pressure and more. The series ended so abruptly and left the fans speechless and wondering why it was removed from the show. Since then, we have seen only a few actors and actresses. Please release it on DVD as soon as possible.
