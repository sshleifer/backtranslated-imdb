If you put Seinfeld aside, it's the best comedy of all time, without a doubt! Just awesome! <br /> <br /> "The King of Queens" has just finished his eighth season of domestic happiness. Located in the working-class suburb of Queens, New York, the show follows Doug Heffernan (Kevin James), a friendly delivery man, and his wife, Carrie Heffernan, spitfire's legal secretary, exploring the daily challenges of love. , life, family and marriage. <br /> <br /> Doug and Carrie deal with everyday national realities that reflect our times and allow us to make fun of ourselves. Their love for each other ultimately carries them through every dilemma they face, whether it's fixing Doug with food or Carrie's obsession with expensive clothes. <br /> <br /> Doug and Carrie also care for the third Heffernan household member, the father of the Heffernan family, who has a heavy widowhood, Arthur Spooner (Jerry Stiller), his father, who lives in their basement. His constant presence and his often strange behavior are added to their daily adventures. Doug and Carrie came across an unorthodox solution to reduce their burden and please Arthur during his regular excursions with naive dog walker Holly (Nicole Sullivan). Doug's friends, Deacon Palmer (Victor Williams), Spence Olchin (Patton Oswalt) and his cousin Danny Heffernan (Gary Valentine) complete the cast with their "masculine" humor and varied perspectives. <br /> <br /> In a way that evokes "The Honeymooners", THE KING OF THE QUEEN draws inspiration from the situations of everyday life. Last season alone, Doug "lent" Carrie to a deacon without a wife to help her prepare for her Thanksgiving dinner. Heffernans suffer from annoyance and financial hardship related to mold damage to their home; and Doug and Carrie trying to copy a couple whose photos of a life more adventurous than those of Doug and Carrie were accidentally taken home. We also saw Arthur become jealous of a new dog Holly added to his course and Doug discover that his overprotective parents have replaced his Rocky childhood dog three times behind his back. Throughout the series, the series features James' incredible physical comedy, Remini's sharp wit and Stiller's unique comic presence. <br /> <br /> You can not ... you should not miss it!
