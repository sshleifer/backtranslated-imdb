I caught this on local Mexican TV at 2:00 am and decided to give it a chance because it is based on a real case that deals with the killing of the typical American family (a father, a mother and a young son). ). <br /> <br /> At first, the clues suggest that Walker would be the murderer because he had strong differences with his father. Shortly after, when Walker and Luke are taken to the sheriff's service. after being examined by the machine to detect lies, things are very different ... <br /> <br /> In addition, when Walker and Luke go to an appointment with their father's lawyer , they learn that Luke would receive $ 200,000 and Walker is out of heresy. Luke immediately buys a convertible. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it's an excellent mystery film about treason, ambition, feelings and cold blood, very cold. <br /> <br /> I know the real names have been changed but the experience remains the same. Try this movie. I know there are hundreds of "real murder cases" or similar events, but this one is really worthy of it. Pure quality on the game, the direction and the plot.
