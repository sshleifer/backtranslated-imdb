With a cast like this, I knew that the acting would be great. Still, I was cautious, as I always follow. Would that maintain the feeling of the first movie? Could they replicate the tension and thrill of Ocean's 11 masterful steer? We will never know because they have not tried. At least, not as I expected. Instead, they made a light and really funny parody of the heist genre. If you want a seizing and logical holdup, do not look at it. If you want to laugh, with witty dialogues, weird characters and an absolutely great scene where Julia Roberts must pretend to be an imitation, then you'll love Ocean's 12.
