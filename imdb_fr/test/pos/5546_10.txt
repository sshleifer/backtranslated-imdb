It's a romantic comedy, so it's really a fairy tale, but an unconventional one. Cinderella, rather than living in the ashes, lives in an overshadowed castle in the suburbs with a handsome husband who is not a prince. She finds her prince, but he is not so handsome. Instead of starting with a castle, she gets a little stroll in Manhattan. <br /> <br /> Pfeifer, Stockwell and Ruehl lead a cast of fully realized characters, although a bit exaggerated. <br /> <br /> Demme has reached the highest level of filmmaking in my mind. It creates a world I want to go to: a Manhattan neighborhood and a street life teeming with life and community. <br /> <br /> I want IMDb to be linked to other reviews. I would like to know what the other authors of this film hate. I am always looking for lots of laughs and good places to "live" for at least an hour.
