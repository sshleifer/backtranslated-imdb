The first time I saw the Society of Satan, I was 12 years old. I saw her in a small town in central Washington State. She played before Tales from the crrypt, which we left early, because my sisters were already scared by the Brotherhood of Satan. Overall, I thought it was a very good movie. The start was good, we had just sat down and this tank numbered a number on this family run. <br /> <br /> What struck me in the film is the landscape of the city in which it was shot. area around Chelan WA where I saw the movie especially when they drove to the Hillsboro town, where is the movie, a small town in southwestern New Mexico. I always liked LQ Jones and Strother Martin as well as Charles Bateman who was on Get Smart, another show that I like. I gave a 7 to the film and later, when I had the opportunity to see Tales from the crypt, I thought the Brotherhood of Satan was better.
