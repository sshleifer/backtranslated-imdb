I've always loved old movies, but it's one of my favorite ten ... it has all the charm, the quaint charm of the 1940s and a good old-fashioned romance and it's hilarious, in more! Barbara Stanwick is an independent single woman who writes articles about cooking and family life in a famous magazine ... on the pretext that she is a married housewife. Even the president of the magazine is under this illusion. Enter a handsome GI (played by the talented Dennis Morgan) who has just been rescued from a raft with his buddy. Her simplest wish is to stay at the inviting hostel where she so eloquently writes and relax with her famous homemade meals. She must now frantically find a way to save her work and reputation ... add to that that her fianc√© is in a hurry to tie the knot is useless. The humor is superb and the chemistry between the main characters is very funny. Add the character actor nicknamed "Cuddles" (which fits that name perfectly), he becomes even more adorable. It became my film not to be missed in which I huddle with a cup of cocoa every Christmas season. A wonderful and enjoyable movie to watch at Christmas or anytime!
