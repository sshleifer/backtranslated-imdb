Commissioner Mattei (André Bourvil) is a single with a small pistol who loves cats. His chief at the Paris police is a philosopher who knows that even the police are guilty sooner or later. That's what movie is all about. And a jewel stealing at Place Vendôme. <br /> <br /> Corey (Delon) brings the prison plan, Vogel (Will) joins him and helps him against two tough men, who pursue him, as he took mafioso Ricos (Andre Eycan), while Rico was already taking Coreys' girlfriend and leaving him alone for five years in prison. Corey and Vogel find a third man, Jansen (Montand), a former police officer and sniper who opens a security lock by throwing special handmade ammunition into a hole. A perfect plan and cooperation, but they must sell the loot and there is Mattei in the role of a disguised buyer. The circle closes. Mattei, his beloved cat, and his little gun are shot. <br /> <br /> It took Melville 20 years to make a film about robbery after failing in his contract with RIFFIFI. Melville wrote the screenplay and filmed it in the south of France and in Paris of yesteryear. The great Henri Decae is as usual the cameraman of the lighting. This is the one that precedes the last photo of Melvilles, who died after another film with Delon in 1972. <br /> <br /> Melville really wanted Belmondo instead of Will, he did not like this Italian at all, but Will-Vogel is an excellent fugitive and gives Bourvil the most convincing performance. But note well: Melville notes that Will is an instinctive actor, a strange character, very tiring and absolutely impossible on a French set. Melville did not like him at all and never wanted to work with him again. <br /> <br /> Melville is wrong. Will gives the most alive character in the nowhere uninteresting characters. You can see what he feels pursued by Mattei and his dangerous little pistol as well as by all the dogs of France in winter 70. A wild actor. <br /> <br /> Also André Bourvil, who died shortly after the shooting. He was not the first choice either, but a great substitute. He carries the lonely hunter's instinct throughout the film and ends up having the opportunity to become guilty again. <br /> <br /> Jansen entered the jeweler's shop at night with a rifle and a tripod, but he finally risks a show of hands. When he meets Delon for the first time, we already know that stylish Jansen has a serious alcohol problem. After the theft, Montand gives up his share of the spoils and mentions to Delon, who respects him, that he penetrated only in the red circle, because he wanted revenge of the inhabitants of his wardrobe. Delon does not understand what he means. The public remembers seeing Montand in a big stage in his haunted house fighting nightmarish creatures, coming out of the closet and attacking him. At this time a very rare scene, we remember long after. I bet it was very difficult to organize and direct this film at a time when no one imagined the next few days of digital filmmaking. Excellent work of art made by hand. <br /> <br /> We will surely remember a band like the actors, but it seems that even after 33 years, it remains the least popular of the six Melville thrillers. What's wrong with that? I'm afraid there is not much interest in these three actors (showing three criminals) and their police fighter. We know too little about Corey and his five-year-old daughter-in-law (Anna Douking). Montand is still an excellent sniper, but that's what makes him a man who drinks with funny creatures in his dressing room. Delon acts as if he were in a previous adventure of the samurai. Will is the man in the trunk of the American car Delons and he is extremely moving. Mattei is a fan of the eye, a great actor at the edge of his life. But how could he doubt that everyone is guilty? <br /> <br /> In an interview, Melville says there is no woman in the movie. Not in the very red circle, but I remember very well this pretty woman, Anna Douking (without future career). We are in the 70s. In fact, a woman gets out of the bed of an old mafia girl wearing nothing and slowly walks to the door to listen to the voice of her old lover, Delon. Bardot did something like that 10 years ago. This time, Melville was leading. Well done. <br /> <br /> The RED CIRCLE has added some glittering jewels to the film's story. The burglars of the Place Vendome and Montands amaze the inhabitants of the wardrobe and Will who escape from Bouvil in white underwear and wear his pants carefully over a stream. It's too little for a big movie about gangsters and robberies. But the 110 minutes have never bothered you and it's a high level game. And there are probably secrets you learn by watching the movie again and again. None of the secrets is that we are all guilty and the death of François Périer is also presented. <br /> <br /> Michael Zabel
