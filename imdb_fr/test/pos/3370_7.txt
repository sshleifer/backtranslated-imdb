The trailer does not go very far and only scratches the surface of the film, and not rightly, not because it has the obligation to keep its true story, but because what happens actually will cause totally different queries, some of which are: frustrating not answered in the movie, leaving you to yourself to interpret the series of events. Which of course means a lot of material for a discussion after the show. <br /> <br /> Metaphorically, the box refers to the way we humans tend to subconsciously hide from situations or things of everyday life, and the tendency of our confined thoughts. to see things from a certain point of view, rarely outside the box. There is a speech made towards the end by one of the characters who will let you meditate on this fact, which governs the basis of the whole film, and even on the existentialism, where our bodies are only vessels for the soul, and from cradle to grave put us more boxes in a way of life. <br /> <br /> What I did not like in the movie is how he tried to look smart by passing the name of secret agencies such as the CIA and NSA, as his there was something clandestine in these agencies that we should be aware of. They serve more than just putting every action and every person under surveillance, which nobody can trust anyone, sowing chaos in one direction for both the characters and the public as we try to stay in touch with the issues of confidence to help interpret the story. Having put it in 1976, in a context of NASA's manned space missions, and in Langley, Virginia, also provided that acute sense of mistrust that will sap your energy if you sit patiently. <br /> <br /> the new Button story, written by Richard Matheson and turned into an episode of Twilight Zone, the story follows the Lewis family, where her husband Arthur (James Marsden) works at NASA and develops a prosthetic foot for his teacher wife Norma (Cameron Diaz). ), and one would think that his family is happy with his son Walter (Sam Oz Stone), until the day when a mysterious man named Arlington Steward (Frank Langella in a face effect inspired by Two-Face) preceded us in the opening, just knock and give them a Deal or No Deal button in a box. Plunge the button and they will get a million dollars (we are talking here in terms of 70s dollars), even if a foreigner will die. If they do not, the agreement has an expiration date. <br /> <br /> The story will dictate that an agreement is reached, which of course triggers a mysterious series of events unfolding, with even more dark characters (who are bleeding from the nose), some who resemble inexplicably to zombies, apparently all under the influence, employment or Arlington Steward. Whether or not Steward is Death, a clandestine government employee, a messenger of God or an Aliens representative after an anal investigation, remains unanswered. No matter how you look at things, it's as if he's delivering something expected, begging the man to want to shake his innate greed to be able to interrupt his work and return to his place of origin. <br /> <br /> If you need a little distraction from the disparate scenes that make up the story, the art direction is beautiful to recreate the look of the '70s, as you try to understand the mystery of the consequences that result from not fully understanding the details. We surround this examination of human nature, of our greed for immediate gratification, which translates into pain, confusion and long-term choices that we will make on the basis of true sacrifices. Beautiful special effects also come into play, even if they leave more room for the genre of the film. <br /> <br /> So, is it horror, science fiction or a mysterious thriller? That's all that makes one, with a pinch of philosophy. Do not expect a live narrative film with clear and easy answers in the end ?? it's like an episode of X-Files on steroids.
