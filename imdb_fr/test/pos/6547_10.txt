I saw UZUMAKI about a year ago and I was hypnotized. The only Japanese horror film I've seen before this one is KWAIDAN (which I proudly own on DVD, by the way), superb! The idea of ​​a city absorbed by spirals sounds exactly like something from Lovecraft. This is certainly reminiscent of SHADOW OVER INNSMOUTH, where the inhabitants slowly turn into monstrosities (in this case, giant snails). And who can forget the sequence of the washing machine? I hope it will be available soon on the Region 1 DVD (I see Sundance recently watching it on US TV, hopefully it will be released soon) so we can all see it. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED !!!!!
