I just watched this last night and it was great. I can understand why some people have perverse feelings about it from the point of view of rugby fans and Maori culture, but other than that, I do not know what is so negative about it. The movie is great. He has a lot of heart. Very inspiring and encouraging for all ages. Great family movie! They did a very good job, considering it was a low budget movie. I love movies based on real stories / events. I was raised in rugby all my life. It's a great game, but I never really lingered on it because (forgive me if I offend anyone, nothing personal, that's how I saw it). I thought that their training was ruthless or hard, the players were not so disciplined and did not look as serious as the other athletes and it would seem that it was just muscular and flourishing to face each other, and so on. I was proud! It was good for rugby (well, it changed my vision of rugby) and New Zealnd Haka. I actually cried. I am not even New Zealander and I was proud of their culture. I did not even know what the song meant before this movie. The film does NOT deal with rugby techniques or rugby, it does not even talk about New Zealand All Blacks, Haka or any other ... Nacre !!!!! hahaha SHUX! <br /> <br /> So, all of you, nice negatives, you miss the point! I'm sure if they could afford it, it was better, the haka is there because it was part of the culture, the tradition of Highland Rugby or what you want to call it. <br /> <br /> So, new members of this site, such as me, do not be put off by these negative comments. See for yourself! Must see the movie! You can learn a lot from this movie, people of all ages. This definitely gives you the desire to be a better person and to be humble! This film reminded me of many things I already know and with which I was raised, but that I lost a little bit along the way! I loved! Happy reading and good luck! <br /> <br /> Muawha!
