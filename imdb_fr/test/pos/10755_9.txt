Harold Lloyd has often neglected his role as an actor. Unlike Chaplin and Keaton, Lloyd did not have the Vaudeville / Music Hall background and was not a natural comedian. He came to Hollywood to act. and he discovered he had the gift of acting funny - first in shorts, then in feature film. He became known as "Lonesome Luke", an imitator of Chaplin; With the "glasses character" that made him an American boy rather than a grotesque, Lloyd found his stride and his films became among the best products of the silent era. <br /> <br /> He earned a reputation as a "daredevil" in some short films, and has retained this in some of his best films ("Safety Last", "For the Love of Heaven", "Girl Shy "). He was more popular than Chaplin or Keaton in the 1920s and he became very rich before the advent of sound. <br /> <br /> The first sound films were often disasters. To make the most of their "sound", too many dialogues have been used in many movies. <br /> <br /> Lloyd's acting talents were, after two decades, designed for silence. He did not have a bad voice. his high pitch corresponded to his character of "glasses". And his sound films were not the unqualified disasters of the legend. Still, silent films had become a high-level art (especially Lloyd's, which did not respect its budget and was extremely well designed); With the introduction of talkies, movies had to learn to walk again and they were making mistakes. <br /> <br /> Although he tries to move with time and adopts the sound, the best excerpts of his early talkies (too talkative) were still visual - as in the scene of "Movie Crazy" where he seems to ride in a nauseated car, but who actually "hooked up his vehicle" on his bike. <br /> <br /> Attempting to recapture the foolish antics made him famous, as he did in "Feet First", was a misstep. (In "Safety Last", his best film and the one that, rightly or not, pushed Lloyd into the box as a "reckless comedian", he was playing a determined young man, climbing to the top. "Safety Last" had a natural A structure that climbed until his character climbed the side of the building, he was obviously afraid, but his fear added to humor.In "Feet First", he accidentally arrived in a dangerous building position; frenzied with help diminished his humor, his character was pathetic and frail, his longing to save his neck - perhaps an exact statement of the 1930s, but not amusing). <br /> <br /> Harold Lloyd was not bogged down in the past, like some delusional Norma Desmond. He adopted the sound and tried to take his films in different directions, developing and evolving with the industry. When "Feet First" failed, he left the business of daredevil and made a satire of the talking film industry, "Movie Crazy". Just as he had to go through many movies like "Lonesome Luke" before carving out a place in film history with the character of glasses, he had tried several directions in sound movies before striding in the sound , as in "The Catspaw". <br /> <br /> In "The Catspaw", he embodies the son of a high missionary in China who, unintentionally, is elected mayor as the front of corrupt political interests. When he discovers the truth, he sets himself the task of cleaning up the city. Only in the early forties, Lloyd could still play the role of an impetuous young man. <br /> <br /> However, "The Catspaw" was another box-office failure and Lloyd only made three other films, including "The Milky Way". Chaplin still had silent films among his main competitors and Keaton was desperately mismanaged. "The Catspaw" and "The Milky Way" suggest that Lloyd would have mastered the comedy sound if he had been a little younger, or if the audience had granted him the benefit of the doubt after his first sound fiasco. <br /> <br /> Although the film was unfair about how Lloyd's character cleansed the city, it suits him. From his time in "short", Lloyd wanted to scare his audience and the culmination of "The Catspaw" reached him again, surprisingly; until the turn is revealed, it seems macabre and then comes laughter. <br /> <br /> Considered a product of his time, "The Catspaw" is charming and fun. A sound comedy very well written, well interpreted by Lloyd. Directed by Sam Taylor, his intriguing blend of drama and sly humor gives him the appearance of a comedy by Frank Capra or Preston Sturges.
