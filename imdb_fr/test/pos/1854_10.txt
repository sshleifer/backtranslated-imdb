I just watched this move for the 5th or 6th time and I'm still in love with it. It always makes me cry, sing, worry and celebrate. I almost wrote a letter to Bonnie Hunt to tell her how much I like it. The scene of grief of David Duchovny is so real! Minnie Driver is so natural and honest. My favorite phrase is when Duchovny says "Elizabeth misses me but I fear Grace". Oh man! I'm crying just thinking about it. ALSO ... Bonnie Hunt and Jim Belushi are sooooooooooooo the perfect couple from the Chicago area !! I know them, I swear! I am bound to them, I am sure. <br /> <br /> This film is in my rotation of three times a year !!! I watched once a week but I'm afraid to get used to it! I always want to make it a special day when I watch it !!
