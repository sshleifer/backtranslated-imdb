This version did not touch me as deeply as the latest Hollywood version starring Anthony Hopkins and Debra Winger. Although beautifully filmed and superbly interpreted, the BBC version was richer in dialogues that conveyed information that I found fascinating. This gave me a detailed insight into the intellectual, theological and moral considerations that motivated C. S. Lewis. It was therefore more interesting and stimulating than the Hollywood version, but not so breathtaking or slimy. Yet, even though I did not leave a lot of soggy Kleenex at the theater, I used one, and at frequent intervals. I enjoyed the movie as much as the Hollywood version and I'm grateful for the increased understanding I've gained.
