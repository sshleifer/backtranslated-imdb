I watched this movie because there was nothing else to watch. The characters immediately sucked me. <br /> <br /> Robin Tunney is nothing short of spectacular in this movie. Her portrayal of a woman suffering from mental illness is both moving and believable. Really, that kind of thing is not easy to do. She does it fantastically. <br /> <br /> We know very early that this film will end tragically, but you can not turn away from it. The characters do stupid things, but unlike most Hollywood movies where people do stupid things because the plot requires it, these people do stupid things because they're not in the head - and that's they do is completely consistent with their characters. /> <br /> This is just a great example of movie making IMHO. Excellent writing, good acting, good direction. A movie for people who think that the film can be more than a senseless entertainment.
