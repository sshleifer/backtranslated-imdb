Assuming, this film features two actors (Caine and Moran) who try to convince a gangster. The plot is at best fragile, as several conspiracy holes occur everywhere. However, this should not normally matter, as the comedy should include a movie like this. There are some really fun pieces (mostly provided by Dylan Moran). However, at other times, there are long melodramatic scenes that bring nothing to the film. Caine's character seemed to me exaggerated. Especially in the beginning, he continually quotes Shakespeare and behaves like a pompous actor. We could say that he played the role correctly, but the character seemed flat and not funny. Overall, I would say only see if a fan of the actors involved. Otherwise, wait for the video or television.
