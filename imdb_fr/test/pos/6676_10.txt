A beautiful magical story, stimulating and comforting. An excellent direction, a perfect cast, a beautiful scenario, an excellent score, a beautiful lighting ...... should I say more? that come to our minds are "Contact", "Field of Dreams" and "Groundhog Day"), so you are sure to love K-PAX. <br /> <br /> To recommend
