A word for that. Hilarious. I have not watched a movie like this for a long time. At times, I totally forgot that it was a movie. I felt like I was watching Viva La Bam, or even watching, say, my own friend go through such a situation. It was realistic and I liked how Bam, Ryan, Raab, Rake, Brandon and the other guys were not trying too hard to play. For me, they acted like their famous idiot. There were some scenes that I loved more than others, like Raab in the shower, sacred, I laughed so much. Honestly, he was probably my favorite character in addition to Bam. In my opinion, he really made the movie a little more hilarious. It's basically a must for all fans of the CKY team:]
