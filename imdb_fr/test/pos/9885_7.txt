In "Checking Out", Peter Falk plays the role of an old New Yorker who calls his children home so they can be with him before he commits suicide. As the film progresses, we can see the flaws and other problems of each. Although some people may interpret this as a "comforting" film, I especially appreciate it for the character Peter Falk, who does not let anything destroy it, and even engages me from time to time in a certain lubricity. It may not be the best movie of all time, but it's worth it. I have long thought that Peter Falk had the perfect look to play this kind of role, with his glass eye and everything. Also starring Laura San Giacomo, David Paymer, Judge Reinhold and Shera Danese (the real wife of Falk).
