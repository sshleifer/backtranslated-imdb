I watched this movie with my mother. She is 81 years old and raised to become a bigot. She even recognizes that. I do not think she really understands what was happening, she had already decided that the child was guilty. Scary. I felt for this child and his family. What torture they endured and remained faithful. This is the true faith. Back to the movie The police and his incompetence disgusted me. I am so happy that this public defender was chosen to handle this case. It was a chance for this family to have a person caring enough to see through the shit that was handed to him. I could tell when one of the cops was lying. He would not look at the defender in the eye. His eyes moved to the side when he answered questions. It is unfortunate that a black person should be punished for the color of his skin. I read the book about the black man trailing behind a truck by three white men. They were finally convicted after many years. I do not remember the title, but it was the same principle. Whites do what they want with blacks. I'm sure the child in the film will be traumatized for a long time, if not forever. I pointed out to my mother that most of the murderers and pedophiles were white people. No comments from her. I want to congratulate the director and producer of this film. I think their exposure to this blatant injustice was a necessary project. I am a keen observer of indy movies. I think they are well written and have substance. I'm happy to have had this film on the shelf. I felt compelled to write a comment because of the strength of my feeling for the film and the prejudices that continue to exist in our modern society.
