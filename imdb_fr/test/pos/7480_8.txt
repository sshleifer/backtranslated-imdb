Very violent film and well filmed. Paulina is a bad sexy girl who will show that men can also be raped. This film has a lot of black humor. This guy will kill anyone just to forget he was a gangster. There will be times when you would not know if you have to shudder or smile and think "Am I laughing at someone who kills people?"
