It was Gene Kelly's breakthrough, and that alone makes him memorable. Add Rita Hayworth to her love interest and comedian Phil Silvers of all peoples to his sidekick and you have the ingredients to please the crowd, which is exactly what happened. <br /> <br /> Kelly plays Danny McGuire, a nightclub owner in Brooklyn (Brooklyn is still the "bad side of the tracks" in the 40s movies), whose main attraction and interest in love is Rusty Parker (Rita Hayworth). Rita is adorable and even plays the double role of Rusty and Rusty's grandmother. Rusty has a chance at the big time thanks to the machinations of John Coudair (Otto Kruger), who romance and loses the grandmother of Rusty. <br /> <br /> The plot revolves around Danny who drops Rusty at the expense of his club, because she has a chance at success that he can not give her. But, of course, that's not what Rusty wants in the end, because, as usual in movies of that time, the good guy is the only thing that preoccupies the girl. There are no surprises, but everyone is doing their job well. <br /> <br /> Kelly is the first of her beautiful dances, this time with himself as a reflection of a window. He was the master of this kind of dance and one still has to wonder how they timed everything so precisely, so that he really seems to be in two places at once. The melodrama gets a bit thick, and there are some free wartime references that do little, but give the opportunity for a song or two, but Kelly takes this film to the next level. It was before he became a mega star and too smooth perhaps for his own good. The raw character of his character gives him a credible and almost melancholy air. <br /> <br /> Kelly's character in the "Xanadu" of 1980 was also called Danny McGuire. This movie was the beginning, this movie the end, of a great race for a dancing genius. Obviously, this film mattered a lot to him. Highly recommended.
