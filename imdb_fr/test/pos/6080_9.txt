I can never know if it's the Artiest Soap opera ever produced or the Soapiest Art art film. Regardless, John Seale's cinematography is absolutely delightful. Ondaatje's novel is not reduced, but for once high in film. If there is a fault, it is in the original novel, not in the beautiful film of Anthony Minghella. Anyone who has a problem with its length has almost certainly not read the book and probably can not read it. I do not like to repeat adjectives, but ravir is used for that. <br /> <br /> Apart from the scenario, the players excel. But it is the Australian sense of light and shadow that eventually triumphs. Like some Dutch masters, Seale uses a breath of light, where Van Rijn used the shadow. We could cry for cinematography this magnificent.
