My introduction to a lifetime love for Shakespeare. My brother was 5 years old and I was not 7 when WTTW Chicago aired An Age of Kings. It has become a family ritual to watch, including reruns. As an autumn series, my father bought us a rare treat for the Midwest: grenades; and my mother would blow corn on the stove. Wonderful acting actor whose names did not mean anything to me at the time (though I never forget the very young Sean Connery as Hotspur), but do it now! And they published the scripts in pocket format so that we could follow and understand the language. I managed to memorize Richard III's essentials about it. I'm so happy to see him out on DVD! Highly recommended for all ages and all levels of familiarity with Shakespeare or English history.
