It's probably one of the best thrillers I've ever seen. There is action, but not this flying ball, the good ones - the bad guys, van damme - the stallone action, but fast, realistic and nervous, there is a plot, because until the very end of the movie, you do not know how it will end, it has characters, Aidan Quinn, Donald Sutherland and Ben Kingsley are just perfect, and it's suspenseful, this movie will not let you go before seeing the end of it. <br /> <br /> Although there are only a few characters, I did not have a hard time keeping my attention on the story, and as for the story, it's basic (not too difficult, but simple and crude) and realistic. . <br /> <br /> If you are interested in a movie with a good story, action and good acting, watch it and I promise you that you will not leave until the end of the film. The end of it.
