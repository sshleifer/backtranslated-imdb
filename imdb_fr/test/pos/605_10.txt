In many ways, the perfect movie. "Incredible Journey" and the story of Horatio Alger unite to give a positive twist to the usually depressing subject of existentialism. Essentially, the work of the muppets comes down to the final song of the movie: "Life is like a movie, write your own ending, keep believing, keep pretending." They create their own reality, which has all the attributes of each epic tale: an ambitious goal at the end of what is necessarily a journey loaded with obstacles; an ever-growing group of like-minded people for fellowship; a villainous set of villians who are not beyond all redemption; and a big budget Hollywood ending because, damn everything, they CAN. <br /> <br /> Only Jim Henson could succeed that. He makes the distinction between sentimentality and philosophy without departing too much or too long. Of course, it seems odd to invest such weight in a film featuring puppets, but in the end, it may be the ideal puppet to argue these arguments. The atmosphere of the film allows you to fully enjoy the Hollywood dream, the end "happy", useless cameos and brilliant songs on a whim. Usually, these aspects are not related to quality in a movie, but the way the story is told makes the film guilt-free. One of the few films that can really be described as "suitable for all ages". <br /> <br /> The other films on muppets (including "The Empire Strikes Back") are not pleasant, they do not touch the grace of this film. Take, for example, the musical number "Let's hope something better is going well", the duo of Kermit and Rowlf. Fun in his clumsiness vaudevillienne, however, makes a crucial crucial point on the motivations that underlie the choices of life. Brilliant.
