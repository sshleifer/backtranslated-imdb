Especially after watching LA MATRICE RELOADED !! * SPOILERS * <br /> <br /> After seeing the Matrix with its ridiculous fantastic and phantasmagorical characters with their super powers, it was refreshing to see an action movie with real people in situations with real risks! I was concerned about these people, and although some of the stunts seemed a little too heavy, it still left me feeling that it was "possible" to say "what a stupid video game" (like the Matrix) <br /> <br This film is not an operation of the brain, it is very simple. Some things are predictable, like knowing that someone is going to be a culprit and that someone will die very early. Pretty obvious, but SO WHAT? The first 15 minutes define our reason, our motive, our main objective. <br /> <br /> I like the fact that Theron and Walhberg did not have a staging. I'm glad they did not go there. They kept the subject of fun dialogues, especially GREENE SETH. This guy is funny! <br /> <br /> This is a movie I would like to buy when it comes out on DVD. It's fun, fast and entertaining. The only thing (and I guess it's a big thing) is that we are really - rooting for the bad guys. This group of protagonists is already on the wrong side of the law. Not a good message for children - parents, explain them to them. <br /> <br />
