This concert is the kind of concert that only happens every twenty years or so. Madonna's Confessions at the time of the dance floor will surely be remembered as one of the highlights of her career. She's 48 years old and she just looks divine. She follows the dancers who are almost twenty years old. I am also very happy to announce that all the songs were sung live, which is a good thing because it sounds much better live. Each song was so unique, the visuals were stunning. The performance of 'Live to tell' was fantastic and amazed me. 'Isaac' was exotic and magnificent and was rich in political symbolism, the Arabic horn, the freed American eagle. I particularly loved the rock performance of "I Love New York", I almost got up in my living room and applauded when she told her critics to suck George Bushes ****. And again, I was impressed by the music inspired by the 70s (inferno remix). This spectacular concert has made me a fan. <br /> <br /> Verdict: Highly recommended with a capital H.
