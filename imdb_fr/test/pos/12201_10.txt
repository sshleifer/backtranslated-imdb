I have now seen all season one and I can say that I have not enjoyed a show of this standard for a long time. I am happy to see such a show going on and I hope there are many on the way to the final of the season. the best bar none can wait for season 2 as far as I'm okay things can only be improved as how miles will continue to change go rick get his family and how will they come out of the roof of the church with acting from this level is easy See why the show is such a hit with people as long as people make shows like this. I will continue to watch. I think it's hard now to come up with an original idea, so many shows have covered a wide range of topics in order to see. as original as it is refreshing
