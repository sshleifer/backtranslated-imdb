I was 13 years old and camped near the McCloud River, near Shasta, at the time of filming. My family was paid to leave our camp for the afternoon, when they filmed Vincent floating on the river. A little anecdote ... the scene where they took him out, is actually the place where he started his chariot down the river. And if the stuntman missed the net, there was a waterfall about twenty meters long. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I looked at the time and I did not understand it. It was only years later, when I saw the film and understood the meaning of it. It's a pretty powerful film and a great job for Jan at such a young age. His film career never really started as planned, but of course, he later enjoyed success on television. I would like this film to be available because I would love to see it again.
