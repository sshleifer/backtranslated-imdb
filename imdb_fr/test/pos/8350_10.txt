Lady and the tramp ii: The scamp adventure is a good movie, but I think the first lady and the tramp movie are preferable because this is the original and I think the original movies, compared to suites, are better. Lady and the tramp ii takes off after the original, but this time it's the junior's turn, the young Lady and Tramp (pole) still hates being treated with what to do with him, following the rules of the house, taking a bath time and taking things easy and easy, Scamp gets angry and runs away with a pack of dogs that are left to their own devices. Scamp meets another dog named Angel, they get along well and do what mother and father scamp did, taking an Italian meal (Spagetthi and Meatballs etc :). the baby, Scamp comes back and Angel is joined in the family. I give this film 10 out of 10.
