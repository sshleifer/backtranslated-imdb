The definition of a vampire is an inhuman corpse supposed to leave his grave at night to drink the blood of the living. Bakjwi almost nailed this concept to the head without the clich√© of sharp fangs and biting necks. Being a R-rated movie, I knew it would actually be about vampires. Which means that the characters in the movie will do what the vampires actually do without restraint and legally lack any glamorous moment with respect to Twilight. After seeing the old Chan-wook Park Oldboy, I was expecting a lot of Bakjwi. <br /> <br /> I was anticipating complicated scenario sequences with our anti-hero, priest Sang-hyeon, and I was very impressed by his portrayal as a holy man who is forced into this dilemma of to be human and to obey his thirst for vampire. (SPOILER) After he survives the defective blood transfusion, he begins to thirst for blood and discovers his super strength and ability to fly. Screenshots perform its transition phase without exposing. He begins to drink the blood of the dying and those who wish to be euthanized for moral reasons. The priest's tragic and dysfunctional love affair with the Tae-joo manipulator is very captivating, as they are performed by The Host's Kanh-ho Song and actress OK-vin Kim. The special effects are correctly placed in the background and, although they offer nothing new in terms of stunts and CGI, they have not imposed themselves in the premise of the plot and the developed character. The story and the essential points of the plot are very perverse and grotesque but very original in their own Korean style. <br /> <br /> There are not many negatives I can say about Bakjwi. Sometimes I wonder if the transition phase of the priests could have shown more than the priest was going through an emotional crisis with his transformation, but again, the film would have lasted three hours. The film was long to start. In the same vein, vampires really do not have much to say to express their emotions. As mentioned before, this movie is very tragic, so do not expect anything by watching this. <br /> <br /> Overall, Bakjwi is deliciously dark, morbid and original. I highly recommend this film to serious viewers who have gone beyond the teenage phase of Twilight. This is definitely the Korean answer to the Swedish movie Let The Right One In, which is also a good movie.
