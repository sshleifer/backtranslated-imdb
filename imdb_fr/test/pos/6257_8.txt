* Spoiler minor * <br /> <br /> Inhabited is not scary, but it's scary. It's a "little" interesting story with good acting and excellent make-up for special effects. <br /> <br /> Intrigue: A little girl attributes the strange things that are happening in her family's new home and the gambling house that accompanies them to her fairy friends. <br /> <br /> The film does not waste time moving, although the end could have been more complicated. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend this movie to those who expect / want hardcore horror, but I recommend it to those who want a cooler and not necessarily a thriller.
