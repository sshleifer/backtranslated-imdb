This film is totally breathtaking. He manages to be provocative, funny, tragic and cinematic while remaining claustrophobic. <br /> <br /> Although flashbacks are not necessary, the film retains a pacy-punchy grip and the performances are excellent, especially Alec Baldwin, and the awesome Eric Bogosian as an anterherent of the film, Barry Champlain.
