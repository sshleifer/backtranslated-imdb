North and South (Books I and II) is for me the ultimate TV series of the 80s. Just to spot all these cameo appearances was very entertaining. Gene Kelly, James Stewart, Elisabeth Taylor, Olivia De Havilland, Robert Mitchum, Even Johny Cash - No series has failed in this success. Have you ever seen someone who looks like Lincoln? Dick Smith's prosthetics made Hal Holbrock's performance even more powerful. The made-up costumes, the places where the jaws fall, everything. It is clear that today there are excellent and bright television series (Desperate Housewives, Lost, 24 years old), but North & South was and is still unique. Do not miss it. Only David Carradine's portrayal of the ultimate villain (we may call him simply a violent husband) is worth watching. Some characters and situations are perhaps too stereotypical, I admit, but the positive sides cast a shadow over them. I am so happy that finally is available on DVD in Spain.
