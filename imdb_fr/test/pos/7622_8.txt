This film is pretty good. It seems that they used the Tyrannosaurus Rex as an inflated balloon, just like Godzilla, perhaps at the time of 60-70, the scientist does not have enough information. on all kinds of dinosaurs. At the time of the scientists who were still making dinosaurs, I suppose this film was based on the movements of a Tyrannosaur Rex in the 60s and 70s. There is even a part where a giant rock, shot by someone at the Tyrannosaurus Rex, damaged the Tyrannosaurus Rex and was knocked out for a little while. In the end, the Tyrannosaurus Rex returned foraging. There is also something wrong with the film, like a rifle, how can a rifle kill a Rex Tyrannosaurus, when it could be 1,000 to 5,000 stronger than us? If this movie is going to make a remake, I suggest making it more good and more excited, because watching an old movie seems to have a remake of it, if lucky.
