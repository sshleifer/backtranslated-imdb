The War At Home is so good that it's become my new favorite show. Me and my neighbors Carly and April watch this together every Sunday and make fun of reality. I love how sarcastic and anxious everyone is and how he stays motionless. Whenever someone does something stupid, he never complains and that's really what the family has to do. The father is always heard by all three children. I love the way parents do not know how to take care of children. This is so true in real family life and the fact that parents are so overwhelmed and do not know how to solve their teens' problems puts the series on top of the stage. War At Home is so brutally honest and so true to the world. live in the fact that it has become a milestone for upcoming sitcoms. It's not Happy Days or The Brady Bunch, it's real life.
