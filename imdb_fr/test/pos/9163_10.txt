Filmed less than a year after the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan, the subject was fresh for the actors, the director and the audience. Most of the actors are real soldiers and officers who have just returned from the war. The Soviet army cooperated a lot during the shooting, which is strange. <br /> <br /> The Afghan intervention was a bloody and useless war in which even the generals had forgotten the reasons for the bloodshed. This film shows the tension and cruelty of military life, the emotional atrophy felt by the troops and the pain that shook a small nation torn apart by war and civil war. <br /> <br /> The powerful scenes are not lacking. One of the first consists of a sequence of steel coffins loaded into a means of transport to the USSR. The soldiers are busy while the officers quietly decide on destinations: Moscow, Rostov, Donetsk, Baltic. <br /> <br /> A previous comment described the last scene with Major Bandura as illogical. It is perfectly logical and in the spirit of the film: the only human relationship maintained by Bandura was the one with the Afghan family that he accidentally killed during the assault. Having lost his only buffer against the fool of the war, Bandura turns his back on the boy (and his weapon) resigned to his fate. <br /> <br /> I particularly liked the last scene: a flock of MI-28s rise above the mountains as the voice of a pilot shouts: "Uhodim! Uhodim rebyata! (We're leaving! Guys, we're leaving!) In a tone of sincere relief. <br /> <br /> Afhanskii Izlom is an excellent film - brutally honest and as discreet as they come.
