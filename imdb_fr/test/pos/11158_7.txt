Falling is our old friend, the movie that tells two different stories that converge gradually to become the same story after all, simply told in different ways. It's a story of little bitches, with the simplet of Matthieu Kassovitz following Jean-Louis Trintignant, an unlucky card diver, with a devotion similar to that of a dog that even tends to kill him when he is invited to repay his gambling debts in kind. Meanwhile, in a slightly different period of time, Jean Yanne's itinerant salesman is increasingly obsessed with finding the man who has put his mate in a mortal coma, his life, his income and his are gradually evaporated closer to their prey. Yet, even though it offers the ideal configuration for a modern black neo, the movie is often more surprisingly gaming, more interested in quirks of character and a slightly skewed sense of humor (aptly served by occasional ironic captions). and the score slightly discordant) than the traditional thriller and the mechanics of the plot. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the film is poorly served by one of the Region 1's worst DVDs released in recent years: image quality on Synkronized The record is so poor that you're still waiting to see the audience's head in front of the photo as a pirate disk.
