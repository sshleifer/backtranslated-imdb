A stunning look at the ocean and its life. <br /> <br /> The good: <br /> <br /> The work of the camera was absolutely phenomenal. Each shot is beautifully made. <br /> <br /> It was interesting to see all the animals that I could never have imagined. <br /> <br /> David Attenborough has the voice of perfect narrator. Nobody could have done better. <br /> <br /> The bad: <br /> <br /> There were one or two different moments when it was about the Earth, a million years old (I have a different belief). <br /> <br /> Overall, a television series anyone can enjoy. I highly recommend buying it. 10/10 stars.
