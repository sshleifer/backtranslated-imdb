I refused to watch 15 Park Avenue despite the recommendations, rejecting the film as a clich√© of extreme emotional dramas and overflowing actors. <br /> <br /> From time to time, movies like 15 Park Avenue arrive and sweep you off your feet. <br /> <br /> The film captures your attention early enough and there is no time to rest after that. Aparna Sen did a remarkable job in tackling the audience at every line of the film. The impeccable development of the characters, the "right" number of emotions and an enigmatic end to match everything ... <br /> <br /> I have renewed respect for Konkana Sen Sharma, who convincingly plays the schizophrenic Mithi. She still exceeds expectations after Page-3 and Mr. & Mrs.Iyer. The role of Professor Anjali is very developed and Shabana gives full justice to the character. Rahul Bose, Shefali Chaya and Waheeda Rehman add incredible flavor to the movie. <br /> <br /> I define "shower moments" as thoughts of scenes from a movie you are constantly meditating on up to your wife / girlfriend. / Mom knocks on the door. 15PA offers many "showering moments", especially the conversation between Anjali and her mother, where the mother is careful when talking to Anjali about her thoughts. Anjali's personality is immediately revealed to the public. <br /> <br /> The end is a very bold statement from the director; probably too Westernized for the Indian public; yet provides the elements to promote the film from a "good" status to a "great" status.
