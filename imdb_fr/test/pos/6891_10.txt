Although the Promised Land channel was no longer broadcast six years ago, it is one of those programs that occur once or twice per generation. Good distribution, distribution (among them, Richard Thomas and Ossie Davis) and crew. The plot is credible with McRaney racing his family and just saying "damn it all" after being subjected to so many disappointments and incidents since returning from Vietnam a few years earlier. I think a lot of veterans of the Vietnamese era, including myself, could really understand McRaney's thinking process and finally decide what to do. Many of us did exactly the same thing in real life, after coming back from this war and discovering that America was not the same place we went. The show not only gives values, but also a glimpse of what has happened in the life of a veteran. For these two aspects alone, I think it's one of the most poignant television series of our time. Why this program lasted only 3 years does not exceed me.
