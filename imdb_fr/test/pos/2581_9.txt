Craig Brewer is now officially a screenwriter / director for whom I will see any movie, no matter how bad it may sound. Her debut, Hustle and Flow, was one of my favorites of that year, with her emotionally charged storyline and realistic, fallible characters. I was not quite sure what I would think after seeing this second year effort. The cast sounded great, the trailer used the music well, but there seemed to be a good chance that it would go into the absurd and quickly. Fortunately, Black Snake Moan hits all his marks. The acting is astonishing, the superb writing and the editing style, as well as the juxtaposed music, which fascinates the whole course. Brewer seems to be a master to bring his characters to have the right mix of compassion and malice as they embark on their paths to redemption. <br /> <br /> The first moment I knew I was delighted was at the beginning of the abbreviated credit sequence. As with Hustle and Flow, Brewer seamlessly transposes music onto widescreen shots with simply titled, static fonts. The aesthetics of the 70s was welcome and helped to show that it would be another beautiful piece of character in vain of those of this decade among the best of cinema. From there, we continued with short excerpts of the life of Lazarus and Rae, each vignette reflecting the other as they traveled to the fateful moment where their paths intersect. The editing between them was fluid and relevant rather than cutting abruptly before the scene felt finished. Rae's boyfriend leaves the service and Laz's wife leaves him for his brother. Everyone feels loneliness and returns to what he knows in this situation: sex and Laz by the bottle. It is only when Rae is left for dead on the side of the road and his savior comes from his farm to take him away that the reasoning of their actions finally begins to become clear. <br /> <br /> Samuel L. Jackson is fantastic as an old bluesman farmer trying to reconcile his life with God and that of the flesh and the pain it brought him. There are times of stoic severity as well as those of kindness with his captive / patient. You never really look at the setup as comical or unrealistic because it sells what it does so well. In addition, the character of Rae is not chained very long, despite what the trailers would have you believe. The situation starts a little awkward until we see that the sequence was done for its good and is only used for a day or two. As for this chained girl, Christina Ricci really shines. I have never really seen it as something special, but this role is a real breakthrough for her. This girl is so troubled that her past sexual abuse has profoundly affected her. Every time she walks away from her love, she begins to see the lightning of the man who has taken away the innocence of his childhood and wants to be touched by every man available to let the image disappear. His nymphomania is not for fun, but to survive the haunted nightmares that are still hidden behind his eyelids. Ricci fully lives the role and shows all the emotional trauma with a lot of effect and realism. We must also mention Justin Timberlake, who has again demonstrated a real acting talent. I have no idea of ​​the origin of this guy, but I hope he will continue to take more movies and get away from the rotten music he is transforming. <br /> <br /> Without being as solid and consistent as Hustle and Flow, Moan I always remember it's spectacular. Towards the end, we have a really exciting sequence with "This Little Light of Mine" singing and, earlier, the interaction between captive and sensor, when the string is introduced for the first time, shows a work of the first order. The truly magical moment, however, is when Jackson sings (yes, it's him all the time, as if it were Terrence Howard in Hustle), the title track as a storm roared and lights flashed. If I do not see a more beautiful sequence all year long, I will not be surprised. What these two people do for each other is wonderful and shows what humanity is capable of. One of the things that excites me most about Brewer's work is the fact that he does not show sinners to be redeemed heroes. Instead, he shows us that no matter how sick you have been or how hard your life has been, everyone can aspire to redemption and be better people. We do not have saints here, but fallible people who are trying to straighten their ship. If the course remains true or if it falls back into darkness, nobody really knows it, but at least they can say that they did their best.
