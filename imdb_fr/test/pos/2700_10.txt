I have been watching King of Queens from the beginning and I feel that this event is being overlooked at awards ceremonies. This show has the best humor, you can identify with the characters, we talk a lot about it at work, because I work in a company like IPS (DHL) and we love the Teamster plugs !! Carrie is my hero, she's the best, she just says it, no matter what. Arthur, what can you say? It just makes you crack and really makes things happen. Doug, well, he's so adorable and funny that the three characters, as well as all the friends, complete the show. It's the best comedy on TV !! I would say up there with Seinfeld, and hey, there's nothing wrong with that ... Excellent !! as Doug would say.
