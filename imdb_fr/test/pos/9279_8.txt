I agree that Spielberg's films are not even in the same league as those mentioned here, such as the brilliant INVADERS FROM MARS by William Cameron Menzies, to name just one of the many titles reviewed, but it's still about a good overview of the 1950s. Paranoid science fiction. Yes, it becomes an advertisement for the warm remake of WAR OF THE WORLDS in the last fifteen minutes; you can disable this. The rest is surprisingly good and it's nice to see contemporary filmmakers remember the films that inspired them, even if they can not begin to match the originals.
