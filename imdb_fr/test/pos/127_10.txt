The previous commentary, Claudio Carvalho, summed up the details of the movie's plot much better than I did. What I remember most is that it was so beautiful, in every sense of the word - emotionally, visually, editorial - just beautiful. that this beauty is relevant, I think you will be happy to have seen this extraordinary and unusual work of art. <br /> <br /> On a scale of 1 to 10, I would give it about 8.75. The only reason I'm not afraid of the 9th is that it's a room. If you fancy a really artistic and very romantic film, then it's a 10. I really think it's a must, but none of us can be in that mood all the time, therefore, overall, 8.75.
