This film is about six men who are responsible for transporting money from a bank to a company. Ty Hackett (Columbus Short) was in Iraq for war in the service of his country and has now been helped by his friend Mike Cochrone (Matt Dillon) to make a living by making sure he does not lose his home. Mike told him that it was not the life his parents expected of him and that he should live a better life than he now lives with his brother Jimmy Hackett (Andre Kinney). Tell Ty that he and Jimmy have always been part of his family and would do anything to help them, Ty tells a plan to make a robbery. The money would be about $ 43 million across the six transportation routes, although Ty does not appreciate the idea that he tells his friend Mike that as long as no one is hurt he would be there. Last night, Ty was forced to speak. a social worker who puts her brother in foster care, which gives him the dilemma of losing what matters most in his life. Although the plan seems at first sure, greed is not all that matters to save lives. <br /> <br /> When it comes to robberies, whether you are or not, then It's hard to play the hero and put an end to greed when it comes to having big sums of money. money. This film is accompanied by a cast of stars that interest you with Jean Reno, Laurence Fishburne, Frederic Amaury Nolasco, Skeet Ulrich and Milo Ventimiglia. In short, I remembered him only recently in "Stomp the Yard" about a child who lost his brother and who lives his dream of going to university. It was probably one of his best films in which I saw him, and he's so much of the character that it's great to see him on the big screen in action.
