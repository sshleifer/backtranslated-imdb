I have never watched a file in a language I do not understand just because I wanted to see the movie and could not find it with English submarines. I do not know how much I missed but it was not much. Probably just specific details that look ridiculous until you see the emotional level of this movie and how the characters interact. I want to mention to the German director The Diceman that there is no reason to think that he "fears" when it comes to commenting on the emotional strength of the film. As I said, I do not understand Japanese - or at least the very small amount with which I read the very long novel - probably my favorite book of all time that I could not repress and take the next day. just work to finish reading! I do not know if there is an English version doubled or under-dubbed but if the film but if there is one, I'd like to see it. The movie was amazing in Japanese, nothing better than the icing on the cake !! Slainte ', Maegi
