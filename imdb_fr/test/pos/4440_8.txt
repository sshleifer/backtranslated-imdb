After seeing this documentary, my impression is that Nathaniel Kahn ended up with more questions than he had before making the film. <br /> <br /> It took five years to do it, a work of love and nostalgia. I can only imagine the turmoil of the editing process, what to leave, what to go out. <br /> <br /> His father, the famous architect Louis Kahn, appears as a man too selfish and egocentric to be emotionally available, even for a woman, not just three. But like many men of his character, he attracted women fascinated by distance and fascinated by creativity. <br /> <br /> One of her mistresses said that it was "accessible" but that it was never explored. Other comments from people who knew him well suffer the same fate. Pity. <br /> <br /> The tension between the three half-brothers and sisters in the room of a house designed by Louis is also palpable. The unsaid hangs over the conversation. The only traces left by his father were in the buildings he had left, some large, others not at all. <br /> <br /> I was captivated by the music boat and the Salk Institute. Sadness for the baby mothers who were caught forever by his ruthless impregnations, never more illustrated than what he told the director's mother after learning about her pregnancy - "never again!" <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10, beautifully filmed, authentic. <br /> <br /> It seems, in this case at least, that the son is not the father of the man.
