Distributor: GOODTIMES home video <br /> <br /> Intrigue: A pretty high school girl is marked for her relentless terror in this thriller filled with a TV movie. Gail Osborne is new in the city. She makes friends, has a boyfriend and everything seems to go for her. That's until she receives a disturbing and frightening call while keeping her children. After more and more phone calls, she is raped. Throughout the film, she tries to find evidence that the person raped her. <br /> <br /> Audio / Video: This 1987 VHS edition of Goodtimes stinks. Constant lines appear at the bottom and top of the screen. <br /> <br /> Supplements: No extras from the personal video of Goodtimes. <br /> <br /> Final Thoughts: This thriller filled with TV movie was created in 1978, so do not expect a lot of dead (there are none). If you can find this movie with the Worldvision video logo on the front, buy it. But the Goodtimes version is pretty ugly. This can be a little boring, but if you are patient, the end is pretty good.
