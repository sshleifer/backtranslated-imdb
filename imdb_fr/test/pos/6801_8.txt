"National Velvet" tells the story of Velvet Brown, a young English girl dreaming of putting her beloved horse into competition at the prestigious Grand National horse race. The film follows her as she drives her horse with the help of a former jockey and the support of her parents. <br /> <br /> While "National Velvet" is a family film, this fact should not discourage anyone from typical such films with derision. Indeed, the film will appeal to the whole family, not just to captivating young people. He even managed to win five Oscar nominations, which was not a sign of a general relaxation. <br /> <br /> Anne Revere, in the role of Velvet's mother, actually won an Oscar for her performance. She was indeed excellent in the role but it is Elizabeth Taylor, 12, who steals the show. She is a charming presence and exhibits a talent beyond her years. Oscar-winner Donald Crisp also plays Velvet's father, Mickey Rooney, ex-jockey Mi Taylor, and Angela Lansbury (in one of his first movie roles), Velvet's older sister. <br /> <br /> for an engaging viewing experience while editing provided the second of two Oscars in the film. In addition, the film has been nominated for direction (by Clarence Brown), cinematography and art direction. The score of ten-time Academy Award nominee Herbert Stothart also deserves mention, even if it was not motivated. <br /> <br /> In total, "National Velvet" is a wonderful family film that deserves a higher rating. I realize that the prospect of watching a film about a girl and her horse is not going to please some people, but it is worth taking a chance.
