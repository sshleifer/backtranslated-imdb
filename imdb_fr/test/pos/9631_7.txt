It seems that everyone did not like Steven Seagal: Take a look at his nomination list, there are only nominations for a raid (with a win), but I think he does not. has won nothing. I saw good movies with Steven Seagal, I saw bad movies with Steven Seagal. And THE PATRIOT (1998) is one of his best films, almost as good as UNDER SIEGE (1992) or HARD TO KILL (1990). THE PATRIOT shows his activities to protect nature. This movie is certainly not great, and I must say there is more violence than I like, and why Seagal's best friend, L. Q. Jones, must die from the death of a victim? Dr. McClaren's role is one of Seagal's best performances. He has, as always, a very good charisma. And in summary, THE PATRIOT is a good entertainment - with an average score of only 4 points, the most underrated movie of all time. <br /> <br /> Sincerely, Hans-Dieter
