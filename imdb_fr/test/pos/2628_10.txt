Roy Thinnes and Joan Hackett are superb in this melodrama of 1970. The sumptuous sets, the haunting music and the twists of the plot make it a really interesting film. I saw him when he came out on television. Once again, it was broadcast when I had a VCR, but I did not have the opportunity to film it. I would love VHS if someone has a copy. Aside from the suspense (which is beautifully worked), I feel that the story is unique and that it is faithful to the book, MRS. MAITLAND'S AFFAIR by Margaret Lynn. I would say it's one of the best movies of the 1970s that have been very neglected and made for television. I gave the film a rating of 10, because it is made with so much originality. There is a real pathos and an air of romance that makes the spectator sympathize with the culprit.
