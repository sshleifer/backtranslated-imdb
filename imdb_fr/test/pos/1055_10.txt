I came across this film in the mid-80s as a teenager and immediately became one of my favorite movies, whether it was a vacation or a vacation. As you can see among the other critics, this film has a very good story and very good actors are involved. <br /> <br /> Stanwyck is great as a bride, it's having a second thought. The role of Dennis Morgan is also strong. It goes unnoticed in most movies but was a very capable actor, check out KITTY FOYLE. In this film, he plays the visiting sailor who runs to Stanwyck away from her husband. <br /> <br /> It's a Christmas classic. The sets and the story make this beautiful Christmas romance
