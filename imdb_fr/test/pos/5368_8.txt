A young couple - Father Ben (Charles Bateman), his wife Nicky (the beautiful Ahna Capri) and their daughter KT (the beautiful Geri Reischl of the celebrity "I Dismember Mama") find themselves trapped in a small desert town Californian populated by hysterical fools. Even worse, there is a pernicious satanic cult that kidnaps little children for evil purposes. Director Bernard McEveety has worked on an offbeat scenario inspired by William Welch and LQ Jones (the director of "Devil Times Five", Sean MacGregor has told this strange story), tells the intriguing plot at a slow but steady pace and creates cleverly a frightening, edgy and mysterious oog-booga-type atmosphere. Strother Martin delivers a marvelously nasty and robust performance as Doc Duncan, who is the sinister leader of the evil cult. Leading actors, who are excellent actors, are an important asset: Jones, pretentious sheriff, Sheriff Hillsboro, Alvy Moore, a friendly friend of Toby, and Charles Robinson, an insightful and fervent priest, Jack. John Arthur Morrill's brilliant and brilliant cinematography on the big screen, Jamie Mendoza-Nava's spooky soundtrack, and the wild and energetic ritual of the dark mass are also at the rendezvous. The idea of ​​bringing toys into a deadly life is simply ingenious (the opening scene with a toy tank that becomes real and crushes a family in his car is really shocking). Beautiful, strangely ambiguous ending, too. A pleasantly idiosyncratic and underrated winner.
