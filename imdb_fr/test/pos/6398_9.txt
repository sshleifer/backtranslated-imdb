"My wife and children", in my opinion, is an absolute ABC classic! I did not see all the episodes, but I always liked it. There are many episodes that I enjoyed. One of them was where Junior (George O. Gore II) got his driver's license. If you want to know why, you must have seen it yourself. Before closing, I would like to say that everyone has always given a good performance, the design of the production was spectacular, the costumes well designed and the writing still very strong. In conclusion, even though we can see it in syndication now, I strongly recommend you catch it in case it disappears from the air for good.
