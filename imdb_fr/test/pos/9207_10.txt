I think Josh Duhamel is so great !! The rest of the series is fun to watch, but I think it's the handsome and sexy Josh Duhamel who makes the Las Vegas series really fun to watch! At the time of "Magnum", I loved Tom Selleck, I thought he was the sexiest man in the world !! A piece in a TV show is a must so that women can watch something, especially for innocuous entertainment purposes! I would have done anything for "Win a date with Tad Hamilton" !! Josh Duhamel is amazing and I will always crack him !! Josh is really a HUNK !! and I will be watching all the time "Las Vegas", Josh Duhamel is an important reason for that too !!
