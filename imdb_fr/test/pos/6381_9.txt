this film is strange but I liked it a lot. this is a good girl who loves her bad boy and his honeymoon messed up. he does not like it in return and he is a bad son. he's starting to like it after something really hot happens on their honeymoon, I will not give it away. it's weird yeah !! but different from other movies in a good way I think. I do not know what to compare but it's a love story. but has a lot of funny things too. like getting to see James Franco in a wig. The notebook appealed to me a lot and it was a bit like that because of the love story. but the rest is very different. nothing like. Sienna Miller is really good. I saw this film during a test because I like it a lot and its fashion. I liked it in Factory Girl but it's a better movie than this one. she and james franco look really in love in this movie and I hope they are together in real life but I do not know <br /> <br /> see it !!!!
