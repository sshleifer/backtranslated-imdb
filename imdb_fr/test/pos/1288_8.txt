The beginnings that emerged from the darkness as one of the brightest stars of contemporary black are assured, though limited, by knife and obsession. Filmed for nothing, Nolan could not have chosen a better subject than the dull and dark underwear of London to exercise his profession, given the lack of funds. This short (67 min) is at its best to play with the expectations of the public and the protagonist as to who scam that, although the initial configuration sounds alarmingly in the credibility department. Muddy cinematography (he often used natural lighting because of his budget) can be largely attributed to black stylization, although limitations sometimes show it. <br /> <br /> One can easily see Nolan's style developing in this nascent effort; many of the same themes of scrambled identity and shattering expectations come to MEMENTO and INSOMNIA. It's not a masterpiece, but good and certainly worth a look for fans of modern black and Nolan.
