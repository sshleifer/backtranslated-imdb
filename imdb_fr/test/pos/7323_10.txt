The Columbia Pictures Short Subject unit has never had any illusions about the production of "Art" films. They wanted to give a little more to the movie operators when they booked a Columbia Picture movie in their cinemas. This was going to double for the 3 films of Stooges. <br /> <br /> MEN IN BLACK (1934) is as close as any of his Comedy shorts to the extent that he has been nominated for an Academy Award for best short film, Comedy. Although he did not win, he could have done it. It was pretty good and even those who do not count among the Stooge files always seem convinced by the cry of "... calling Dr. Howard, Dr. Fine, Dr. Fine, Dr. Howard!" It was the second entry in the Stooges' long comedy shorts series for producer Jules White, head of Columbia's Short Subjects department. Only WOMAN HATERS, described in her credits as a "musical novelty," preceded her in the Harry Cohen Killing Workshop in Poverty Row. <br /> <br /> The film begins in the office of Dr. Graves, head of the hospital. He receives new trainees and, speaking to the group, reports that three of them were transferred from Medical Conditionally because they had stayed there for so long. But, the good doctor declares that he will not reveal their identity as long as they all commit "...... for Duty and Humanity!" The Stooges rushed to the front, pledging "... for duty and humanity!", And found themselves at the end of the office, smashing the window of the door. The game was launched. <br /> <br /> The Stooges took off and did not stop for the rest of the two reels. Each type of gag was in evidence. Sennett-like visual gags, puns, dialectal humor, "the theater of the absurd" and a surreal gag with a sound system that seems to have a life of its own and the real culprit , a radio tube being shot at a "........ he got me!" (All of this is pretty good, honest!) The sets used were very authentic and probably borrowed from Columbia's features at about the same time. Sufficient evidence to maintain the illusion of a hospital is found in many wheelchairs, surgical operating tables, stetoscopes, oversized scalpels, and so on. <br /> <br /> A great strength of MEN IN BLACK lies in the high number of players, whom we all recognize from the front. With them, the film boasts of a large number of veteran comedy actors, who always perform well, often stealing the stage. People with names such as Billy Gilbert, Hank Mann and Bud Jamison shine even in small parts. <br /> <br /> And finally, we have Maestro, the conductor Raymond McCarey, brother of Leo McCarey who showed his ability to get this little film "in the box". He cleverly made things happen, sometimes acting like a traffic policeman, with all the actors, extras and backstage crews moving and bothering each other. And that does not count the Giant 3 Man tandem bike, the Sway supported horse and miniature race cars, not to mention the "Giant, Green Canaries!
