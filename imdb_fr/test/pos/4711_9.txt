I'm afraid I have to add my name to the long list of people who are amazed by the fact that this movie did NOT STILL (September 2007) was released on DVD. This is one of those mysteries that makes the mind staggering, especially considering the amount of DVDs available at the moment that contains material that should have been stored years ago. Still, I have an excellent digital VHS copy in English with subtitles and Nicam Stereo; my problem is therefore more one of principle than the frustration of not being able to see the film. As far as the film itself is concerned, it is an excellent full-length film with good image quality, a more than satisfying soundtrack, a lively plot involving suspense, emotion, sadness, frustration, pleasant environment and exotic (for a European). What is the veracity of the film in Burmese reality? I do not know at all, it's less important, the bottom line is that, from the point of view of entertainment, it's a success. We will soon focus on each of the main characters and I confess to have the heart in my mouth during the last scene of the crossing of the river. It's too bad that we hear so little about countries like Burma and this film gives at least a glimpse of the country. Has the situation changed since 1995? The events that will occur later this month seem to answer this question with a categorical no and the regime in place seems to be as brutal as ever, not sparing even the lives of monks, let alone women or children !
