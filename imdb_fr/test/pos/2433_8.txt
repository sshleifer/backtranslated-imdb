Do this short and to the point. This movie was great! I liked it! In fact, I took it in a Hollywood video for $ 3 on VHS and I watched it about 5 times in the last two weeks. I am a big fan of Bogart and I have just become attached to this film. I thought the song was funny and had it now as a ringtone for my phone. Robert Sacchi is great and draws a good Bogart. His nose is a bit big, his voice is a Bogart-Columbo mix, and he does some things that are clumsy but otherwise he was fantastic and this movie was wonderful. Nobody can be a perfect Bogart but he was great. Remember that Sam Marlow is a fan of Bogart and will not do everything he has done. He mentions many other films and does things that have never been part of Bogart's true character. But, it's so funny and hilarious and has an excellent cast, including beautiful women. Watch it and have fun!
