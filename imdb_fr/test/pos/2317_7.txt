This film is about a group of unsuitable people supposed to be assigned to a task that will fail miserably. The marginalized unite to carry out their mission. <br /> <br /> Hilarity ensues. <br /> <br /> As in the case of the "School of Police" movies, the humor comes from the wacky characters of the boat. I thought it was an engaging movie and I will stop watching it anytime on TV. No, it will not make you think about your relative role in the cosmos or make you do great things in the service of humanity, but it's a fun enough entertainment for about 90 minutes. In addition, Lauren Holly looks great in a navy uniform.
