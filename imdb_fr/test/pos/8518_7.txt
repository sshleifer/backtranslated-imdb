1983 was "the battle of links". That year, Roger Moore and Sean Connery starred in two separate James Bond films, the former (Octopussy) being produced by Bond's "official" producers, while the latter (Never Say Never Again) has been produced "unofficially" by a group. directed by Kevin McClory who held the Thunderball movie rights. Surprisingly, the "unofficial" movie is better despite the obvious flaw of and that Never Never Never Again is a remake of Thunderball. <br /> <br /> Never Say Never Again has the distinction of doing sports best casts ever assembled for a Bond movie. It all starts with Sean Connery, who returns to the Bond game for the first time since 1971, Diamonds Are Forever. Connery may be older then, but he looks better here than in Diamonds Are Forever. The link never to say never again is the elegant and dangerous shark of Dr. No or Russia With Love, a few years older. Connery's delivery of a lining and dialogue is as complete as ever. The only disadvantage of Connery's age is his credibility, especially with regard to the ladies of the movie. Let's be clear, even though his physical condition is excellent, Connery looks as strange as Moore when he covers a woman half his age. Yet despite this credibility problem, Never Say Never Again presents Connery in one of its best performances in Bond and a clear improvement over its previous two performances in Bond. <br /> <br /> Kim Bassinger plays Domino in one of her leading roles. Bassinger plays this role with considerable confidence for a newcomer and makes the character believable. Bassinger defends himself against his co-stars and has a considerable chemistry with them too. In fact, she could surpass her replica Thunderball interpreted by Claudine Auger. <br /> <br /> Then there is the villain, Maximilian Largo, played by Klaus Maria Brandauer. Brandauer's Largo is all that a villain of James Bond should be: sweet, charming, devilish and above all believable. Brandauer makes the role realistic and chooses not to fall into the trap that many of Bond's other villains have fallen into by going beyond. Brandauer plays Largo with a silent threat and an invisible charisma in many 007 opponents. <br /> <br /> The excellent cast also extends into the support cast. Barbara Carrera is a good hand woman in Fatima Blush and the screen turns on when she appears. Max Von Sydow has a beautiful appearance as Blofeld, although his appearance is more like a cameo. Rowan Atkinson makes his appearance as a sudden contact Bond, which is part of the best scenes of the film. The highlight of the secondary distribution is Edward Fox's MI6 staff, who contrast perfectly with Bernard Lee, Pamela Salem, who make Moneypenny an affine and make it the icing on the cake with the superb Q. de Alec McCowen. Bernie Casey (Felix Leiter) and Gavin O'Herlihy (Jack Petachi) both seem to lack credibility in their respective roles. Otherwise, this film presents one of the best cast ever assembled for a Bond movie. <br /> <br /> In addition to an excellent cast, the film contains several other essential ingredients. From the opening sequence in Central America to the Battle of Shrublands, to underwater footage and motorcycle chases, it's a movie whose action sequences are not only great, but serve also the plot in most cases. The film also has good special effects in terms of cruising missile models, explosions and everything we expect from a Bond movie. Irvin Kershner, who has just finished The Empire Strikes Back, gives the film a keen sense of direction, especially in sequences like the nuclear charge substation and the subsequent flight of cruise missiles. <br /> <br /> Yet this film is far from perfect. Never Say Never Again is easily one of Bond's most out-of-date movies with its extensive use of sand video games from the 1980s. While technology dates back to all movies after a while, the movie's heavy reliance on it especially during the hijacking of cruise missiles and the Domination sequence, gives the film an incredibly dated look about a quarter of a century after its release. The script also tends to suffer from predictability because it is a remake of Thunderball. <br /> <br /> Yet, for its predictability, the Never Say Never Again script is pretty good. The scenario presents good scenes of dialogue, not a single crooked line (some of the scenarios of the time Roger Moore can say the same?), Humorous situations, and yet, it is observable and tense for most. Once you've overcome the fact that it's a remake, the movie script contains a lot of good things. <br /> <br /> Music is actually the biggest weakness of the film. Due to the "unofficial" status of the film, the James Bond theme could not be used. That said, it could have shown the good composer that a Bond score would not work. Unfortunately, Michael Legrand's score is far from adequate. Legrand's score is totally misplaced in a James Bond movie and there are only one or two places where it actually works. To make matters worse, the film also contains one of the worst title footage ever seen for a James Bond movie. <br /> <br /> Despite his strong dating, prediction and bad score, Never Say Never Again is still a good Bond movie. With one of the best cast of all James Bond movies, good action sequences, good special effects, good direction and great dialogue, this movie proves that "unofficial" is not a bad thing . In fact, it's better than Octopussy and the winner of "The Battle of Links".
