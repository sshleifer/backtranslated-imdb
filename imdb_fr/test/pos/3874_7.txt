"Back in the Day" is an interesting but imperfect effort. Ja Rule plays Reggie Cooper, an honest but sad man trying to cope with his father's death. He meets his old friend J-Bone (Ving Rhames) who tries to force Reggie to live in crime. Reggie also falls in love with Alica (Tatyana Ali), the preacher's daughter. He must now choose: love or crime. <br /> <br /> Ja Rule does a good job as Reggie. At least he tries to act. Ving Rhames is perfect as J-Bone. It brings a lot of energy and threat into the role. Joe Morton as a preacher is his usual good, but he does not do much. Same problem for Giancarlo Esposito as father of Reggie. He needed more time on the screen. I do not mean that, but Pam Grier is pretty terrible as Mrs. Cooper. She exaggerates each scene and lowers the film. Tia Carrere and Frank Langella participate, but do nothing substantial for the plot. <br /> <br /> In the end: you should see it for the talented performances of Ving Rhames and Joe Morton and for the great character to write and direct.
