"Any Gun Can Play" (1967), directed by Enzo G. Castellari, is a very good pastiche of spaghetti westerns, especially those of Leone. The first half is great and, apart from the opening that directly reminds "For a few dollars more", with Monco, Colonel Douglas Mortimer and El Indio look-alikes going to a ghost town, then quickly killed by a bounty hunter called "The Stranger", is quite serious, with great fights (especially the train flight scene), fast and furious action and great performances from Gilbert Roland, George Hilton and (who manages well, since it is misc miscast) Edd Byrnes. But then, when the film reaches halfway, Hilton and Byrnes fight in the fist. It's not very funny and it's the weakest part of the movie, but it throws everything you've seen before in a new light. You realize that in reality this is a parody of Spaghetti Western conventions and, in retrospect, the first half is so well done that you completely miss this underlying current. The following is now a more obvious parody, with even a few acrobatic jumps from Brynes that predate all these circus westerns of the seventies. The end, a complete sending of the culmination of "The good, the bad and the ugly", is very well done, because in other hands, it could have been very ridiculous. So, a fun Western Spaghetti that does not take itself too seriously. I would recommend it to anyone who loves spaghetti westerns.
