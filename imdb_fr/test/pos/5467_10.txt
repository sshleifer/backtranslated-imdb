I saw this film during its broadcast on Lifetime in 2004. I have never seen it since, but I often thought about it. It left me with such an impression that I had been looking for it for some time. I finally found it and realized it was only for television. The film is fabulous, filled with writings and remarkable actors. William Petersen is perfect, as always. This film left me speechless and in tears. It's a wonderful story of faith, love and compassion. Does anyone know how I can get a copy of this movie at home? Is it possible with TV movies? I would really love to see him again. This is a must-have among my collection !!
