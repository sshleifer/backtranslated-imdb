John Carpenter's brilliantly suspensive film is a great fusion of science fiction and horror, adopting the classic theme of body swap and bringing it to the extreme. A remake of the original 1951 Howard Hawks, Carpenter retains the themes of paranoia and Cold War confidence as a backdrop for alien control and imminent fate in the madness and isolation of the Antarctic cadre . The management of Carpenter is as always excellent, because his camera slips into the solitary world of characters whose living environment is about to be corrupted by the primordial fear of taking possession of the body. But here and a little like the work of David Cronenberg, Carpenter does not stop on the incident, because through fantastic special effects, we attend insane moments of surreal gore. However, he never loses contact with the human side of the story, because in the face of the shocking events happening in front of us, we still have perceived notions of trust and suspicion. <br /> <br /> 9/10
