The opening film of the bank's conveyor belt indicated that this film would be great. <br /> <br /> A minimalist touch with a touch of retro this film is full of style - the brilliant camera The work, the acting, the scenario and the way in which the secret life of the protagonist is completed to complement each other to form the best Italian film I have ever seen (with La Stanza Del Figlio - although it's different). <br /> <br /> Shame on the people sitting behind me who made it clear that they could not see the relevance of the slow but painfully beautiful scenes meticulously designed by the camera. Do not miss.
