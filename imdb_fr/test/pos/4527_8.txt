Murder in New York is one of Chan's best mysteries and it's the first time I've seen it. <br /> <br /> Charlie Chan travels to New York to attend a police convention. At the same time, people involved in aircraft manufacturing plants are murdered and he decides to participate in the investigation, alongside his son number 2. These murders are the result of sabotage in the factories of manufacturing of Aircraft and Chan helps identify the murderer ... his son number 2 and Marjorie Weaver. <br /> <br /> I rather liked this mystery and deserves the detour if you like that kind of thing. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3 and a half stars out of 5
