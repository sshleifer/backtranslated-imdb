Lights of New York was the first feature film. There was of course The Jazz Singer, released in October 1927, the first feature film incorporating a synchronized dialogue. However, this film released in July 1928 has hardly been recalled for its place in the history of cinema. It started as a short film, but more and more, it was added until it reached a climax at 58 minutes. It has by chance become the first full-length feature film. It opened at a base race and to the surprise of Warner Bros., brought in more than a million dollars. It was fine in 1928. <br /> <br /> The plot is quite simple. Two peasant barbers buy naively in a Broadway barber shop, an easy pretext to take in hand for "The Hawk", a gangster. When they learn the truth, they can not afford to go out, because the young barber, Eddie, has all the money from his blocked mother instead. Kitty is the girlfriend of the youngest hairdresser and gangster Hawk (Wheeler Oakman) is watching for her older girlfriend (Gladys Brockwell) to turn to a new model - the choir girl Kitty (Helene Costello). A policeman is killed while trying to stop the Hawk men from unloading illegal liquor, and the Hawk sees an opportunity to mentor Eddie, getting Kitty for himself. <br /> <br /> This first talkie is loaded with pleasure for fans of these pioneering works. Of course, the plot is elemental and the dialogue open, but there is something you do not see often in the early talkies: the musical notation in the background. Vitaphone was originally used for this purpose, and here they still use it to accompany the music as well as the dialogue. And there are singing and dancing numbers! The scenes from Hawk's nightclub are used to show what movies could never do before - musical numbers. There is even a transmitter with raging eyes, pretty makeup of the silent era, which deserves to be watched. <br /> <br /> The Vitaphone could not go outside at this stage because of static camera cabs. scene in the park between the two lovers Eddie and Kitty is simulated - and cheaply. The greenery looks like an Ed Wood movie or maybe a high school production from "Our Town". <br /> <br /> Gladys Brockwell, as Hawk's girlfriend, speaks loudly. She is a real horsewoman considering which lines she has to deliver. For the hawk - "So, you think you can have any chicken and throw me in the bridge!" Huh? mixed metaphors someone? And then there are his last lines "I lived, I loved and I lost!" Has anyone been paid to write this dialogue? Brockwell had a successful love affair after winning some silent movies (the evil sister of "Seventh Heaven"), when a deadly car accident ended his career. <br /> <br /> Then there's Eugene Palette - the oldest of the two barbers in our history. His frog voice, natural lines and cuddly appearance have allowed him to have a long career as a character actor, usually appearing as an endorsed business man / man, with a gruff exterior and a heart of gold. In fact, Mr. Palette is the only member of this cast to still have a remarkable career in the movies just three years after the release of this film. <br /> <br /> Finally, one must ask "where is this hidden microphone?" ? "The microphones were still motionless at this point, and it's fun to know where they hid it.There is a famous scene, however, where everyone can understand it.Hawk is in his office and talking to his two men - who seem to understand as slowly as they speak - about "taking Eddie for a ride." If you look at this scene, you would say that the phone on the desk is a character in this movie. the whole conversation The microphone is probably in the phone. <br /> <br /> There is something heroic about the fact that these pioneers are flying blind in the face of the new sound technology. silent actors who are accustomed to using pantomime for expression, Vaudevillians who know how to play in front of an audience but do not know how to make the same impression on a Vitaphone camera booth, and you have dialogue writers who try t write a conversation as compact as title cards or movies filled with endless chatter. <br /> <br /> Check this one. It's not boring, it moves fast, and it's a lot of fun if you know what to look for. And no, I do not expect it to be on Blu-Ray, but I hope Warner Brothers will soon add it to Warner Archive so everyone can see it.
