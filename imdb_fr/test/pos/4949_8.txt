Iron Eagle may not be the most credible movie in terms of plot, but the characters are well written and played very well. If you can not believe the characters, the movie is a flop. <br /> <br /> I believe that photography, especially aerial photography, is superb. I believe he is far superior to Top Gun, to which he is constantly compared. This is one of the best aerial photographs I have ever seen. The soundtrack of Basil Paledouros (pardon the spelling) is excellent and juxtaposes well with the rock tunes. I wish this part of the soundtrack is available. <br /> <br /> Jason Gedrick does well as a teenager who must suddenly grow in haste and the realities of life, death and responsibilities. Lou Gossett is fabulous in the role of Chappy, both tough, biting and human when he remembers the deaths of pilots. <br /> <br /> There are many movies you watch once and you do not want to watch again. Then there are those movies that attract you for one aspect or another and you can watch it again and again! Iron Eagle is that kind of movie!
