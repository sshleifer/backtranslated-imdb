Being a middle-aged mother myself, I really enjoyed seeing an adult romance intertwined with the many issues that affect us. <br /> <br /> Diane Lane admirably describes Adrienne, the sacrifice and conflict that a mother endures, wanting to do what is right for her children, while having a happy life. <br /> <br /> I'm not a big fan of Richard Gere, but he always does a good job with the guy who's a fool, but who's learning something about himself. <br /> <br /> The criticism of their romance as unrealistic is hardly justified compared to most other romantic movies. When Nicole Kidman and Hugh Jackman fall in love with Australia, they barely have a conversation they consider a true love affair. We have so much more here with Rodanthe. She redeems him. He releases her. It's beautiful. <br /> <br /> The intimacy they create by sharing their deepest insecurity, the fans in a flame of passion. The time it takes is irrelevant. Perhaps the film was a little too subtle in that it was the letters they shared the following year that deepened their relationship - again, another historical way of getting to know someone . <br /> <br /> Although I enjoyed the plot and themes, the dialogue was not of consistent quality. Some lines sounded so true, and other lines were embarrassing, banal and banal. <br /> <br /> I also enjoyed the relationship with Adrienne's teenage daughter and her best friend, reminding us that there are many types of love, not just romantic love. <br /> <br /> It's not a light heart. romantic comedy, plus a romantic drama. He has a very relaxed pace that some might consider too slow. <br /> <br /> The house on the beach is a fabulous work of art. Look for the driftwood bench on the porch in the first pan-over of the house - very beautiful. I also enjoyed the music and the landscapes, which combined to create the effect of the place as the third main character. It is this place far removed from their usual life that allowed them to see each other and see each other in a different light. <br /> <br /> If you are old enough to appreciate these themes and if you feel like crying out the Kleenex and enjoy this movie.
