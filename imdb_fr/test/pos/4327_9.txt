What is the interest of these messages except to discuss and share thoughts on the next season ... Here are my predictions: 1. The trap has been sounded, but everyone inside has survived . Goals lets see about it. 2. The episode at the end of the tent is an observation team monitoring the tracking device installed on the Desmonds boat by Penny. Now that the magnetic shield around the island has been lifted, the signal has been picked up by the observation station and they will send a rescue mission. 3. After the destruction of the hatch, the island is no longer isolated and other ships / planes will arrive 4. The others will finally share their secret with us, poor observers <br /> It was indeed confirmed that there will be 4 seasons of LOST? <br /> <br /> Cheers Mike
