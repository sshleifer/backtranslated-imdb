It's a great movie, but Momento (Nolan's other big budget movie) is a lot better. I would recommend people to see Momento, then if they like that, see this movie. The film is shot in black and white, which made me a little nervous at first, but once in the film, you understand that black and white is the best way to see the film. It is extremely attractive and relatively easy to understand even if the way it was designed is extremely intelligent. I think some elements of the plot are a little silly, but the film certainly deserves a second viewing. To compete, the film has a clever plot, clever twists, a very good acting and given the budget of the film, I must say it's pretty incredible.
