This movie is extremely funny - the character of mom makes me go back to the movie again and again! I can not get tired of her dry lines ... like when she tells her son Owen to bury his friend in the back yard before he feels the place ... unsalted nuts! It's hilarious! <br /> <br /> If you like movies like National Lampoon's Vacation, Uncle Buck or Planes, Trains & Automobiles, your humor will be the same. It's a great healthy laugh ... to see absolutely!
