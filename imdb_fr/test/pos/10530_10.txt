Bright work. Wonderful actors dissolve like brave and courageous characters. All the unforgettable roles in an action thriller more than captivating and captivating. The casting is perfect. Both on the side of stars like: Armand Asante, Bernhardt, Kier, Denier. But also for new faces. I was very impressed by the young actor who plays the role of a gang member, Mustafa. You trust each of the Turkish gang. Michael Barral and all the supporters of the white power are very convincing. I admire the musical rhythm of the main theme of "Children of Wax". This soundtrack is a charming mixture of Turkish, hard rock and humming Udo Kier ?? And at the same time, Children of Wax ", a tale focused on racial conflicts, intolerance and brutality between skinheads and Turks.
