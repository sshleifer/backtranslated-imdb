DO NOT TORTURE DUCKLING (Lucio Fulci - Italy 1972). <br /> <br /> This is certainly a prime candidate for the most foolish film title ever conceived, it's quite a feat in the country of the giallo. Originally, the film was titled even more absurdly: "Do not torture Donald Duck", translated literally from his Italian title. A small Donald Duck figurine is briefly introduced as a toy, but barely sufficient to make a title like this, but apparently it has been changed for fear of legal ramifications by Disney. I have criticized much of Fulci's previous film, LIZARD IN A WOMAN'S SKIN (1971), but all the ingredients are present. A surprisingly effective mystery, a good distribution and an imaginative imagination against an unusual rural setting. Everything is done in one click. I think it is rightly hailed as one of the most accomplished achievements of the director. <br /> <br /> The story takes place in the context of a small mountain town in Sicily, where someone kills young teenagers. Among the suspects, the most obvious is a young woman, Maciara (Florinda Balkan), a self-proclaimed witch who is seen suspiciously digging up the skeleton of a baby and planting pins in effigies. Guiseppe, the idiot of the village is also suspected because he tried weakly to take advantage of the disappearance of one of the boys and found himself trapped. At a time when a keen journalist (Tomas Milian) arrives from Milan to cover the murders, he immediately begins to question the authorities' assumptions, when he meets two other potential suspects: Don Alberto, the local priest ( Marc Porel) with Patrizia (Barbara Bouchet), a bored young woman from the city with a troubled drug history, who also believes she has sex with young boys in the city. Talk about your red herring premium. <br /> <br /> Fulci contrasts nicely with modernity and tradition with the new elevated road that winds through the Sicilian hills, into old cities where life is still deeply rooted in tradition and superstition. One could debate the political position of the film as North versus South, or as a commentary on the virtues of small cities - conventions of society in general - which are too often on the verge of dangerously falling into moral disintegration, chaos and ultimately self-determination. justice by the population. The film has often been criticized for its anticatholic tone, but it is not an important element except for obvious reasons related to the plot, which would give too much. It is actually quite docile compared to a film like that of Joel Seria, DO NOT MAKE IT BAD (1971). Probably, the rather unflattering portrayal of the film in which the Sicilian values ​​of a small town are located (when another boy is killed, the local population is portrayed as a backward lynch-populan) could be a ground for Sicily, but - considering the problematic relationship of Sicily with the rest of Italy - hardly problematic for other Italians, I think. The film was defeated in the dark much too quickly to make a huge impact. <br /> <br /> When you speak in fulci, the amount of blood is usually a main topic of discussion. Although gouging scenes are lacking, the film contains two very graphic scenes. In the rough final, the killer falls off a cliff, shattering his face along the rocks with abominable (though unrealistic) results. And the sequence of flogging with Florinda Balkan in the graveyard shows Fulci's penchant for sadistic violence and, as a rule, does not graphically show what most filmmakers would refer to. Surely one of the most horrible scenes in Fulci's repertoire. <br /> <br /> It is above all a small tense, well-written and effective mystery, well enlightened by Fulci, with an impressive distribution of regulars of the genre like Barbara Bouchet, Marc Porel (not very convincing in as a priest), Tomas Milian and Florinda Balkan (mad as a witch in the mouth). <br /> <br /> Camera Obscura --- 8/10
