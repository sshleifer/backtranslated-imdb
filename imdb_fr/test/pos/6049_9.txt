I saw this film on television in the 60s and it resists well even after brilliant performances by DI Lee Ermey, Lou Gossett and even Frank Sutton (in a comic vein) on Gomer Pyle USMC. I was not on duty, but my brother had recorded a training instructor in the air force and it was scary. Other family members who were marines told me that Ermey and even Sutton were very well placed in their roles. The only thing missing in "The D. I." is the language. In 1958, they could not yet use blasphemies on a film, and yet Jack Webb was damn hard without it. I think it's his best role ever. In Dragnet, he was rather stiff, I admit, but not as bad as George Raft, but he only used it to play in "The D. I." You will never forget the funeral of the dead flea! The romantic part was simply to stretch the film, but did not really interfere with the basic plot. Don Dubbins was very good but he never went beyond this film in his career. As for patriotism, Jack Webb was John Wayne of television. He pushed it a little too far in some episodes of Dragnet, but not in "The D. I." After 40 years, I was hoping that the film could stand up to "Full Metal Jacket", among others. and it did!
