I really liked this film, because of thorny scenes (both humorous and ironic, sometimes even "tragic"), credible performances, witty dialogue and a sincere rendering of what it looks like or rather what one could be / and / or heterosexual. or homosexual & on the lookout for fulfilling your desires. I'm aware of the paradox here: homosexual and heterosexual ... it's something that the film addresses, but never uses it for caricature. If you are as open-minded as the people who seem to have shot this movie, in the end you will not matter if those who fold in the arms are of the same sex or not. <br /> <br /> "Mr. Smith" of the matrix gives an admirable turn as a gay house seller with "strange" appetites here, but that's not the only thing to marvel. enjoy.....
