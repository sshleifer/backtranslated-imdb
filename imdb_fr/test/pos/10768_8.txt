In the second film of his films on historical martial arts, Chiba describes his real life sensei Mas Oyama. The film recreates even Oyama's incredible feat of killing a rabid bull with his bare hands (Oyama has done this feat more than 50 times in real life). Dynamic combat choreography with authentic Kyokushinkai techniques. Ironically, this is one of Sonny Chiba's rare films in which he does not tear or tear off parts of his opponents' bodies. Must see for fans of Sonny Chiba, one of his 5 best movies
