"Subconscious Cruelty" must be one of the most disturbing films I have ever seen. "Salo" and "Cannibal Holocaust" did not bother me too much, but there is a strange psychological element in "Unconscious Cruelty". This film invades your subconscious with shocking taboos, surreal visuals and one of the most unsettling movie scores and soundscapes. Repulsive at times; yes, but his visual talent can be compared to Avant-Gard directors such as Alejandro Jodorowsky, Dario Argento, Dusan Makavejev and David Lynch. Take the most extreme elements of these 4 directors and incorporate the graphic violence of a film by Luico Fulci, and you may be able to guess what you are planning. <br /> <br /> The film is divided into 4 parts. The first part "The Ovarian Eye" is really short. A narrator tells us about the parts of the brain and its functions. Then a naked woman cuts her stomach and takes out an eyeball. The second part "Human Larvae" is a bit like the film "Eraserhead" but with incest. It deals with the sexual obsession of a man with his pregnant sister. Where is Frued when you need him? The third part is my absolute favorite. It reminds me of Jame's Broughton's "Begotten" and 1972 short film "Dreamwood". In this segment, people have sex with the earth. Men dig bloody holes in the ground, girls masturbate with tree branches. The branches bleed when they are broken. Watch in horror a man giving a blowjob to a knife coming out of a woman's vagina. These people really know how to get in touch with nature. <br /> <br /> The last part of the film is the most disturbing and sometimes affects hardcore pornography. This part of the film reminded me of Jodorowsky's "The Holy Mountain", the "Sweet Movie" and the "Cannibal Holocaust". I have never been so troubled in my life by what I witnessed. A businessman gets his quarters separated by hooks. Yuck and Ouch! Two women urinate on a figure of Christ and begin to eat it in a cannibal way as communion bread and sodomize it with a tree branch. Poor man. The last part was so extreme that if I went for the movie again, I would close my eyes or go a little bit forward. Karim Hussien and Mitch Davis are obviously very talented. Say they realized this project in their early twenties. Hussein then directed "Ascension" (2002), a much better film, and wrote the screenplay for Nacho Cerda, a dark horror masterpiece "The Abandoned". "Unconscious Cruelty" is a fascinating and disturbing journey; with images that come from the unthinkable realm of ordinary human minds. Well, sort of.
