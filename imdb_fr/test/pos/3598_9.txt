Forget all those people who tell you that it's not as good as the book. So what? It's a movie after all. It's a pure pleasure to watch, made entirely on site in Cephallonia, a beautiful photograph but with dark and disturbing moments. The only problem I have is with the obvious mistake of Nicolas Cage as captain Corelli. Apart from that, the film was a very pleasant surprise.
