David Innes (Doug McClure) and Dr. Abner Perry (Peter Cushing) sneak into the Earth's core with their thorny machine. The duo discovers an ancient prehistoric world populated by gigantic beasts and dangerous humans, used both as food and as slaves by evil telepathic pterodactyl men. Director Kevin Conner, who has worked from a subtle and sneaky scenario of Milton Subotsky, maintains a fast and steady pace and deals with the exceptionally stupid principle with astonishing seriousness, thus giving this image some fervent quality to the both fun and endearing. The special effects adorably hokey (not so) are pretty funny (involuntarily). The panoply of low-priced creatures, in particular, has a positive side: sturdy men in crisp rubber suits, men in pterodactyls, wild rinky-dink-like monkey-men and a hilarious grotesque frog of fire. that blows up real good. McClure mixes it with a big and clumsy giant reptile. Another priceless scene is a dinosaur holding a doll between his jaws. In addition, we also have brutal fist grips and a thrilling and exciting revolt. It's a treat for everyone to see Cushing play happily in a large comic role and become an improbable but enthusiastic hero, carrying arrows, in the last third of the film. Caroline Munro, always so greedy, looks really delightful as Princess Dia, but she is also supported by Cy Grant in the role of the gallant warrior Ra and by Sean Lynch in the role of the cowardly treacherous Hoojah. Mike Vickers' highly varied score alternates between cool orchestral music and silly synthesizers. Alan Hume's flawless cinematography adds a brilliant brilliance to the infectious and meaningless process. A complete camping riot.
