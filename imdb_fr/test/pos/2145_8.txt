I really do not know why this movie received such a hostile reception on its first release. Of course, his portrayal of sexuality and violence is a bit excessive and somewhat gratuitous, but so are many well-viewed films. I really do not think that those who hated "Heaven's Gate" understood it well. "Heaven's Gate" in its raw form, much like "The Deer Hunter", shows the big differences between living a precarious and dangerous life (like immigrants and Averil in Wyoming) and living in comfort and privileges ( such as the "established Americans" in Wyoming and Averil in the prologue and epilogue.) Living a difficult life is painful, but it can also be invigorating, unlike the dull life that Averil leads in the epilogue. besides, as Michael Cimino has strived to make the picture historically accurate, it is fascinating as a document of American life (and possibly impeachment) in Old West Wyoming.The dialogue is often really intelligent and emotional, associated with quality music and cinematography, the film works as a truly poetic work of art.Of course, "Heaven's Gate", with its refusal to attend the viewer, is not for all tastes. In fact, Hollywood produces so many commercial problems every year that it is so much easier to call brain-less candies (even when an example becomes a blockbuster) that Gate and Cimino really deserve more respect. Everyone should see the uncut version at least once, then get their own idea. <br /> <br />
