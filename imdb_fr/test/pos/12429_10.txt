If you've taken a really good Black Jack movie, added some jeepers creepers, then a pinch of joy with a hint of Texas chainsaw killing and the 1000 corpses home ... you'd have MONSTER MAN! I went in this movie, without really expecting much, but I finally enjoyed the film. the premise is really old-fashioned, a monster man in a monster truck is chasing people, but it's so funny that the screenwriter / director does not expect you to take it seriously. Justin Urich is a comical gem who should have a very promising career. it is identical to the black jack. the only problem with the movie is the incredible role of hero played by eric jungmann. But all in all, if you're looking for a really fun movie that will make you crack until you roll in the aisles while scary ... watch this movie.
