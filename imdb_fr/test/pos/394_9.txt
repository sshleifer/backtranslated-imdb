I enjoyed this film, which offers various secondary intrigues and complex relationships between love and hate, as well as intertwined action scenes and light moments in which the mountaineers oppose the hard discipline of the army. All the main characters are well expressed. Certainly John Wayne or Robert Mitchum would probably have also played the lead role, but Victor Mature certainly appears as some sort of tarzan stain. It reminds me of his role in the movie Samson, another tough but not impossible man to tame. <br /> <br /> The Montagnards of the opening scene are certainly an anachronism, just like the era of pure trappers. completed 20 years earlier, with the collapse of the western beaver populations and the beaver pelts fashion market. This story would take place in Oregon just before the end of the Civil War. Judging by the volcano in the background of the opening scene (probably Mount Lassen), the fictitious fort was located somewhere in a remote part of the Cascades, as we never see other civilians. However, there is a lot of conflicting evidence that this is actually happening in the mountains of Wyoming or Montana! Red Cloud, the warlord who threatens trappers and soldiers in the fort, owes his name to the famous Sioux warlord who successfully led a campaign to exterminate the recently built military forts in Wyoming and Montana, in 1865-1866. Fort Laramie (Eastern Wyoming) is mentioned as not too far from the fictitious fort. The tribe of the plains of Assiniboines mentions his membership of Red Cloud. This aspect of history thus has a general resemblance to a historical fact. <br /> <br /> It may be interesting to note some similarities between the plot of this story and that of John Ford's "Fort Apache". In both cases, we have a fort commander who was recently assigned to his first border post with Native American problems. He underestimates the military prowess of his opponents and considers them only as cannon fodder to promote his career. In both films, he pays dearly for his inexperience in dealing with the enemy. In addition, the Commander-in-Chief feels resentment toward a subordinate with long experience of local Indians who wants to tell him what to do and what not to do. . In both films, we have a nascent romantic relationship between a woman very close to the commander's heart and a subordinate, whom the commander does everything to choke. It is obvious that the commander must be eliminated to allow these relationships to end. <br /> <br /> I also see some similarities with "The Misfits". The soldiers, as a whole, including the commander, are unsuitable (as one of them admits): they have mostly "problems" or are recruits without experience in the fight against the Amerindians . The commander's wife is apparently the only woman. inside or near this fort, is therefore inherently unsuitable, with a husband who is very uncertain of his future in the army. The trappers, in their turn, are also maladjusted, not really willing to accept the military or civil discipline, still cut The former antagonism generated by the army of Red Cloud testifies of their free and free past. <br /> <br /> Finally, we can also compare this story with Anthony Mann's latest film, "The Far Country", starring Jimmy Stewart. case, he may choose to become a lonely cowboy again at the end. But the character of Mature does not propose a new appetizing way to become his own boss. Red Cloud has made life outside the army in this too dangerous region. to contemplate.In addition, he has an obsession with the woman commander.
