A man is wrongly accused of killing his friend in an airplane factory fire and has to travel several countries to escape the police and discover the true sinister nature of the situation. A plot later used to feed Northwest's classic Hitchcock by Northwest, Saboteur enjoys very good performances as well as masterful suspense sequences from Master himself. <br /> <br /> For any fan of Hitchcock, the plot is: a little too familiar, but he has always been able to infuse history with his own characters and charades memorable. Here, the friendly and charming Robert Cummings is the lead role and soon finds himself visiting many strange and unusual characters, despite a troupe of circus performers, a rich businessman with hidden motives and a blind solitaire who shows the best way to judge. <br /> <br /> In terms of originality and quality, this is missing in some areas, particularly the motive of the antagonists. However, there is a good chemistry between Cummings and his main wife, the underappreciated Priscilla Lane, as well as a moving performance as a blind man by Vaughn Glaser. The best part is the final sequence, which perfectly reflects what Hitchcock would later use in North by Northwest, but this time the climax is at the top of a statue in New York. Certainly not his best, but the Master of Suspense leaves us a long time to wait.
