It's a beautiful look, you should excuse the pun: 22 women talk about breasts - theirs, their mothers, other women and how they affect many aspects of their lives. Young girls, old women and all the others (with all shapes, sizes, configurations, etc.) talk about developing, reacting, celebrating, hiding, improving or reducing the breast. <br /> It's charming, lovely sad, funny and everything else. Cut with documentary footage and excerpts from these old "famous women's movies" that the girls took to the cafeteria to see, the interviews are a fascinating window for men who love women and their breasts, what the other half has to say I do not know that you listen.
