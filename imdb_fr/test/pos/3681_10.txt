I saw this film for the first time at a queer film festival. Ten minutes after the end of the movie, a homosexual couple approached me and asked if I needed help - I was still sitting, crying like a maniac. The film is corny, it's weird, it's too much, it's gay - but it's amazing. I think every character is plausible. The character of Everett is mean to a woman who only seeks to help, he brutally throws his (terrible) friends, he has a cold temper, he can harm a fly, the "fly" that killed the love of his life, even more. Bates is a miracle, she is perfect, just like a role. A woman whose love and admiration is so strong that she even loves the homosexual lover of her idol is for me the essence of true love. I even understand Max (the husband), he misses his life, he has a midlife crisis. He moves, tries to lead an exciting life, only to realize a) that he is the really boring part of the relationship and b) that he loves his wife. I like the fact that it finally comes back to him because I think it gives the film the right balance between dream and reality. In the end, he is her husband and he may not be as exciting as Victor, but he is real, he is the man she loves in a very realistic way. I have watched it about 50 times and I love this movie, everything is unconditional. BTW, just read Rupert Everett's autobiography and UL is the only movie he talks about as one of the best movies he's ever made. For me, it's the best movie he's ever done.
