William H. Macy always gives a good performance. He never looks lazy and never seems to prefer to be anywhere else. In short, it is what more actors should be. "A slight murder case" is directed by Steven Schachter, who then shot two other great movies with Macy (Door to Door, The Wool Beanie). <br /> <br /> The TV movies have long been acting too much, bad cinematography, and sub-par script. That's why it's so refreshing to watch a TV movie that does exactly what it was created for. Tell a little story (not a simplistic story) that does not require big screen viewing. <br /> <br /> "A slight murder case" is a light and entertaining product, as well as an excellent watch. <Br /> <br /> 7.6 out of 10
