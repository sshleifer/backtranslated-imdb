Eddie Monroe is Hooooot. He is a great actor and I could be his daughter at any time. He is so good. I was so sad at the end. I will not spoil the end but wow. The girls are so vicious. His daughter was wrong. If Eddie were my man, I would never miss anything. These gangsters were scary. The moral of the story is Trust No One. Your friends will hurt you if they can. Oh and Eddie tells your girlfriend that mine, she should move eggs! I suggest to see the movie. Why? Becasur I said it. This kept my eyes on the screen. My sister loved that too I will see him again because now my friends want to see him and it's worth it to see him twice. Peace, happy new year!
