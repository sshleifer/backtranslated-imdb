I really like the show. The show is very entertaining and it's a clean show. A show like surface is interesting. That catches my attention. There is compassion and suspense. I like all the members of the cast who are in the series. They are all very good choices. I think it's very important to have the right distribution of Any Show because that's what makes each show a success and of course the scenes and the show itself. Television has changed so much over the years. It has changed in a positive and negative way. I like to watch comedy, action, suspense and romance. And scifi. But Surface is a show that I hope will come back for many seasons because it's a great show that families can watch. My children have grown up, but my husband and I like to watch these types of shows. Thank you for your time and let me comment my opinion. <br /> <br /> Thank you. <br /> <br /> Paulette Blackwell
