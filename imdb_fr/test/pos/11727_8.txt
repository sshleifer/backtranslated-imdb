It was one of those movies that I always met (whether on TV or on a cheap DVD), but that never hit me trying because I thought I did not miss much. It was one night and I thought, well ?? why not. A good decision too, because I would blame myself for taking so much time to get there. For me, this has left me impressed, as Burt Reynold's best features ("Deliverance", "White Lightning" and "Boogie Nights") and a look back at these urban and cruel urban crime thrillers did not fear to be obscured by fear and go out of their way to stage characters, wrap it with a realistic and brutal force and effectively incorporate the local places (Atlanta being the case here) to the fold with photographs well anchored. In some nuances, it made me think of "Dirty Harry," but it's vaguely. However, his delicately muffled blues score with his quivering kicks, funky changes, and messy sounds made me think of Lalo Schifrin's thrilling score, which he orchestrated for "Dirty Harry." The soundtrack of the music is random. <br /> <br /> Sgt. Tom Sharky was a narcotic agent in the Atlantic before a bust stunt saw him demoted to vice president. With his new team, they encounter a prostitution ring, which attracts their interest because it belongs to a difficult to follow and condemnation of the crime lord. What they discover involves a government figure and a call girl who can give them important names, but they must reach her before she becomes a target. <br /> <br /> The acts of Burt Reynold, but also its staging a decidedly firm and muscular fashion that would be appropriate to its laconic performance and the thematically treated scenario of Gerald Di Pego (adapted from William Diehl's novel) ). Well, he shows some kind of heart / insightful thoughts among this armor in scenes involving British actress Rachel Ward, very powerful, whether it's the staging scenes where he looks at it from another building (and slowly becomes infatuated with it) when they finally meet, but these last mid-term interactions slow the momentum but give it a black appearance. The performances are fairly well placed and Reynold has created an excellent relationship with exceptional actors such as Charles Durning, Earl Holliman, Brian Keith, Richard Libertini and Bernie Casey. The scathing profanation and spiritual dialogues between these guys have been an explosion. As for corrupt villains, Vittorio Gassman builds an imposing strength and power, but it is Henry Silva (who seems to have been born for these roles) a cunning and unstoppable trick that makes the series. Where his appearance seems to describe things to come and help them get established. His violent climax with Sharky and his team is accomplished brilliantly. <br /> <br /> The thrilling action scenes could be fast and dry, but remain violent as a sequence of quizzes that cringe. . Some practical and old-fashioned shooting techniques add to the suspense. The intriguing material retains its rather tactical character, but when one thinks that its navigation is soft, it offers one or two surprises, as well as extremely hard confrontations.
