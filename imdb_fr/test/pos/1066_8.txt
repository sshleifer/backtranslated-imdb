Forget Jimmy Stewart reliving his life and go for that smart comedy of mistakes. I guess that only institutionalized sexism explains why this movie and Stanwyck's other great Christmas story, "Meet John Doe" are not revered with the same level of love as ... well, you know his name. <br /> <br /> Stanwyck plays the role of a culinary writer for a McCall-type rag that has been lying for years to his pompous publisher about the folkloric d√©cor of his recipes. She is a b.s. artist until the day Morgan's sailor is removed from the ocean after 18 days afloat and 6 weeks of convalescence at a Navy hospital. Released in the last year of the Second World War, the film is sprinkled with subtle patriotic gestures and holiday nostalgia, but never sinks into sentimentality. Stanwyck is sexy and impertinent, as always, and meets his match in the pretty Morgan, with whom it is love at first sight. Unfortunately, she has to marry the famous Gardiner architect who has been looking for his hand for years at his CT farm, just to fool his boss. <br /> <br /> S.Z. Sakall adds a lot of Hungarian malaprop and two-way humor as Babs' true source of culinary talent and Una O'Connor is hilarious as Gardiner's obnoxious Irish governess.
