William Shakespeare's plays are classified as comedy, tragedy or history. Some of her most memorable creations - and most often read - offer nostalgic humor, sweet poetry and a hilarious hut. Some of them survive as unforgettable dramas of convincing depth and gravity. Anyway, he was able to write with unparalleled skill and inventiveness, contributing greatly to our young language. So what category is The Merchant of Venice? I was very surprised to find that this is one of Shakespeare's comedies. I had never read or seen it before, but after watching the most recent version of the film, I decided it was neither. This is one of the many questions the viewer must try to answer when it comes to a clearly confusing and deeply troubling moral tragedy. <br /> <br /> Players are introduced quickly and simply. One of them, in the first place, is Venice itself; director Michael Radford filmed the Venetian scenes of the current city, creating an extremely dynamic and animated backdrop for the unfolding of the play. Bassanio (Joseph Fiennes), young man, enters this landscape and returns to Venice to see a dear old friend, Antonio (Jeremy Irons). It seems that poor Bassanio has heard of a princess whose father is dead and has left any potential suitor a sort of lottery. Three small trunks are expected on the estate of the island of the beautiful lady, only one of which contains "images of the princess". Whoever can guess the right choice, using only the blind intuition and enigmatic enigmas written on it, will be endowed with the father's enormous fortune for life. Oh, and his daughter and his eternal love in marriage, I forgot to mention. Here, Shakespeare's light comedy takes over the film. This element of ridiculous plot is at the base of the story and occupies much of the film's duration, while a number of extremely impatient opportunists arrive on the island, looking with humor and failing to win. this hand very rich in marriage. But before all this happens, Bassanio, who is sorely lacking in financial means, begs Antonio to lend him three thousand ducats to pay for the long journey he will have to take to get the prize. <br /> <br /> Antonio, himself almost penniless, must reluctantly embrace humility seeking financial help from Shylock (Al Pacino), one of the countless Jewish usurers who keep the economy weakened afloat, but are despised and persecuted endless zealous majority of Christians of the city. Thus, they live in the basement of society, and it is here that the two borrowers must leave. Shylock does not hesitate to remind the two men of a certain incident in which Antonio insulted him and spit on him in the city market. He proudly reprimands this man who has a lot of courage to ask for help. But help him, it's Shylock. He even wipes out any kind of interest on the loan, probably estimating that he has no reason to worry if Antonio will be able to repay it within three months. Nevertheless, Shylock's only contractual demand is a pound of flesh by Antonio, if he renounced their agreement. This is a troubling request, for Antonio and Bassanio, as well as for us. But it seems that despite her legitimate pride, Shylock does not really anticipate the occurrence of such an awful act. <br /> <br /> It is here that the dramatic foundations were laid. And as the film goes off in search of its softer side with its love lottery and mistaken identities, the dark prospect of lending is looming. In the end, what will happen to this sinister agreement? In the meantime, we still have to explore the true central character of Shylock. Al Pacino has a lot of dramatic weight to bear here, and he does so with conviction and passion. There are times when it leaves room for the theater that is now expected of such a colorful actor. But his most impressive scenes are those where he internalizes this energy, showing a conflicting personality: honest, sincere and proud, but nevertheless dark, vengeful and totally without remorse. This is one of Pacino's most sincere performances to date. And while the other actors play their roles in a credible and convincing way, it is Pacino who really is the owner of the film - especially towards the end, when Shakespeare reverses this apparent romantic comedy by a crush of a third act . <br /> <br /> I will not reveal much here; all I can say is that this is the initial loan - a powerful shoe that you would expect to drop sooner or later. And does he ever do it. In the end, Shakespeare raised a host of dilemmas for his audience: seemingly insoluble questions about faith, morality, law and mercy are put to us through the final scenes and, if the curtain is tight, the position of the Playwright may seem clear to some. are left completely at odds. There are winners and losers in this one, but did the winners get their loot with good reason or did they end up losing too? Has virtue been rewarded or simply flouted? Was justice fair this time? At the end of the play, some fates are painfully obvious and perfectly sealed. But the public must be the one who really decides the verdict for everyone involved. And for some, the verdict is still pending. Comedy or tragedy? The author cleverly concealed the final of the courtroom with a gaiety end and romantic resolutions. Is he saying that all is well ends well or is it his final and ironic condemnation? The humor of the room serves to prepare us for such an accident. And if this is also what prevents the Merchant of Venice from reaching the grandeur of so many other works of Shakespeare, it is always interesting, amusing and stimulating to reflection.
