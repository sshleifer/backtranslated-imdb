Why did the critics not like this movie? I do not understand. It's easily my favorite effort of Clive Barker. "Hellraiser" is a bit too hard (the movie never leaves this stupid house) and, let's face it, "Lord of Illusions" does not move at all !!! I liked Barker's writing for years, especially his "Books of Blood". Terribly entertaining. He has a vicious side that is totally different from Stephen King. He mixes freely with his own homosexuality and with strange religious and occult elements. I love it I love it I love it I love it However, I also realize that Barker is a dark fantasy writer as well as a horror writer. And fantasy is just not my bag. I'm allowed to sleep. Has always. I also think that Barker works better with news. His novels tend to wander a little. It was my experience when I tried to read "The Damnation Game". It started well. Then 100 pages in I thought "where are you going?" because it was not happening anywhere. <br /> <br /> I read "Cabal" (the book on which Nightbreed was based) and I thought it was good. I particularly like the development of Decker's character. The way the mask spoke to him and controlled him. I like the way Barker simply presents it. Black and white. Here it is. It gives it an attractive and credible simplicity. When asked why Decker kills, he says (simply) "Because I like it". Probably something that Jeffrey Dahmer said at one point. <br /> <br /> But I liked the movie Nightbreed better than Cabal. I love the visual attention that Barker gives to details. ADORE IT. I think it's just beautiful. Lord of Illusions also had some. Some of the early drawings, during the sequence of credits Nightbreed. It's like a complete vocabulary that Barker imagined for the world of Nightbreed. I would be curious to know how much was his design. I know that he is an INCREDIBLE artist who has his own style and his own artist's language. <br /> <br /> Nightbreed is also (I think) BArker's most entertaining film. It moves very fast. Well edited. It does not hang around like Lord of Illusions does. Very fast. Everything is perfect. It also works like a fantastic and scary little slasher movie. Killing the murderer early, killing the family and tormenting the old man in the store is really scary. This mask is scary. I would be curious if Barker also designed it. It's not just a Jason hokey or a scream mask. Something about it is really disturbing. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it's a fantastic movie. Check if you have not already seen it. Highly recommended. One of my favorite horror movies of all time. In my opinion, the best of Clive BArker. It's scary and violent though, be warned
