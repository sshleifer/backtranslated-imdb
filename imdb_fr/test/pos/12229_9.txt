A soft film that represents how our daily lives are a catalyst for us to change our thoughts, behaviors and emotions into people we are not. This story is a love story where real emotions are born. I thank Malcolm Jamal Warner (Win) and Challen Cates for their outstanding performance. A movie that is definitely worth the detour, a holiday roadtrip that turns into emotional whirling. I suggest to see him.
