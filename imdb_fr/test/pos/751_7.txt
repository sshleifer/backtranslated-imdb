A small but memorable budget would be a shock that appears rather like the theater of the strange. Charlotte Beale, a vulnerable and naive nurse, goes to an isolated psychiatric hospital and is completely unaware that the only healthy people have been murdered, despite the red flags constantly rising all around her. <br /> <br /> The lack of a decent budget gives filmmakers little more than a sense of style, as well as a set of zany characters. The pleasures of this film do not come from the shocks of the film, which are quite tame, but from the strange atmosphere. First we have the delirious woman who thinks that her doll is real. There is also a murderer with an ax, a veteran shocked by shells, and old Mrs. Callahan is like the elderly and deaf grandmother of everyone who went crazy. A young patient named Allyson gives the term "nymphomaniac" a new meaning. A big guy named Sam is just a little slow after a sloppy lobotomy and Jennifer jumps suddenly between catatonia and violent explosions. Dr. Masters seems to be the only other sensitive person instead, but does she have a secret? <br /> <br /> "Do not look in the basement" is a great example of a low budget movie. There is not much conspiracy, but the cheap works for the movie. Several cast members perform memorable performances, especially Betty Chandler and Annabelle Weenick, and the way the director adds strange details to the film can really follow you. <br /> <br /> The scene between Allyson and "the man on the phone" is a classic for all time, and Dr. Masters' facial expressions are particularly delightful when she starts to go beyond the edge of the movie. Brownrigg also makes good use of the cheap soundtrack, with several musical signals actually evoking the characters they accompany. My favorite landmark is the "crazy" landmark, a sitar that slams every time a patient does something pathological. <br /> <br /> The way Charlotte herself plunges into hysteria at its peak is also wonderful. that Dr. Masters is simply another inmate, and then suggests that CHARLOTTE is also a patient who is allowed to play her illusions (she certainly has a tenuous grip on reality, otherwise why would she not question the lack of telephone service outside contact?). The scene where Charlotte manages to finish Dr. Stephens just living with a toy boat must be one of the biggest horror moments on a budget. Yes, "Do not look in the basement" could very well be the "American Beauty" Grade Z bin.
