I got it as part of a contest prize. I watched it, not really expecting much of a low-budget production of course. There are obvious references to other horror movies - Texas Chainsaw Massacre on Friday the 13th, and so on. on your heels - add some very good humorous scenes (siphoning off the essence of the motorhome) and a dialogue ("f ***** g virgin? It must be an oxymoron ..." and you have the one of the best movies horror in years, I particularly liked the way our reluctant hero took advantage of his stress-related nose bleed.
