In 1968, when "SYMBIOPSYCHOTAXIPLASM: Take One" came out, it came from nowhere and hit like a psychedelic thunderbolt. William Greaves, an actor and African-American filmmaker, aimed to forever change the style of documentary "the press" and, to date, he has never been so similar. The film is a film about "the making of a film", written and directed intentionally so as to create as much controversy and contradiction as possible. Located in New York's Central Park, action and skinny dialogue are about a couple arguing and arguing over homosexuality and abortion. The woman wants to leave the relationship and the man wants an explanation. Towards the end of this interaction, a drunk homeless person interrupts the procedure and offers his comments and his personal story. Then, after filming the main sequence, the film crew adds its own perspective on the filmmaker and what they feel like an inept manipulation of the film. And throughout the film, several cameras are used to record the action in the scene, as well as spurious comments from actors, teams and spectators. I would definitely recommend this film to anyone interested in avant-garde filmmakers such as Andy Warhol, John Cassavetes or Jim Jarmusch. William Greaves tries to show that something can not really be observed and understood, because viewing in itself would change the reality. "SYMBIOPSYCHOTAXIPLASM: Take One" can be considered as a cinematic representation or an application of the principle of uncertainty. This is only a possible explanation, and the true intention of Greave is certainly open to speculation. This film seeks above all to confuse, to confront. and stimulate, and without a doubt, succeeds admirably.
