In the original French version, the jokes of Numérobis (funny and fun voice - Jamel Debbrouze) are very funny. <br /> <br /> But in translated versions (I saw the German and English version), it's not half good that the original. <br /> <br /> But: Goof Special Effects, almost entirely comic (with differences, like the figure of Lügnix (German name), is placed in another comic. <br /> <br /> Of course, the Asterix cartoon is cult, but when you watch animated films from 1968 to 1998, you'll see much better jokes, a better story and the old "charm" and the "flair" of cult stories. <br /> <br /> For Francophones, I suggest to look at it in its original version, with or without subtitles, if necessary in different languages.
