When I saw this film for the first time in mid-January (2005), I did not like it. I thought it was too weird and I thought some of the parts performed by the main star, Judith Light, were so much like him. (Which of course is true) And then I watched footage the next day when it was rebroadcast and I felt pretty much the same. Then I watched it again two Sundays ago (March 20, 2005) and I started to really appreciate it. This time, I filmed everything. I even cried the first 2 times, but mainly because the actress was crying and I'm a big fan of her. <br /> <br /> It's a TV movie very well played and played. Judith Light is one of my favorite actresses and I think she does a great job in this movie! I continue to watch it again and again. It's a sad film, but very good. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen this movie, I recommend it without hesitation! It's not usually my type of movie, but I liked it! A +++
