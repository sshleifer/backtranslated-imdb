SPOILERS The famous character of Edgar Rice Burroughs has been adapted thousands of times on the screen until his thirst is quenched, especially in the thirties and forties by Hollywood. Its producers have made Tarzan one of the most successful characters in cinema. A few years later, Hugh Hudson decided to create a more ambitious version of the monkey-man. He is a more natural Tarzan, wilder and more down-to-earth than he gives here. Hudson skilfully avoids the clich√©s you usually give to Tarzan, such as his famous cry or friendly pet, Cheetah. Not only are we far from the character designed and invented by Hollwood, but we are also far from the film set used to create his stories. The film was made partly in Africa (more precisely in Cameroon). The film has two obvious parts: the first in the jungle where Tarzan lives among his adoptive friends, the monkeys and considers himself their lord. But he does not know his true origins. The second in England where Tarzan discovers English society. Ian Holm perfectly embodies the bond between the two sides and Hudson avoids anything that could make the movie fall into ridicule through a clever scenario. Indeed, Holm teaches the basic rules of Lambert to behave well in English society and the result works. Moreover, in the second part, nobody makes fun of Tarzan and he is even very appreciated. As for the end, it is a bitter and happy ending. Happy because Tarzan returns to the jungle and finds his close adoptive parents. But bitter too, because this return to the country means that the Greystoke line will not be assured and it is doomed to disappear ... Christophe Lambert finds here his first (and last?) Great role. Unfortunately, he will never equal his performance in this film and he will play in poor and insipid action movies. Nevertheless, as I said before, a clever scenario, a performance of a rare quality, impressive natural landscapes (the jungle and the English country and we get a beautiful film.) It is also an excellent proofreading of a popular novel, he only barely rated (6/10)?
