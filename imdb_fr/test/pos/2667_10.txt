For all those who are baffled by the length and the rhythm of this film ("kind, why does it show moored spaceships for 15 minutes?"), Here's a word you might want to think about: <br /> > <br /> Beauty. <br /> <br /> Beauty is an underrated concept. Of course, you will often see beautiful photos and so on in the movies. But when did you see a film that contains beauty just for the sake of seeing it? Film lovers are strangely believing that anything that is not related to a plot or character must be removed. It's depressing hogwash. There is nothing wrong with creating a beautiful sequence that has nothing to do with the plot of the film. A director can show 15 minutes of spaceships for the simple reason that they are beautiful, and it is neither illegal nor bad to do so. <br /> <br /> "2001" requires you to watch movies differently. This requires you to relax. You must experience strange and beautiful images without feeling guilty of complex intrigue or detailed characterization. Do not get me wrong, the intrigues and characters are good, but they are not the ultimate goal of everything. There are different types of movies and to enjoy '2001', you have to tune your brain to a different wavelength and succumb to the pleasure of beauty, PURE beauty, unhindered by the banal conventions of everyday movies. <br /> <br /> "All art is totally useless" - Oscar Wilde.
