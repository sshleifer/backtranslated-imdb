I would have liked to meet Ida Lupino. When people ask you who you could invite 6 extraordinary people of the twentieth century to dinner, well, for me, a person would be her. I think she is now one of the most underrated personalities in the film industry. His life story would make an excellent TV movie (Hey, Mr. Bogdanovich ........). Ida Lupino was the driving force behind many fascinating black films from the '40s and' 50s. I remember being saddened to see her reduced to a horrible role in a dreaded AIP film in the late '70s. She was bitten by a big worm at the kitchen sink. Ugh. I should have contacted her when she died shortly after ... more on the part than the worm too. From High Sierra, Roadhouse and the extraordinary RKO On Dangerous Ground thriller, Ida Lupino was often the producer and the main actress. Later, with her husband Howard Duff, they produced many timeless black dramas that are still very captivating. One of them is JENNIFER, which is, I think, the latest film with a copyright Monogram Pictures. Monogram officially changed the name of the company to Allied Artists in 1953 and JENNIFER has both company names in the opening credits. This is a haunted house thriller of superior quality, just as scary as The Innocents and The Haunting 8 years later. Really scary and very scary, this tiny film is exactly the kind of very good film that Ida Lupino directed and for which he is responsible. Try to find it ... you will always remember and as I feel, much admiration for this great actress / producer almost forgotten.
