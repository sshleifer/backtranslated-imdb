What a refreshing change from PG movies in which teenage girls jump to bed, young high school girls counting the number of girls they can "connect" with, children who drink, drug, etc., etc. Hiaasen has written so many books that are nice but are hardly classical literature. but he finally wrote something that college students WANT to read. And this film sends a message to the kids: maybe they can make a difference, maybe their voice can be heard. Filmed in South Florida, the landscape is beautiful, natural and REAL. Who cares if it's predictable, and a little tacky. So, it was FREE WILLY and look like it went well. It's a good family film .......... a rare breed.
