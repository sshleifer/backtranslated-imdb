Anand is one of those low-budget movies, but well taken. It's a "cup of coffee" entertainment without the violence, blood or excitement of most Telugu movies. However, he has his own massala. Roopa is a stubborn and down-to-earth young woman who is not afraid to face all sorts of situations, even to the disgust of her mother-in-law. She even withdraws from the marriage because her fiance does not defend her. However, his air of confidence and independence is enough to make Anand, a rich young man living in the city, dream of becoming his new husband. Her father accidentally kills his parents in a car accident anyway, so why not pay it back? But Roopa is not the type to fall in love with charming smiles and polite behavior, she makes him suffer a lot of situations, continuing to be rude and painful. It is only when he defends her and saves her life that she understands that she loves him too. But complications ensue?
