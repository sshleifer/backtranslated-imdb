The Cranes are Mikhail Kalatozov is a superb movie. Winner of the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival, he has an excellent cinematography and an excellent performance by Tatyana Samojlova, the only Russian actor to ever win a prize at Cannes for a performance. She embodies Veronika, a teenage girl in love with her boyfriend, happy and without worries, who plans to get married. His life will rock when World War II hits and his boyfriend volunteers for the army. The film describes the effects of the war on the love of a teenager and the people who stayed behind and saw their loved ones leave to fight while waiting for a letter or other information. It is a portrait of lost innocence. Samojlova does a magnificent job and her transformation of character will break your heart. The movement of the camera is fast with a lot of close-ups, it's a dancing camera. The first scene on the stairs is fantastic, but it's not the only one; then there is a scene where Veronika tries to commit suicide, and another, in my opinion one of the most powerful scenes in the history of cinema, the bombing of Veronika's house when she runs down the stairs in the middle of fire, to find his apartment completely destroyed. Just great! 10 of 10.
