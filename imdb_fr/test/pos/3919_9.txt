I usually give horror movies around 6/10, but this one caught my eye. House of Wax was by far the best horror movie I've seen ... even better than Amityville Horror. <br /> <br /> Paris Hilton has been good enough in this area and I must say that he has a bright future ahead of him. His death scene was probably the coolest. I'm just going to say how she's dying ... <br /> <br /> She has a giant pole between her eyes and her close-ups on everything. Gory, huh? Brian Van Holt was very good as a killer, Bo and Vincent (Vincent had long hair). Usually he plays a bad cop or soldier, but he's doing very well. <br /> <br /> Eliza Cuthbert and Chad Michael Murray also played very well as Carly and Nick Jones. Nick took the limelight in the first half of the film, then Eliza recovered him by enduring a lot of pain in the second half, like having his finger cut, tearing his lips after sticking and having a right punch in front of Bo. <br /> <br /> Overall, I give this film an 8/10. Fans of horror movies must see this.
