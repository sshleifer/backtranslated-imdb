It's probably the best film shot at least in the last five years. I always thought it was much harder to make people cry than to make people laugh. If you want to see 400 adults crying in the same room, check out this movie. It's breathtaking. Javier Bardem plays the role of his life. You will cry, you will laugh, you will smile ... The most deserving fact is that in Spain, everyone knows Ramon Sampedro. Personally, I knew the whole story and even its end. So, the excellence of the film lies in the way the story is told. And in this area, Amenabar is a master. <br /> <br /> This film is a MUST.
