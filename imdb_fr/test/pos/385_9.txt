In Strangers, it is clear from the beginning that playboy boy Robert Walker has described Farley Granger as an unwilling accomplice to two murders. Granger is a semi-public figure, he is a professional tennis player, but not particularly good. High enough for him to know, however, that Granger is trapped in a loveless marriage and would like to be free to marry Ruth Roman. <br /> <br /> So when they meet as complete strangers one afternoon, Walker will know enough. Granger will at least be intrigued by the possibility that, if two of them, completely foreign, commit a homicide on one of the parties, the second would be invited by their disappearance. Even if Granger is repelled by this idea, one of the beautiful things about this movie is that you can see in the performance that it gives Granger risk of being tempted. <br /> <br /> In fact, when Walker kills Laura Elliot Granger's wife who was programmed at two and who has even become pregnant with another man, expects Granger to kill in turn Walker's father so that he can inherit his estate. Today, Walker would be called a trust fund baby and at the same time a pretty malicious one. <br /> <br /> Alfred Hitchcock directed Walker to his role in the career, ironically in his latest feature film. Walker died the following year with most of My Son John completed. Hitchcock does not hurt too much by Farley Granger either. <br /> <br /> Of course, when Granger hesitates to commit homicide on people who have never done anything to him, the tension. Strangers On A Train is also characterized by excellent editing, first in the tennis match in which Granger must finish the match and guide Walker before he produces evidence condemning Granger at the crime scene. And also in this final culmination with a fight on a galloping carousel between Walker and Granger. <br /> <br /> The stranger in a train is Hitchcock at its best, it should not be missed and should be forced to watch when the film courses study the issue.
