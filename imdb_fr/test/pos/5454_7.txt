I read the book written by Bill Carter on which this film is based several years ago. The book is certainly stronger than the movie. It provides more details than a film can provide, the end result being that I thought the film seemed a little shady on a handful of items. All in all, and given the limitations of the medium, the film provides an entertaining and informative narrative of the battle between Jay Leno and David Letterman in the early '90s to host "The Tonight Show" after retirement. from Johnny Carson. <br /> <br /> The highlight is clearly the performances. I can not imagine a performance more difficult for an actor than to play a character still alive and known and regularly broadcast on television. John Michael Higgins has perfectly described the role of Letterman. Watching it was really like looking at Letterman. Daniel Roebuck bravely tried to become Jay Leno, but he failed to do so effectively. All his "look" seemed wrong, and he did not seem natural in the role. In a less central role, Rich Little unsurprisingly nailed the voice of Carson, although the look was a bit off. In the book, the most interesting of the central figures was probably Leno's agent, Helen Kushnick. In the movie, Kathy Bates was perfect in the role, though not as uncontrollable as Carter's portrayal of the woman's writing. <br /> <br /> In the end, the viewing is light and fun. The subject is not particularly important overall, but it's fun, behind the scenes, to watch a memorable moment in the entertainment industry. 7/10
