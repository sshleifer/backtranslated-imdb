Do not pay attention to what this socially retarded person said above, this show is hilarious. This shows how many unmarried men live in a bar atmosphere and also shows that women are not as credulous as men think. <br /> <br /> The contest aspect of how is really cool and original. This is not the standard reality show we are all used to now. <br /> <br /> Give everyone a chance, we're just one episode, we finally have Canadian programming that's not absolute shit. As Canadians, what do we normally get, Bon Cop, Bad Cop or Corner Gas. Come on, people show that we are not all as modest as the previous critic. <br /> <br /> Way to go Comedy Network, to give a new chance to a new show. The panel is funny and the candidates are so far pretty good.
