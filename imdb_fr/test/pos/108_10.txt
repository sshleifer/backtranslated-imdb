The film is really a question of choice. In the oppressed situation as seen in Fire, where good women had to obey and do what was right in the eyes of tradition, there seemed to be few options for Radha and Sita. However, knowing that it was not their only option. What is life without desire, questions Radha Ashok. Yes, it is true that life offers us a number of options, but their number depends on a number of external factors. When your world is confined to a small Indian household, he is a daughter-in-law dedicated to a silent but observant and powerful matriarch, a devoted wife of 13 to a man who has vowed celibacy because of your inability to have a child a man who only wants you lying next to him proves his strength to eliminate his desires. I felt that ladies had no choice but to find comfort in each other's company. I suppose that the fact that so many women applauded Ms. Mehta's work was due to the fact that it allowed them to think for themselves. An option to do what may have been unacceptable. The lesbian scenes I felt were just to get that message across. All the scenes of the film, from the first to the Taj Mahal to the last of the mosque, are engraved in my memory. How frustrating to be a prisoner of your feelings and desires. Feel that you have to give up human contact to become a respectful woman simply because you are expected of you. Having to suppress all desire and thirst for human contact. One wonders then what is the meaning of our existence. In the scene where Sita weeps alone in the room and Radha comforts her, their lips accidentally brush against each other and it wakes them up. Something they both have been deprived of. <br /> <br /> Congratulations to Mrs Mehta for the very clear translation of her vision. I especially like the flashbacks of the young Radha who tries to "see" for the ocean. It's a metaphor for freedom. Freedom of choice, freedom to move to places where we would normally be unable to go. In these scenes, we are kindly told that his sense of duty was also conveyed by his mother, who, I suppose, lives in the rich Indian traditions of duty in marriage. The film is beautifully filmed and reinforced by the score of A.R. Rahman. Since the film, I became a fan of the two leading actresses and the director. I look forward to more future productions from Mrs. Deepa.
