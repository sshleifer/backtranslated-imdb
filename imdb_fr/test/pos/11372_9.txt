I think it's been more than 40 years since I saw this series, but the memory of it has not faded. This seems natural to me for the DVD reissue. Many artists have become more famous (Robert Hardy, Sean Connery, to name a few); Although it's a small role, I still remember Judy Dench, then 20, as Katherine of France (Henry V). She was very pretty then like now. <br /> <br /> There is an allusion to this site that the series was filmed in color - is this the case? Which of us would know - virtually no color television at this time. Mores pity, no VCR; if so, some may have registered. As a way of teaching English history, this series has given life to few class teachers. <br /> <br /> What a beautiful reissue it would be!
