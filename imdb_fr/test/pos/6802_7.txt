It was one of the first color films I saw at the cinema when I was a child. It is good to remember. The girl, Liz Taylor, who later became a beautiful woman, played with the very small and excellent actor Mickey Rooney. The content of the movie plot is suitable for all ages, goodwill and behavior. The good ethics of Velvet's parents, especially his mother, is something to consider. Our generations should be well educated and this film can help to this end. Velvet loves horses and running them, and Mi Taylor (Rooney) took her to an international horse racing event in England, where the young Velvet eventually won but was disqualified for femininity.
