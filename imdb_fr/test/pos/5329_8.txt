Leland P. Fitzgerald (Ryan Gosling) has committed an indescribable crime, that of stabbing the delayed younger brother of his ex-girlfriend Becky (Jena Malone). No one, especially Leland, can explain why he did what he did, whether it was a premeditated or spontaneous act, committed by hatred or love. <br /> <br /> At the detention center, Leland meets Pearl Madison. (Don Cheadle), another writer who sees in Leland's case a second chance. But Pearl also wants to understand Leland's motivation and takes him under his wing as a confidante in the prison. <br /> <br /> The film goes from past to present on many occasions, often leaving the past as a context. in the present, and vice versa. Screenwriter / director Matthew Ryan Hodge shows how Leland's crime - and the events that preceded it - touched the lives of people in her life, from Becky to her family, to Leland's mother (Lena Olin) and her mother. father (Kevin Spacey)), a young man who lives with Becky's family after the death of his own mother. <br /> <br /> The main asset of the film is Gosling, who perfectly embodies the 15-year-old pseudopsychopath. Like Bartleby the Scrivener, Leland de Gosling simply exists; it shows little emotion during the film, but its expressions deny an ocean of guilt, sadness, love and rage. <br /> <br /> Each of the main actors may have done their best work so far, with the exception of Spacey. not really novice). Especially Malone and Klein, two young performers better known for their light comedy fees than the heavy drama of this film, are to be congratulated. <br /> <br /> Another huge advantage of the story is that none of the characters is flawless; none is a hero to save the day. It's just not a black and white movie.
