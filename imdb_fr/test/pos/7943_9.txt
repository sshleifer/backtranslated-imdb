At school, I was taught to call shots and two directors were constantly mentioned: Orson Welles and Sergei M. Eisenstein. I did not care then (I was a kid!) But now I know why, Eisenstein is a genius and it's a shame to see what was possible in 1938 where almost more than half a century we are taken innumerable virgin films! Some say that this film is not worth the genius of Eisenstein (so they have to watch it again and again until they can say anything bad) or even worse than it is a movie propaganda for the Russians. Let's say it is, it is pure propaganda for patriotism but "Save Private Ryan" or "The longest day" is not true? I could sum up so many movies in which America is high at the top, so why not Russia, and besides every war is waged for its patriotism, why else would they raise flags? Aleksandr Nevsky is a must for anyone interested in cinematography, because almost every shot is sublime. All of this may be overlooked, but I'm wondering why this is not in IMDB Bank's Top 250, where there is also a lot of overstated Oscarcrap.
