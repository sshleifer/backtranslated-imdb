"Rush in Rio" is without a doubt one of the most interesting DVDs I've ever bought. Although I have been a fan of Rush for almost 20 years, I found this performance flawless. The music is heavy and clean (which is great on any surround sound system), the band is energetic, the crowd has a constant smile ... it's like they've been able to capture all concerts I attended. For any Rush fan, this DVD is a must. if nothing, just to see the documentary "Boys in Brazil" (which reveals the trips of this group rather isolated and personal). For all non-Rush fans, this DVD is a nice concert. Rush fans know the talent of these three Canadians. We have been supporting them fairly firmly for years. I showed this DVD (or part of it) to those who have never heard of Rush, or to those who think that Rush is not a good thing, because they do not appeal to the masses pessimistic rock (sex, drugs, etc.). and a drunken frenzy). In the end, this DVD is worth every penny and deserves ample time to watch it.
