A perverse baron retains water to a group of farmers to try to take advantage of their properties for money. Next is Singin 'Sandy Saunders (John Wayne), who saves the day for Gabby Hayes and her daughter by going undercover as the villain's last shooter. <br /> <br /> First of sixteen films that Wayne has made for Lone Star / Monogram Photos, it tries to portray him as a singing cowboy, only with a clearly synchronous voice. The title card highlights his character "Singin 'Sandy", suggesting that this is the first of a series proposed! <br /> <br /> Yes, it's ridiculous, but it's also very fun to see. Wayne sings songs and fires, especially when he makes a little song before shooting with shooter Earl Dwire. <br /> <br /> Riders Of Destiny presents a rare villainous role for Al "Fuzzy" St. John, who plays as much with the villains as he plays a heroic sidekick alongside Buster Crabbe and Lash LaRue.
