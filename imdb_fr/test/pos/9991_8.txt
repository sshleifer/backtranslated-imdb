At the age of 20, Francis Ouimet (Shia Lebouf) has his whole life ahead of him - in a way. Son of a family of immigrants living in the United States at the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century, class was a very compelling fact. If one is born poor, one remains poor; if one is born in the bourgeoisie, one has a tiny opportunity; if one is born in the rich class, one does it mainly in the shade. British golfer Harry Vardon and Francis's golf idol (played by Stephen Dillane, criminally underrated) are the exception that confirms the rule. Born and raised in a poor British family, his golfer skills allowed him to get out of the dirty bazaar of the poorest slums to the lush greens of English country clubs. He did not forget this lesson of life. Francis wants to follow in the footsteps of Vardon and uses his great golfing skills to go to the US Open from 1913 to 20 years. But a difficult course and formidable opponents (including the idol of Francis Harry Vardon) are not all that Francis must face An unimpressive father and a cruel societal framework resist his way of living his own dream. <br /> <br /> I know what you think - I thought so too - a film produced by Walt Disney on the 1913 US Open, starring Shia LaBeouf, irritable, offers the opportunity to be entertaining, but it can not be a good movie. Well, I'm here to encourage you to think again. Despite what may seem on paper, The Greatest Game is one of the best sports films in creation. <br /> <br /> As in all major sports movies, The Greatest Game includes many exciting sports scenes. but it's not a film about golf - it's a character-centered film about using your talents, realizing your dreams and breaking down class barriers. Where The best game ever played works perfectly as a thematic sports film but also as a period film - the costumes and sets presented in the film are the best thing to do to travel back in time. The film also just looks awesome and the almost unknown music composer Brian Tyler has defined the film as a wonderful piece of music. The cast is also excellent with a subtle yet powerful Stephen Dillane in the title of British golf champion Harry Vardon, a hilarious Stephen Marcus in golfer Ted Ray, a martyr Josh Flitter in the role of Francis's pre-adolescent caddy Eddie and a surprisingly good Shia LaBeouf. in the lead role as Francis. Actor Bill Paxton (Apollo 13, Titanic) becomes a director here for the second time (making a feature film) in The Greatest Game Ever Played. He produces a quality product incorporating a lot of heart, ingenuity and great attention to detail in the making of the film.
