As a former Erasmus student, I really liked this film. It was so realistic and fun. He really took up the spirit that exists among Erasmus students. I hope many other students will follow this experience as well. However, I wonder if this movie is so interesting to watch for people without international experience. But at least one of my friends who has never been to Erasmus has also enjoyed it. I give it 9 out of 10.
