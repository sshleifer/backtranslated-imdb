This show came to Canada via PBS in the mid-90s and I really loved it at the time. Even 10 years later, looking at the various information networks, I can not help but think about the cynical manipulation that occurs in the name of the ratings and the various "ponies of the show" that we all see on television , as various episodes of Frontline show. The scripts are well written and the actors all have flawless cartoon timing and none of this is cluttered with a stupid laughter. There is a lot of fun stuff here that is very well executed and you do not have to know when to laugh and what to laugh about. I do not understand why this show has never taken off in North America, it's really a jewel! I was really excited to see the DVDs available, even though they are in PAL format. I thought I would extract them to my computer, and then look at the converted files. I tried my luck and ordered it from ABC? 6 to 8 weeks later, I had the 3 seasons. Best of all, it worked on my NTSC DVD player. I suspect that any player bought in the last 2 years with xvid / divx will play them. Great thing! 10 years later, the episodes are really good! You do not need to know anything about Australian politics to be humorous, because all this will be familiar to the Western public. My wife and I had a 10-day Frontline Festival and laughed again a few weeks later after watching the 39 episodes
