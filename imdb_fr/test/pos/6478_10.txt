Pat O'Brien had his best role ever as coach of Notre Dame Knute Rockne. Since his humble beginnings, Rockne entered Notre Dame as a student around 1910. He is interested in chemistry, but becomes a football player and a wonderful hero. <br /> <br /> After graduating, he teaches chemistry at school, but he has football fever that pulls him, it forces him to give up chemistry to pursue his dream of coaching football . Too bad, the school probably lost a great chemistry teacher, certainly better and more beautiful than the one I had in high school. (Erasmus Hall in Brooklyn to be exact.) <br /> <br /> He motivates his students. It will not tolerate underperformance. He is a coach for all seasons. <br /> <br /> O'Brien captures this touch of common kindness. One of his students, George Gipp, played memorable in a short show of Ronald Reagan's support. <br /> <br /> The years pass and the exploits are in full swing, but Knute remains the same kind coach who testifies before the Congress when football is questioned. <br /> <br /> Donald Crisp is remarkable as a priest of Notre Dame who knew that Rockne was destined to coach football. Albert Basserman is adequate, but his Jewish accent in depicting a priest is at best clumsy. Basserman was nominated that year in the secondary category "Foreign Correspondent". <br /> <br /> The tragic death of Rockne, in a plane crash, has deprived the world of many years of a human being quite professional. The movie is great.
