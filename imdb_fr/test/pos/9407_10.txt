I thought this movie was excellent. Jon Foster is one of my best favorite actors, he was perfect in the role of Micheal Skakel. I thought everything was great: acting, costumes, production, staging, photography, screenplay, music, etc. <br /> <br /> Spoilers Coming Up! You have been warned! <br /> <br /> Martha Moxley, to whom they told the story in the film, was clubbed to death by her troubled troubled neighbor Micheal Skakel. Micheal did this out of jealousy of his brother Tommy when Martha rejected him and took Tommy instead. Fortunately, they caught him years later and he was sentenced to 20 years in prison for life. Although, I think, he should have been sentenced to a "natural life" without the possibility of parole. <br /> <br /> Congratulations to the cast, the team and the filmmakers. Two inches higher.
