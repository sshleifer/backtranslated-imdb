WARNING: SPOILER PLOT <br /> <br /> The always abnormal films of David Cronenberg are certainly an acquired taste. Fans of his previous films will probably like "eXistenZ", but it's certainly not for the crazy. All the usual elements are here. A skin play pod (hung in your back), buckets of blood, a bone gun and a manic mechanic, just to name a few. The result is good in games, bad in games and just weird in others. But the film has an undeniable originality. <br /> <br /> Despite the excessive use of ?? odd that proves a point - virtual reality games can have a dangerous effect on some people. In the movie, a character kills a dead person by claiming that he was "annoying" (assuming she is still in the game). But it remains to be seen if this really happened or if it happened in this incredibly realistic game. eXistenZ leads to a conclusion that can be answered in several ways. <br /> <br /> Despite some extra gadgets and gadgets, it was simply your classic `it was a dream ?? or was it 'twist'. It's a nice surprise and answers a few questions, but it's a little disappointing to find that the whole movie was ahead of that moment. At just 97 minutes, it could have been a little longer. In a particular way, the film raises moral problems but responds in a violent and rather inappropriate way. <br /> <br /> Jennifer Jason Leigh appears here in her first big role for a long time. But his character does not have enough qualities to make it out of the screen or even give it a nice character. In contrast, Jude Law (with a curious American accent) is good because your average Joe is sucked into this abnormal world. We see the film through his perspective. <br /> <br /> `eXistenZ 'is far from perfect, but it's certainly a cinematic experience to remember. There are tons of strange features to match David Lynch's similar styles (and then? - be consumed by a question mark?!?!? !!). This is definitely not for all tastes, but it is rewarding enough to recommend. My rating IMDb: 6.2 / 10.
