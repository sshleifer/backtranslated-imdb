I read the comment above and can not believe it! Of course, it's a children's movie, it's an adaptation of a children's book !! This movie is easy to get, try play.com or amazon and it's very easy to get a copy! The jokes are hilarious for kids and adults, and the adventure is clean and non-violent! Its quite suitable for children of all ages! The songs are fabulous, and yes, a little repetitive, but that's what kids need and while watching them, we heard my little ones sing "hi hi cocalorum" all night long! They loved, a story of innocence and friendship! Very charming and well worth watching for kids and adults of all ages!
