I only have good things to say about this film of good taste and comforting. I think the film director / screenwriter's effort is both courageous and inspiring. I loved this movie not only for the fantastic story (that had to be told), but also for the way the actors told the story. This is not another shallow "gay movie" that portrays stereotypical characters in humorous situations. It was a memorable and seamless effort to show people that love has no limits, and love is still as beautiful and wonderful as it always has been. <br /> <br /> Another thing that touched my heart was to understand how I could understand the emotion described in this movie about the release of one of the main characters. We must all experience similar situations in the society in which we live and feel this sense of detachment from all that is "right" and "normal". I sincerely congratulate you for this fabulous and courageous story.
