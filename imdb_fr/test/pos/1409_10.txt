It is unfortunate that this series has not been remastered and produced in video by Warner or another professional film house. <br /> <br /> Copies of most episodes are available, but are generally of poor quality, being copies of copies of copies. <br /> <br /> If I understand correctly, 92 episodes were produced during its execution, but only 15 are noted here. <br /> <br /> Some authors of the series, such as Richard Matheson, became a recognized author. <br /> <br /> Excellent series, well written, well directed and well produced. <br /> <br /> Michael Weldon, <br /> <br /> Udon Thani, Thailand
