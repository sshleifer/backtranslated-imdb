Look at it, people-- "DK3" is more challenging, innovative and intelligent than its predecessor. Difficult, its levels are ridiculously difficult for a considerable time. A particularly difficult level is called "Lightning Watch", in which you can be struck by lightning at any time. Innovative, it opened a lot of doors. Too bad the SNES died shortly after this title. And clever: level names range from keywords ("Lake Orangatanga") to spiritual references that the target audience of the game will not receive for many years ("Bleak's House"). <br /> <What irritates me in most people's critics about this game is basically two words: Kiddy Kong. He is a worthy "boyfriend" successor to Diddy Kong and certainly does not deserve to be called a "delayed monkey". "DK3" will remain a classic until the end of time.
