During the Second World War, two Belarussian soldiers (Soviet Russians) tried to avoid being captured by the occupation Nazis as they walked on snowy terrain in search of food and security. If you do not like "foreign" movies in black and white, you can still enjoy "Voskhozhdeniye" (English version of "The Ascent"). The director, Larisa Shepitko, attends the film extraordinarily well, even if it is a largely introspective work. His untimely death, in a car accident, unfortunately made the last film of Mrs. Shepitko. <br /> <br /> Once the inaugural mission is declared, there does not seem to be much that can happen in the snowy woods, but Shepitko and a different environment make it exciting. The main players Vladimir Gostyukhin (as Rybak, spiritually wounded) and Boris Plotnikov (as Sotnikov, a physical wounded) manage to be crushed by the ever-increasing symbolism. causing a familiar story. <br /> <br /> ******** Voskhozhdeniye (4/2/77) Larisa Shepitko ~ Vladimir Gostyukhin, Boris Plotnikov, Lyudmila Polyakova, Anatoly Solonitsyn
