Inspired by director of the latest Brit-Flick, Rose Troche, who burst with NY Dykes' budget-free tale, "Go Fish" brings a slightly yellowish look to this story where a Londoner chose the slightly inappropriate medium of society. male bond to declare his lust for a fellow researcher of male truths. The highlight for me is a scene where society tries to become primitive hunter-gatherers, but ends up ordering a takeaway. The film as a whole is wonderfully performed and Troche, who would never have been accepted by some of the lesbians she described in her previous film, savor the larger budget by engaging in wonderfully persistent pan shots that contrast with the granular hyperkinesia of Go Fish. A really nice movie
