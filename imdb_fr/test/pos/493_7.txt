Not being the least familiar with the characters in the comic book series, I was expecting this film to simply fulfill the basic principle: show me the characters and their inherent characteristics, present the plot and end with the destruction of the main opponent allusion to the possibility of a sequel. And that's exactly what this movie offers. <br /> <br /> However, unlike most other comic books, I had the impression that he did it with a little class. Instead of risking a more limited audience with strong graphic and graphic fighting scenes, "Blade" presents a very modern, credible and dark world whose small shades have effectively managed to arouse a sense of terror - however minor - of a spectator. which rarely mixes with a story, unless an emotional (ie, serious) aspect is concerned. <br /> <br /> Yes, the film features countless plotholes and absurdly unrealistic situations such as an ordinary female doctor clever enough to do what no one else has been able to do for thousands of years . But when you have an enemy as cool as this film and you face scenes with camera clipping and special effects that are exciting and exciting, what matters? It may take a long time, but for what it is intended to do, "Blade" is distinctly different from most other films of this genre.
