CELLA fascinated me at first sight. I was a little surprised by this, because the story of this film is absolutely boring. If there was no story, the movie would be better. I think of Bunuels "An Andalusian Dog" - a film without history, but also with fascinating and sometimes disturbing images. But THE CELL is first a Hollywood film, then a work of art. I am very interested in the next Tarsem project. Hamlet on Indian could be very interesting, especially when it has the same look as THE CELL. <br /> <br /> For movie music lovers: Howard Shore's score for THE CELL is absolutely fantastic, its very modernist style.
