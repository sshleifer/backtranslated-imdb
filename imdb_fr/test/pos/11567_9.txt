Being a child of the 90s, I really enjoyed this show and I can proudly say that I enjoyed it a lot and even more than the classic WB cartoons. <br /> <br /> I do not know why; cartoons from the early nineties were something special; I do not know if it was the atmosphere of uncertainty, a change of generation, whatever. But "Tiny Toons" kept the mood of the '90s and produced one of the most popular, fun and underrated cartoons ever created. <br /> <br /> The memories are dark, but I can only say that I enjoyed every episode and produced. in connection with the show. Easily, no other cartoon made me laugh so tenderly (before going into dark sitcoms geared for teens). <br /> <br /> The characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a real main character. Each character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead.
