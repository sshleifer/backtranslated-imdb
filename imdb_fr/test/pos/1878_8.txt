an awesome does for the sci-fi movie that far exceeds much of the previous poor efforts they've made. Bruce Campbell is in excellent shape as a potential investor involved in a strange experiment led by a delusional teacher, Stacey Keach, and his half-witted aide, Ted Raimi. The film is gilded and it's a pleasure to see Keach and play on screen with Bruce, and the fact that a lot of this movie only works for Bruce's comic and awesome game is what makes it hilarious, and ask me the question. why does not this guy get more of his scripts ?, It's really a sick world. Well worth a look.
