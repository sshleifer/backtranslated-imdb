At first, renting this movie delayed me because of the DVD cover. In fact, this is true for friends of mine who did not praise him because of his art and his mental image evoked as a film that hardly interested me or not at all. But, I rented and watched the movie and was really surprised. <br /> <br /> I agree with another user's comments that this film is not for everyone because of the blatant sexual inferences; young children to watch (and seriously doubt if they would understand it anyway). <br /> <br /> I like movies like this one in which the personality of the character and his identity are truly defined in a direct and flawless way. teasers to indicate that they will go wrong. The game does ... was it playing? Ricci and Jackson performed so well that I was trained in this movie without even realizing they were playing. Same thing with the story ... may seem a bit far fetched, but it has been done very, very well. It made me think of another film with Mel Gibson, Tim, where each character had limits, be it mental or circumstantial, so they were well defined. <br /> <br /> I found a lot of depth in this film with the participation of the character, so feel that everyone involved (cameramen to actors) should be commended for a perfect fit / result. After watching this film, I spoke to a couple of friends who had a negative approach, but after hearing my comments, they rented and watched the movie. They too were quite surprised to see how good it was. It is unfortunate that the art on the jacket was made as it is, since it is off. I can now see how art applies, but I had never heard of this film before, and this art was my first impression ... art sells or destroys sales / rentals of DVDs. <br /> <br /> These characters had more depth for them and a good timing was allocated to give an audience like me time to absorb the "feeling" of each. I felt that I could trust the movie to make it run smoothly, and that's what happened. So, with the jacket apart, I would recommend watching this movie.
