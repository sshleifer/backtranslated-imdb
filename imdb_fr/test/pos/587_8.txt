I really liked THE MUPPET MOVIE. It was the first of the Muppet movies and is by far the best because it is so creative and fresh. With the following movies, the ideas just did not seem so original. But here we see Kermit and Miss Piggy riding a bike (an incredibly difficult scene), an excellent overall cast and just a lot of fun. I loved every minute of Muppet performance and I would have rated the movie much better, except for a serious problem. In this film and in most of Muppet's later films, some powers felt it was necessary to include many non-Muppets - especially many cameos by stars. Some worked well (like Charles Durning's), but many seemed simply out of place and slowed down the picture. The worst of them was probably with Edgar Bergan. Yes, he was an extraordinary man who inspired Jim Henson and the rest of his team, but the tiny scene he was in was simply not necessary, nor was most of the cameos. Despite everything, despite this big grievance, it's a great movie for the whole family, from children to the most demanding adults.
