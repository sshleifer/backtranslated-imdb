Gene Roddenberry has never let down his fans. His death ended a sci-fi legacy that will never be equaled. Earth: the last conflict was the proof! His film pilot and the first 2 seasons were well written and meticulously produced, but somewhere on the way, the Roddenberry touch was lost. The loss of leader, Kevin Kilner (William Boone) definitely detracted from the series as it was a vital part of his success. The story implies that the human race is visited by the Taelons, an alien race that calls itself "The Companions". After 3 years, they gave Earth new technologies, useful information about the Universe and more. Many question their intentions here on Earth. The main link on Earth between races is Da'an (Leni Parker) and is for many, the most reliable Taelon. Questions arise: why are they here? What are their goals? Is Da'an aware of plots suspected of being conspiracies against humans? There is a clandestine group led by the millionaire industrialist Jonathan Doors (David Hemblen) who uses his millions to investigate the Taelons. At the end of the first season, things are going well, Da'an seems trustworthy, Boone attends Doors in his investigation while working with Daan and Taelons as a liaison. In the middle of the second season, things start to go away and the series, once fantastic and fascinating, sinks, especially because Roddenberry was dead and was not there to guide the producers, including his wife Majel Barrett-Roddenberry was co-producer. Still, the first season is intriguing and fun to watch.
