This would seem obvious, but if the viewer forgets the context, he may miss an opportunity to have fun. <br /> <br /> It is easy to carve from the high heights of the 21st century to the styles and prices of the market. Years of great depression; but the intelligent viewer will remember this magic word, "context," and will understand better and will thus enjoy the word "Accidents will occur". <br /> <br /> Among the actors, Ronald Reagan again showed himself a handsome and charming man, and again gave a performance to perfection. <br /> <br /> A reviewer previously said that Gloria Blondell was playing the wicked woman, but that was not good: she plays the role of the clerk who has a crush on Reagan's character, Eric Gregg, but keeps hands apart as long as he is married. <br /> <br /> Gloria was cute. Not as beautiful as her sister Joan, she was always so attractive and good actress. Maybe she looked a little like Joan, which was detrimental to the success of her career, and that's certainly our loss. <br /> <br /> Sheila Bromley was Mrs. Gregg and she played well. <br /> <br /> Dick Purcell and Earl Earl Dwire had the opportunity to play something other than a naughty cowboy. <br /> <br /> Again, most players have never achieved the "surname" status that many of them deserved, but they have all performed well here in a story which is still relevant today.
