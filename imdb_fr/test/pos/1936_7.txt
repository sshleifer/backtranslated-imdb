This relic from before the Hays Production Code and Office is a pleasure, not much, but entertaining. <br /> <br /> According to a song by Rogers & Hart that was a huge success at the time, the story The daughter of the dance hall Barbara Stanwyck, romanced by the rich businessman Ricardo Cortez (who was indecent, is handsome), but whose heart belongs to his bookish neighbor, Monroe Owsley. Owsley and she get married, but keep it secret, as she fires Cortez, who still has hope. She helps her husband find a job in the Cortez business, but conjugal happiness soon turns to the wing as Owsley acquires a taste for high life and goes out with a college friend and plays bridge with high stakes (Yeah, I know, it's pretty funny .. ..). Finally, he diverts $ 5,000 from Cortez and is about to leave, when his devoted wife will go to Cortez ... and I will not reveal anything else, even if the end was certainly a surprise. <br /> <br /> Stanwyck is the best thing about this movie; in one of her leading roles she is very accomplished. Owsley is the weak point. He is unattractive and fearful, while Cortez is incredibly sweet and sexy, while his performance is serious but banal. <br /> <br /> Although it is apparently a drama, it is filled with laughter, many inadvertently, some elements of this film having aged very poorly. But there are many good spiritual lines; at one point, Stanwyck said to Cortez, "My brain is between my feet, while yours is in ...." It's damn suggestive for 1931! There are many suggestive and suggestive elements in this film, in recent days before the Code blocks everyone. An amusing antique, a good reminder of the path we have not traveled for 70 years ... This story could very easily be modified to match 2003, but it could keep the basic plot, with the original ending, in square.
