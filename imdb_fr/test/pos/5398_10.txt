IMAGINARY HERO is a beautiful little movie! Written and directed by Dan Harris, this story is a classic theater mixing both comedy and tragedy at the climax of the film. The Travis family is a strange group: no member is who everyone seems to be. Beginning with the suicide of reluctant child swimming champion Matt (Kip Pardue), father Ben (Jeff Daniels) disintegrates and isolates himself from his family and himself, while his mother Sandy (Sigourney Weaver) turns to the pot and the rage and sarcasm, the girl Penny (Michelle Williams) returns from the school repulsed by the behavior of her family, and the remaining son, Tim (Emile Hirsch) undergoes the shock of all the preceding avoiding his comrades class, his girlfriend and his teams with his neighbor Kyle (Ryan Donowho) to jump into drugs and sexual experimentation. Throughout the film, Tim tries to hide on his body bruises that have a secret of their own, but pushing his girlfriend to feel rejected, his mother to run wild against the trash of the trailer park that intimidates him according to her, and finally to open the window to the abyss. scars this family has been suffering for years. Secrets and lies here and their resolution is painfully dramatic. <br /> <br /> This is perhaps Sigourney Weaver's most beautiful role, although Emil Hirsh, Jeff Daniels, Ryan Donowho and Kip Pardue (despite the brevity of his role) all contribute prime performances order. The story begins slowly and seems to tumble. This may cause some viewers to lose their attention, but stay with this little film from the power station and the impact of the work will stun you. Highly recommended. Grady Harp
