Cowboys and Indians is a great movie. Writing, playing, directing could not have been better. It was a story that needed to be told, and this group of talented people and teams did a great job. Stories like this are not nice, but serve to remind people of the social injustices that exist around the world. I hope that when this film is seen, attitudes and prejudices will be changed. A movie that can do that is a rare and rare thing. Andrew Berzins is an excellent writer. His talents and expertise in this area have been manifested in this film. <br /> <br /> Thank you for telling this story !!! <br /> <br /> Ruby
