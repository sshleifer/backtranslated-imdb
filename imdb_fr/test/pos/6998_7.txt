This film starts badly. An incredibly corny monologue is immediately followed by a brilliantly realized and truly amazing spacecraft crash. Then things get worse again, when you realize that the survivors are all a) bad actors (with the exception of the berthing pilot and the psychopath) and b) almost all get into the role of monster-fodder too well . Damn, half of them do not even speak English, thus preventing the public from knowing the characters. You feel as if you are watching "Deep Blue Sea" meets "The Silence of the Lambs", minus the good pieces. And unfortunately, all this is trying to be "crashed on a desert planet with Hannibal Lecter" during the daytime scenes. Vin Diesel is an excellent actor - but it's not Anthony Hopkins, and he's frankly irritating as a super-cool psychopath. There is at least one very good scene starring an unexpected survivor - but other than that, you could just as easily have cut the first thirty minutes or so ... <br /> <br /> But things go wrong. I can not specify the moment, but the film will soon be much better. It also seems less choppy - the scenes begin to follow with consistent narration, and Vin Diesel becomes a lot less boring and soon, he steals the shows. At the moment the first monsters appear, the movie is really nice. As night falls, it's great. Exciting, horrible and exciting. And even the development of the characters of most of the main characters is well done. If you can just watch the poor at first, you're ready for some great entertainment. <br /> <br /> In addition, the visual effects are fantastic, and I sincerely admit: I like the color and the tone of this film. <br /> <br /> 7/10 (could have been 9/10, if only ....)
