Last year, we celebrated the 200th anniversary of the birth of Charles Darwin and the 150th anniversary of the publication of "The Origin of Species". It is therefore normal that the "Creation" of Jon Amiel has been published. The film focuses on the period of life of Darwin (Paul Bettany) when he wrote his famous work, and the slight tension it put on his family life. <br /> <br /> I suppose the film played down Darwin's tension with his religious wife Emma (Jennifer Connelly) and her guilt over her dead daughter Annie, but I still like the idea that Darwin's theory functions as a cut of karate on a religious dogma. As things stand, the United States was one of the last countries in which "Creation" found a distributor, because of the creationism-evolution debate (yes, it still continues). <br /> <br /> All in all, this is not a masterpiece, but I recommend it in the same way that I recommend "inheriting the wind". I hope that one day the creationism-evolution debate will not be a problem. If this movie helps put an end to the debate, give more power to everyone in the movie! Also starring Martha West, Jeremy Northam, Toby Jones and Benedict Cumberbatch.
