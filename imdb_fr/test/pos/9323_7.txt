The musical bios are all cut from the same fabric. Hope fights, succeeds and eventually wins the girl, but this one - an Irish tenor's life, Chauncey Olcott / Jack Chancellor - has more advantages than the usual traps. It has a lot of charm and great sincerity and is played beautifully by all concerned. Dennis Morgan is in the lead, as is Arlene Dahl for his love affair. The accompanying performance of Andrea King as Lillian Russell is much better than that of Alice Faye in the film about her career. William Frawley is moving as an aging tenor champion, William Scanlon, and Sara Allgood is charming as Olcott's mother. George Tobias, Ben Blue and Alan Hale provide good support. There are more than 25 songs (a real treasure chest): Come Down My Evening Star; The blue eyes of my Nellie; You tell me your dream; Wait until the sun shines, Nellie; Will you love me in December? In the light of the silver moon; Days of minstrel; Polly Wolly Doodle; Natchez and Robert E. Lee; Miss Lindy Lou; If I dream Wee Rose from Killarney; Shaking hands; A little girl; A little corner of paradise; Married; Sweet Innescarren; Tiddely Um; When the Irish eyes smile Mother machree; The fair of kerey; Room in my heart; My Wild Irish Rose. <br /> <br /> Although the film only won one Oscar - for Scoring - and rightly so, it also earned top marks for art direction and costume design - sumptuous and delightful in Technicolor. <br /> The reasons why it's not on the video may be due to the considerable time spent in the atmosphere of the Minstrel Show - at least a quarter of the film - with a lot of material quite politically INCORRECT for the audience today. However, this is historically accurate. <br /> <br /> This is a real gem that deserves to be searched. He leaves one with a warm glow.
