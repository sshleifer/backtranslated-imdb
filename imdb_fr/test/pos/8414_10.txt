MP James Hacker did not expect to be the next Prime Minister. Unlike the United States, the party is elected in Britain, while we Americans vote for candidates, regardless of party. Despite the differences, Paul Eddington CBE's performance as minister becoming prime minister almost overnight is helped by his senior advisor, Sir Humphrey, played by another knight, Sir Nigel Hawthorne, and veteran actor Derek Fowlds . Instead of pleasing some people, it must please the nation rather than its constituency. Now he has a difficult job to accomplish, even more difficult than before. Now he must approve the list of honors and collaborate regularly with Her Majesty. Hacker is not the type of hacking. Rather than all the men we love and do not want to hate and become a villain or a vicious dictator. Now we see the Prime Minister's point of view and all that should please and manage the strikes.
