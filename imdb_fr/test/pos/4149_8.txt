This opinion responds to the submission asking how much the facts are corrected in the film ... <br /> <br /> You saw this film last year and it inspired promising immigrants, like my Italian parents who passed through Ellis Island at the beginning of the last century, would submit to all kinds of invasive inspections just to enter America. <br /> <br /> It was certainly a revelation, because my grandparents had never said anything terrible when they were there. My grandmother was 5 years old and my grandfather arrived when they arrived. <br /> <br /> I have just returned from a trip to New York where I had the pleasure of visiting Ellis Island and where the museum guides you through immigration. Evaluation Process - The filmmaker obviously conducted his research up to exams and medical equipment, questions and puzzles. They are all there at the museum. Even the wedding photos and the exam room - in fact, it's ok! Anyone who has immigrant grandparents should see this movie. Inspired to say the least.
