The story of Sweeney Todd evokes memories of the work of classical writers like Charles Dickens and more contemporary writers like Edward Gory. As a musical, it naturally looks more like the musical Les Misérables. Both deal with the disastrous effects of poverty during the Industrial Revolution and the collapse of organized society. But this musical differs from Les Mis in a very important aspect: Stephen Sondheim, the songwriter capable of adapting to all styles. Certainly, he had his successes and his failures, but you can always count on his emissions: they will be unique. Who would have thought someone would write a musical on a barber who slaughtered people and turned them into meat pies? Sondheim did it and he did it wonderfully. The entire show takes place in a factory, to suggest the ever-present catastrophic effects of the misery of the lowest people in society, and this perfectly meets the needs of the show. Bridges and railings are moved to suggest streets, alleys and bridges. Techniques are borrowed from Kabuki and Noh, with visual machinists and scenery changes. To top it off, set the great Angela Lansbury as Mrs. Lovett, a very practical and humorous woman at the same time, and George Hearn, with his lyrical baritone voice, like the murderer Todd, and you'll have - even a stellar musical vehicle. The rest of the cast evolves perfectly in the clichés of the love story, with the exception of Johanna and Pirelli, who seem a little too forced. If the Johanna and Pirelli from the Broadway show could be here, that would be perfect. Hearn plays as he sings more than Len Cariou on the OBC album, and the accents do not sound like forced here. Through all this, Sondheim's score never fails to emphasize the seriousness of the story. As I said, it can adapt to all styles. In Follies, he imitates the style of the 30s, in Pacific Overtures, he captures the subtle art of Asian music, Into the Woods eliminates the 32 Disney-style songs, and Assassins traces the history of American music. Here, however, he does wonders by making his score distinctly in English, whether it be parlor songs, opera duets or soliloquies, or social waltzes in the style of Gilbert / Sullivan. And yet, the series remains extremely serious, even if it causes more laughter than any other musical. It still contains a dark warning about the ills of revenge. It is here that the film makes a mistake by cutting the judge's solo in which he flogs himself with guilt for his crimes. Without that, the judge is only a conventional villain, and the purpose of this film is that there are no bad guys. Todd and the judge learn too late the horrors of having to take responsibility for their actions and Todd loses everything in his obsession. This is well evidenced by the frightening recovery of the still annoying Ballad of Sweeney Todd, which ends the show when Todd and Lovett come out of the grave to tell us that the end is the same: in a world filled with Sweeneys revenge does not cause revenge. "Attend the story of Sweeney Todd He served a dark and vengeful God, seeking revenge can lead to hell, but everyone does it, and rarely as well as Sweeney, like Sweeney Todd, the barber demon of Fleet Street.
