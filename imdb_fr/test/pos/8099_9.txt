Chaplin plays the dual role of a Jewish barber who, along with amnesia, is confused with dictator Adenoid Hynkel (Hitler). A film made in 1940 when the war was in its dark days and had never been won by the allies. banned in Germany by Hitler and constituted a risk for Chaplin, because if the war was lost, he would surely be sent back to be "re-educated" <br /> <br /> A funny satire with the classic Hitler scene throwing around a giant balloon of the world..well fun but with a message..a bit preached at the end. It was the last movie with Chaplin's little mustache. on a scale of one to ten.9
