This sad story is incomprehensible because the director decides to break his story and offer the views of each character. So, there are a lot of flashbacks, re-shooting of the same scene. But it would be an extraordinary moment of cinema to put all the fragments to see the result! <br /> <br /> And it would be worth it, because it's for me one of the best french movies ever! <br /> <br /> He has everything: <br /> <br /> Casting: first steps of Monica Bellucci and Vincent Cassel! Such a presence and such voices, even for the hearing impaired! It's symbolic for them to fall in love with this movie! <br /> <br /> Realization: his camera is bright, alive, plays with the scenery or can be mysterious with its close-up "David Lynch". <br /> <br /> Cinematography: the light is beautiful, between gold and rust, in the manner of their love! <br /> <br /> A Paris never seen before: it's a Paris out of time with more precision, a composite of many neighborhoods! Huge search here! It looks like Gotham City, both modern and old! <br /> <br /> Music: Not the big orchestra, but in perfect harmony with the frames. And the song of Charles Aznavour made me discover this great singer! <br /> <br /> Ah, ?? the story! As I said, it's a love story, but rather tragic: To say that love can only be for nothing, that it does not make everyone happy or that nothing guarantees a sweet end is great, because this message is not often said! Love is a passion that derives from the Latin "pain". You can suffer a lot when you are in love! Because of the why ...?, Endless waiting, lack of courage, indecision. <br /> <br /> And when you can relax, destiny, destiny, god (?), devil (?) can stab you in the back, simply because you arrive too early or too late, and especially because love means 2 in a world of billions! Many things can happen and so many stories can be written! So what is love? <br /> <br /> Personally, I have lived moments like this: in a car with the beloved. Her cell phone rings and you know it's her "special friend" that she kisses goodbye (and not you, even though we're still together). So, you want to get out of this car to leave them together, not to hear the sweet but cruel words, but you can not, because an incredible hard rain has just begun! <br /> <br /> I noticed that this movie describes these tragic moments like nobody else!
