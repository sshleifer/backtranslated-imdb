Let me start by saying that I was VERY surprised by the production value of this film. I managed to attend a first performance and I must say that it is the BEST (if not the only) Christian movie to be on theaters since The Passion. <br /> <br /> Do not let the PG-13's rating scare you, the classification is appropriate because of the serious issues covered in this movie (divorce, teenage pregnancy, drug use and suicide), but nothing in the movie is free. It's really a movie that a group of college kids, a kid could see without disturbing (most) parents, and the message is wonderful. The best part is that it is not a film FOR THE CHRISTIANS, it is a family film without the septic sensation of the sky. <br /> <br /> The laughs are there, and many times at the theater, everyone was laughing, The humor was natural and did not seem to be written or forced, and it was a good rhythm in such a serious film. Adolescents and young adults, whether religious or not, will be able to identify with most, if not all, characters in the film, and I was surprised to see that such issues are dealt with in this type of film. The plot is by no means predictable, and in the end strikes closer to home than many will admit. Fortunately, Christians are not shown because all the powerful know that everything is "Word", but rather people who try to understand life. Humans make mistakes and nobody is perfect, not even in this film ... not far away. <br /> <br /> The acting game is awesome, the place of writing is perfect, and you are not touched by the head with all the Christian rhetoric preached. This is an excellent film that will make you think, talk and perhaps question your own morality (or lack thereof). If you want to see a quality family film in January, check out the local list of this movie and you may know more about yourself. <br /> <br /> And I'm a 25 year old man who only wanted to see a free movie. movie.
