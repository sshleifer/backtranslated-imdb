This movie is really a good movie fun and fun for kids. Kaley (played by talented talented Amanda Nickelodeon) is the accompanist of a rowdy boy who has trouble telling the truth. He ends up incorporating this into a stolen movie script. I will not bore you with the details. If you have children and want to see an entertaining or even exciting movie, I highly recommend it.
