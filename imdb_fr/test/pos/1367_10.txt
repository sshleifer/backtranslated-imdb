The story involves an old demon released in a small town on Halloween night. In all my life, I've never seen such a cheesy movie, but it's so entertaining that you can forgive him for his bad play, his effects, his direction and his script. It's the best movie created for the Halloween season since the original Halloween. And when they introduce Linnea Quigley's character for the first time, she is completely naked in the shower for about 5 minutes. Goodness, they do not do better than that. Hurry up and buy this tape right away. 5/10
