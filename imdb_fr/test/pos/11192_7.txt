so, I will not disagree with the critics but I have not really been moved by this movie. I was a little hesitant to praise him, because I feel some of the things that the protagonist is supposed to live. Yet, I praised it thinking that I could experience a catharsis, or at least understand that I'm not alone. Although I understood the protagonist's irritation with his carefree cousin, I did not feel his inner struggle with isolation as much as I would have liked. I felt a lot more emphasis was placed on his disruptive cousin who was staying longer than his home. it's a beautifully filmed film, and I really enjoyed the use of silence to bring out the feeling of isolation.
