Since Mr. Bean almost never speaks, I strongly recommend using a DVD player with the teacher holding his finger on the pause / play button. At the end of each age group's lesson, simply spend 5 minutes pausing and reading the DVD, encouraging students to shout out the answers to "What's this?" What's going to happen? "," What's going on? "," What's wrong? " ? ", or any other question that elicits answers from the new vocabulary and grammar of this lesson. <br /> <br /> Because everyone watches TV, usually shy students are heard. the DVD can be started or stopped at any time, it constitutes an ideal "filling material" for the "difficult moments" between the departure and the arrival of the students. <br /> <br /> I tried to other DVDs, notably "Tom & Jerry" The cartoons and DVDs of Red Skelton, but no other was as good as "Mister Bean" to retain the constant attention of the students.
