the most "spiritual" film I have seen for a long time. maybe never. there is also a scene around the dining room table a piece of comic perfection. I understand that a release date is planned for the fall. if it's about your city and you want to see a movie that makes you think that's it. Aviva is awesome and she's definitely a future star - (Superbad is where she currently is) - all the actors also seem perfectly calibrated. This film has a tone used to surprise. I do not know what to call it - it's comedy but the underlying message is so fierce and direct that "comedy" is not a word big enough to say. I like this film. It's the comedy of a thinking man. but even that sentence is not enough. FTF has a message and this message must be heard right now
