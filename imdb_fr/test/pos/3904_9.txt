I saw the victim for the first time more than 25 years ago, when I was very young. Being a passionate fan of Bewitched since I was a kid, I loved watching everything that featured Elizabeth Montgomery. This movie was (and still is) a real treat - whether you're a fan of Miss Montgomery's work or not. Elizabeth still shines in her roles, such as her portrayal as a rape victim in A Case Of Rape and as an alleged murderer in The Legend Of Lizzie Borden. His performance in The Victim as Kate, a terrified woman imprisoned in a remote house during a storm, followed by a killer after her, is brilliant. If you like thriller thrillers, here is a movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat until the end. Another great performance worth mentioning is that of Eileen Heckhart, who plays the mysterious and suspicious housekeeper. Unfortunately, like most Miss Montgomery movies, The Victim is not available on DVD and I think that although it was released on VHS a few years ago, it is rare nowadays. I was lucky to have filmed it when it was broadcast on television about ten years ago and so I have a nice copy of this very good movie. A must see!
