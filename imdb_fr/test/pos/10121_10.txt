It's a very moving film about life itself. The challenges a person with a disability faces in a country that expects perfection are put in the foreground so that everyone can see them and hopefully understand them. This should teach societal bigots that we are all human beings and that even though some of us are endowed with a healthy mind, heart and body, there are human beings in the world. decent who are not so lucky, or maybe we re unlucky. We do not always see the beauty of the world because we are packed into our "blind" ambitions and we only see it in one light: "what can this world do for me !!!". Maybe we all want to be like a radio, a happy and loving individual ... who loves everyone.
