I saw this movie at the Lowlands Festival (August 23rd, 24th and 25th) after one of my friends told me it was a very cool movie about the history of skating. I did not know now what to expect from this movie. Was it recorded by a few skaters who thought they could do some cool stuff, or was it a skating documentary? <br /> <br /> So I came in after an hour or so, with no expectations. <br /> <br /> This movie is really a great work on the beginning of skateboarding. It started with the zephyr team, which was a good group of surfers. This is happening in an area not very pleasant to live. At one point, the waves are not as good for surfing. So they try something else. skateboarding was a fact. <br /> <br /> If you were part of the zephyr team at that time, you are one of the trendy guys / girls. Because many people saw an escape from where they lived with the zephyr team. So they were trying all their new tricks now on a skateboard. <br /> <br /> In no time, skateboarding has regained its popularity. There were two competitions and one national competition. The zephyr team participated in several competitions and at the national competition. But what they were doing on these skateboards was amazing. But the jury did not know now how to judge them. So they put everyone skateboard on his head. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I can tell you the rest of the film / documentary, but you have to see this one with your own eyes. Because then you can feel the mood of this movie. This film has a lot of style for me, so I rewarded it with an 8. <br /> <br /> Greetings from Gijs and the rest of Holland. See you.
