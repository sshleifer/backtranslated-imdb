The scene "all I have to do is $ 5 and my wedding ring ..." was a riot. I also mocked the scene in the bar where Hyde sniffed the horse in radish and returned the bird to Japan and told him "my friend Pearl Harbor". I think my IQ is above 115, but I'm not sure because I can not count so high. <br /> <br /> It's funny, this requirement of 10 lines. Looks like they would like you for making your comments too long, not too short. I hope I do not get to 1000 words before I get to line 10. <br /> <br /> I still have two lines left. Forgive me while I think and drink, or drink and think. It depends if my hands are faster than my mind. Well, I think I have reached the limit of 10 lines. Thanks for reading!
