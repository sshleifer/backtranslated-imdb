I only watched this film because it contained Rupert Grint (whom I knew as Ron in the Harry Potter films). I had never really enjoyed Rupert as an actor before this movie. I liked the whole movie. Rupert does a great job in this hilarious and offbeat movie. I think the film could have been good without sex, but it worked. I can not wait to see more of Rupert's films in the future. Julie Walters has also done an amazing job. In Harry Potter movies, she has a very small role, so I did not know what to expect from her. But she was wonderful as Lady Evie. The part where she swallowed the key was absolutely hilarious. All in all, an amazing movie.
