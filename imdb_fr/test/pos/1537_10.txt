This film gave me recurring nightmares, with the voice of Alan Rickman representing an omnipotent, insidious fascist leader. The scariest movie I've ever seen - a psychological terror more powerful than any other "horror" movie ever made. The voice of Alan Rickman will always represent to me the power and the terror of a totalitarian state, recalling that of Orwell in 1984. This film describes to those who make fun of the reality of a big part of the current world governments. This film is disturbing, but in a way that everyone should watch it - it's a description of a reality that no one should ever have to live, but many do.
