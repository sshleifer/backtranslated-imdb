This film is a great example of the quality of the dramas that Channel 4 and the BBC have produced over the years. Ted Danson offers a powerful representation of a man tormented by memories that no one will accept and a society that thinks itself crazy. This is a remarkable performance by one of the most famous men for his role in Cheers, a sitcom for television comedy. Supporting actors are all very well chosen, including Mary Steenbergen, the wife of Danson, who plays the role of Gulliver's wife in the film. But it's mostly the seamless and very delicate changes between our world and Gulliver's world that make this film. The difference of perspective between the giants and the dwarves, all played by real actors, is beautifully captured. A rare treat of cinematography and staging.
