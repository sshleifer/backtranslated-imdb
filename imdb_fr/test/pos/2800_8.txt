"The Spanish Inn" has gathered the public wherever it is shown. He has collected public awards at many film festivals around the world. And it's not strange. We have the ability to watch a gay and amazing artwork. And it's wise elsewhere. "The Spanish Inn" is a very funny comedy about youth and growth. But it's all about the lights and shadows of life in the European Union. <br /> <br /> The main character of the film is a French student in economics, Xavier. For his future carrier, he is sent for a year of study in Barcelona. In Spain, it turns out that the lectures are given in Catalan. This probably does not help the increase of knowledge. But it helps to strengthen relationships within the exchange student group. Especially if they rent a big apartment together. There are 3 girls: English, Belgian and Spanish, as well as three boys: German, Danish and Italian. Our French will also get there. One year is very long. Long enough to get close and make friends. And get to know some European stereotypes by trying to separate them. <br /> <br /> Klapisch deals with this particular case of a process of unification of Europe with humor and without didacticism. He came out of the idea that young people are everywhere the same. They like jokes. They like making irresponsible relationships. But they do not neglect their aspirations. The most interesting is the amount of experience of this small community. They live together in the fire of daily tasks while struggling with the surrounding reality. They are full of unusual ideas for life. Young Europeans return to their country to start alone in the life of an adult. They constitute Europe's hope of combating the many problems of the Union. For example, the terrifying administration system. In the end, they prove that not only can they communicate and make friends despite the many differences. But they also know now how to live fully. And they will not take away their life.
