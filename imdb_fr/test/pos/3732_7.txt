WTF !! Do some of his books / movies end well? The notebook was good ... but hey, that's enough already with the depressing ends. I am told that he is writing about realistic situations that people encounter in real life. It's understandable ... but sometimes it's nice to see people who have sacrificed their whole lives for a mediocre and unhappy time in their lives - to finally find the true meaning of happiness and to be able to live it for the rest of their lives . Do not we already know what is really happening in real life? Can we not - for an instant (an hour and a half) live vicariously through a film that ends on a happy note - that gives us hope for our own future ??? <br /> <br /> Yeah - wah. I know. But in reality, I think it's necessary to warn movies that end like this. "Warning: no happy ending."
