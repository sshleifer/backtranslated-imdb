Jewel Thief is one of those suspense thrillers in which the audience has to guess who the villain is. The suspense is created from the first scene when the jeweler thief becomes a national problem and the film contains cleverly hidden clues to help you guess who the jewel thief is. The story depicts that Dev Anand (Vinay in the movie) and the jewelry thief have identical faces. But you get a shock of 1000 watts when you get to know the bad guy. There are a lot of surprises and a lot of fish stuff, but there's still time for a romance and six melodious songs still sung by Lata Mangeshkar, Asha Bhosle, Kishore Kumar and Mohmmad Rafi. <br /> <br /> This film was also spoken for videos of his song. Consider teasing and teasing against Asman Ke Neeche. Or the blocking of the road by Dev Anand when Tanuja went out with his friends to Yeh Dil Na Hota Bechara. Or the romantic Dil Pukare Are Are are in beautiful Sikkim. Or the wonderful dance of Vyjantimala in Hotho Pe Aisi Baat. Add Rulake Gaya Sapna Mera and Raat Akeli Hain and you'll never forget this movie for any reason. <br /> <br /> Being able to play Dev Anand, Ashok Kumar, Tanuja and Vyjantimala and under the direction of Vijay Anand (Dev Anand's younger brother) makes it one of the most popular Hindi films of all time, even today.
