My friends and I went through a period where we rented movies that none of us had ever heard of. The only good that resulted was this movie, "Take it to Limit". From the beginning of the film, we could expect a real classic. The music is probably made by white boys from rural Colorado, but that sounds like rap in the early '90s. The star of the show, actor Leo Fitzpatrick, plays the villain so well, especially in the film. This film is based on climbing, and I am not a climber. Yet even I find it hilarious to see a climber struggling to climb and there is a guy in the background climbing up the cliff. You do not want to miss this movie, you will see the same clips again and again. You will have surprises every turn. You will find yourself quoting unforgettable lines. I highly recommend this movie to anyone. Take the snow. Disclaimer: This movie is badly done, but that's what makes it awesome
