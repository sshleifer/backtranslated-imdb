I saw Bandit Queen in 2005, more than ten years after its inception amid widespread controversy in India. The language, the hard treatment and the natural game (of a relatively unknown distribution at the time) could have been even more shocking at that time for an Indian population more familiar with the fantastic cinema. The film, the cast and Shekhar Kapoor deserve praise for this decisive effort. <br /> <br /> The plot is not very different from a typical revenge drama performed in India in different forms. In fact, there have been several fictional accounts of this particular story itself. That's because it's supposed to be the first-person narrative of someone who has gone through all this, and many other things that do not find a place on the screen and have survived to tell the story. Survived long enough to see his story turned into a movie at least. Phoolan Devi did not live very long after being released from prison in 1994. <br /> <br /> The film marks in many ways. Cinematography is brilliant. The music is apt. Distribution, many of which have become more familiar names later, is very good. But the scenario is uneven. Things move too fast and at times. This is understandable, however, because there is simply too much to do to make everything coherent. Or maybe I felt that because I read Mala Sen's book, which is more detailed and better, although not as shocking as the visual narrative, the story of Phoolan Devi's episodes, and that is supposed to be one of the main sources of the film. <br /> <br /> There are also some factual ambiguities. According to Phoolan Devi, she was not present when the Behmai massacre took place and, while claiming to be Phoolan's dictated story herself, it was shown to be involved in the massacre and was 'origin. Then, the last scene where Phoolan goes shows the woman who touches the chief minister, whereas she had actually given up the portrait of Mahatma Gandhi. Symbolic value only, but shows that Phoolan did not want to show slavery to an ordinary, living person. It would have been nice to show the Chief Minister some resemblance to Arjun Singh, who many remember was the Madhya Pradesh CM at the time. <br /> <br /> But these are just small flaws in this eminently well-done film, a rare jewel from the traditional Indian film industry, made by a man who was previously best known for his ultimate masala film. the late 80s - Mr India.
