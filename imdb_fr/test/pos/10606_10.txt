If you're looking for a film that does not take itself seriously, Haggard is for you. I must say before writing anything more, that if you have not viewed any of the CKY videos (Camp Kill Yourself), the movie will probably not be as funny. My advice is to watch some excerpts from these videos made by Bam and his friends. Haggard does not take himself at all seriously and that was never his goal. Throughout the film, you will have random moments that have nothing to do with the plot, which can be boring, but none of it is out of control. Despite everything, the plot remains focused and the story of Ryan Dunn's character runs pretty smoothly. This plot was told to me is based on a true story (for the most part) of Ryan Dunn's ex-girlfriend. Brandon Dicamillo is by far the best character in the film. He has a lot of talent and can make people laugh. He stole the film if you ask me. Overall, I love this film for its simplicity and its strangeness. It's a Bam movie, it's not going to be normal. Haggard is filled with hilarious quotes that my friends and I have been constantly using since the first time. I saw the film 6 to 7 times and I always find new things each time. The soundtrack is just as good. Everything from Gnar Kill to New Order and techno. Just do not go into the film with high expectations, let everything unfold and then judge for what it is.
