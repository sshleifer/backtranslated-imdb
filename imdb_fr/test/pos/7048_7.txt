If you take the film for what it's worth, you will not be disappointed. If you think Murray is supposed to win an Oscar for his performance and you expect this type of movie, do not worry. It was funny when I saw it in 1979 and I did not lose its charm. Good clean fun for kids and silly entertainment for older people. The scenario is simple and easy to follow. Murray did better, but it's his first film. The film reminds me of a time when we did not need blood and courage to entertain ourselves. Morty is the main dunce and plays the perfect role. Other counselors are usually passionate teenagers looking to have fun during the summer. A good thing about this movie, it has a message.
