Ah, classic comedy. At the time of the brave movie, a two-minute scene with Bruce Campbell struggling in part, reminds me of how much simplistic movies and ideas can take you and wrap you in an entire movie. <br /> <br /> For years and years, Bruce Campbell knows what kind of movies we want from him. We want to see strange movies like Bubba Ho Tep. We want to see cameo roles in Sam Raimi's films, and we want to see "The Man with Screaming Brain". With the only title, we know that it will touch this type of movie completely silly, like Army of Darkness, only with more idiotic monsters and less monstrous. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​the film is simple. Bruce sees the doctor. The doctor has a new idea. Bruce hurts himself by going to see a doctor. Coincidentally, this is the thing the doctor wanted to show him who saves him. Hilarity ensues. <br /> <br /> With the addition of Ted Raimi in strange Russian and companion Stacy Keach as Dr. Ivan Ivanovich Ivanov, it's funny this movie. Completely funny. Never a scary point. <br /> <br /> If you like the ridiculous Bruce Campbell, you'll like this. Again, why would you look at this if you did not like Bruce Campbell?
