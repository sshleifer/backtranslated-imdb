<br /> <br /> Medium adventure movie that took a serious story and "sacred" it. The dilution effect makes especially for the medium screened scenario the place of this film as a classic solid. Probably because it addresses "sensitive" colonial issues and producers do not want to create political heat, but quick profits, thank you. The film's production, cinematography and soundtrack were excellent. Connery's charm offset his bad Arabic accent and all scenes with President T. Roosevelt were masterpieces. The costumes / decorations here were very good. Too bad we did not get a historical drama what history requires. Only for big fans of the main actors or fans of the exotic Romance / Adventure Holywood movies .....
