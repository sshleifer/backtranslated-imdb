I have not seen all of Burt Reynolds's movies, but this one (which I just watched for the third time) might be his best! He suffers only from a few slow stretches; Burt may have tried to make it more "artistic" than it should have been. On the other hand, he managed to avoid many of the usual clich√©s in the presentation of the role of "hard policeman" that he plays (note, for example, the scene in which he tries to kiss Rachel Ward he expresses just before the confrontation final with the indestructible Henry Silva). In fact, Silva and these two ninja assassins are three of the most memorable villains of the 80s policemen. The film also has a few quirky touches, a surprising amount of humor, a brutal and striking fist fight and many good shots. directed. (***)
