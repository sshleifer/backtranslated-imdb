The central airport tells the story of a pilot named Jim (Richard Barthelmess) who flees in 4,000 hours and is forced to abandon his commercial flights. He meets a beautiful girl named Jill (Sally Eilers) and the two embark on a number involving theft and stunts. The two begin a relationship, but when Jim is hurt, his brother (Tom Brown) takes over for a moment and falls in love with his brother's girlfriend. From there, things become exciting and terribly terribly sad. <br /> <br /> This film is a pre-code for several reasons. First, Jim and Jill consumed their relationship without being married or intending to marry. Secondly, Eilers is shown in his underwear and in an absolutely restricted scene when the Production Code came into effect. <br /> <br /> This film does not skimp on the dramatic love triangle and ends accordingly bitterly.
