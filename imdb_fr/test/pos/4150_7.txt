This movie promises a lot but offers little. The fundamental problem is related to the inclusion of Charlotte Gainsbourg's character in this film. Sicilian immigrants did not need an Anglo Redhead at all - the film might have needed it, but the new citizens certainly did not. In my opinion, the decision to include it destroys the continuity of the film. This is particularly disturbing because it seems to belittle not only the characters in the film, but also the history of immigration itself. The immigrants themselves were heroic characters, perfectly able to get along without having to satisfy what I believe to be a veiled image of the "burden of the white man". I wonder if anyone will shoot a movie of Irish immigrants featuring a Sicilian woman as the main character. The Left Elbow Index takes into account seven aspects of cinematic action, production scenery, dialogue, artistic quality, film continuity, plot and character development, on a scale from 10 to 1 for an excellent, 5 for a medium, 1 for a help to needs. The continuity of the film and the plot have a minimum of 1. The end, as discussed above, is further degraded by the surrealist ending. Can not a film of such important historical significance deserve more than a conclusion reminiscent of Marc Chagall's? The plot is quite simple, until there seems to be too much time spent in the old country, too little time on the boat and too much emphasis on the end. The acting and the development of the characters are average since all the characters are fixed throughout the film and that the inclusion of English perfectly speaking Anglo-Saxon almost turns the film into satire. Where is Groucho when you need him? Production sets, dialogues and artistic talent are very good, each giving the mark of 10. The sets in Sicily, on the ship and at Ellis Island are as good as possible. The dialogue is wonderful and the ethical song is superb. I agree with Scorsese that listening to the Sicilian dialect is a pleasure. Note that immigrants speak of "America", not "United States" - the ideal against the political reality. There are many good artistic scenes, with dreams of America, raining gold coins and some of the best giant vegetables. The average left elbow score is 5.25, raised to 7.0 when compared to the IMDb scale. Another idea seems to emerge from the Ellis Island experience: the tribulations of passing immigrants were grueling. Later, in 2006, it was enough to pay a coyote or boat owner and sneak into the darkness of the night without asking any questions! The film is worth seeing, but it seems that what we see is problematic.
