Brain of Blood begins when Abdul Amir (Reed Hadley), leader of a country called Kahlid, is about to die because of cancer. However, if he dies, Kahlid will tear himself apart without anyone leading him. Dr. Robert Nigserian (Grant Williams) & one of Amir's followers, Mohammed (Zandor Vorkov) has come up with a plan to take Amir's body to America, where mad scientist Lloyd Trenton (Kent Taylor) will transplant his brain into a new body and with a little plastic surgery, no one will ever know it was even dead. Things are not going as planned, but when it comes time to transplant Amir's brain, Gor (John Bloom), the monstrous wizard of Trenton, brings back the corpse of someone who fell off the balcony, Trenton had need a living body and fit, because there was more. time he decides to use Gor's body as a temporary break until one finds another more appropriate. Unfortunately, when Amir wakes up in his new body, he is not very happy with what he sees. I would do it if you found out that your brain is inside a badly burned monster. <br /> <br /> Also called Brain Damage, The Brain, The Revenge's Creature and The Undying Brain, this inexpensive movie was produced and directed by the one and only Al Adamason and, frankly, I I am offended by the pathetic note of 1.5 that Brain of Blood has on IMDb, personally, I think it's great. fun in such a bad way it's kind of. The highly entertaining storyline of Kane W. Lynn and Joe Van Rodgers is as silly and ridiculous as they come from wet-brain brains to crazy scientists, acid-scarred 7-foot-high freaks with small cars up to 4 feet medical height. assistant, from dungeons to rooftop prosecutions, from car accidents to assassinations, from kidnappings to gaudy clothed women, from Regina Carrol's hairstyle which should be mentioned in the opening credits of teenage girls imprisoned in the basement for having hilariously soby ending that includes a deep and meaningful speech! It's all there and Brain of Blood has quality cheese stamped on it, if you're a fan of bad-budget, low-budget movies with a sense of fun then this movie should be at the top of your must-see list of movies . Despite a modest 1.5, I'm proud to say that I loved Brain of Blood, but I thought it was great to watch it. It slows down a bit at the end with a few strokes of too many people wandering without doing anything. In particular, but until then, he had evolved like a rocket. At only 85 minutes, it is relatively short, it's hard to guess the complicated plot and I think it's a lot of fun activities. <br /> <br /> It's Director Adamson's masterpiece for me with Dracula vs. Frankenstein (1971) that he directed the year before. Those who have ever seen an Adamson movie will experience nonexistent production values, cheap special effects and cardboard games and all this adds to the fun, this movie handles the fine incompetence / seriousness to create a memorable visual experience. I love Kahlid's first shot, which is obviously only a photo of the Taj Mahal in India with statuesque characters in the foreground! Regina Carrol's hair seems to be an entity in itself, they seem to change their style between shots and are frankly horrible, do not get me into her makeup job, she has to apply it with a paint sprayer ! There is another hilarious moment when we see that Amir's body has been transported to America, wrapped in what looks like an ordinary tin sheet. Why the question I asked myself, why !? The effects are variable, there is a fake spider of terrible appearance, the work of makeup artist burned Gor is rather painful although there is a surprisingly bloody brain sample that is actually quite impressive. <br /> <br /> Brain of Blood's budget is virtually non-existent, I must admit that I thought the Trenton lab was pretty good with various computers and medical instruments although the rest of the movie seems cheap and nasty. The production values ​​are low, the music is from another film, Beast of Blood (1971), and the acting is awful, but playful and fun. <br /> <br /> Brain of Blood may have the best title for an all time movie and for me, it's an extremely entertaining nonsense that I've had a good time at look and laugh. They simply do not want / can not / do not want to make them so, impossible to recommend to those looking for a good movie, but bad moviegoers should enjoy it. I liked that, but again I'm just weird.
