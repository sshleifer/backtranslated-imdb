On the release of THE CHINA SYNDROME, many right-wing critics and nuclear-destroying partisans sapped the film, especially since its three main stars were all known for their liberal politics and their obvious mistrust of nuclear power. But it took only two weeks and an almost catastrophic accident at Three Mile Island to silence those critics. <br /> <br /> Fonda and Douglas are the Los Angeles news team that is witnessing a potentially catastrophic accident at the Ventana Nuclear Generating Station. . Douglas films the event through the soundproof glass of the factory. but the TV channel will not broadcast the images, fearing a massive trial. It is therefore up to Fonda and Douglas to discover the truth, despite a massive attempt by factory owners to conceal the accident. <br /> <br /> But a conscientious shift leader (Jack Lemmon) has uncovered some flaws in the plant's pump support structure. He believes that these defects were the cause of the accident and that, even if it would be extremely expensive and time consuming, if the repairs are not carried out, the next accident could be apocalyptic. But he can not convince anyone who works with him to believe his story. The result is a nightmarish climax that brings together various narratives of political, technological and human interests in one disturbing package. <br /> <br /> Although obviously of a politically liberal nature, THE CHINA SYNDROME, is well directed and co-written by James Bridges (THE PAPER CHASE) is also basically a message film about the inherent dangers of assembly technology and nuclear energy. Basically, nuclear energy can NEVER be secured because people can NEVER be perfect. That's what the movie says. and in a very entertaining and suspensive way, he says it brilliantly.
