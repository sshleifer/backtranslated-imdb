No one will ever doubt that director Leos Carax is a genius, but what we are wondering is: is he a crazy genius? So many people hated this movie! I'm usually the first person to accuse many French directors of making offensive, boring, disgusting and pretentious movies (like the horrible film "The Child" and the useless and offensive film "Red Lights"). But strangely, I really think that 'Pola X' is an amazing film, made with great talent and passion by a master of his art, and containing remarkable performances. The film carries melodrama to more extreme lengths than I have ever seen on screen. But then, Carax is extreme, we know it. The film also contains what I consider to be Trotskyist or anarchist wet fantasies and dreams, with a mysterious group of young men learning to fire machine guns against the middle class between the rather fascinating music of Scott Walker in a group at his recording sessions in an abandoned warehouse filled with squatters and fires in old steel drums. Guillaume Depardieu plays a rich young man in a castle (his mother-in-law is Catherine Deneuve and he walks in his bathroom while she is naked in the bathtub, by the way). But he suddenly "suffers" a complete breach when he discovers that his father, a famous diplomat, who died, had an illegitimate daughter, which Deneuve had effectively eliminated as a disadvantage. Indeed, the sister suddenly appears as a kind of Romanian refugee with hair disheveled, face without expression and a low ability to speak French consistently. Depardieu then transforms himself into a "hero of class" of the far left and wants to kill or destroy his family for hypocrisy and corruption, and lives in misery and extreme poverty while despising a vast legacy. He then begins an incestuous sexual relationship with his half-sister, as shown by an explicit sex scene that has offended many people, although I do not see any objection, because I feel that sex is far too hysterical , especially in the United States, where apparently this never happens. The intensity of the game and filming make this unlikely scenario a powerful, though depressing, experience of hyper-melodrama. The differences between Carax in an extreme film like this one and the many extreme French films that I find pretentious and disgusting are (1) the fact that Carax is an excellent filmmaker and (2) he seriously tries to explore a meaningful meaning, so heartbreaking, extreme emotional condition, whereby a human being disintegrates and turns against his past. Many would say that the extreme elements of this film were free, but I do not agree. I believe that Carax was genuine and did not make a picture of the operation at all. It is very difficult to defend a man who is going that far and who, as far as I know, may be crazy, but I think he deserves to defend this remarkable film feat.
