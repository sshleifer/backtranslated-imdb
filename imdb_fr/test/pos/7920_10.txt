This is commented only because Serge Prokofiev (1891-1953) may not have known at first how powerful and truly majestic a score is. If you read the lyrics of Alexander Nevsky op.78, is, through the song, the witness of one of the most beautiful and moving musical scores of all the musical literature.This film and the accompanying score have a place of choice in the world and can be as true on the Internet as anywhere else. The composer's website, which is underwritten by his estate, brings extra care to a score that this score really deserves. It is as profound to me as it is vast with such audacity that you want to be the one called Grand Novgorod. It's a song about Alexander Nevsky. Yes, that's what happened on the Neva, on the Neva, on the wide waters. There, we slaughtered our pawn of combat enemies, the combat man, the Swedish army. Ah! How we fought, how we routed them! Ah! Smashed their ship From war to embers! In the fight, our blood was poured freely for our great land, our homeland, Russia.Hey! Where the broad blade rocked was like an open street, in their ranks an alley where spears ran! Swedes like feathers growing on the desert floor. We will never give up Russian homeland. Those who walk on Russia will be put to death! Stand up against the enemy, the Russian land, stand up to arms, great Novgorod! The Russian people, in fair combat in the fight to the death, rise, free and courageous people, defend our beautiful country! For the living warriors, high esteem, immortal glory to the killed warriors! your Russian people! In our great native Russia, no enemy will live. We raise our arms, let us arise, our mother, Russia! No enemy will march through the Russian land, no foreign army will plunder Russia. the roads leading to Russia. no enemy will ravage the Russian fields (here, dear reader, we are asked to live forever with the following verse) entitled "The field of the dead" -I will cross the snowy field, I will fly over the field of death. I will seek valiant warriors, my fiancee, my young pillars. She is shot down by a wild saber, and there is one impaled by an arrow. From their wounds, the blood fell like rain on our native soil, on our Russian fields. Whoever fell to Russia in a noble death will be blessed by my kiss on his dead eyes; , brave boy, who stayed alive, I will be a real woman and a loving friend.I will not be married to a handsome man, earthly charm and beauty will quickly disappear and die.I will be married to the brave man, Take this into account, brave warriors! (now its conclusion with the entry of Nevskys to Pskov) In a great campaign, Russia went to war.Russia has shot down hostile troops.At our homeland, no enemy will live.Es who will come will be put to death ! Celebrate and sing, Russian mother, Russia! In our homeland, men will not live. Enemies will never see Russian cities and fields; they will march on Russia will be put to death! Celebrate and sing, Russian mother, all Russia has come to triumph over the feast. Celebrate and rejoice, Russian fatherland! - It should be noted that Prokofiev was under This score was really approved by Stalin. For me, there is an incomparable beauty in the way we love this world and Nevsky speaks of a hero whose attributes of God love for any participation in this love. A truly magnificent and stealthy account of Alexander's story Nevsky.
