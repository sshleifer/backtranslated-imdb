I like the dummy document format that Chris Guest and his team have developed over the years. In fact, I like that and "Waiting for Guffman" better than "Spinal Tap", the band's first (and made by Rob Reiner but featured Guest and several other of his fake documentary regulars). This humor is not for everyone. It's rather subtle and not too physical, so some people may not be in a relationship. However, as a dog lover (and lover of canine shows), I loved this movie. There are so many funny lines in it! My daughter and I often quote them. I find it amazing that these people can ad lib so much funny content for each movie! What a fun group they must be. I highly recommend it to people who prefer their cerebral humor.
