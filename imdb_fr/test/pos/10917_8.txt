I watched it after not having seen it since its first release (in 97), and it always made me laugh out loud. It's skillfully written, Kevin Kline and Joan Cusack are perfect in their role, and if you can watch Bob Newhart in this movie and not laugh, you're more of a man than me. <br /> <br /> For no matter, I think the scenes where Tom Selleck kisses Kevin Kline, where Kevin Kline listens to the tape "How to be a man", and the (almost) wedding scenes with Joan Cusack are three the funniest scenes of any movie. <br /> <br /> Of course, the last scene is an excuse to conclude happy, but ... few movies are perfect.
