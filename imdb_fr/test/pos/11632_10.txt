Barney talks about "IMAGINATION" of what you do not have, if my preschooler never wanted to play as if it were the same thing in this show, then I would be worried. Which 2 or 3 year old child really understands all that? It's all about colors and songs. For those who say that all they do on Barney is eating junk food and recommending Sesame Street, what about "cookie monster" is all he eats, but I have not seen anyone comment on this. I agree that sesame is a better educational show, but Barney is like a show for fun, do not be too serious if you do not like your child watching TV and you fear he understand things you do not believe then you should not. I'm not supporting them in front of the TV in the first place because all this is wrong everything is wrong the wrong actors are so why do not take your brain wrong and put it to use and think if you have a problem with a fake TV show for the kids, then turn it off and play with them yourself and teach them what you want them to learn, not BIG BIRD or Bert & Ernie or anyone from barney who used to watch all these emissions and that went well.
