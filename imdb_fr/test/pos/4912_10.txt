Warning, contains spoilers! <br /> <br /> This is one of the best Italian sleaze movies I've seen. <br /> <br /> The plot has a teenager who is interested in occultism and has supernatural powers. Her mother is a member of the Satanist group and fears the influences it will have on the girl. No need to worry, the girl knows what to do and there is no return, she belongs to Satan .. <br /> <During the movie, weird things happen in Italian , there is not too much logic, but it's only a good thing. It's amazing to see that these films are entertaining. During the final battle, we see her fighting with her mother. By performing mysterious rituals, you may guess who wins ... The final images of the films leave their mouths open and wander, why can not we have more than movies like this? <br /> <br /> The music is superb throughout the film and the actors are good enough, better than usual in this type of film. In particular Anne Heywood is beautiful and has good deeds. This is not boring at all. My rating is 10. <br /> <br /> Hope someone publishes this information on a DVD.
