I think this film is really entertaining, even if it lacks some essential features of this kind of film. First, when Doug and Chappy begin their mission, they take off with the F-16B and, during the fight scenes, they fly the F-16A. The second thing I do not like in this film is the F-16, which is constantly repeating itself, rolling to its right to escape the missiles ... Why were the projectiles not projected in any film? Thirdly, once the F-16 is almost empty of ammunition, a lot of missiles appear again ... the models used to simulate the destroyed aircraft are not good either. However, I think that using IAI Kfir as an enemy plane was really good, much better than the F-5 presented in Top Gun (but this film is not as good as this masterpiece). <br /> <br /> A funny film, I love planes and I've seen it more than 3 times.
