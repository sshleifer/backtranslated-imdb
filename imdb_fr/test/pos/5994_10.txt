I gradually go out of all the Hong Kong action films and discover this jewel, mainly thanks to Ching Wan Lau, who is one of my favorite actors. <br /> <br /> This is an excellent action movie although not as OTT as the title might suggest. He is moving at a steady pace and is really nice. <br /> <br /> The biggest surprise of this film was the soundtrack. It seems that Rob Dougan - the guy who composed the song "Clubbed To Death" that was popular in "The Matrix" raised the soundtrack of Big Bullet and compiled it in one of the tracks of his album "Furious Angels "; The song in question is called "I Do not Drive More" and is also the opening song of the TV series "Law and Order" AND the teaser opening song of the DVD menu "Matrix Reloaded"! It really surprised me, because of pure coincidence!
