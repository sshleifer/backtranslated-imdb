I saw this film at the Locarno Film Festival in Italian Switzerland. <br /> <br /> Aishwarya Rai is beautiful. <br /> <br /> I rate this movie 7/10 because of its good times. <br /> <br /> * Spoilers to come * <br /> <br /> It contains beautiful cinematic moments, especially at the end. <br /> <br /> Although my general feeling is too long (over 2 hours and 40 minutes) and contains too much dialogue? And almost no dance at all. <br /> <br /> Clearly, a Bollywood film like Lagaan or Devdas is a film very different from that of Chokher Bali.
