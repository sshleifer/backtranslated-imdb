This movie made me literally roll on the floor (at least on the couch) laughing. I did not think it would please me, but it was broadcast on cable TV one afternoon, I watched everything and had a good time. Since then, I've also seen Black Sheep, which was pretty good, but not as funny as Tommy Boy.
