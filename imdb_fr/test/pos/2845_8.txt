Nurse Betty has this strange yet winning combination of a disgusting and uncomfortable plot with extraordinary characters. In the same way that I hated Fargo on his first visit, and then realized that I was still thinking about it a few days later and that I liked it, I loved Nurse Betty the next day. Difficult to understand, more difficult to explain. As others have said, it's forced in many ways, but it seems to be part of what makes it so striking. <br /> <br /> Fair work from Greg Kinnear, Morgan Freeman's excellent work (although I'm afraid he's stereotypical as the bad guy). Chris Rock was good but not a standout. Ren√© Z. is so natural that it irritates - that is, it is confusing to be "natural" when playing with someone who does not have his head in his head. Also liked the kind of "abrasive spark" of Allison Janney in a small part. <br /> <br /> Do not expect a "road movie" as you might think from some synopsis. (There is "road", but it's hardly relevant.) Classified 8/10.
