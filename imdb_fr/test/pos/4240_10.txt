This is a good movie for Chucky fans. Ok, I'm sure it's not as good as the Child's Play movie, but it can get really funny and enjoyable, Chucky's laughs are hilarious. <br /> <br /> (SPOILERS) <br /> <br /> Now, not a doll but two, the double impact, Jennifer Tilly played very well and definitely won the best result movie. <br /> <br /> If you've watched Child's Play movies, be a movie worthy of your Chucky collection, but if you've never seen the kids movies play before, it'll be a fresh start. Of course, you will not know how Chucky got into his current state (because I'm not telling you), but you'll understand why Chucky is so popular. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's very nice. movie.
