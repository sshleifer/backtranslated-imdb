Style on the substance. But what style is it? "The Cell" is the internal version of most serial killer movies. Unfortunately, history hardly supports the visual elements. <br /> <br /> Psychotherapist Catherine Deane (J-Lo) describes in her patients' dreams artificial ways to discover them and help them overcome their phobias and obsessions. A new patient whose coma has fallen into a coma is brought to his attention by the FBI. It is a serial killer who drowns his female victims and then puts their bodies in grotesque scenarios like models. Deane must enter the killer's mind and navigate his sick fantasies in order to find and rescue his last victim. <br /> <br /> Director Tarsem Singh has incredible visions and background pieces for this production. Each sequence of dreams is like a nightmarish painting in motion, landscapes with costumes. <br /> <br /> But the plot suffers from the lack of history of his characters. Stargher is the only person with deep experience and he is the last person you want to worry about. Without him, you essentially have a film that moves only in the present, which is a shame because the film is so breathtaking and truly scary. Lopez is wasted, but she is not such an incredible actress, although she is still so beautiful. And Vince Vaughn? I do not even know why he was chosen. This is not his forte and he exaggerates. He was trying too hard to become his character and it showed. Stand at the comedy, Vince! Still, this film is so visually scary that I always look at it with the lights on and that I can never fall asleep immediately afterwards.
