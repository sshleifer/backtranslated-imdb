LIFEFORCE is an extremely schizophrenic film, based on Colin Wilson's novel, The Space Vampires, the screenplay ignores most of the novel's concepts and structure (it actually owes more to the QUATERMASS series than the novel), but the scenes that he leave the novel are almost identical to those of the film. And speaking of the screenplay must be one of the most unequal in the history of cinema, although it has been written in chapters by several different people. Take for example Carlson, he disappears after the first scenes of the shuttle that led me to believe he was dead, then he returns to half of the film to explain the plot to the beleaguered British and it is this lack of attention of the writers. which spoils the film. And there are many other awkward scripts, such as the heroes who come back to London by helicopter and do not realize they were crushed by zombies until they fly over this plane. <br /> <br /> I could go on. LIFEFORCE is nice to watch as long as you do not use your brain. It's nice to see a sci-fi horror movie from a time when aliens were portrayed as cute creatures that children hid in their room so that evil human adults would not put their hands in their hands. . The special effects and the pyrotechnic effects are very good, there is a lot of action and stunts and LIFEFORCE is one of the most memorable extraterrestrials of the Space Girl. When mentioning LIFEFORCE in a conversation with men, it is always a race to say "Seeing the alien in LIFEFORCE, it can suck the life force of me at any time". No wonder watching the demographics of this movie is more popular than women <br /> <br /> "Do not worry, a naked girl can not escape from here" She can not? Have mercy <br /> <br />
