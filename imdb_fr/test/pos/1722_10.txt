I love Dr. Who! I believe that David Tennant is the best doctor in the series and Billie Piper the best companion! I liked the way Dr. and Rose had such a connection and a great relationship and Dr. approached a few times to express his love for the rose! Unfortunately, it ended after only 2 seasons. I will miss looking at lots of roses and think that the show will not be the same without Rose! But David is always there to make me laugh and make me happy to see him play this fantastic role! I rate this show at 110%, it is fantastic! The graphics and monsters of this show are wonderful and each scenario is different but somewhat connected and I learned something about the love, the world and the relationships of this show. It must be one of the most fantastic shows of all time!
