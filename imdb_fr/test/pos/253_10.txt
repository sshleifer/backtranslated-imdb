When I saw this movie, it reminded me of all my biggest dreams (mostly filled with robots). <br /> <br /> I can understand Eldore's problems and I have a similarity with Shiro. It's an excellent movie. to watch (if you are a bitter and eccentric Goth like me!). Overall, watch for it before it runs out!
