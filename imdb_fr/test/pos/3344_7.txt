I probably would not have bothered to comment on this film if I had not been disturbed by the constant references made to it here in North America as a porn movie. Our obsession with what is or should be considered pornographic remains a remnant of the "guidance" provided to filmmakers by the Hayes Committee many years ago and it is now high time to relegate them to the past. So far, we have not made much progress beyond establishing a somewhat arbitrary division between what we now call "soft" porn and "hard" porn, with both groups bearing the same label pornographic. It's time we all recognize that neither the version of this movie rated R (pornographic film?), Nor the unrated version (hard porn?) Available on DVD are by no means pornographic. <br /> <br /> In Legal Terms Pornography is defined by its ability to deprave or corrupt. Many classic books such as Lady Chatterley's lover, Fanny Hill, Women in Love, The Story of 'O' and Moll Flanders have been sued for pornographic content, judged by a jury and approved on the basis of this definition, but in practice most ordinary citizens are not interested in what they consider to be legal ambiguity and apply a simpler criterion, but a little too strict when applied to books or films very close to reality, but serves to quickly rid most others of any pornographic content. Although the Hayes Code would have described AIW as unacceptable for nudity and the description of sexual activities, in practice most people today admit that the fundamental message of a book or movie is clearly designed to encourage the development of long-term stable family relationships. in which the participants find true fulfillment, this can not be considered pornographic (this does not mean that works describing unsatisfactory or unstable relationships must be recognized as pornographic, but only that they may require a more elaborate evaluation). At AIW, we have a film about a young woman librarian who has had a rather protective education and holds her suitor at arm's length because she feels that this is what morality asks her to do. Too frustrated by this situation and threatening to leave her, she falls asleep and dreams of being transported to a land of wonders (close to Lewis Carrol's) where all the people she meets will be fully informed of their sexual needs. She is shocked, but is a kind person who takes things as she finds them, so very quickly, she discovers that her own prejudices are gradually dissolving. She wakes up when her boyfriend returns to break their affair, but her attitude towards him has changed so much that their relationship is fully restored and the film ends with a life "happy forever" with their children in a house with a fence and a family dog ​​- an end clearly directed towards the romantic ones who remain very young at heart. <br /> <br /> Pornographic? - Barely!. <br /> <br /> A view adapted to children? - And probably not quite, unless you have very progressive parents. <br /> <br /> R notation? - PG would be better today. <br /> <br /> Entertainment for viewers of most age groups? - Yes, but the film has its flaws - these are discussed in many comments on IMDb, but most commentators have clearly appreciated and appreciated. <br /> <br /> I believe that the only pornography associated with this film was the An anti-pornography activist allegedly claimed that a "scientific image" of Kristin deBell was a photographic montage of images of the face of a ten-year-old teen with various body parts of adult models. These and other comments have seriously damaged the career of a promising young actress, but today the film seems to be becoming a cult classic. Several personal video productions have been published in VHS and DVD format; the last was a DVD containing the R and unrated versions of the film, released by Subversive Cinema in 2007. Copies were already available a few months ago. They are almost exhausted and the mail order sellers still have copies. in stock sell them at several times their original price - a situation that usually results in the rapid appearance of a new DVD version. This persistent interest, nearly 35 years after the release of the original film, indicates an almost classic status. <br /> <br /> Commentators of this database should provide other viewers with useful information about the value of the film, or even its collection - - My comments here were intended to highlight the ongoing damage in the industry that still results pressure on major studios to comply with the self-censorship recommendations of the Hayes Panel. On this database, such general comments are very quickly marked by readers as "not useful" and I rarely do them; but fortunately, I still have room to add that, in my opinion, this film is quite unusual and deserves to be watched, even bought. It's flawed, but Kristine deBell gives an excellent performance and the film offers a pretty unique and rewarding viewing experience. Overall, I would give it 7 stars and I will buy a copy of the next edition of the DVD if and when it will appear. If Ms. deBell is still alive today, I would like to hear her comments on the attempts to remove this film and the late recognition it has gradually achieved.
