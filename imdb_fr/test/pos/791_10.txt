It's a game that you can watch over and over again and laugh so much every time. We participated in a Keaton festival after buying some of his films. In this one, Buster is mistaken for an escaped murderer and there are a lot of chase scenes and crazy scenes but also what is best about Buster - his creativity. The opening scene is really fun and it just keeps going from there.
