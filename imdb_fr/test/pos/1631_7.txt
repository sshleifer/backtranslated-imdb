I go to the movies for entertainment. The first movie in this series: The DaVinci Code has been a lot of fun. There were a lot of twists to keep me very interested. Angels and Demons is no different. If you enjoyed the DaVinci code, then you will definitely enjoy this movie. Angels and Demons is done pretty much in the same style as the previous movie, but at a faster pace, which I liked. Ron Howard kept me stuck in my seat for two hours without getting bored. <br /> <br /> What I really liked in this movie is that even though it's obviously fictional, it leaves enough story to make that seem very believable. If there is one thing that I do not like in this film, it is that the plot in itself is very incredible (I do not want to give any spoilers). But hey, it's a movie. I had fun throughout the evening and I was very happy with what I saw.
