THE GOLDEN DOOR (NUOVOMONDO) is for this spectator the best film of the year. It is a masterpiece of concept: writing, staging, acting and cinematography. More importantly, this film of dazzling beauty is an indispensable reflection mirror so that we can see the history of immigration of "foreigners" to America at a time when the mere mention of the word "borders" is a political detonator. Screenwriter / director Emanuele Crialese not only told us a moving story, he also gave viewers a touchstone that allowed them to revisit the history of each of our origins: with the exception of Native Americans, we are all entered America as "strangers". at some point in our stories, and it is humbling to see this movie with that in mind. <br /> <br /> The film opens at the turn of the century in Sicily as a miserable widower, the widower Salvatore Mancuso (Vincenzo Amato) and his brother Angelo (Francesco Casisa) climbs a rocky hill to present his chips to the cross to ask for a sign indicating whether they should continue to struggle for existence on the island or to travel to America, the land of dreams. The mute and deaf son of Mancuso, Pietro (Filippo Pucillo) runs to the top of the hill with postcards he found with images of America (money growing on trees, fruits and vegetables more big as people, etc.), and Salvatore accepts it as a sign that he should move his family to America. After having convinced her reluctant mother Fortunata (Aurora Quattrocchi) and her sisters Rita (Federica De Cola) and Rosa (Isabella Ragonese) to make the trip, he sells his only possessions (two donkeys, goats and rabbits) and the man with the boat arranges their trip by giving the family shoes, appropriate clothing and instructions for boarding a liner as third-class passengers. As the Mancuso family prepares to board, they ask for a photo and behind a painted background, an Englishwoman Lucy / Luce (Charlotte Gainsbourg) appears on the picture as if she were part of this peasant family. Lucy can not board the boat for America without a male escort. <br /> <br /> The journey begins and Luce identifies herself with kindness to the Mancuso family, finally strengthening her safe passage by offering to Salvatore to marry her for more convenience, not out of love when they arrive in America. Through a violent storm and appalling living conditions for the poor, the multitude of third-class passengers survive, bond and arrive at Ellis Island, convinced that their dream of America has been realized. But everyone must pass rigorous physical tests, intimidation tests and even intelligence tests to determine if they can enter America: officials told them that America does not want people who are genetically inferior enter the new world! Each woman must be chosen by a man to marry Ellis Island before being admitted. The way in which the Mancuso family stays united to a rather surprising end is the closing of the story. <br /> <br /> Few of us understand the strict rules and harsh treatment that immigrants face (or at least face the turning point). century) on Ellis Island, and if we do, we have chosen to overwhelm this information. THE GOLDEN DOOR presents the arguments for the struggle of immigrants in a way that affects not only our hearts, but also our acceptance of current immigration legislation. But all political issues aside, THE GOLDEN DOOR is above all a film of immense beauty, exquisite photography, performances deeply felt by a huge cast, as well as a very sensitive story written and performed. It is a film that deserves wide distribution, a film that is worth seeing for everyone. Highly recommended. Grady Harp
