I was 19 or 20 at the time and living in Salt Lake City, Utah, and I still remember the new "Century 21" dome theater. the screen and the packed theater. We felt the excitement of a new preview of a movie. Da da da da da da daada dada ... I can still hear the opening music ringing the trumpet and crashing cymbals. I loved the character game and the filmed views. I know Peter Finch and Luv and Sally had some problems with the sink, but hey, it was a feeling of well-being, are you better with the movie! What I regret is the way they cut the significant heart, showed the cut version and then called the flop. I saw the cut version and I can see that she lost sight of the vision she had in the preview edition. Yes, I grimace a little in front of Peter's efforts to make love through music but, you know, I did not see him that way when I left the theater. when they interrogated us when we left, I regret all the comments I made that could have changed the original. I liked it then and I still see it while I listen to music on my LP. Most of my family members have heard me sing a good part of the soundtrack and I can use the film's monologues in our "what movie is this" games. I would like a director's DVD to be available. It is available on VHS but it is not quite the same. I would like in particular a serious comment on the origins, the struggles and the triumphs of the Lord of the Rings. Difficult people should leave things pretty well alone. Bring it back !!!!
