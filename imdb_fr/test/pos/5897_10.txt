Very happy to see that this excellent movie gets such a rating from IMDB users. The best years of their lives remain the most beautiful cinematographic statement about the veterans who come back from the war and whom I saw. Without a doubt the most beautiful performance of Frederick March, often neglected. In fact, the entire cast is shining, including the music legend Hoagy Carmichael who is treating us all with a subtle version of his classic Lazy River. I would recommend this great movie to anyone who loves movies.
