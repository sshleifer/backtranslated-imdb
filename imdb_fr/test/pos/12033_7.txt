I found parts of this film rather slow, especially the first part; the second part seemed to go much faster, but I do not quite understand why one part was faster than the other. I managed to find it nice. The acting was good, the writing was good (yet vulgar). There was also another good thing: it was easier to understand than the godfather movies. You knew who was on which side, and so on. In short, the film was not so bad.
