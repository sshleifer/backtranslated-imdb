The first time I saw the poster, I was stunned by its tranquility and beauty. Then the city of Istanbul haunts my mind since. <br /> <br /> Not a lot of dialogue, not a lot of music, the entire film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically as a sculpture. It's a landscape. <br /> <br /> In fact, there are many things in the film, but the director deliberately omitted the most dramatic scenes and left them to our imagination, creating a truly flat life. ** (light spoiler) Mahmut's ladylove can be seen crying in the toilet and then going out without saying a word but not their fight; we can see Mahmut accompanying his mother to the hospital but not his fight against the disease. The most dramatic scene in this film is for me Yusuf to burst out laughing at the toy soldier he bought for his niece **. It was then that I was heartbroken to see this boring and lonely life bursting like this. <Br /> <br /> With all the trivia of life, history presents the pure inner world of all the characters, their sadness, their anguish, their loneliness, their regrets ... And as and when as the story unfolded, I end up understanding desperate situation where their emotions are really not an issue if nothing external intervenes, what every loner tries exactly to keep at all costs, especially for an irresponsible artist like Mahmut. <br /> <br /> I just finished my second look. Last night, I squatted in my blanket, put some vodka next to my bed and went through the whole film in a trance. I felt two real lives unfold, one on the outside of the screen, one on the inside of the screen. I felt liberated from all this loneliness and anxiety because the people inside experienced it. I just evaded all these things. <br /> <br /> We can not deny the universal problem of communication and loneliness even puts us far ahead, which becomes a vicious spiral. I bet Mahmut still has not found a way to live in the end. That's why he came out of his room to try to find the answers of the outside world, the cold and the landscape.
