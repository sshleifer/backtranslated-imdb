House of Dracula was manufactured near the end of Universal's horror cycle in the 1940s and I have seen it many times before. <br /> <br /> Crazy doctor, Edelman raises plants for a serum that heals humans. Count Dracula arrives to heal his vampirism and Lawrence Talbot then comes to see if he can heal him to become a werewolf on a full moon. Frankenstein's monster is then discovered and Edelman brings him back to life just as the villagers descend on the castle and set it on fire. Talbot, now healed and one of Edelman's assistants, is safe. <br /> <br /> Like many movies of the genre, we have a hunchbacked assistant and a thunderstorm to keep him moving. <br /> <br /> The cast includes the regulars of Universal horror, Lon Chaney Jr (The werewolf), John Carradine (Frankenstein's House) and Glenn Strange, Frankenstein's monster. With Onslow Stevens (Them!), Lionel Atwill (The Vampire Bat) and Martha O'Driscoll also. <br /> <br /> Dracula's home is a must-see for all old horror fans. Very funny. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3 out of 5 stars.
