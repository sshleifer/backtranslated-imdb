Surface was one of the few truly unique shows on TV from last season. Honestly, I can say that I changed my schedule so I could watch every episode at home. Tons of action, suspense, science fiction, etc. <br /> <br /> The story was about a boy who found an egg hatched in a sea creature. The same sea creature that killed the main character's brother and the woman (oceanographer) had seen. Most people think it's a deadly killing machine, but the one that came out of the egg was very nice. <br /> <br /> The only problem is that NBC canceled it. We will never know what will happen ... Hopefully science fiction or another channel will catch it.
