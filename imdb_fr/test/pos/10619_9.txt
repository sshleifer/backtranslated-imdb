Prepare for "The Pianist" from Trip to Haneke ... The psychological illness of the main character, beautifully interpreted by Huppert, exceeds all the limits that you could expect. The most amazing part is that you start to feel compassion for the character Erika. Trash-Sexuality (no nude scenes, however), perversion, masochism, incestuous relationships ... Haneke gives us a rude meal, heavy to digest; Sometimes the only way to escape the extremism of some scenes is to start laughing. The "staging" is perhaps not the most attractive part of the film, it presents obvious Austro-Germanic, sometimes Scandinavian: static, long scenes, but never boring. The settings of Vienna, the French language used, make the whole thing look like a European mix. Permanent permanent music Background (Schubert) is beautifully chosen. First and foremost, Cannes' two best actors awards are well deserved: one of the greatest performances of the year by one of France's greatest actresses.
