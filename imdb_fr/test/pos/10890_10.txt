We all played Halo, Socom, GTA, Resi, etc., but none of them can resist GE007. The game itself is great. I literally burned my N64 playing this great game, with Zelda OOT. This game alone has built the mold which is essential for all modern shooters. in addition, the multiplayer is great. Story mode deserves to be played a hundred times and more. This is a great game for when your board and you just want to pull up some people and there are endless unlocked abilities. (tricks, aztec, egyptian, god knows how many multiplayer charries, and the three difficulties as well as the famous difficulty '007' Our modern games are awesome, but when you play this game, you feel like a few others And with the online capabilities of new shooter games, we rarely see this old style of match-to-death vs. 2. And when we do it, it's not nearly as good as this game and when you're bored with history There are innumerable mysteries, problems and Easter eggs. <br /> <br /> This is certainly one of the greatest shooting games of all time.
