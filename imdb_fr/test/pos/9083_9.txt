This film is great from start to finish and talks about a group of medical students coming together and literally literally murdering each other, stopping their hearts and then reviving. They then look for what is happening from the "imminent death" experiments. As each goes through the experience, they are haunted by their deepest fears that seem to materialize as reality. This ranges from dead children with hockey sticks to deceased fathers who seem to be upstairs. <br /> <br /> The cast is top notch and Oliver Platt is hilarious in one of the best roles in his career. I'm not a big fan of Keifer Sutherland but he does a great job. It's a movie that I can watch again and again!
