Warner Brothers produced this 3D extravaganza that was the greatest commercial success of the westerns in 1953. Guy Madison leads a group of soldiers and soldiers to rescue two white women held by Indians, which is essentially all he There is to see in this film. The 3D format was in its early days as a Hollywood gadget to compete with the growing popularity of home television, and the effects work very well here. The rescuers leave with the ladies and are pursued by the Indians until the white men settle in front of an island in a stream bed. Indian weapons arrive uninterruptedly in front of the public and a jet of tobacco juice for a rattlesnake is thrown for good measure. Madison was very popular on television as Wild Bill Hickock and is good as a displaced cattle rancher to whom the army entrusts his thankless task. Despite all the polishing and presentation of the film, the film was made in just three days.
