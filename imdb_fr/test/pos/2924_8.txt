Few people realize it, but there was a world literature in the ancient world before the arrival of the Greeks. In addition to the literary remains contained in the "Old Testament" of the Jews, there were considerable works of Mesopotamia and Egypt. The summit of the first was religious poetry and "the epic of Gilgamesh". The Egyptians have published many poems, but the adventure story of a traveler and a doctor called "The Story Of Sinuhe" has been added. It is from this work (in fact a fragment of which we do not know the end) that the novel "The Egyptian" comes from. <br /> <br /> The story is unique (like the movie). "The Egyptian" was a bestseller in the early 1950s and Darryl Zanuck decided to try his luck. Yes, he wanted a showcase for his girlfriend Bella Darvi in ​​the role of Nefer, as well as for the rest of the cast (Victor Mature, Edmund Purdom, Peter Ustinov, Michael Wilding and Gene Tierney), but he was aware of the fact that these films rarely made a big ticket. This can be considered as an example of Zanuck trying something different. <br /> <br /> The number of films dealing with ancient Egypt is very small. "The Land of the Pharaohs", "The Egyptian", "The Ten Commandments" (both versions of De Mille), "Moses", "Saint Moses!", "Cleopatra", "The Mummy" (all versions) , "The King Scorpion". If there are 20 films about ancient Egypt, it's great. But "the Egyptian" is unique. While the second "Ten Commandments" deals with Ramses the Great (Pharoah Rameses II - Yul Brynner) and his father Seti I (Cedric Hardwicke), and that the films on Cleopatra treat him, few other names in Egypt old appear in the movie. The largest Egyptian pharaoh was Thutmose III, which conquered most of the known Middle East from the 1470 BC period. J. - C. or then No film on him appeared, any more than on his predecessor usurper, the first woman sovereign of the history, Hatshepsut. But the only known pharaoh who attempted a religious revolution that approached what Jews (and later Christians) attempted - a type of monotheism - is the subject of "The Egyptian." It's Pharoah Akhnaton. <br /> <br /> In reality, Akhnaton practiced a personal form of monotheism that was not intended for public consumption. But this angered the priests who worshiped Amon rather than Aton. Because of our uncertain historical records (although Akhnaton's official archives - the letters "Tel-el-Amana" - are quite complete as long as they survive), we do not know if Pharaoh was killed or not during a coup in a palace. However, he died. A younger brother or one of his sons succeeded him. His name is better remembered than any other Pharaoh except Ramses: Tutankhamun. <br /> <br /> This movie is actually pretty good. Wilding is a good Akhnaton, too weak to be as effective as a so-called religious reformer. Maturity is good as the ambitious Horemheb (and - apart from the film - the future pharaoh finally crowned with success). Tierney and Purdom are doing well in their main roles and Ustinov is a good friend of Purdom. Ms. Darvi is also very satisfied. John Carridine is a philosophical tomb robber. The film certainly deserves to be viewed, as it is one of the few attempts to show part of the history and culture of ancient Egypt.
