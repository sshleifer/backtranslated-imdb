Upon entering this movie, I knew two things about it. I knew it was a real extreme film and I knew it was a bit artistic. Both of them attract me by their own right, but once gathered, this can be truly unique. And it was damn good, without a doubt, unique. As I said above, it's an artistic film. The way they used an intense sound, it reminded me a lot of the film Aronofsky. Visually, I did not see anything like it. Cinematography and lighting were very well done. The film uses visuals and sounds seriously better than anything I've seen in a long time. Especially if you consider the experience of these young filmmakers (20 years old), you really have to take their hat off. <br /> <br /> The film is not easy to describe or even discuss. There is no real story. You could say that it revolves around the right and left sides of the brain and how they control your life. These are four segments, or four ideas driven by visual and auditory extremes. There are people who speak and hear, but it is essentially a non-talking film. <br /> <br /> The first segment is the shortest and revolves around a naked body and an eye. Try to guess what's going on? The second segment is my favorite. He is a brother and a sister (who looks a bit like Sarah Silverman, but with bigger breasts). The brother is crazy and the sister is a bit of a whore. I would say it's the most extreme of all segments and the most well done. The gore effects in this one were great. The third segment is organized around a group of naked people sexed with mother earth. This is probably considered the weakest of the group, but he is always smart and well done. The fourth segment is probably the strongest of the film and I would also say the deepest. For my part, I will have to look at this several times to understand what is really said. I know he approaches Christianity in a way that would probably make your mother feign or vomit ?? Try it. <br /> <br /> I have been recommended unconscious cruelty, and I am proud to say so. is now in my film collection. It is extreme, violent, bloody, very sexual and surprisingly pretty that causes thought. The next line I'm about to say has been used in almost every criticism I've read for this movie. "This film is not for everyone." Is not that the truth? If you like extreme movies and / or if you're just a movie lover and want to see something different, see it. 8 1/2 out of 10
