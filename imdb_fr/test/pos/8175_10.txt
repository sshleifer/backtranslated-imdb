A very good movie. <br /> <br /> A great love story. A lot of sword fighting. Huge battle scenes. Heroes and villains. Real history. <br /> <br /> Few people in the West know the history of China. Chin Zchaundi founded China. The country indeed bears his name. Some know the recently discovered terracotta army. It is a historic epic of how it ended the period of conflicting states and the unification of China. He founded a dynasty that lasted only 14 years, but it was immediately replaced by the Han dynasty that had always defined Chinese civilization. <br /> <br /> Chin (or the king of Zheng, as he was known before founding the empire) was about contemporary with Scipio, Hannibal and Fabius in the West. The parallel domination of the Roman world (the western and eastern worlds) was achieved without a single dominant personality like Chin. It would not be a century before the West produced Caesar - the most comparable Western figure. <br /> <br /> Chin is shown very well at the beginning, but he evolves over the course of the film into a ruthless despot. The story only records the pitiless despot side, but the friendly start leaves room for the character's actual development during this long movie. The famous story of the meeting with the assassin is as true as an anecdote two thousand years old. Gong Li is adorable. She is the emotional core of the story. All this makes a good movie.
