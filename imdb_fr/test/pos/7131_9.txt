Dead Gentlemen Productions made a film with amazing production values ​​given their budget. Anyone who has ever played a role-playing game, especially a fantastic RPG (they play Dungeons and Dragons in the movie), will love this movie. Bright performances all around - especially with regard to the dual nature of the principles, playing their players and characters. Anyone who has ever filmed or starred in a student film will appreciate the work and love they dedicate to this project. This film (and its sequel) is to fantastic movies and role playing what Blazing Saddles is to westerns - a parody of the highest order. I only have a few minor complaints about the movie itself, none of which prevents me from buying the DVD as soon as it is available (more than 6 weeks - I count the days): <br /> <br /> 1. When Lodge tells Joanna of his intention to join the gaming group, he hands him a copy of the Dungeons and Dragons Player's Handbook and tells him "it will tell you everything you need to know." The camera spends too much time shooting a book and the moment really seemed like an advertisement. <br /> <br /> 2. The jokes are hilarious, but they seem unequally distributed in the film. The last third of the film, after the almost continuous barrage of visual and verbal humor that precedes it, slows a little, as if the story caught up with jokes. Strange, but Blazing Saddles always struck me the same way. . . and I also like this movie. <br /> <br /> One of the narrative assets of the story is the unresolved nature of the romantic subplot. Will Joanna become the CEO's girlfriend? Will she go back to Cass? Or will the three maintain a platonic friendship, reinforced by the role play camaraderie? (Yes, it sounds absurd, but there are some saccharinic moments, especially when Cass and Lodge "make up" at the end.) But the film spans a week: in terms of human relations, it was impossible to answer to these questions in a general way. the week. The fact that the characters 'relationships remain indefinite seems to me better than the more classic choices that we see in most movies, as when the girl takes her prince and they settle in the castle, or that the prince s' sinks in the North Atlantic after three times nothing, hours tedious and predictable. The writers really seem to understand the psychology of the characters well and you can see that the characters (players and characters of the player) change during the film, but not suddenly, or incredibly. <br /> <br /> I would like to hear more wisdom from Brother Silence. "The man who stands out in the dark is ... fluorescent."
