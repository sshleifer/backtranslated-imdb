Aaah ... The Thing. <br /> <br /> See a horror movie in which not only each character of more than thirty years, but distinctly attractive, makes a refreshing change and reminds me of the distant times the actors were chosen for their talent and their ability to interpret realistic characters, rather than for their teenager appeal on a magazine cover. And Carpenter chooses a production designer and a filmmaker who can create realistic environments rather than highly stylized parodies. And there is no end "twist" gimmicky, nor appearance of celebrity, nor pseudo-romantic subplot lame. <br /> <br /> And I REALLY lack physical effects on the set; with all those 20-year-olds looking for crazy new ideas with blood and latex tubs and the first animatronics. In the 5 years between 1979 and 1984, we saw Alien, The Elephant Man, Poltergeist, The Howling, an American werewolf in London, The Thing, The Wolf Company, A nightmare on Elm Street ... What a time for the horror effects! And do not throw me into the death of matte painting. The work of matte in this film is beautiful and transparent. <br /> <br /> What do we have now? Third-class CGI, former video directors and professional stylists, who make even horror movies look like glossy MTV videos. <br /> <br /> Now I'm going to use Netflix "The Howling".
