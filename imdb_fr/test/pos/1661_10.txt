There are not many films that I would describe as perfect, but Rififi is perfect. No other film has come close to that, before or after. The plot is simple, but absorbs you. It never fails to surprise me how amazing the film is every time you watch it. You care about all the characters, even if they are bank robbers, because they are presented as human beings with all their problems and faults. It is difficult to imagine another actor than Jean Servais in the role of Tony the Stephanois. When the team members talk about what they are going to do with their money and finally get Tony, his response and the expression on his face speaks volumes. While the 30-minute sequence of heist is the most famous part of the movie (and rightly so), the movie gets better after. shootout, but instead inserted a big decisive score during Tony's last run towards his destiny. To say that if Dassin, an American director, had not been blacklisted in Hollywood and forced to work in France, this masterpiece of cinema would never have been conceived as such. It certainly would not have been so good if it had been done like an American movie. What Dassin had to endure was absolutely horrible, but he did his greatest work because of that, in the interest of all. I fall for the next remake of Al Pacino. Most of the stop movies since Rififi have already borrowed somehow. There is no reason to redo this masterpiece other than money. Leave the classics alone!
