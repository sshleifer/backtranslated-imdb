This almost perfect cinematic interpretation of Edith Nesbit's children's novel follows the lives of Roberta (Bobbie), Phyllis and Peter, as well as their mother, after their father was unfairly accused of treason and sent to prison. They will live in an almost uninhabitable house in the country that is near a railway line ?? Mom writes stories to earn enough money for food and candles, while kids spend most of their time around the station and, in particular, inviting a particular train to "send their love to her father ". <br /> <br /> Always an engaging and intelligent novel, the characters come alive under the enlightened guidance of Lionel Jeffries (better known as a good actor). Jenny Agutter plays Bobbie, while Sally Thomsett and Gary Warren are his sister and brother. Their mother is Dinah Sheridan, while the other memorable characters are played by Bernard Cribbins (Perks the Railwayman) and William Mervyn (the old gentleman of the train). <br /> "The children of the railroad" is nice entertainment from another age, but does its job wonderfully. When we watch Bobbie grow up with the concerns of an absent parent struggling with her own needs, both to be alone and to have fun, we can only rejoice when the events unfold at the end of the table. All along we have an idea of ​​time and place ?? whether it's steam trains, the university paper chase or red flannel petticoats worn by girls (and used to prevent a disaster!).
