The best thing - and it's very good - about The Black Castle is that it's a black-and-white gothic grapple from the 1940s featuring a crazy and deadly count that was created in 1952. The star is apparently the British actor Richard Greene. an able leader who reminds me of an earlier version of Roger Moore. The villain is a crazy count played by Stephen McNally, who does a credible job, except when he is called to laugh maniacally. Boris Karloff plays a decisive role in the secondary role of an old doctor who might or might not be the salvation of our hero. <br /> <br /> We are in the middle of the 18th century in Austria and Sir Ronald Burton (Greene) is determined to find out what happened to two close friends. They disappeared in the vicinity of Count Karl von Bruno's castle (McNally), at the end of the Black Forest. It seems that Sir Ronald and his friends helped defeat a brutal plan of von Bruno in Africa, three years ago, involving slavery and ivory. The count was left not only with a check but with a scar on his face and a black stain he now carries to cover a ruined eye. von Bruno has vowed revenge, and it seems he may have been partially successful. So, under a false name, Sir Ronald organizes a count's hunting invitation, and we ride in a carriage through a dark journey of storm and howling wolves to the count's castle. It is an imposing mass of turrets and stone corridors, dark staircases, large chimneys ... and scary passages leading to dark cells of the dungeon, a torture chamber and a large pit full of crocodiles. It is also occupied by the charming and sensitive wife of the count, Elga (Paula Corday, sometimes called Rita Corday), and by the two close friends of the count, played by these two known actors of the 50s and specialized in slime. in costume, John Hoyt and Michael Ansara. There is a dangerous leopard hunt, forbidden kisses, restless servants, crisp wooden signs and swaying in the cold wind and poison in a cup. Dr. Meissen (Karloff) has a special medicine bottle that will slow down body functions so much that death seems to have occurred. The risk is that ... well, when the person wakes up ten hours later, she'd better hope she's not already nailed in her coffin. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, despite all the clich√©s, the Black Castle continues to move forward happily. The film is taken seriously, but it is done with enough skill to keep our interest even if we find ourselves sitting with a smile while we watch. It is even reassuring to realize that there are strong echoes of The Most Dangerous Game. When Burton realizes how crazy von Bruno is, he becomes even more determined to get von Bruno to blame. And, of course, he fell in love with Elga. Von Bruno, mad with revenge but clever and capable, is a man who loves hunting and who is engorged by the killing. The second creative rule of Hollywood has always been: "If you want to fly, steal the best." The first creative rule, of course, is: "If you want to fly, steal it among the best and then turn it into liverwurst." Black Castle is a good piece of Austrian braunschweiger.
