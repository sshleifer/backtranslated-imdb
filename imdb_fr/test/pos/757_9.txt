If you like the drive-in cheeze of the early 70's, you'll love this one. How can you go wrong by projecting a low-budget movie about bloodshed in an insane asylum? You can not! Madmen and sharp objects are always an entertaining combination. <br /> <br /> The film was shot in someone's house for about $ 320.65. For me, it's just fun advertising to watch this stuff. The gore is a little soft compared to others like this, but there is enough to keep us happy like bloodthirsty lunatics (like me). That is not the case here. The characters are fun enough to make each image enjoyable. There is never a boring moment from start to finish. The climax of the mind is finally incredible. I liked it so much that after the end credits, I watched it a second time. It is an absolute must for any self-respecting and self-respecting horror nut. <br /> <br /> 9.5 / 10 on the Drive-in Freak-O-Meter ... mandatory visit <br /> <br /> Yes, I love you..I love you ... take now your Thorazine and put back your clothes ... please .... 8)
