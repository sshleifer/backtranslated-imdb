James Cagney, racketeer and political advisor, becomes assistant commissioner of correctional services and goes to a reform school for boys. The problem is that Cagney is not part of it, he really wants to make a difference in the lives of children because he comes from an environment like his. <br /> <br /> The villain of the play is Dudley Digges who is a sanctimonious grafter and hypocrite to boot. One of the subtitles of the mayor of hell conspiracy is that these children are mostly immigrants and those who judge them and hold positions of power are those who are here a few generations. Note on the mess stage while Digges offers a thank you prayer for the food they are going to receive, Digges eats well, but the kids enjoy a quality you would not give to your pet. <br /> <br /> Cagney has his own problems in the city with some of his henchmen and he has to do it. This puts Digges back in charge and prepares the film for its climax. <br /> <br /> The mayor of hell was a typical product of the studio of the working class. And since it was before the Code, it sometimes becomes horrible. Crime School, with Humphrey Bogart and the Dead End Kids, was a more disinfected remake. <br /> <br /> Although Cagney plays the lead role, as Madge Evans, the school nurse, the honors go to Dudley Digges. Hard to believe that the same man could portray the drunkard, but kindly, the surgeon of the one-legged ship in Mutiny on the Bounty. But Digges is an excellent player and a joy to watch in every movie in which he is. <br /> <br /> This film is not presented often because of the racial and ethnic stereotypes it represents. Many minorities would be offended today. It's still a good movie. <br /> <br /> It is interesting to note that the movie Sleepers came out a few years ago and was addressing some of the same issues. I guess movies about Reform schools never change.
