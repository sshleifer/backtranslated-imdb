Police squad! (1982) was a fun show that ended too early. But I guess it was run before it became too repetitive and funny like so many American TV shows. The geniuses behind this fun show were the teams of Zucker, Abrahams and Zucker. Since her first role in the comic series AIRPLANE !, Leslie Nielsen has found a new acting career. In this short life TV series he had the chance to play the hetero in a crazy comedy once again. The weird titles of each episode revealed the end. But Lieutenant Drebrin (Leslie Nielsen) has had so many strange cases that you have to see them to believe them. <br /> <br /> Too bad they never published this the D.V.D. If a series were to be republished, it would be that one. A whole new generation is waiting for this show! <br /> <br /> Highly recommended!
