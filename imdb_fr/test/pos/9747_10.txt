The standard bearer of all series of films, the brave guy - Flash Gordon - against Bad Guy - Ming the Merciless. Although the special effects seem horrendous by today's standards, they were first-class for 1936. But the essence of the story is the battle between Flash's Earthman Flash (Buster Crabbe) and Emperor Ming of Mongo ( Charles Middleton). Crabbe and Middleton are great in their games. And the secondary characters playing Dale Arden, Dr. Zarkov, Princess Aura, Prince Barin, Vulcan and the others are all very good. This series is far superior to the 1980 film, essentially because Crabbe is far superior to Sam J. Jones in the role of Flash Gordon. <br /> <br /> This series is the standard bearer of all series. No questions about it.
