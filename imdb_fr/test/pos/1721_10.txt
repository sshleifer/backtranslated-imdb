First of all, I was a fan of the series when my PBS station started broadcasting it in 1981. I learned a lot about the series and about the people who participated or contributed to it. <br /> <br /> This last article of Doctor Who impressed me a lot. The original series, the so-called classic series, has been ridiculed by bad effects and / or unstable decorations. Well, that's not true anymore. The special effects are great, but what's even better is the writing. You will have the opportunity to learn more about our dear doctor and perhaps one of the reasons why he loves the planet Earth so much. Without revealing too much, it's a very interesting series to watch. Christopher Eccelston has brought one side of the Doctor that we will never see, a bitter and angry but yet kind face at the same time. <br /> <br /> TO SEE ABSOLUTELY!
