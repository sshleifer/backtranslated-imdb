I do not know why the other comment on this movie was so negative, but I loved this movie. I am a student of Asian art with a particular love for art, culture and Korean history. I thought this movie was a very controversial and interesting character to life. Jang Seung-up is one of the most famous Korean artists and perhaps the most revered. Given the tumult of the time he painted and his own conflicting nature, it is amazing that he produces as much work, in as many styles and with as much talent. This film honors his talent while casting a direct look at his erratic and somewhat self-destructive personality. In my opinion, the cinematography was beautiful, many outdoor panoramic shots looked like Korean landscape paintings (which I found a pretentious rather than "too artistic") and I think Choi Min-sik represented Jang Seun-up with a necessary intensity. and unpredictability. I highly recommend this film to art and cinema lovers.
