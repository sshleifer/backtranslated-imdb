I understand that "Checking Out" will probably be released in US theaters in the US in June 2006 and on DVD in November 2006. My recommendation is not to miss "Checking Out" !! This comic film will entertain everyone, who will relate to the characters, family relationships and multiple social issues described. "Checking Out" will make you laugh from start to finish with a sharp and intelligent humor integrated in almost all ranges, and will also make you cry poignantly and positively. <br /> <br /> The subject of suicide is treated in a comic manner, which can also help people who consider it to understand the impact that this act can have on those affected by their lives and those who love them. Let's hope that "Checking Out" can have a positive impact and prevent people considering suicide from doing so, especially among 16-25 year olds with the highest suicide rate in the United States. <br /> <br /> The script is beautifully written, perfectly molded and loaded with synchronicity and significant flashbacks over time, whose meaning becomes more evident throughout the film and especially at the end. I believe that the script deserves an Oscar nomination for "Best Screenplay, Playing a Movie" (the film Phoenix awarded "Checking Out" with the "Best Screenplay"). <br /> <br /> The cast is packed with great actors who are doing their own thing and have a long history of exceptional performance, nominations and wins. I think Peter Falk's performance in "Checking Out" is worthy of an Oscar nomination and is the most challenging and diverse career of his career. The performance and chemistry of Laura San Giacomo with Peter Falk as her father are masterful and have been awarded at the Palm Beach International Film Festival by the "Best Actress Award". <br /> <br /> Even the teenage characters of the film shine and Dan Byrd (Movies: A story of Cinderalla with Hilary Duff, 3 nominations for Young Artist Awards, Won 1) and Mary Elizabeth Winstead (TV: Monster Island, Wolf Lake, Passions, Affected by an Angel, 2 Young Star Nominations). <br /> <br /> Director Jeff Hare and producer Mark Lane are the perfect developers of the characters, their interrelations and the plot of this fun, entertaining and complex storyline. <br /> <br /> The editing of the film keeps the rhythm of the film moving fast, only slowing down appropriately in poignant scenes, so that the audience never loses interest from the beginning to the end. <br /> <br /> Do not miss this movie that you can take the whole family to see and everyone will enjoy it.
