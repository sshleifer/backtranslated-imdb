I came across this movie on DVD only by chance thanks to a Blockbuster rental. Voyage to the Planets is an excellent two-hour documentary / drama about a future "grand tour" of the solar system. This film tells the story of astronauts during a trip to Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn and Pluto. > The special effects are excellent for a TV show. I found the actors credible as astronauts. The situations presented are for the most part plausible, and you will learn a lot about the science of planets and spaceflight! Only two minor complaints: I found some situations and dialogues somewhat disordered at the same time. In addition, I'm not sure that only one crew and one ship would be sent on one mission to see all these destinations at the same time. More than likely, visits to Venus, Mars, Jupiter, etc. would / will be separate missions. <br /> <br /> They did not try to skimp on this show with production values. The scenes of Venus and Mars were actually shot in the deserts of northern Chile - the driest region in the world and a powerful indicator of the Martian landscape. Sequences of weightlessness were filmed in a Russian transport plane. The producers could have played with one or the other of these studios using studios and CGI, but by choosing the real thing. <br /> <br /> I would like to mention in particular the wonderful music composed for this film. The thrilling theme of Don Davis is the first thing that worries you at the beginning of the film, as the magnificent Pegasus plan passes in front of the screen and David Suchet announces, "It's man's destiny to explore the stars. ... ". <br /> Watching it on a small TV screen is a regret I have. What a pleasure to see this in a movie theater or, better yet, an IMAX presentation!
