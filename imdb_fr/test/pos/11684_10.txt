Spheeris must be one of the best music documentaries of all time. And as far as I know, it's also the only one that focuses on L.A.'s punk explosion of the early eighties. It's all there: not only big bands, such as Black Flag, Fear, X, The Germs, whose names may not tell you much today, but whose influence on alternative rock can not to be overrated, but also about the promoters, the media and first and foremost the public - the punks - are all described in such a way as to make you laugh, shudder and gasp about energy, anger and fury that their youth puts in their music. Where is it today? The eighties may have fizzled out when they turned to traditional music, but the underground was rocking. If you need proof, look at Fear's performance in Decline. Incomparable. A good film! How is it that it is not available on vid, LD or DVD? P.S. Tracking Decline Pt. II is hilarious too
