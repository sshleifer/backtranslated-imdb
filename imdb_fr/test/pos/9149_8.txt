This film is a good start for novices who have never watched a "silent movie" and for those who believe that the quality of cinema has started with the efforts of their generations. They hurt themselves by not expanding their horizons. The silent film is an art of playing in a pantomime that differs from the sound movie and the scene. He can defend himself autonomously. THE BELOVED ROGUE (1927) United Artists is a fictional story of the relations of the French poet Fran√ßois Villon and King Louis XI. Through "Villons", King Louis "will defeat his enemy" the Duke of Burgundy, minimize the feudal system and establish the king at the head of the state and the beginnings of modern France. <br /> <br /> The cast is exceptional, led by JOHN BARRYMORE (yes, Drew's grandfather). For those who only remember him for the decaying actor "Larry Renault" in DINNER AT EIGHT (1933) or the ham in THE INVISABLE WOMEN (1940), it will be a revelation. In shape, cut with the "Great Profile" still prominently, it controls the screen. CONRAD VEIDT is his co-star in his first American film with his interpretation of "Louis XI", "cadaverous spider". It's a duel of titans acting, each not letting the other one inch. The actor and dwarf character ANGELO ROSSITTO in his first film, his latest film, MAD MAX BEYOND THUNDERDOME (1985), is an anecdote. There are other actors of character who would continue in the sound and who are easily captured. <br /> <br /> United Artists spared no effort for this beautiful production supervised by WILLIAM CAMERON MENZIES. The costumes, accessories and sets are well made and are not exaggerated, as in the productions of DOUGLAS FAIRBANKS. There is a touch of reality here. The DVD copy we watched of "Delta Entertainment" comes from a good master. Although not restored, his musical soundtrack was clear and the printing suffered only from annoying black spots (stains) and collapses. The only major damage at the end of the last reel of water. 'Kino' also offers a higher quality edition because it performs major restorations on its prints. Best check with them. In our opinion, this is a "must", especially if you do not have "silence" in your collection. This is a good place to start.
