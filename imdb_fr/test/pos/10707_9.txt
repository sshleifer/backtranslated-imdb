For once, a story of hope has brought to light the tragic reality our young people are facing. Favela Rising takes us into a frightening, dangerous and unjust world and shows through a beautiful color and moving music how a man and his devoted friends choose not to accept this world and change it through action and art. An entertaining, interesting, emotional, aesthetically beautiful film. I also showed this film to many high school students who all lived in neighborhoods plagued by poverty and gun violence, and they fell in love with protagonist Anderson. I recommend this movie to all ages over 13 (due to subtitles and some images of death) from all walks of life.
