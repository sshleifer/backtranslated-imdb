I described this movie as surprising ... it's true in many ways. The material (black man wrongly accused), the characters (the people you expect to be stereotypes often display unusual attitudes during the film), the production ... film, especially for his time (1949). The only disadvantages are the sometimes corny dialogue and sometimes high moral positions. <br /> <br /> But if you have trouble when you do not plan to watch a movie, you could end up like me - stay awake in the middle of the night to see what's going on. <br /> <br />
