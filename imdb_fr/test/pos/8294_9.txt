The only copy of CHIKAMATUS MONOGATARI I could find was abysmal - I could hardly look at it. It's a shame because it's one of Mizoguchi's greatest movies.

As always with Mizoguchi, there is a delicate tone of challenge, and - bad impression outside of that - I was very happy. As with all Mizoguchi movies, I look forward to the release of a restored DVD - whenever it happens ...
