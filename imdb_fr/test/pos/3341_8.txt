This film was originally published as a mild "X", apparently with explicit sex removed. Later, the producers "gave in" (felt the money) and reissued it with the restored excised scenes (apparently only about 3 minutes). I guess since Kristine was older, it was held against her and her promising career ended. It all depends on timing (Pam Anderson's career) - but Ronald Reagan was responsible for Kristine's debacle (we had not heard about Nancy Reagan's business), Bill Clinton and Monica Lewinski were in full swing at the "exit" from Pam. <br /> <br /> Sex is just the icing on the cake, both versions please. This naughty musical is well above the others that came out at the same time.
