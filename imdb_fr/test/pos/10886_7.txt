This game has cartoon graphics, not a lot of violence and really short levels - so why do people say it's so brilliant?!? Because he always holds your attention, he captivates you and refuses to let you go! You will try for hours to try to find this damn flight recorder, to try to find a way to enter the room without alerting the guards, etc.! The levels are only short when you know what to do. Until then, you will spend hours trying to find where to find connections, where to find helicopters, etc. And you will have fun while doing it! Well worth a rent!
