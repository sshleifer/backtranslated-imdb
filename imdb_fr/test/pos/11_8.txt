I was anxious to see The Guardian, but when I entered the theater, I was not really in the mood to do it at that time. It's a bit like the Olive Garden - I like it, but I have to be in the right state of mind to fully enjoy it. <br /> <br /> I do not really know what has cooled my mind. The caravans looked beautiful, but the water theme was a bad flashback to Kevin Costner's latest film about the subject - Waterworld. Moreover, despite the promise of Ashton Kutcher in The Butterfly Effect, I'm still not completely sold for him. Something about this guy annoys me. Probably to do with his simian features. <br /> <br /> It took about two minutes for my fears to calm down and my hesitations to disappear. The film immediately puts us at the heart of a tense rescue mission, and I was much tighter than Kenny Rogers's orange facelift. My concerns briefly resonated during Kutcher's initial appearance because of too much effort to describe him as ridiculously cold and rebellious. Sunglasses, a toothpick hard in the mouth and a smirk that would be the pride of George Clooney? Yes, we get it. I was totally ready to hate him. <br /> <br /> But then he had to leave and perform a pretty strong performance and force me to soften my blows. <br /> <br /> You know, monkey man! Efficiently blending exciting rescue scenes, drama, humor and solid acting, The Guardian is easily a movie that I dare say will please most viewers. You can challenge his clich√©s, his predictability and his rare moments of overcooked sappiness, but none of that detracts from the value of entertainment. <br /> <br /> I had the bad feeling that the pace would slow too much at the start of Costner training young people, but on the contrary, workouts are perhaps the most interesting aspect of the film. Coast Guard lifeguards are heroes whose stories have never been told on the big screen. So I feel what's going on inside and how difficult it is to make it very informative and a great way to present these things to the public. group appreciated. <br /> <br /> Do you have what it takes to be a savior swimmer? Think about it, you will be able to participate in dangerous missions in cold, dark and agitated waters, then fight against disorientation, exhaustion, hypothermia and lack of oxygen, while trying to help the stranded and panicked that depend on you. for their survival. And if all that is not enough, sometimes you can not save everyone, so you have to make the difficult decision of who lives and who dies. <br /> <br /> Man, who wants all this responsibility? Not me! I did not know what it really looked like for these guys, and who would have thought I'd have a film from Ashton Kutcher / Kevin Costner to thank for the education? <br /> <br /> The Guardian not only pays a remarkable tribute to this rare breed of hero, but is also lucky to entertain his paying customers. <br /> <br /> THE GIST <br /> <br /> Movie lovers who want to immerse themselves in a daring rescue mission in the middle of the ocean might want to give The Guardian a chance. I saw it for free, but if I had paid, I would have felt that I had it for my money.
