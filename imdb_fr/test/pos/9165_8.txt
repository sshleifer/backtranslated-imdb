The Italian concept of "sprezzatura" was the grace and nonchalance of the social mores that led to success in love, as described in the 16th century textbook "The Courtier". The film "Hitch" deserves to be watched to embody the concept "sprezzzatura" in the dynamic performance of Will Smith. <br /> <br /> Smith plays the character of Alex "Hitch" Hitchens, professional dating consultant. to those who lack luck and confidence. The best scenes are those where Hitch leads Albert, extremely shy and clumsy, on his quest to conquer the heart of a social socialite in New York and Hitch's attraction to Sara and her surprise on her visit to Ellis Island. In these scenes, Kevin James and Eva Mendes support Smith. But this film is animated by the charm and seductive personality of Smith. <br /> <br /> From start to finish, Smith goes beyond the average scenario to make "Hitch" an eminently watchable and entertaining film. I do not believe there is another actor working today who is able to deliver the charisma and perfect timing with the comedic moments like Will Smith in this movie. And his secret is in the "sprezzatura"!
