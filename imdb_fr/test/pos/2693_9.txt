This is one of the funniest shows on television today. He hits the mark 99% of the time. Usually, after watching a sitcom a few years later, actors become caricatural, as if they were trying to become the beloved characters they play. In my opinion, these actors have remained faithful to their roles. Chemistry is still there, the writing has not diminished and I can not wait to watch it. The family dynamic still seems real and the situations after all this time are not so dark that it suggests that the writers are plunging their efforts into an empty bag trying to keep the show one more season. This is one of the few shows I watch without the remote in my hand for fast switching.
