I was a little surprised to see all the hateful comments here. Of course, this is not the best children's show, but do people keep scorning Barney so much after fifth grade? <br /> <br /> OK, everyone hates Barney. Okay, I think his voice and his songs are annoying. Ok, he's a little scary and strange. I'm fourteen, so I know enough. But here is the thing. Kids? They LOVE this show. <br /> <br /> When I was a little boy of two or three years, my parents spent more time chasing me at home than they did anything else. Nothing could hold my attention for more than ten minutes. Look at it, toddlers are like that. Even the most patient can not sit long enough to give their parents a break. There is too much to do and see and explore, too many problems to overcome. <br /> <br /> And then came Barney. I do not know exactly what it is about this purple dinosaur so fun for children, but they certainly like it. I know I did. I was addicted to the show and wanted to watch it again and again. Yes, the songs have somehow made my parents crazy, but to be able to watch their children learn and be excited by something that can really grab their attention, it's worth it. I learned my ABCs and 123, magic words and brushing teeth. I had grown up five or six years, of course, but at that time at least I was a little more patient and gave my parents a break. the growing Barney phase, to the delight of their mother. I know what keeps Barney on the air. He entertains. Of course, there are Big Bird, Ernie and Oscar, and they are very good too. But at the toddler stage, it seems that more and more children prefer the big singing dinosaur. And that's enough for me.
