I absolutely loved this movie. For me, the best reason to see this lies in the stark contrast between legal dramas such as "Boston Legal", "Ally McBeal" or even "LA Law". It's reality. The law is not BS, won during a final argument or by a ridiculous defense that you shoot from your buttocks, like the "Chewbacca Defense" on South Park.) The work of good lawyers - not the stereotype of shyster , who use all their skills to fix it. It will do more to restore your faith in humanity than any film by Frank Capra or TOKILL A MOCKINGBIRD. And most importantly, I cried. During the movie, during the featurette included at the end of the DVD - it's amazing. Wonderful film wonderfully done. Thank God, the filmmakers have succeeded.
