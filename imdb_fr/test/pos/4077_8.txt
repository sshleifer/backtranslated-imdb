I watched an NFL game and started surfing during a break and found it on one of the HBO-type channels. I missed the start, but when I started watching Deadly Voyage, the clicker was put in place and was not even thought of before the credits. You will find yourself rooting against the villains and the edge of your La-Z-Boy throughout this one. If you have the opportunity, take the time to look at it. From time to time, I think the cable company needs to remove my Movie channels, but when you come across great channels like this, you know why it's worth paying extra for them. Happy Holidays to all of Cape Cod !!!
