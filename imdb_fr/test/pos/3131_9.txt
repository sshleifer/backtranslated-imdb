It was recorded that John Ford had directed the "big hit movies" so he could afford to do the "little" movies he loved so much. Wagon Master, with the young Ben Johnson, is clearly one of his best, if not the best of his little films. Shooting, carts, horse-drawn work and inclusion of the Plains Indians are trademarks of Ford. As in many other films, Eisenstein, the influence of the great Russian director is visible in this film. The casting actors, including Ward Bond, Russell Simpson and Jane Darwell, are excellent, as well as the many characters of minor characters used by Ford, including his brother (the one who plays the drums). While Ben Johnson won a well-deserved Oscar for The Last Picture Show, his co-star, Harry Carey, Jr. did not reach these heights. Although his father, Carey, father, became one of the most important Western characters in Ford's early films, Carey, Jr. spent most of his career in supporting roles. For John Ford fans and Western film fans, this one is a must.
