Although all of the Superman / Fleischer / Famous Studios cartoons are excellent, "Billion Dollar Limited", the third in the series, is probably the best of the lot in terms of overall animation, scenario and stimulation. Why he was not even nominated for Oscars in the category Best Animated Short Film of 1942 (Incredibly, only the first one was), inexplicable. <br /> <br /> Here, Lois Lane is responsible for covering the transfer of one billion dollars in gold to the US Mint. Masked gangsters in their overpowered car (for 1942) take off after the train, determined to win this gold. Without saying too much, it results in a thrill ride for the characters and the audience, with truth, justice and Superman triumphant at the end. <br /> <br /> As they have done in all the Fleischer / Famous Superman cartoons, Clayton "Bud" Collyer and Joan Alexander, who plays Clark Kent / Superman and Lois Lane on the radio, have the honors for voice work here, and Fleischer, a lifelong Jack Mercer, also has a bit to do.
