I remember seeing this 1978 comedy on a morning when I was attending when I was looking for a break from school in my college classes. Walter Matthau and Glenda Jackson perform an effective parade in featherweight style directed by the worthy Howard Zieff ("soldier Benjamin") about the aggressive return of a newly widowed doctor in the dating game. Everything is happening quickly, mainly thanks to the astute scenario of the experienced screenwriter Julius J. Epstein ("Casablanca") alongside Alan Mandel, Max Shulman and the future director Charles Shyer. <br /> <br /> Dr. Charley Nichols has just returned from Hawaii after the death of his wife. Upon his return, he realizes that he is an instant catnip for all single women in Los Angeles. He works in a hospital run by an increasingly senile Chief of Staff, Amos Willoughby, whom Charley must pacify to stay in residence. Enter Ann Atkinson, an English transplant recipient who bakes cheesecakes and has some concrete insights into the medical profession, which she expresses freely during a PBS talk show. Of course, Charley is on the panel discussion of the series, and sparks, as they say, fly. This leads to the usual complications about the gravity of Charley's will about Ann. At the same time, the hospital faces a possible trial for the wrongful death of the widow of a wealthy baseball team owner who died at the hospital under Willoughby's negligent supervision. <br /> <br /> It's refreshing to see such a mature but invigorating love story between two characters, who live with actors who deliver lines with the skill of scalpel surgeons. Matthau is his usual Scottish swinger of the 1970s and he has quite a show waddling with his rebel arms held akimbo in his brisk walk. Far from his heavy Elizabethan award-winning roles, Jackson is clearly sardonic and charming vulnerable like Ann, the ferocious who believes that all doctors should aspire to be Albert Schweitzer. Art Carney plays Willoughby with a predictable bluster, while Richard Benjamin provides kind support as Charley's colleague, Dr. Solomon. Everything is very compact with some nice jabs to greed within the medical profession. There are no extras on the 2005 DVD.
