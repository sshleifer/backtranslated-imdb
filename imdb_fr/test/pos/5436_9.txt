This film is a great comedy drama. Christopher Walken plays a leading role in his role as director and his comments will always make you laugh. Robin Williams plays an important role as a fast-paced "Jon Stewart" and will entertain you if you are a fan of Comedy Central. The series is good because if the viewer has half of the brain, he will see it as a much needed sub-cultural attack against the current Republican government's policy and criticism of the American democratic process ..., not to mention the means by which most politicians are elected. <br /> <br /> I had fun with the sub-intrigues and I found the film very rhythmic and entertaining, without any of the usual "oh-brother" agree that the film is less comical than commercialized, however, without no doubt better than 90% of the trash in theaters right now. Just my thoughts ... Don
