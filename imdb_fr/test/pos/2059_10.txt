This film is a great tidal wave of action and comedy, it comes from the beginning, it is not boring. The chemistry of the main roles adds to the excitement and anticipation of the end, even if my suspicions were not satisfied. The special effects worked brilliantly and were credible! I would have liked a different end, but it still shook me with emotions. The story is going well, but it's a movie you have to watch carefully from beginning to end to get all the details, to fully understand and enjoy. <br /> <br />
