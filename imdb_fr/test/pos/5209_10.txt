This film is one of the most accurate war films to date in that it portrays the reality of soldiers in combat as well as the particular circumstances of the Battle of Stalingrad, which is evident when you compare this film to works such as the book of Anthony Beevor. "Stalingrad". <br /> <br /> Unlike the best-known "Enemy at the Gates" where the plot is hidden in a sniper / hunting story, this film shows what war can do for individuals . Although filmed by the Germans, "Stalingrad" is anything but a nationalist apologetic film. This shows that war movies can be something more than jingonistic distortions of the dark truth of war, as so many Hollywood "war" products seem. <br /> <br /> The script, the acting, the staging and others The film techniques in "Stlingrad" are of the highest caliber. <br /> <br /> This is a must-see movie for anyone planning to join the army and obey the orders of any type of "FÃ¼hrer".
