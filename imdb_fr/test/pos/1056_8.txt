Although it's a Christmas movie, "Christmas in Connecticut" could have been made at any time of the year, because it's the story of a soldier who's having an idyllic time with a guy like Martha Stewart. That's what he thinks. In fact, the lady in question, played by Barbara Stanwyck, published an article in a magazine about life on a farm with her husband and baby. She does not have a farm, no husband and no baby, no more than the many recipes she publishes. They belong to the owner of the restaurant nearby. When Sydney Greenstreet, her editor-in-chief, insists that she entertain Private Dennis Morgan, she asks her boyfriend's help so that she can use her farm, and she gets transported as well as the restaurateur. There is even a baby ... well, in fact, there are more than one. Chaos ensues and the charade becomes more and more difficult to play, especially when Stanwyck falls in love with Morgan. <br /> <br /> It's such a wonderful movie, and even if you're seriously depressed, "Christmas in Connecticut" can get you out of there. Barbara Stanwyck is wonderful as a career woman turned housekeeper. Although she was not as flashy as Crawford or Davis, she was still able to do what any role required - she could be cheap, stylish, hot, nasty, cold and / or sexy and she made her easy. On top of that, she is always attractive and seductive. Dennis Morgan is a beautiful and charming soldier. As a bonus, he uses his Irish tenor. Fiance Reginald Gardner takes care of everything and we can say that he is not quite in Stanwyck's shoes. S.Z. Sakall as a fake uncle / real boss is hilarious, especially since he prays Stanwyck can tip a pancake in front of an audience. <br /> <br /> I can imagine the impact of this film on the end of the Second World War. It had to be a real beacon for the best moments to come.
