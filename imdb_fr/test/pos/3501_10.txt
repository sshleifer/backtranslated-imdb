The problem with Ali G is that he takes the mick off of himself and his character. <br /> <br /> Humor is really a brand of the kind totally politically incorrect, irreverent and effacing. "I like it or I like it". <br /> <br /> Personally, I love this movie, everyone I met who saw it. You can watch it several times and choose new gags each time. The humor is both auditory and visual and the timing is impeccable. The humor is probably very English, and especially in London. It is therefore possible that non-English speaking viewers do not get some of the humor. Think of yourself as a teenager and you will love it, especially if Kevin & Perry Go Large tickled you!
