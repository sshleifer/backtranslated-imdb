1st viewed 28/10/2007, 8 out of 10 (Dir-Jesus Ponce): Simple and sweet story of a homeless couple and their daily adventures surviving in the everyday world without roof. The film begins with the woman of the story (interpreted by Isabel Ampudia) released from prison, but we do not know why she was or how long she stayed there. She meets the anti-hero of the story and her boyfriend, played by Sebastian Haro, who parks cars for change. They assemble under an old dilapidated building that has only the heat of each and a small mattress. He is an addict who is just trying to go from one solution to another, but he has a strange and obsessive attraction for him as a person, which we end up accepting. It also has some kind of sexually transmitted disease, so sex for them is out of the question, but that does not seem to be a problem for one or the other. She loves this man as he is, without a doubt, and without having to change, which is a rare find anywhere. She makes a living by carrying a bucket and washing shop windows. They eat a bakery bread every day and see it as a treat. Isabel's character dreams of a normal life, but does not expect that to happen and does not fit into that role, so do not think much about it. Both characters come from extremely broken families and the public sympathizes them despite their imperfections. Without giving up much of the story, Isabel's character continues to persevere as the man gets worse and worse in his obsession with drugs. There is a beautiful melodramatic conclusion to this story that will appeal to the masses, but overall, it's a beautiful, independent film about a relationship between the world's iniquities that keeps you interested until the end.
