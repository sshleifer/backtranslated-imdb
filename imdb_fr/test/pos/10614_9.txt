I saw this movie more than 20 years ago and I still remember how much I loved it. it really touched me and I really appreciated the work of Noel Coward. highly recommended: atmospheric and touching. <br /> <br /> I think of this film from time to time, and I am disappointed that it has not experienced as much revival as many classic movies. I did not understand until I looked today for the award of an academy for the best original story for Ben Hecht and Charles Macarthur. he. he dies, but is allowed to buy back if he can convince someone to shed a tear on him. the majority of films show this in pursuit of this goal. well written and charming. I knew him for his plays, so I was surprised to see him play that role on TV late one night in New York. to see if you have the opportunity.
