I have just returned from watching this documentary nominated by the Academy, and I have been deeply touched and interested in exploring such works of which I had never heard before. Of course, I am a person seduced by beautiful architecture, so I realize that others will not care. <br /> <br /> We can only imagine if there were a few more visionaries in Philadelphia in the late '60s when Kahn's shots were a possibility, what a wonderful downtown there would be. If you are wondering if you will know more about the Bangladesh building at the beginning of the film, be patient because it will provide the film's climax at the end. <br /> <br /> The personal discoveries of his son during the making of this film are quite interesting, sometimes touching and sometimes funny. One of the most comical anti-visionary speeches ever recorded on the camera. <br /> <br /> To complete the highlights of this document, you will find a touching musical score with excellent expressive string music. And the expressiveness is a major point that we find in the architecture of Kahn. The remarks made by other architects about the spiritual nature of the material and how Kahn's buildings implemented it connect the overall experience of this film.
