Keira Knightley and Sienna Miller are the stars in the story of two women in Dylan Thomas' life. Knightley is the friend of his childhood, Thomas, whom he meets again at the Blitz. When they meet in a bar, they reconnect, but things get complicated when Thomas takes his wife (Miller) at his next meeting. The women get along and things go on until the trio is joined by the man who will become Knightly's husband. This complicates things even more when jealousy begins to appear. <br /> <br /> Beautiful to look at, extraordinarily written and wonderfully played (everyone completely disappears in his roles), it is a sumptuous treat for the eyes and the ears. It's so nice to see a film about adults as adults. On a purely visceral level, I really enjoyed watching the film because the film is so artistically pleasing. I have rarely seen such a beautiful film. <br /> <br /> The problem with the film is that I'm not quite sure what has happened. Something seemed to be missing and several times I had to replay the movie to see if I had missed something. It's not bad, but it's not completely satisfactory. (I tried to look online to see how true the movie is, but I did not find anything.) However, I think it's a movie that deserves to be seen. It's a beautiful adult movie with probably the best acting game that the main actors have done.
