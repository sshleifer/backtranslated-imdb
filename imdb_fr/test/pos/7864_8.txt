Combining the conventions of Western and Gothic horror, and often realized as if it were an art film, it is one of the best collaborations of Siegel and Eastwood. <br /> <br /> Eastwood plays a Yankee soldier who, after being wounded during the American Civil War, fled to an isolated southwestern women's seminary. Isolated from the world, women send him their romantic fantasies and he reacts with a hard and masculine manipulation. But jealousy and resentment lift their heads, and he finds himself in a world of brutal vengeance. And the boy is a brutal revenge. <br /> <br /> Beautifully shot by Bruce Surtees, and carefully paced, "The Beguiled" is a haunting and elegant work that seems to have influenced the troubled sexuality of "Play Misty for East Me" and "The Tightrope" . <br /> <br /> The film is a gripping representation of a fierce battle between the sexes and overflows with a dreamlike mix of horror and sexuality. All the characters are ambiguous, displaying traits of both good and bad, leaving us the choice to choose who we should look for. <br /> <br /> Don Siegel left a legacy of beautiful films. Everything from "Invitation of the Body Snatchers" to "Dirty Harry". But although his first black and white images have aged well, most of his color films seem grainy, dated and badly shot. His realistic "realism" must have seemed fresh and kinetic 40 years ago, but nowadays I do not think they have stood the test of time. <br /> <br /> "The seduced", however, is in a different league. Mature, ambiguous and very clear, it's a shame that she is not better known. While evolving technologies and techniques have rendered most of Siegel's male action thrillers obsolete, "The Beguiled" continues to appeal to the public because of its surrealistic atmosphere and unique subject. <br /> 8.5 / 10 - Better than The same theme, "Black Narcissus", is in my opinion the best film of Siegel. Horror, drama and sexual odyssey at the same time, "The Beguiled" is a surprisingly artistic film (especially considering that Siegel saw his films without a quote, "meaningless"). Much of the film's art is due to Clint Eastwood, who would now make an effort to choose a mature material.
