In this film, astronauts sent to explore a newly discovered planet face many dilemmas, and they do it intelligently. The film addresses its main plot theme in a unique way, and unfolds it gradually, although it can be guessed in advance. <br /> <br /> The acting is very good, although it is sometimes stiff, as some may become. It can also be somewhat verbose and even melodramatic, especially after the plot theme has been revealed. Visually, his scene resembles that of "2001: The Odyssey of Space" of the previous year and tends to date the film. Some of the actors then played in the television show "UFO" of 1970, which is delightfully camper and deserves to be watched on DVD. <br /> <br /> Despite these small points, the space flight itself is realistic. It was in 1969, the scenes inside the cockpit of the spaceship also had a realistic appearance. (Look at the 1990/2000 video technology too!) One thing: I suspect that a love scene has been cut, but I can not prove it! In any case, it would have been a distraction. <br /> <br /> Unlike most sci-fi movies, this movie will make you think about the plot, which is well worth it. I am happy to have this film in my video library.
