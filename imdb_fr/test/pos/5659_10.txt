Although this was a failure in the movie theaters because mainly Mylene Farmer, one of the three big French stars did not have the first role. The fans had changed their minds later and were waiting for it on DVD. When he came out on DVD this year, he's having a huge success! The other failures were the slowness and the incredible length (3h) at that time (1994) which annoyed the critics. But the melancholy history makes the slow and long rhythm obligatory. The moral of the movie is that you can not escape the death for which you are destined. It's the same theme as in the movie "Final Destination" and makes it a gothic tale. The atmosphere is very melancholy.
