I try to trace the age of kings for many, many years. My life at the theater has been filled with actors in this series. At the time, in 1960, I could not follow everything because I worked at the theater myself, a lot of night work. Now, in retirement, I WANT to have that and keep it for myself. Please, please, can not you release it on DVD, I would not mind. I see there are others who feel the same way. What can we do to get there? Something as big as it should not be sent into oblivion. I have to write two more lines. OK, I can do it by saying that I want this series more than anything in the world. Just to watch some of the best actors of our time interpret the finest words of our wonderful Shakespeare. Is not enough! An Uzmen
