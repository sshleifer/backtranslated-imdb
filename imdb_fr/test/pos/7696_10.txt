"Porgy and Bess" is an exceptional production of George Gershwin's masterpiece. It is done with taste in muted colors. The voices are exceptional. Although the voice of Sidney Portier is doubled for its sung part, it gives a very touching performance. Sammy Davis Jr. achieved a remarkable performance in Sportin Life. There is still no DVD available for viewing, and this piece requires one. All intelligent film buffs who loved him in 1959 will appreciate the release of this masterpiece on this new medium. The screen is filled with a dynamic presentation that rivals all other musicals, including those of Rodgers and Hammerstein. Make sure to ask your video provider. Like "Songs of the South" by Walt Disney, it is possible that the assumption of a racial connotation prevents the commercialization of this cinema.
