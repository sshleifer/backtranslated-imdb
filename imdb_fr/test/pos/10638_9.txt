If you think that piano teacher Erika Kohut (Isabelle Huppert) in Michael Haneke's film "THE PIANIST" is the ultimate degree of personification of derangement, perversion and darkness, I have news for you: the piano teacher in Elfriede Jellinek's novel "THE PIANIST" (on which the film is based) is twice as "disgusting", "disgusting", "disturbed" and even more fascinating - although there is not enough words to translate the level of artistic mastery achieved by Isabelle Huppert here, above all the other deadly actresses in activity today. And who else could have played this character with such emotional power, with the best piano that can play an actor / dubbing? <br /> <br /> In the novel as in the film, there are two great antagonists of the "" heroine "Kohut: his own mother (wonderful Annie Girardot, voice to the wreckage, originally intended to Jeanne Moreau The mother personifies Jellinek's perception of her native Austria as a country that misleadingly and perversely promotes racist / fascist (or at least authoritarian) behavior, sexual and emotional repression, and , say, the ideals Ã¼bermensch that it is impossible to maintain today without the danger mental depression. <br /> <br /> "The Pianist" also addresses a very powerful and delicate question: how dangerous it is to reveal your most secret fantasies to the one you love.We tend to think that our own sexual fantasies must be as exciting to others as they are to ourselves, which can be a huge mistake embarrassing and pa Here, Kohut learns (?) The lesson in the most painful and humiliating way. <br /> <br /> It must be mentioned that Elfriede Jellinek is one of the best-known and most praised writers in Austria and Europe (well, she now has a Nobel Prize!) and we can deduce autobiographical passages in her novel, as she herself was a pianist and apparently had a difficult relationship with her mother. The novel also includes lengthy passages on Kohut's childhood and adolescence so that you understand in a way how she has transformed into who she is now. Haneke chose to hide this information in the film, forcing us to wonder how she became like this (do not we know an Erika Kohut?). But he retains very well the fabric of the book in his film: an unbearable honesty, to the point of emerge from the most secret and most "horrible" feelings - envy, cruelty, violence, jealousy, hatred, misery, sadism, masochism, selfishness, perversion, etc. All undeniably human. <br /> <br /> I thought "The Pianist" was a deeply moving film, very disturbing and provocative, with a handful of unforgettable scenes, and that's all I ask. movies. It also encouraged me to buy the book and be delighted, to discover a fantastic author whom I had not read before and to listen to Schubert again and again - so thanks to Haneke, Jellinek and Isabelle !!! On the other hand, if you are looking for light entertainment, please stay away. My vote: 9 out of 10
