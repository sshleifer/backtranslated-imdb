This covers just about every area of ​​the creative process and reviews the three stages chronologically, with a focus on production. There are documentaries that go into more detail and better cover the other two groups. These are works of art, sequences of backgrounds, film clips and many interviews. With a run time of no more than two hours, the public is entitled to a lot of information, since it is almost the same length as the film itself. One could say that people spend a lot of their time working with the know-how and the fruit of their collaborative efforts. It's done well, with a tight edition. It goes into technology and reveals how certain effects have been achieved. This spends a lot of time on physical training, in preparation for battles and the like. You get beautiful candid shots of people, team and actors. The Ultimate Matrix 10-Disc set of this disc also contains nearly three hours of music, in a simple system, with individual track selection and Play All function, about 38 minutes of BTS material in addition to the title itself, in various featurettes. The original version, however, includes several very short extras, including excerpts from the realization of the sequels, a preview of The Animatrix and Yuen Wo Ping's Blocking Tapes (a complete overview of some of the biggest martial arts sequences, with performers and almost the exact cinematography, with the same planes and angles of these bits in the effort of the finished silver screen). The language is strong enough, but rather infrequent, almost non-existent. I recommend either version to those who like the concept and / or want to know how they assembled the first. 7/10
