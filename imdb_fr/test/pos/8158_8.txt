Latter Days is a very independent film. And compared to many more modern movies, a lot of things are missing. The shot sometimes seems quite amateur, the dialogues can be a little chopped and the characters are not of an impressive complexity. So, do not expect too much for this film, because as I said, it is very independent. But all that is missing in the concrete aspects of the film can be neglected because of the charm of the story! I can not pretend that the plot is remarkably original, but the story is still beautiful and comforting in many ways! It's not about being gay or straight, but about faith and deciding how you will live your life! It's an idiotic story that makes you want to cry and smile at the same time! So, to be honest, Latter Days is far from perfect, but I really loved the movie and highly recommend it! It's very critical of the religious aspects of our society, and homosexuality is involved - but approach it with an open mind, and I'm pretty sure most people will enjoy it as much as I do!
