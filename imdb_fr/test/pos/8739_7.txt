Ingrid Bergman, the faithful receptionist of dentist Walter Matthau who loves his boss at first sight, is absolutely wonderful in this film. She manipulates the spiritual divide of the script with aplomb and steals a fantastic scene where she and Goldie Hawn chat in a recording booth (Ingrid's monologue is a front, but her face tells you she believes it wholeheartedly) . Matthau is a strange choice for the leader (he is too old for Goldie Hawn and too unrefined for Bergman, not to mention too vague to be a dentist), but I liked the way he was trying to please Goldie and stumbling for try to free himself from a lie. Hawn (who won an Oscar for support) is just as fresh and bubbly as it is today. This bedroom farce is not very sophisticated (and vaguely reminiscent of "Every Wednesday"), but it is a welcome relief from the noisy comedies for teenagers they have today. "Cactus flower" is a nice sigh! *** of ****
