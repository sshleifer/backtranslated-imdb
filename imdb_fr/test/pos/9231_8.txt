The 221 episodes of "The Lone Ranger" were originally broadcast on ABC from 1949 to 1957; and then for many years, they played in local syndication. For most of the broadcast years, the series was ABC's most watched lineup. <br /> <br /> The new Pop Flix DVD game contains the first 16 episodes (September 15-December 29, 1949) and, for some unknown reason, episode 22 of the fifth season, for a total of 17 episodes (the same 17 available in last year's edition of Mill Creek Entertainment, so these are probably in the public domain). These sets almost make the film "The Lone Ranger's Legend" superfluous since the three episodes that were combined in 1952 to form the film are included in these releases. <br /> <br /> The first episodes return to the radio because there are many more narrations in voice-over used as introduction and to present the key moments of the plot. <br /> <br /> The series itself was a pure children's western with clear distinctions between good and bad and no romance. The main character (played by Clayton Moore) started Texas Ranger John Reid. The first three episodes provide context for his transformation to the status of Lone Ranger, his partnership with the Indian Tonto (Jay Silverheels) and the taming of his horse "Silver". <br /> <br /> There is an unambiguous code of positive morality infusing each episode. The Lone Ranger is totally good but it takes on the appearance of evil. While good citizens feared a masked man in the West and the Indians were mistrusted, the Langer Ranger is feared by those who would do evil. One of the recurring themes is that when the Lone Ranger and Tonto first meet an average citizen, they are met with suspicion and at the end of the episode, the citizen was convinced of their value. The end of the mark was a secondary character who asked the question: "who was this masked man?" <br /> <br /> To truly appreciate the series, you must accept it for the simplistic morality narrative that it was meant to be. If you do not take it seriously and continue to wish for self-reflective campy parody, you will be frustrated. <br /> <br /> Again, what do I know? I am only a child.
