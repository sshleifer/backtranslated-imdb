The Stepford Children is the second best Stepford film in the Stepford series. I saw the original The Stepford Wives at the movies when it was released in 1975. I was blown away, it was fantastic. I've seen all of Stepford's films, and I love them all. I think The Stepford Children is such a campy and fun movie. I've recently watched it on tape again, and I really enjoyed it. The cast of this movie was really good to watch. Barbara Eden has done a job as usual.Every role she has ever played has been very good.Barbara Eden is very good at playing roles where she is kind of kind and nurturing person.Don Murray as her husband and his perfect father in this movie. He was particularly effective at being the irritated father of his two teenage children. I made sure to have all of Stepford's film on tape to enjoy it. If you have the chance to see this movie, you should.
