The "good news" is that the circus is in town. The "bad news" comes from the underground house of Bugs Bunny. He wakes up when his place shook like an earthquake, when workers plunge into the ground and elephants trample, etc. <br /> <br /> To be more specific, the cage of lions is placed exactly above Bugs' hole. The lion sniffs food and, by way of elimination, discovers that it is a rabbit. Insects, curious to know what all this noise consists of, make their way through the tunnel and find themselves in the lion's mouth. <br /> <br /> I'll say something for BB: he's totally intrepid, at least in this cartoon, and at least for 30 seconds. When he regains his senses, he runs like crazy and we have a lion fight against a rabbit for the rest of the way. Once again, Bugs is facing an idiotic opponent, the one he calls "Nero," but the lion is fearsome and Bugs will need all his wit and bravery bravery to repel this animal. <br /> <br /> About half of the gags are stupid and the other half funny, but still fast, colorful and good enough to recommend. I mean, it's not every day that you can see a lion on a trapeze or do a hula dance!
