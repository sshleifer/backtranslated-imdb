If you're looking for a not too serious crowd movie, with a woman in mind, you're in the right place. Pfieffer acted much better than that. You can see that it has matured beyond this image. <br /> <br /> When I first took this movie, I was expecting Pfeiffer to be misinterpreted. However, she plays her role as a street gang wife. It's not bad either of Baldwin. <br /> <br /> If you do not pay attention to the hair, this film could interest you. But do not take it too seriously ...
