It's a classic war movie. One of the best, a festival of unusual images consisting of flashing lights, dark backgrounds and helicopter blades turned into ceiling fans. A starry show of immense powers. <br /> <br /> Martin Sheen is a mercenary sent to assassinate the lost general, sadistic dictator whose great Marlon Brando was the illusion. Robert Duvall will also embody the ideal of DI with a penchant for "morning napalm" or at least its smell. Dennis Hopper is an avant-garde photojournalist with a biased view of the war and its leader. Also in this amazing movie, you'll see emerging stars such as Laurence Fishburne, R. Lee Ermey, Sam Bottoms, Albert Hall and watch Harrison Ford too ... <br /> <br /> Francis Ford Coppolla delivers a movie with can -be more intense and drama than the famous Godfather films. It highlights the war in its most basic form, which is for most invisible boat continues on the river the feeling of the war tightening is quite unbearable. The resulting feeling is rather claustrophobic and creates unusual moods among viewers. Honestly, no movie has ever made me feel that way. <br /> <br /> It's hard to find criticism. Some blame Brando for earning tons of money for a role to play for ten minutes, but this is not justified. It was money well earned, a role that limited him physically, being at the time a man indisposed, and a role he had really attributed. I can not imagine better than anyone for the role. And if you have the Redux version of Apocalypse Now, there are additional pieces of the big man, and I think Redux is improving the movie. Better, you feel more happy In the Redux version, you will have the chance to have a very satisfying film, with an additional sequence of 49 minutes. Otherwise, you will not be disappointed, because this film is among the best and deserves great recognition and a place of choice among the 50 best films ever made ...
