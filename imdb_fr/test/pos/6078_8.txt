During the Second World War, a severely burned amnesiac known as the "English Patient" is in the African desert and is transported to Italy where he joins a convoy of medical troops and others in an abandoned monastery. Among them, Hana (Juliette Binoche), a Canadian nurse whose lovers generally have unpleasant purposes; Kip (Naveen Andrews) and Hardy (Kevin Whately), two explosives experts who search the monastery for bombs; and David Caravaggio (Willem Dafoe), a Canadian soldier of fortune who knows the identity of the English patient and has an account to settle. <br /> <br /> Looking back, we learn the story of the patient: he is Laszo Almasy (Ralph Fiennes), a Hungarian explorer who, in the late 1930s, rubs shoulders with a group of British cartographers , including Geoffrey Clifton (Colin Firth) and his wife Katharine (Kristen Scott-Thomas), while mapping the deserts of North Africa. After Clifton has left them for government reasons, Katharine and Clifton fall in love with each other in the desert, resulting in an affair that, of course, has a less than happy end. <br /> <br /> If one can ignore the illogical parts of history (such as, why would a patient found in Africa be sent to what is essentially the front line of the war in Italy? ?), you will then be able to enjoy "The English Patient" as a reminder of David Lean's intelligent, superimposed and radical epics in the 60s. Much more than "Titanic" or other epic novels of recent times, this film evokes both "Doctor Zhivago" and "Gone With the Wind", an epic love story unfolding in an immense historical context. You should not expect a war movie, although some striking (albeit too short) violence scenes stand out more than the romantics, as is usually the case (Caravaggio's interrogation by a sadistic SS officer (Jurgen Prochnow ) in particular). <br /> <br /> The film is very ambiguous, just about everything. The central question of the film is: how far do you want to go for love? As critics of the film hasten to point out, Almasy is, at first glance, a far from friendly character: he has an affair with a married woman and betrays his country by giving cards and information to the Germans, causing the death. of his friend Madox (Julian Wadham) and the torture of Caravaggio, and actually kill a British soldier who stopped him at some point. The fact that Almasy is in many ways reprehensible is a bit of a problem. He is in love with Katharine and sees the world closely as a lover of the fact that fidelity to a country (or anything else for that matter) is secondary; as Almasy says, he hates "property, to be the property". The two men embark on a rather daring love affair (hundreds of people at a Christmas party), and it is obvious that Katharine is more attracted to the mysterious and exciting Almasy than to the relatively boring Geoffrey. <br /> <br /> The secondary plot of 1944 is somewhat fragile and seems superfluous; the romance between Kip and Hannah is never totally believable, and I think the film could have been without it. But these sequences add an interesting texture of mystery and complexity to the movie, so I will not complain too much. <br /> <br /> Like the epics mentioned above, the film is able to convey the time and place of devices such as crowd scenes, strategically placed posters and a military presence. We do not need to insist that we are in Cairo in 1938, but it is useful to know. Anthony Minghella's direction and John Seale's desert cinematography are absolutely beautiful. Sand dunes, sandstorms and haunted desert caves are captured in beautiful details. Gabriel Yared's score is obsolete and atmospheric. <br /> <br /> The game of actors is generally solid. Fiennes gives a very stratified performance as a mysterious, complex and haunted character. The difference between the Almasys of 1938 and 1944 is remarkable. one exciting and somewhat carefree, the other haunted and reflective. Kirsten Scott Thomas is effective as Katharine, the adventure-seeking female explorer, and Colin Firth gives one of his best performances as Geoffrey, who realizes early on that he is not a competitor for the exciting Almasy. Willem Dafoe does a good job as Caravaggio, the thief turned hunter turned spy, driven by revenge. Jurgen Prochnow gives a performance reminiscent of Jose Ferrer in "Lawrence of Arabia" (and a similar character): very brief, but more memorable than some of the main characters. Some of the actors of 1944 are insignificant: Juliette Binochette is nothing special, while Naveen Andrews is good but tasteless. Kevin Whately, as an unfortunate partner of Kip, does what he can with a rather small role. <br /> <br /> "The English Patient" is certainly not a perfect film, but its vituperous attacks drag it much of the public who go to the cinema are not deserved at all. It may be a show of the evolution of film sensibility since the Lean and Kubricks era, or maybe people were expecting something simple to understand. Complex to criticize, brilliantly directed and filmed, "The English Patient" is a marvelous modern epic. <br /> <br /> 8/10
