Angels of the Universe is a pure masterpiece and proves once again that you can make a brilliant, low-budget film, such as American Beauty and Blair Witch Project. The director Fridrik Thór Fridriksson gives the novel Englar alheimsins a new life on a white screen. The film is a breakthrough in Icelandic cinema because it is the biggest and biggest film made in Iceland. <br /> <br /> The film's music, played by Sigurrós, is very symbolic for the film. is absolutely great. I recommend to all those who are able to think to see this movie as soon as possible, you will not be disappointed. I would bet on this film to win the prize for best foreign film next year ?? worldwide!
