Lucio Fulci's most respected film, "Do not Torture a Duckling", is renowned for his edgy subject, his macabre images and his powerful story. Terror falls on a small Italian village as young boys begin to be murdered, engulfing confused and determined authorities, and a detective dedicated to the mystery. Was it the scary hermit? The spotted voodoo witch? One of the prostitutes? The rich girl? Someone else? Unlike the frequent portrayal of most fans about the violent content of the movie, I consider it much more intrigue-based; presenting only a real moment of memorable bloodshed (involving chains and planks). In no way does this detract from the positive attributes of this film. Fulci is quite capable of producing a dark and disturbing giallo with childish slayings, black magic and, of course, a beautiful full set of knockers ... Although I particularly like the lizard in a Fulci woman Skin "and" New York Ripper "," Do not torture a duckling "dominate the giallo genre as a mystery of gloomy and convincing murder!
