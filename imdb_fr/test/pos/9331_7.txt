Music videos are often completely ignored in movie discussions, with most people viewing them as a less important form of art. If a large majority are just flashy clips to announce the latest single of their popular performer, a few precious people exceed the others, becoming works of art in its own right (all that Spike Jonze or Michel Gondry realize is still worth "Art" is not exactly the word I would use to describe "Thriller (1983)" by Michael Jackson, "it is an extremely nice hybrid of horror and schlock, and a short film in the scandalous campaign that remains remarkably endearing 25 years later.The 13-minute video, the longest and most expensive at the time of its release, was directed by John Landis , a filmmaker I do not know very well, although "The Blues Brothers (1980)" is a classic, and I hear that a "American werewolf in London (1981)" is a horror comedy incredibly entertaining. <br /> <br /> Que Th whether or not to qualify as a music video is certainly subject to debate, given its length (although Jackson improved his efforts with "Ghosts" from 1997, to 38 minutes) and the fact that the title song represents less than half of the total duration. The video begins with a short film in a film, when Michael, on a calm and enlightened night, reveals to his girlfriend (Ola Ray) that he is "different" from the other guys, turning into a hideous werewolf. Night clouds separate to reveal a full moon. While he is probably beheading the unfortunate heroine, we meet Michael and his daughter at the movies, watching this drama unfold in a horror picture. When the girl is scared, they leave the cinema and start going home. Michael begins to sing the first lines of his last song, "Thriller". However, when a horde of bloodthirsty zombies come out of the local graveyard (their entry macabre told by Vincent Price), the situation begins to become interesting. <br /> <br /> It's hard to understand why "Thriller" is considered one of the best music videos, it can not just be that the song itself is very funny, and Michael Jackson? Although he has since become the target of all comedian jokes for his personality and particulars, there is no doubt that he is an excellent singer and performer, perhaps a decent explanation of the popularity of movie is the sheer amount of work she had to do, nothing like what had been seen before, and there is still something of a quirk in the world of video clips. macabres were designed by Rick Baker and are surprisingly graphic for a music video, although everything is made with a sense of fun, there are several moments to create a truly exciting thriller, successfully capturing the atmosphere She films movies that she parodies {but always with a touch of the usual formula}. In other words, you will never look at a zombie movie in the same way!
