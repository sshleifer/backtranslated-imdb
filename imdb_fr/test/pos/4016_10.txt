A truly unique and amazing film from Jules Verne's film "Pour le drapeau", directed by Czech master director Karel Zeman. Although the story takes place in a rather sober style from the late Victorian era, the graphics are breathtaking. Zeman uses animation, graphics, painted sets, model animation combined with real actions to create the atmosphere of Verne that the reader associates with his spirit. The style is similar to the steel engravings by Dore, Bennet and Riou illustrating these stories with a good dose of Georges Melies.Photographed in beautiful black and white, the animation is of the highest quality and is not that of Saturday morning. There are underwater sequences in which swimming fish are drawn with such precision that they can be used in a field guide. There are images of ships, submarines, flying machines, castles and machines drawn with a level of detail so precise that it is necessary to freeze framing her VCR or DVD to pause the scene and study the remarkable details of The atmosphere of the late Victorian era is designed to resemble the world that has never been and to delight us in the magic of science that has made Verne the grandfather of the genre. If that's not enough, there's also the score that's probably one of the best ever created for a fantasy or sci-fi movie. Really a forgotten classic, this one is worth discovering and buying. Always one of my favorite movies of all time, it's sure to be one of yours too. And remember, this has been done decades before CGI or computer animation. Congratulations to the great artists who have obviously put their heart into it. This shows. Jules Verne himself would be proud of this film. A film that deserves to be better known, but those who have seen it adore it - and cherish it. Remarkable achievement, this remarkable film improves every time you watch it. A true cinematographic work of a visionary director.
