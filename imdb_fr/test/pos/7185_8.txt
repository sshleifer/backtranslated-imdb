This film is just great ... It starts at first very slow and boring but as the film goes on ... well, the fun continues. The power of the film may lie in its subtle references to many other films. For me, the best part was perhaps the scene of Bruce Lee / Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. How the two actors move from French to Chinese or any other Asian language, it was great. Then the jokes with the names, they are hilarious, but maybe you will not understand them all when you are American (no offense) Overall, a good movie
