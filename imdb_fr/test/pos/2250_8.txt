Let me start by saying that Liev gained a ton of respect from me after seeing his first film as director "Everything Is Illuminated". Anyone who has read the book knows how saturated the story is with Alex's hilarious and absurd vocabulary, as well as countless flashbacks and dreamlike dream sequences. Liev took all that and made it work. The film itself is excellent - the soundtrack, the performances, the cinematography - everything works. It lacks a lot of history about the city and its people, but you can only make one independent film, so this part did not bother me too much. It is simply disappointing that not many people will see this film or even know it exists, because of the lack of promotion that results. I did not even know it was in the theaters. I did not know when the DVD came out. One would think that since Frodo Baggins was one of the main characters, SOMEBODY would have at least published an advertisement for it. I had to watch the trailer on my DVD "Paradise Now" (released on DVD in the spring of 2006) to know he had a release date at the movie theater "Fall 2005". Haha - really sad. <br /> <br /> Anyway, if you come across this criticism because one of your friends read the book and loved it or saw the movie and recommend you to see it - follow my advice and look at it. It's a very good experience. <br /> <br /> 8 of 10.
