I liked this film. Many people refer to this as "Sabrina the teenage feminist". That's what they do with a lot of movies in which Melissa Joan Hart is. Yet she really surprised me in this movie because she was great in the role of Mary, who fights for justice when her roommate is raped. You could say that Hart was extremely determined in this film and this was shown. I also loved Lisa Dean Ryan as a roommate of Mary. She was very helpful in making me feel sorry for her character after being raped. Josh Hopkins was good as an arrogant and selfish rapist. Lochlyn Munro played her character convincingly. Playing in this movie is better than most TV movies, in my opinion. <br /> <br /> But the movie was pretty predictable. Also, I was expecting more from the end, it was too abrupt. The delivery could have been better. But the performance and the overall plot compensate for these problems.
