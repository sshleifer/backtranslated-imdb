The above profile was written by me when I used the OldWereWolf56 nickname, which is still my email address. I still believe that Frisky's character by Andy Devine is the best episode of Twilight Zone and I watch this episode at least once a year, whereas I consider Frisby as a privileged man because he has many friends who love him a lot. <br /> <br /> If many of you are too young to remember, I'm 61 years old, Andy Devine hosted a children's entertainment show in the 50's, I believe, that's call Andy's Gang. There were three assistants: a cat named Midnight who played the violin, a mouse named Squeaky who played a hand organ, and a devilish toad named Froggy who could appear and disappear as he pleases embarrassing many funny guest stars like Billy Gilbert. .
