Although I completely agree with the previous comment about the wonderful role of Toni Servillo in Titta Di Girolamo, I would also like to add the beautiful filming and editing that turns this film into a painting. The young director Paolo Sorrentino had the courage to experiment with different types of shooting techniques, which reminded me of Darren Aronofsky's Requiem for a Dream. They both used the same MTV style shoot combined with modern music (alternative / techno), making the film ?? The Consequenze dell'Amore - stand out from other crime / mafia movies of its kind. Although the film can begin almost very slowly, it should be appreciated because of its serenity, its marvelous character and its splendid end. A must-see for European / Italian cinema lovers. PS Toni continues to do this: we need a reminder.
