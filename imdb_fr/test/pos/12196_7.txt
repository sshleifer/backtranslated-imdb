Despite some acceptable adaptations of the main themes of the books, the QUEEN OF DAMNÃ‰S / VAMPIRE LESTAT did not remain faithful to the complicated narrative of Anne Rices. The deep layers that make up all the characters have been shredded to give only their surface, if not a completely different identity. The chronological order of the main events in the film seemed distorted and uneven. <br /> <br /> However, the film deserved a number of things that deserved my rating of 7. First, the film strongly captured the affect. that Lestat (among other vampires) had to the public, especially young girls. The film also did a pretty good job of emphasizing the importance of heredity and history that vampires were proud of. The scenes of sensuality were also satisfying from the atmospheric point of view. <br /> <br /> The acting in QUEEN OF THE DAMNED was moderate, so disappointing. Stuart Townsend and Aaliyah have surprising chemistry, although it only shows the moment when the acting is at its best (not very often). The characters are nothing compared to those set in INTERVIEW WITH A VAMPIRE. It also lacks the emotional intelligence of THE FEAST OF ALL SAINTS, which is a shame because the book of Rice, the queen of the damned, had one, and more. <br /> <br /> This film does not give everything it seems to be. . The effects are dull and very disappointing. The extravagance necessary in many scenes is not given and the dialogue is tiring. The parameters of many scenes are not as I described them in the book, and I think many of them have not even been extracted from the story. There are only a few areas of incoherence in the beginning and middle of the film, but it ends pretty well, giving the viewer a complete story (if they had not read the book). <br /> <br /> Somethings I think the film would need a good original score (Howard Shore or Elmer Bernstein), instead of a mix of rock music; even though I had no problem with some of the songs. Another thing that could have improved the movie is to better define the direction. The landscape was boring and fuzzy, which is important in a story that moves quite often. <br /> <br /> Overall, QUEEN OF THE DAMNED was a disappointing and somewhat satisfying adaptation of the important novel. With a few simple changes, it was perhaps a very successful film. I would recommend this film to people who have seen INTERVIEW or who have read the books so they can make their own opinion about the adaptation.
