The Tempest has been interpreted in different ways, from more or less traditional conceptions dealing with art to more modern approaches that consist of dissecting the play in post-colonial, feminist, gender or deconstructionist lines. Jarman's version left me cold enough because I did not know what he was talking about. What is the vision / idea / concept behind this interpretation of Shakespeare? The previous reviews do not go much further than revenge, a tragedy, a punk show, but there is surely more than that, is not it? This does not mean that there is no vision here, but that I have a hard time discovering it. Anyway, there are still things to appreciate. The punk flavor is refreshing and fun. Toyah Wilcox as Miranda and Jack Birkett as Caliban are wonderful. I did not care much about Williams as Prospero ... not enough magic I suppose. The tilts between the old monastery / castle and the (English) world outside can sometimes be a little disturbing, but I guess it's intentional. In the end, interesting but not quite the success I had hoped for (especially after seeing Jarman's Caravaggio).
