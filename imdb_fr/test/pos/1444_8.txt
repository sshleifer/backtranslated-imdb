Many scenes and dialogues are completely crazy, but when you add up everything, that is to say that the daily cycle of Machine, ranging from a depressing depressing to a depressing bar, to a depressing burlesque hall, to Poker games filled with depressing smoke and returning home, you get a strange sense that someone is trying, somewhere, to give a faithful description of the life of the drug addict around 1955. That it is Sinatra, who would obviously have encountered this type of character growing up in Hoboken and working in many bands, or Preminger, who uses Frankie-Zosch's soundtrack and subtext to drag the addict's inner-world vision beyond the cage of the Code Hays, you get a good companion for On the Waterfront, which was shot almost exactly at the same time. A kind of false-realistic work that lets you ask yourself realistically how deeply the drug culture is embedded in American life.
