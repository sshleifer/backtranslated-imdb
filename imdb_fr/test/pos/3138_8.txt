It takes a while to adjust to the sound of Sons of The Pioneers, but you'll get the most out of it. If the soundtrack was performed by an orchestra like Max Steiner or Dmitri Tiomkin, it would lose its folk character. The music directs the film, everything seems to follow its rhythm. The whole cast is excellent. Ben Johnson and Harry Carey Jr. are the young men guiding the caravan. Ward Bond is the Mormon leader and Joanne Dru is a flirting actress. Ford has managed to create what would be an ordinary Western, something totally different and original showing us the music, the dances and, above all, the people.
