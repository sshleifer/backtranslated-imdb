This is probably part of my list of the 5 funniest movies I've ever seen! I was not a big fan of Robin Hood or Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves, but this movie was very different! We made fun of Robin Hood, and it was HILARIOUS! I was extremely happy with the quality of the set-up and the quality of the staging! In addition to Home Alone, Mrs. Doubtfire and Houseguest is the funniest thing I've ever seen! I particularly like the song; "We are men in tights!" If you have a sense of humor, you will love this movie!
