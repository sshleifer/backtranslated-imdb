There is a serious scene in this movie. A scene that lets you know that his movie will not shoot a lot of shots. It takes place in a crowded station and the protagonists are ambushed by assassins armed with automatic weapons. They paused and just managed to get under fire. The main hall of the station is now full of dead innocent people caught between two fires. Some would describe it as too sad and / or sinister to incorporate into what is supposed to be a pleasurable action movie. I call it honesty. Most action movies tend to focus on the "safe side" of violence and intrigue. Above all, this means that despite massive shooting, innocent people do not tend to die or at least we do not see them die. Violence is only good against bad guys, especially those who die. A little common sense makes it clear that this is absurd. <br /> <br /> Renny Harlin alluded to it in his first (and unfortunately only) hit, Die Hard 2. The bad guys intentionally crashed a plane filled with people to get their message across. The scene was also filmed with a backup scene of a cargo plane with only a few people on board, but the darker and probably more realistic scenario was finally used. However, to match the spirit of the first movie, Die Hard 2 was primarily a "fun action movie". Here, this darker and more convincing edge is omnipresent. The violence is bloody. The linings are hilarious, but with a certain style that echoes the natural human sarcasm more than the film's sarcasm of clichÃ©s at the key moments of the action. The plot is also packed with more malevolent intent than most action movies. The villain is not just a thug in search of revenge or a crazy take on power. It's less ridiculous, but also more scary than that. Among the recent films, the "Bourne" trilogy almost gets there with its less cheesy movie style than the usual action movies, but this film dates back to 1996 and 7 years before "The Bourne Identity" with Matt Damon was released. big screen. > <br /> Another interesting aspect is that the main hero is actually a heroine. And that's long before the film version of "Tomb Raider" is a success. What's more, this heroine really seems to be able to eliminate John McClane, then his cigarette always on. This film marks the second role of the action heroine Geena Davis and she still has not managed to hit. While Angelina Jolie plays in "Tomb Raider" years later and gets a hit. The reasons are beyond me. Completely. <br /> <br /> Finally, this movie is not quite dark. There are many scandalous and spectacular sets that can only be seen in an action movie. The climatic explosion of a chemical bomb is an absolutely spectacular show of film pyrotechnics, with more than one law of physics taking a convenient break. Thus, there is a formula here, but it is the Anti-Formula for the daily formula of the Hollywood Action Movie. --- 9/10 <br /> <br /> BsCDb classification: 13+ --- violence, blasphemy
