I am a big bouncer, a former male bouncer, a former rugby player and a former boxer, and I love this movie. <br /> <br /> This is not a "mystical river". It's a piece of down. But there is room in life for soft toys, and when these soft toys are photographed in an attractive way, well interpreted by attractive and friendly people, cleverly prepared and full of a good dialogue, there is even more room for that. <br /> I'm not the biggest fan of Tom Selleck. But he is good at this area. Just like Julianne Nicholson (her bald head and her freckles), Ellen Degeneres, Kate Capshaw and even Tom Everett Scott (That Thing You Do!). <br /> <br /> The landscape is pleasant, the atmosphere is optimistic, there is sorrow and nostalgia, farce and even a little redemption. <br /> <br /> Any critic (male) who refutes this film is, we will say, not perfectly confident in his masculinity. In the meantime, I will continue to take pieces without excuses every time it happens on a cable.
