I may be a sentimentalist. But I found this film really moving. It was the first film that made me cry. And he did it more than once! I recommend it to anyone who is both gay and str8. Religious or not! Supporting partner Jackie Bisset stole the show, especially with her lining. The nude scenes were superbly worked too, and all were in good taste. The most shocking was the representation of the deprogramming by reversal of the orientation instituted by the Mormon church to the main character. It shocked me that it still continues in the world. Nevertheless, I enjoyed this film immensely. This is definitely the best gay movie since the Torch Song Trilogy. And much better than the other gay movie of this year, The Fluffer.
