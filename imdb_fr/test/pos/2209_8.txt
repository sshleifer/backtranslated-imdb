At first, I did not think Lauren Ambrose's performance was anything but flaky, but as her character evolved, the performance made more sense. Amy Madigan seemed too concise for her role and did not really relate to her daughter's characters, although it was obvious that her character was disengaged from the character portrayed by Lauren Ambrose. <br /> <br /> Christopher Lloyd is a hit as usual and carried off his role to encourage the plot. The development of his character left the public wondering why he had been reprimanded by the younger characters and could have been accomplished more directly with <br /> <br /> Taylor Roberts played a pivotal role in this somewhat vague story . His comprehensive performance of a simplistic character kept the film together. In this central role, Taylor was able to encourage a realistic family relationship between the characters while playing the role of antagonist for all other relationships in the film.
