This show is pure entertainment and does not try to be a Greek drama. It certainly contains elements of one with all the twists and turns of the plot, but it is extremely engaging and entertaining. Las Vegas is the perfect setting for a show and they will certainly never miss material to work with! Everything and everything goes on there! The actors on this show are extremely friendly and you really want to see what they do every week. The show is also very entertaining. Humor comes from characters and situations. Not just thrown for free. It's a well-crafted show in this regard. It certainly makes me look forward to Friday nights and I'm happy I can now own the first two seasons on DVD!
