A really excellent look at the world and the realities of heroin addiction. The film is a film that will touch far too close to home those who have been involved in the drug culture and who know what a heroin addict really is. Good movie, which will never be really obsolete. Preminger shows how the world of a JUNKIE can become dark. Worth the detour - a kind of education. The Golden Arm is a worried look at the truth of the underground life of the pain in which a junkie lives.
