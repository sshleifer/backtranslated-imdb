good enough, do not expect some high quality culture ... the acting is bad, the script fails, but it's still a pretty good movie to watch. Why? because it's dark, a little stupid, unpredictable, entertaining and fun to watch. do not expect anything, as I said, see it for yourself and see what I mean. <br /> <br /> it's a film, without a scenario or a memorable action, but there are enough scenes to make you dream laugh, cry or at least make you feel obliged to look at it to the end. That's all I wanted to say .... <br /> <br /> 7/10
