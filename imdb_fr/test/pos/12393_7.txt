It is generally accepted that Marcel Carné's 1936-1946 films are masterpieces and it is considered polite to say that the rest is mediocrity. This is an unfair opinion: at least two of these are eminently searchable: better post-war work and "cheats". <br /> <br /> There is a strange evolution of the golden hour of the Prevert to "the cheaters": in "the children of paradise" "mists quay" or "the day rises", the true love is thwarted by the wicked. In "cheaters", true love no longer exists: we are dealing with a group of young people who do not believe in anything, falling in love would be incongruous for this young man. Adults are not bad guys at all: Mic's brother and mother are nice people, but she is beyond their control. Very few adults appear anyway. <br /> <br /> For two hours, the characters do not stop playing, dancing, listening to jazz records (music that was not yet part of bourgeois culture) and drinking a lot . When two of them discover that they care about each other, it will be too late. <br /> <br /> The distribution is rather good, Laurent Terzieff as cynical existentialist and Andréa Paris is rich in rich children. On the other hand, Pascale Petit and especially Jacques Charrier (who married Brigitte Bardot the same year as "the cheaters") do not have the ambiguity that their roles demand. They are all smiling. , too kind and too kind to be credible. <br /> <br /> Strangely, "the cheaters" was labeled "new wave"! you know what the priests of this school of cinema (like Godard) thought of Carné, it's really a good joke.But this disenchantment that you feel throughout the film is really disturbing.
