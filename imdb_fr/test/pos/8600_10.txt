In light of the recent typhoon that hit the country severely (ie Typhoon Ondoy), I thought I was going to watch "Black Rain" (1988, Japan), the chief black and white work that haunts Shohei Imamura. destruction and aftermath of the atomic bomb that hit Hiroshima at the end of the Second World War. The destruction and impact of the two disasters (war and typhoon) may differ in degree and quality, but the trauma and scar (physically and psychologically) are still present. <br /> <br /> The power of movies is that their images remain as powerful and indelible as when they were first seen. The only difference I see now, in my case, is that looking at these images has acquired a sharper and more powerful meaning due to a direct experience of a near-monumental climate catastrophe. There is a sense of kinship, so to speak. <br /> <br /> Imamura has always been one of my favorite Japanese filmmakers. His films are always enjoyable to watch because of their anarchy, their sensuality and their earthly character: "Pornographers: Introduction to Anthropology" (1966), "Eijanaika" (1981), "Hot Water Under One Red Bridge "(2001), his two winners of the Palme d'Or" Ballad of Narayama "(1983) and" The Eel "(1997), to name a few. Given the atmosphere of his films, who would have thought that he had been assistant director of Yasujiro Ozu, the most austere and minimalist filmmaker of Japanese cinema? But then, it is against Izu's rigorous formality and national intimacy that Imamura rebels. <br /> <br /> But, again, with "Black Rain", one can clearly feel the imprints of Ozu. The father (or father's figure) has the firm intention to see his daughter get married before time runs out, and the calm and serenity of the scenes showing all the family members together (including the dinner scenes or at Ozu the lexicon of the film, the tatami) are something that the venerable filmmaker will unceasingly explore in his works ("Tokyo Story", "Late Spring"). The discrete and deliberate quality of "Black Rain" is essentially a remarkable contrast to the Bacchanalian chaos and the instinctive drive of all Imamura's filmography. <br /> <br /> That does not prevent that watching the movie would not be quite an inconvenient experience. "Black Rain", as rightly described by American film critic Leonard Maltin, "is full of obsessive black and white images". During the first 15 minutes of the film, Imamura does not show one after another the immediate horrors and graphics of nuclear bombing (burnt bodies, drooping flesh, dead, fires and debris everywhere, madness everywhere). Attacked by the sensations of the audience, associated with the dark black-and-white photograph of Takashi Kawamata (Yoshitaru Nomura's crime drama film, "The Incident") and the chilling score of Toru Takemitsu (he played the music in classics such as "Ran" by Akira Kurosawa and "Double Suicide" by Masahiro Shinoda). <br /> <br /> Even during the so-called "quiet" phase of the film (ie five years after the atomic bombing), we still can not have the feeling of satisfaction and order, the Malaise and pain are still strongly felt by survivors, not only in terms of poor physical health, but more in terms of psychological trauma and social stigma. The human race, now seemingly indisputable, has been destined to support the legacy of the Bomb as long as it lives. <br /> <br /> I already wrote an article about "Black Rain" a few years ago (published on IMDb.com), but only in comparison with Volker Schlondorff's beautiful "Tin Drum", another film about monumental human madness and global catastrophe. Moreover, I have never used to write twice about a film for which I already wrote something. It is in light of the recent meteorological disasters that devastated our country that I was prompted to revisit and write something about this remarkable film Imamura, because many lessons can be learned from both the film and the film. recent event. with regard to the imperfections and dangers of scientific knowledge and action, as well as the long-term scars and injuries caused by large-scale destruction (whether caused by man or by nature) . <br /> <br /> films dealing with the nuclear holocaust and destruction ("Testament", "Threads", "The War Game", each in their respective countries); "Black Rain" is among them, if not more, a dark portrait of the individual and communal disintegration caused by atomic devastation and the fact that it has a historical event as a basis. <br /> <br /> In a few weeks, another catastrophic Hollywood film, "2012" by Roland Emmerich, will finally hit (no pun intended) the big screen. As we all know, this American filmmaker's "disaster / apocalypse" series - "Independence Day", "Godzilla", "The Day After Tomorrow" - serves no purpose other than being a simple value of entertainment, without real insight into the nature and wisdom of the apocalyptic disaster and the affected human condition. I wonder how this "gigantic" film would exploit the trauma, disorientation and apprehensions our people are still experiencing due to the recent climate disaster. To say that this film is a precautionary tale would probably not be an overestimate. <br /> <br /> But yes, I will look anyway "2012".
