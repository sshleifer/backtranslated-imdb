This is by far my favorite action movie. But what makes it work is not Renny Harlin's explosions and elite shots. This is the scenario of Shane Black and his skillful execution by Geena Davis and Samuel L. Jackson. <br /> <br /> The chemistry between the two leaders deserved a sequel. Thank God, this has never been done. Too much risk of damaging the original. <br /> <br /> The checkers 'The Long Kiss', from one scene to another to the action scene, then back to the next. Never a boring moment. <br /> <br /> This must be Jackson's funniest role, and the most amazing thing is that he plays one of the most normal characters in his career. No quirky Tarantino hit-man, super cool Shaft, or psychopathic soldier on the edge. In TLKG, Jackson is the universe we identify with. The poor bitch is drawn into the odyssey of this crazy to discover the dangerous secret of his past. <br /> <br /> Although the story claims that Davis' character, Samantha Caine suffers from amnesia, the writer and director treat her as if she were a multiple personality disorder. <br /> <br /> Samantha Caine is not just a new identity taken by the amnesiac Charly Baltimore - she is a distinct personality, fully developed. Samantha's trauma during the first half-hour of the film allowed Charly's dissociated and submerged personality to reappear. <br /> <br /> The materials of his past life, uncovered by Detective Mitch Henessey of Jackson, make it easier to lay out Charly. It's also a good timing, given Samantha's target of herself. <br /> <br /> But Charly must fight to remain the dominant personality. There are fragments of dialogue that the warrior personality (Charly) developed after the death of his father and was recruited by the "Chapter". <br /> <br /> In the last eight years, Charly was buried in the psyche. Samantha's identity has grown to become the dominant personality. (She's even funnier than Charly.) It's probably because she's become a mother that it's the reunion with her daughter that breaks Charly's fight to repress Samantha, leading to their apparent integration by the end of May. movie. <br /> <br /> impossible to choose a "best quote" from this film: <br /> <br /> "Now, are you a sniper?" <br /> <br /> "I saved your ass, it was great!" <br /> <br /> "Keep dying, out there." <br /> <br /> "I put them in the jaw and I scream 'Pop goes the weasel'". <br /> <br /> And a couple among dozens of others, far too crazy to quote here. <br /> <br /> Geena Davis looks great and presents herself as a heroine of action not to mention the fact that she is forty years old. (Listen to Charley's story, do the math). <br /> <br /> Fantastic soundtrack too. Santana, Muddy Waters, Elvis, LaBelle, Marvin Gaye. <br /> <br /> I give a 9 to "Long Kiss Goodnight", only because I do not believe in a 10. I see it a dozen times and it always stays fresh. Beautiful twisted holiday movie to place on your shelf next to "It's a wonderful life".
