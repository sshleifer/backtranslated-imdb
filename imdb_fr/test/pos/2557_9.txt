Alejandro (Alejandro Polanco), nicknamed Ale, works in a body repair shop in what is now known as the Iron Triangle, a 20-yard stretch of deterioration and gritty auto repair dealerships located near Shea Stadium, Queens, New York. Here, customers do not wonder if parts come from stolen cars or why they are able to receive such discounts, they simply deposit their money and hope everything is fine. The tour guides do not mention sordid suburbs like these, but the Iranian-American director Ramin Bahrani presents them in Chop Shop, a powerful independent film that received a lot of affection last year in Cannes, Berlin and Toronto. Following his famous "Man Push Cart", Bahrani spent a year and a half in a place that F. Scott Fitzgerald described as "the valley of ashes" in Great Gatsby. <br /> <br /> Chop Shop is not only a social criticism but, like Hector Babenco's Pixote, a poignant character study in which the survival of a young boy is bought at the price of his innocence. Filmed onsite at Willets Point in Queens, Bahrani makes you feel like you're there, sweating in a hot and humid summer in New York with all its noise and chaos. The film focuses on the charming, intelligent 12-year-old Ale who lives on the edge without any support or supervision from adults, except for her boss (Rob Sowulski), the real owner of the garage. Iron Triangle. Polanco's performance is raw and slightly ragged, but he fully earned the ovation he received at the premiere of the film in Cannes, as well as a hug from the great Iranian director Abbas Kiarostami. <br /> <br /> Cramped together in a small room above the garage With her 16-year-old sister Isamar (Isamar Gonzales), who works at the food distribution in a lunch cart, Ale is like one of the interchangeable spare parts with which he works.

In this environment, Ale and Isi use every means necessary to keep their head out of the water while their love for each other remains constant and they laugh and play a childhood that has never been place. As Barack Obama says in his book "Dreams From My Father", change can occur later when their eyes stop laughing and they have closed something inside. Meanwhile, Ale supplements his income by selling treats on the crowded New York metro with his friend Carlos (Carlos Zapata) and pushing illegal DVDs to street corners, while Isi helps truck drivers save enough money to buy the product. A $ 4500 rusty van in which they hope to start their own business. <br /> <br /> Although Ale is a "good boy", he is unmatched in stealing handbags and hubcaps from the Shea Stadium parking lot, events that Bahrani's camera observes. without judgement. In Chop Shop, Bahrani provided an indisputable antidote to the success stories of the Hollywood dream factory unveiled by the underdogs, and offered us a film of stunning naturalism and respect for his characters, similar in many respects to the great neo-realistic Italian films. and recent Iranian works by Kiarostami, Panahi and others. Although the outcome of the characters is far from certain, Bahrani ensures that we notice at Shea Stadium a giant billboard that says "Make dreams come true", leaving us the hint that in the sentence of Rumi, "the drum of the realization of this promise beats",
