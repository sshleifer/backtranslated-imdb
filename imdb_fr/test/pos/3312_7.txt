Although dated, this film is definitely worth the detour. I saw him about eight times as a teenager when it opened and it changed my life ... I had to live in New York. He has excellent plans to open the Manhattan skyline with Johnny Mathis humming "Romance is still ... the best of all ..." that rivals those of West Side Story. The first REAL model in the world, Suzy Parker (rather sorry, Janice D.), presents a rather overheated performance, but it's a visual wonder! It also offers a glimpse of the American mores of the late '50s - our obsession (and repression) of sex (in the workplace, nothing less!), Romance and marriage before women . It represents a time when New York was at its best and Joan Crawford's super-bitchy performance is icing on the cake.
