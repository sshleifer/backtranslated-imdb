Spoiler begin The film focuses on three friends, Samantha (Summer Phoenix), Chris (Nick Stahl) and Owen (Aaron Paul). The film starts with Sam and Owen as addicts, and Chris, the star of the track, as the one who looks after them. As the situation gets worse at home, Chris asks Sam how is the drug. Sam is currently rehab and sober. He tells her that everything is better. Chris then catches Owen and they start using. It takes Chris twice to become a "full time member". After some trouble with a dealer and a confession to Sam, she enters again. So begins the downward spiral for them. Chris od is when he breaks a promise made to Sam (I want the movie to be a surprise). He dies, Sam enters college to become an architect and Owen is arrested. So ends the story <br /> <br /> Spoiler ends. small spoilers throughout <br /> <br /> Nick Stahl is amazing. He will have an Oscar one day. His portrait of Chris was heartbreaking. He was the only one to feel real about the movie regarding drug use. Aaron Paul who played Owen acted as if he was speeding, not heroin. Summer Phoenix was fine, she has talent, but what can I say, Nick Stahl stole the movie. His drugged eyes, his slow movements, everything was perfect. <br /> <br /> Writers had to show withdrawals in the film. This is one of the main reasons why people do not want to quit smoking. Apart from that, there are hilarious scenes (the backstreet boy's mall and stage scene, the Stahl man perfectly understood the reaction.), Touching and sad scenes, I screamed, and the scene of the park.). It was realistic too. As if I was still eating when Chris wanted to throw the drug in the bathroom, and Chris was using it again after going to Own, which had been clean for two weeks, the appeal was too strong. everything is realistic. <br /> <br /> Watch the film for excellent distribution, excellent music and an almost true story of addiction.
