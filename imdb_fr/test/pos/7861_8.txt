It is difficult to know in which category to classify this film. Most of the films in this period of American history are westerns, but here, instead of the vast plains of the west, the action is almost entirely limited to a claustrophobic girls' boarding school in Louisiana. . <br /> <br /> The film begins with Amy, a young girl, walking through the woods, picking mushrooms, and falling on Corporal John 'McBee' McBurney, a wounded Union soldier, to whom she returns . school. We know that he is not a particularly nice person when he kisses her on the lips to prevent him from warning a Confederate patrol, although she told him she was twelve years old. <br /> <br /> Once back to school are divided on what should be done with their new guest, some think they should take care of him until his wounds are healed, while others think it is a betrayal not to deliver it to Confederate forces at the first opportunity. The old group wins and he recovers gradually. In doing so, her presence has an impact on all the girls who have had no man on the site for a long time, including a young teacher and the director who had already had a romantic relationship seems to have been with his own brother. McBee strives to seduce them, emotionally if not physically, which causes considerable envy among girls. <br /> <br /> This movie has been rated at fifteen, but it's certainly not meant for young viewers so much for sexual content as little is actually shown, but a lot is involved, and for a very grueling scene that made me squirm more than any other scene in a movie I've seen for some time. It's interesting to see Clint Eastwood face the guy, instead of being heroic, his character is both unpleasant and, most of the time, at the mercy of the women around him. The acting is solid, not just from Eastwood but from all the actresses, including the young Pamelyn Ferdin who played Amy.
