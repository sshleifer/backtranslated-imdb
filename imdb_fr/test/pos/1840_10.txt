Gracie (Minnie Driver), a woman in her twenties, is on a waiting list for a heart transplant. Bob (David Duchovny) has just experienced the tragedy of losing his wife in a car accident. We can guess the result. Gracie receives the heart of Bob's wife, although they do not know each other yet ... yet! A year later, Gracie feels like a new person while Bob is just starting to think about his social life. When a friend gives him a blind date, Bob finds himself interested in the waitress, Gracie, at the restaurant where the date is. They start to see each other. How long will it take before the truth materializes and what will be the consequences? This charming, funny and touching movie is one of the best romantic comedies ever made. The two stars are dazzling, the couple that only heaven could meet and the actors, Bonnie Hunt, Jim Belushi and Carroll O'Connor, are just as wonderful. Taking place near Chicago, the neighborhood is also charming and beautiful. Let's do this for the costumes and the script. If you know someone who's ga-ga about gay love stories, you'll always be in their good graces if you show him this beautiful movie.
