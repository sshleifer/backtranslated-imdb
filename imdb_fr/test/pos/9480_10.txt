The first time I saw this DVD, I was happy not only because it was the first time in decades that the band was broadcasting something, but also because the DVD itself was extremely noisy. Jimmy Page obviously can not live with quiet music, I guess. I must say however that during the concert at the Royal Albert Hall, they expanded "How many times more" and "Moby Dick" too long. Other than that, it was exquisit. My favorite song of all time is now on this DVD. Fouled on the feet. It's either this one or "At the moment of my death". In this song, Jimmy really plays this thing. Ever seen Randy Rhoads play? Well, Jimmy plays exactly like him, except that his guitar is lower.
