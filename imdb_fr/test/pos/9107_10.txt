I've been waiting for this movie for so many years! The best part is that it matches my visions! This is a must for any Tenacious D fan or real Jack Black. It's really great to see JB, KG and Lee on the big screen! It's not a true story, but we do not care. D is the largest group on earth! I had the soundtrack of the film last week and I listened to it all the time. Seeing the movie was pure happiness for me and my husband. We both met Jack and Kyle after 2 different shows of Tenacious D and also saw them when they shot Weezer. We left this concert after the D finished playing. Nobody can beat their show! Long live the D !!! :RE
