This version of "The Lost Horizon" is actually not a bad movie. I think the problem is that people like to listen to musicals, especially those of the 70's. I saw the movie when it was released in 1973 (I was 10) and I really enjoyed the music . (Burt Bacharach has always been a favorite.) The story is fun, the acting is good and, technically, it's great. Of course, there are one or two rather silly dance numbers, but hey, you can not win them all. I have this film on video and I watch it from time to time ... and I appreciate it every time!
