This movie is like a bastard. UNTIL the musical numbers look like MIND F * CK, but softer, more like a caress. MINES FOREPLAY. The depressing atmosphere caused by the speed and desperation of the characters can be pretty. Kill-Yourself-Awesome UNTIL you get the musical numbers. It's a very good film. Optimistic. Bizarre. Manic-depressive (bipolar). That's all! THIS FILM IS BIPOLAR. anyway see him. THIS IS A MUSIC !!! WITH DEPTH !!!! If you like existential slags like The Stranger or Waiting for Godot, then you probably have a real kick for this one. I had to get the DVD on Amazon.com for about $ 12. Oh & the rock songs. Well they rock but they're not rock, like calypso, jazz, Broadway, but by Grace Chung, and I can not find the soundtrack NOWHERE <but I want the songs to be great and the dances to be so fun.
