Among all the seasons and episodes of THE TWILIGHT ZONE, having seen all the great stories breathtaking and provoking thought, this one stands at the top. It is true. This story, entitled THE HUNT, is at the top of many of the best scripts in the history of television. <br /> <br /> It is true that there are no interplanetary space flights nor cracks inexplicable over time. There is no living nightmare, no sudden change of scenery. Our protagonist apparently has nothing extraordinary to deal with. <br /> <br /> The main character, played by the famous actor Arthur Hunnicut, comes out of his cabin in the hills, accompanied by his faithful dog, chasing the raccoon. Because the raccoon is an essentially nocturnal hunt for animals, it is done in the moonlight. <br /> <br /> The man and the dog soon meet a big raccoon who jumps on the dog's back and tries to drown him in a pond. The man intervenes to help his dog. There is a kind of quasi-blackout, after which we see them on the shore, in an extended position, almost asleep. <br /> <br /> Calling his dog by his name old man leaves to go home. When he arrives, he finds the woman crying and insensitive to his conversation. He also observes the visitors who come and go to his home, paying tribute to him, and giving words to comfort his wife. <br /> <br /> He always seems puzzled by the strange welcome and the events around the Home Cabin, where the man and tearing take off in a long walk down the road, where he points out that he is not remembered for such a long fence in these areas. He ends up falling on a rather important guy, dressed in an outfit similar to his suit, hat, work shirt. They are at a door, which leads to an area where a lot of smoke rises freely. The doorkeeper is too enthusiastic to try to convince the man to enter. Rip seems displeased. The Man at the Door tells the Old Man that he can enter, but that the dog should stay outside, offering to watch the animal for him. The man will not have one, and the two will continue on their way. <br /> <br /> After a little more hiking, they fall on a second closed entrance where the guardian of the door recognizes the man and welcomes him. When the old man tells what happened on the road, he explains how the guy on the other door tried to separate the man and the dog and added: "Without a dog allowed, it must be a hell " The 2nd Gate Keeper said he was right! "That's exactly what it is!" <br /> <br /> Our family lost our first dog, Lady-a Mixed Lab, in October 1981. About 6 months later, as we wished, the woman (Deanna) and myself with our their daughters (Jennifer 9 and Michelle 6) watched this episode on television, WGN TV, Channel 9 Chicago. Well, all that seemed perfectly logical to us at that time. <br /> <br /> We are sure that anyone who has had this relationship with a dog in the family would agree. The episode always brings a state of tears to the eyes of this writer now 60 years old.
