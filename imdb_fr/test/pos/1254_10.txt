Now, it's certainly one of the lightest stories Bruce Willis has ever seen yet, yet it's touching. I really like Bruce's style and personality, I did not like everything he's ever experienced, but he brought it to me at the "Big-time" for most of his film projects. <br /> <br /> The story begins ..... It's power, trust and style with a Capitol 'S'. He drives a Porshe, he lives well, in a sumptuous area with a grand view of the beautiful city. It's Russell Duritz. He is an image consultant to those who are at the top or the height. His praise, he is Russell Duritz, he knows what it takes to do it. It just seems that while life is moving fast and it's laying on foundations, there's a problem, an intruder at home, the alarm has been triggered! <br /> <br /> Russell does not seem to be able to understand (for the moment) what is happening to him. It's different and yet it's kind of familiar. A little boy who looks exactly like him. As their lives follow each other, there seems to be a reason that shouts to him: "You have an unfinished business that you have to deal with now!" <br /> <br /> Amy, the young support woman of The Story is probably the best balance he has seen and had in his life. She works with him, supports his "ego" and yet, she is in love with Russell. Absolutely. With Rusty, his "me" past is now in the picture and speaks a kilometer to the minute, singing too late at night, everything that was fundamental becomes like jelly! <br /> <br /> Willis is fun, egocentric and sometimes baffled by this adorable Disney modern classic, "The Kid", and adds his extra-sturdy side kick. story from childhood to adult and back to the adventure of childhood. Chi McBride is an inspiring support character because he is the heavyweight champion who teaches the "little" Rusty how to box up to defend himself against bullies on the playing field. <br /> <br /> Overall is a real winner of a movie with even Lillie Tomlin as secretary and help of Russell. I had seen it originally in 2000, then again years later, with the same pleasure. It's a brilliant family comedy that has a great ending that will warm the hearts of all Disney fans. Highly recommended (*****)
