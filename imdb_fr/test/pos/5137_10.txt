HOOT talks about these three teenagers trying to save a group of burrowing owls. now for me, I think they are right, they oppose what is right and what is wrong. In this film, Roy Eberhardt (Logan Lerman), a young boy, left Montana for Florida. and as soon as he gets on the bus, Dana Matherson begins to intimidate her the next day. Roy hits the bully and gets out of the bus in pursuit of the mysterious boy running. After all, Roy finally meets the boy named Mullet Fingers (Cody Linley) and his nickname, his step sister Beatrice (Brie Larson), gave it to him because he can catch Mullets with his bare hands. Be that as it may, Mullet Fingers and Roy become friends and partner with Beatrice to stop the construction of a new pancake restaurant. Mullet Fingers is the one behind all the vandalism that happened there. In addition, he is bitten by one of the dogs who monitor the site. so they stood up against the muckle driving the bulldozer and everyone could see the owls. It turned out to be a great film because it showed that children could make a difference in life by fighting what was right and what was wrong. that's what's great about this movie. he teaches everyone about wildlife and its importance.
