Stephen Hawkings is a genius. He is the king of geniuses. Watching this movie, I feel stupid. But it's a good movie. Not very fun, but very very intriguing. The film focuses on Stephen Hawkings, a man who gives Einstein the air, and his theories and scientific discoveries about the universe, time, galaxy and black holes. Everyone, at one time or another during a really high high, arrives at a time when they think they have understood the universe and the cosmos and that they swear as soon as they are sober that they will write everything. Well here is a man who has really kept this feeling for more than six hours. Here is a man who, despite Lou Gehrig's illness, has become the greatest spirit the world has ever seen. Look at this and listen to how he formulated theories about black holes. Impressive. You will not be the same after seeing it.
