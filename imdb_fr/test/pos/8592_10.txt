When it comes to political films, I usually feel empty. They generally adopt a moralistic stance and you have a clear and positive story as if it were a kind of Batman movie. <br /> <br /> But with Lumumba, this is the first film I've seen that shows politics for what it is, and the real problems related to the desire to govern a country of broken people who knew no rule other than violence. There was neither good nor bad, there were just interests and conflicts of interest. This is the only political film in my opinion that really gets out of learning something. This film shows that you can not say what you want for a country, but what the country wants from you. <br /> <br /> That's why I disagree with a lot of things. critics who say that everyone comes from bad, I think they come from too idealistic, (the Belgians want the perfect colony, Lumumba wants a perfect unity Congo, Tshombe wants wealth and wealth, America wants to perfect ally against communism, Russia wants the perfect help for communism). And the Congolese? They are used and abused (best example in the film when General Janssens tells his black troops that your government lied to you and he leaves them all in a tumult), they are always pushed to support that person or another. <BR/> <br /> This film shows in politics that an error can be expensive and that everyone is mistaken on error until it degenerates and ends up destroying the country. Their intentions may be good (or at least in the opinion of the characters), but it is everyone's mistakes that led to the fall of the Congo. I do not think anyone is bad in this film, I just think they want too many people who are tired of giving and want to start taking it. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's not just the best political film, it's a great movie in general. Interpreting is fabulous (Eriq Ebouaney, Lumumba being a perfect cast, I really believe it), a perfect script, a perfect editing rhythm and a higher production value than I expected for a film from Central Africa. To watch absolutely.
