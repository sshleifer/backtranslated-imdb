The highlight of this film is without a doubt his casting. <br/> <br /> Diana Rigg, George C. Scott, Bernard Hughes, to name just a few examples. <br /> <br /> I have accumulated more time in hospitals and with doctors over the years than I care to think. <br /> <br /> This comedy attacks the pump and pretense in all aspects of our society, through the establishment of one of its institutions "Most Haughty" ... the medical profession. <br /> <br /> The idea that such things might be possible might shock some, but delight everyone with a perspective of experience. <br /> <br /> Dr. Brock (Scott) is undergoing a monumental crisis of monumental proportions before our eyes as we, and him, fall in love with the prospect of his involvement with Miss Drummond (Rigg). <br /> <br /> The thread of the absurd is woven into this marvelous mixture of irony that the hospital seems to kill its own workers who do not handle their affairs well. <br /> <br /> The climax is unpredictable (unless you're in it) and made even more hilarious if you guess. <br /> <br /> It's not everyone's humor, of course, and there are some incredibly fun "dark moments" if you're open to it. I loved every minute and I was delighted to see it on DVD.
