OK, maybe he does not deserve an Oscar. Or a Golden Globe. Or any price, by the way. The acting is not exceptional, there's no reason to give credit to the staging, and it's just another half-gore horror film of the 21st century that most people consider it decent. Or maybe even terrible. But in my opinion, all this does not matter. And that's because I had a good time watching this movie. <br /> <br /> Of course, the first 40 minutes are pretty slow, but as the movie progresses, you'll like something, if you're like me, and everyone should be watching this movie. And it is: to seek 2 hours of pleasure, a blind violence. (And a crazy ending that I will not spoil.) Yes, there are many flaws in this film, but do not let the list of actors on the cover before you fool. Hilton is offering a decent performance that no one has seen coming. Even her biggest enemies, like me and my friends, had to admit that she surprised us a lot with her barely credible acting skills and a striptease that was not as bad as a promise from a pop-up online, but still not. unbearable to advance or turn off the DVD. <br /> <br /> The violence that provoked me surprised me; nobody at school or on the horror board talked about it as if they were talking about "these new movies called" Saw "and" Hostel "" but I can safely say that "Wax" is more graphic than Saw , and some scenes of death are actually quite disturbing. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, I'm not surprised that House of Wax has not made its way into the IMDb Top 250, but it's definitely worth it.
