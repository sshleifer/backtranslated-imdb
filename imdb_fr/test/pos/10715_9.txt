Inexplicably, I watched this film for the first time just a few days ago and I understood from the start what all this fuss is about. This film caught my attention from beginning to end and covered the whole range of emotions (and perhaps helped me to discover some of the ones I did not know.) <br /> <br /> Dustin Hoffman absolutely shines under the name of Ted Kramer. He is absolutely convincing as a man who has to juggle at least three different challenges in life: a jailed husband, a workaholic leader and a loving father. Meryl Streep as Joanna Kramer was less at the center of the film, simply because Joanna had been away for a good part of the time, but when she was on screen, she gave Hoffman a run for her money. The real star character, however, was (in my opinion) to be the young Justin Henry in the role of Billy Kramer. Children are still the innocent victim in a marital breakdown, and Justin seemed absolutely natural and quite credible in this role, as he was dealing with conflicting emotions around his mother and his adaptation to life with dad, before he the confusion about why he should leave his father when it's his mother who left him. Young Justin did not seem to miss a beat in this very difficult role. <br /> <br /> In the end, it's an excellent movie worthy of an Oscar whose only weak point is what I thought was really disappointing. The decision to embark on a happy and peaceful end, which was totally unrealistic given the destructive battle that Ted and Joanna had waged for the guard. But there is not much to complain about here. <br /> <br /> 9/10
