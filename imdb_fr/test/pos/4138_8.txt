The best performance of Gary Busey in a fluid biography. Since he had a musical background, he was able to compose his own songs and it really works. It is always good to see this excellent actor, Don Stroud (one of the crickets) and Charlie Martin Smith too. <br /> <br /> One out of 10. Best performance = Gary Busey. Fortunately, Mr. Busey was nominated for the Oscars for this, losing by Jon Voight in COMING HOME. A low budget film that does not disappoint, with GREAT SONGS from Mr. Holly. I hope that has made a lot of dough. Busey has never been so popular again for a variety of reasons, but luckily, he has an excellent resume.
