Absolutely amazing! Humor, catchy music and anti-war message make this movie probably the best movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> First of all, I love the skill of this movie, especially in Vietnam. ground. It is interesting to see how ridiculous the army officials responsible for implementing the project are. Follow this with the grave situation of the present war, then the conclusion (which leaves me boiling with anger at the war); and yet there is absolutely no violence on the screen. Wow. <br /> <br /> In addition, the music is really cool. But what is very unique in this musical (unlike Evita or Wizard of Oz, for example) is that the lyrics do not tell the story. The mood is too (with the visuals and dialogue between songs): "Donna" is a catchy song that highlights the good mood, while "Flesh Failures" has a powerful, intense beat, in a tone minor. <br /> <br /> In addition, I notice that the scene of LSD is not very flattering. Now, I will definitely not use drugs (although I never intended to do so). <br /> <br /> All in all, it's an amazing movie. The only negative comment I can say is that it is sometimes difficult to hear the dialogue. But who cares? 10/10 stars!
