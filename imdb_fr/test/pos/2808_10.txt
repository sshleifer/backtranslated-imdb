It does not matter that nobody here likes this film, that's what this criticism says. Lou Diamond Phillips is great in this comic role. This line about train ab and c is now for me an instant classic, the cg is awesome, yeah train looks a bit fake, but the wow extraterrestrials do they ever rock, Todd Bridges, where is Arnold and M Drummond,, wow, he's out of the woods, I guess that's what prison does to you. A high-speed train goes to Las Vegas with the senator to allow him to deliver a great speech, a meteor just hit, and now all day, extraterrestrials are unleashed on board the train and our policeman hero must save the situation to make matters worse, his ex-wife is arguing with him. I just thought this movie was so wonderful, to see absolutely if you like action.
