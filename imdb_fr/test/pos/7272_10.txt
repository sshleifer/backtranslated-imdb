Wow! I chose this on the rental shelf because I loved Robert Carlyle and Jonny Lee Miller in 'Trainspotting'. It's a phenomenal film. he has action, romance, suspense, intrigue and spirit. When I was not laughing, I was at the edge of my seat. This is definitely a film I would recommend to people who appreciate the intelligent dialogue and a new perspective of the 18th century. This movie has everything to keep me happy!
