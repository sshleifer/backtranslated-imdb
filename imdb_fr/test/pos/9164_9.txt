I would recommend this as the most successful attempt to date to make a film about the Soviet war in Afghanistan. And it is a very honest and responsible image from small details of uniforms and weapons to human relations, the routine of war and the landscapes of Central Asia. It was shot in Tajikistan right after the withdrawal of the troops that took place in 1989 and not in 1985. The Italian star, Mr. Placido, was just perfect in the role of Major Bandura. Other characters also seemed very natural, especially officers drunk :-) The scenario seems a little confused in the end, but it could be an impact of the civil war in Tajikistan that had begun just during the shooting of the film. The whole film crew had to escape sometimes even under fire. The last scene is purely "harakiri" and reminded me of the last sentence of a famous samurai film: "We won all the battles but lost the war". It could also be a metaphor for the collapse of the USSR - the big country that allows the offended little child to shoot himself in the back.
