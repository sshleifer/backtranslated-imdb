An image featuring Danny Devito and Billy Crystal. They are both famous actors and, in this charming comedy, they try to kill their pet peeve. The bane of Billy Crystal, who is his ex-wife, stole his book and put his name on it. Danny Devito's pet peeve is his evil mother. Billy Crystal is a writer and teacher apparently and Danny Devito is one of his students. This comic classic is very entertaining and for all ages. <br /> <br /> Danny Devito seems to behave like a child in this film because of his devilish mother who belittles him all the time. She says things like, "You do not have friends!" and when Billy Crystal fell, she said, "Bury him before he stinks the basement!" She also poses Danny calling him "Lard Ass!" and other things just to make him angry.
