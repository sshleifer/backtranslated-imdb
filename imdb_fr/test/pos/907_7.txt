This is one of L & H's short films most often cited as the first "real" L & H teaming and perhaps one of their best silent traits. J. Piedmont Mumblethunder (Ollie) is a millionaire who came to the docks to greet his nephew Philip, whom he has never seen before. At first, Ollie laughs with everyone when this strange little man disarms and draws a lot of attention by his behavior during his medical examination, but he is very humiliated when it turns out to be the man that he is supposed to support. be greet. He was told that Philip was a good boy, but he had a weakness: women. Mumblethunder and Philip left to go home, but their journey is interrupted by Philip dancing a little dance every time he sees a woman, then chases her. Huge crowds gather whenever this happens, not so much because he runs after the skirts, but because Philip himself wears a skirt (a kilt). Finally, Mumblethunder manages to drag Philip into a tailor's shop to ask him to give him appropriate pants, but Philip also escapes to chase other skirts. There are a lot of laughs all around. It's also nice to see a short film like this because boys are not exactly the characters we know and love. Ollie is pretty much his usual character, but it's such a pleasure to see Stan acting so different from his usual child-man character. This shows that he was not a pony at one turn and that he excelled in other types of roles when given the opportunity. With a run time of 19 minutes, it is soft and short, offering classic liners that still hold me in the mesh.
