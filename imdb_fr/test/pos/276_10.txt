I was half asleep as I watched a selection of late-night shorts - but I straightened out the first images of "I Shout Love" and I could not leave the eyes of its duration, its perfect length and perfect. With an incredibly fast pace and performance, this film retains its funny, sad and insightful tone. The credits at the end went so fast and in such a small format, I had to go online to find the person responsible for this master work. What a nice surprise to see the name of Sarah Polley, a major actress that we see too rarely. <br /> <br /> Kristen Thomsen (Tessa) and Matthew Ferguson (Bobby) perform rich and touching performances in the throes of breakup. As they work on a repeat of Tessa's favorite moments after they come together, the two actors reveal the dimensions of their characters and their relationships in a way that will only honor their talents - and the skills of the director / writer. The film creates a moving narrative with moments of laughter and sorrow. <br /> <br /> "I Shout Love" is without a doubt one of the biggest and most memorable shorts I expect to see. He has wit, heart and stunning originality. It matters.
