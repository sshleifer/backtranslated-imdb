The best fan-boy movie I have ever seen save save "Free Enterprise". <br /> <br /> In a way, it reminded me of Kevin Smith's first film. <br /> <br /> If you make any kind of role-playing movie, this movie will probably make you laugh often at its insatiable fun. Do not expect a big budget here, the acting is also sometimes debatable, but it really adds to the fun of the atmosphere they create. The scenario is really fun, with many moments of wit that are worth living. <br /> <br /> The bard who gets killed always makes me roll. The sexually confused player also made me smile a little. But in the end ... It was just a good movie showing better moments in the life of some geeks having fun with the role play. <br /> <br /> If you are bored and you have entered a role play, it will do very well for a distraction. A real treat unexpected.
