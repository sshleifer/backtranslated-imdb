Dolemite is for me an object of my deepest affection. It's all there: a bunch of prostitutes fighting karate, Dolemite punching his belly in the belly of Willie Green (director Martin), high heels and 100-gallon hats printed with dalmations. Moore's unique comic raps, toast, are close to the roots of hip hop. No wonder Dr. Dre mentioned "Dolemite" 3 times in his classic album "The Chronic". Add the best character list for a movie, like the excited preacher, the hamburger pimp and, of course, "the one nobody knows until the time has come". We must thank the director of Urville Martin, who should not be as attracting as much attention as he should in cinema fan circles (I searched for a copy of his films and those of Fred Williamson at all. beginning). 70 years old for years and can not find them). <br /> <br /> Many people are really depressed by this film and say that it's really bad, and it's true that you can see DP Nicholas Josef Von Sternberg, for whom I think was a very early effort), there is a lot going on for this movie. Number one, there is no other movie like that. Second, you'll see Rudy Ray Moore doing a cinematic version of his toasts, as well as anyone who has NOT seen the outrageous show of Moore's live act: he'll be living the life of his superpimp cartoon character coming to the life. The action scenes are rather mediocre, but the dialogue of the characters when they speak is more than compensated. It's full of strange little details (like the fact that the Hamburger Pimp wears a Dolemite t-shirt upside down) was it intentional or did the guy just take the shirt that was on the set and the What keeps you coming back to watch it again and again. <br /> <br /> At least I have it. <br /> <br />
