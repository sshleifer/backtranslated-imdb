"Murder by Numbers" stars Ryan Gosling and Michael Pitt, two rebellious high school students who are satisfied with the perfect murder to defeat their broken self-esteem. Sandra Bullock plays the heroic thorn in the path of their plans as Det. Cassie Mayweather. This is far from being a mystery of traditional murder as the film graciously reveals the murderers (Gosling and Pitt). The film focuses instead on the goals of their murders and whether they have the means to commit the perfect murder. <br /> <br /> The title itself was rightly chosen for various reasons, including the fact that the "Numbers" of the title are the most vocal. The angle that focuses on the reasons that motivated these heinous killings will haunt you with his frightening dialogue (especially that of the senseless boys), but he has not fully explored the origins of what led them to their murderous frenzy. The characters are captivating. You have the rich kid Richard (Ryan Gosling) and the smart but socially awkward Justin (Michael Pitt). At school, they claim they despise each other and even share a penchant for classmate Lisa (Agnes Bruckner), but outside of school they are allies and collaborate in school. a ritual in which murder is a flight to free the spirit. <br /> <br /> Of course, the story involving the boys seems exciting, but it is relegated to the background a more trivial secondary plot involving Det. Mayweather (Bullock), who presumes their killings are due to discrimination (hence Gosling's arrogant air) and unexplained features, but manages to do it right. At first, the public can despise the character of Cassie because she is very stubborn and not supportive. She shows domination and control over her junior partner Sam Kennedy (Ben Chaplin). Even if he tries to reason with it, he knows it's a battle he's unlikely to win. <br /> <br /> The reason for her tyrant behavior goes back to the days when Cassie was the sad victim of a crime that left a permanent mental scarring on her. This parallel story does not have much space in this film, partly because it offers nothing of interest to the main plot (the murderous madness of the boys). It also offers some developments to the character of Bullock in the film, but it's only a half-assigned and not very fulfilling job. I would have liked the devilish students to have a parallel story. The resources at their fingertips came together for the perfect crime sheet, the creative projects that allowed boys to manipulate the cops with fake evidence and lies just to avoid a life sentence. <br /> <br /> Despite the unbalanced intrigue and the useless end of the "real killer", "Murder By Numbers" shows a strong performance from a large distribution. Sandra Bullock was convincing as a ruthless cop who tries to turn her inner pain into a more positive light. Ben Chaplin shows his strength as a young detective trying to understand his partner and who is able to defend himself from his occasional tyrannical reproaches. But the thieves are the evil duo of Michael Pitt and Ryan Gosling who keep you glued to their seat waiting for what they will do next. The chemistry of the boys is reminiscent of Matt Damon-Jude Law in "The Talented Mr. Ripley".
