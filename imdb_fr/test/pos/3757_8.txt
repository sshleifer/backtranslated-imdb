I love this movie and have seen it many times. I recorded it around 1987 when it was broadcast on Channel Four, but my tape is very worn now and I would like a new copy. on the video and as far as I know has not been repeated since the 80's. I did not get an answer and it still has not been repeated. The performances are superb. The film has everything. It's funny, sad, disturbing, exciting and takes you back to school. It is extremely well paced and captures you from beginning to end. The scene in the shower room is particularly horrible. I also can not hear the Cream Badge song and not think about this movie. This film deserves to be seen by a much wider audience because it is superb. Channel Four please show again or release to video or DVD.
