A simple X file that shows that action is always equal to intelligence. The direction of Rob Bowman is clear and clear, the episode looks just as fresh as it was almost ten years ago. David and Gillian both give great performances and both seem to enjoy the lack of luggage. It's a standalone X file that even non-fans can find and enjoy. Junior Brown gives the two protagonists a chance for their money during his stage with them. It is so convincing that one could believe that the crew drove in the middle of nowhere and knocked on the first door where they came from. Bryan Cranston is intense and energetic like Patrick Crump. Since then, he confessed during interviews that he knew practically nothing of X Files before this role, which makes his execution on the ground all the more incredible. A brilliantly silent episode.
