I am watching "The Big Chill" on DVD. One of his actors is Meg Tilly. I watched it on IMDb, which led me to read Meg's biography that mentioned and reminded me of Meg's sister, Jennifer Tilly, whose filmography included "Key West", which was one of my shows favorite and my wife's. I then read all of this feed of comments. <br /> <br /> Wow, I really liked this show too and agree with all the feelings expressed about the quirkiness and uniqueness of the characters and situations. <br /> <br /> Like almost everyone, I would like it to be on DVD or available. <br /> <br /> The last reviewer said he was watching it in reruns, so I'd like to know what network, what channel, what day and what time it is. <br /> <br /> If anyone knows how to watch episodes of "Key West", let us know.
