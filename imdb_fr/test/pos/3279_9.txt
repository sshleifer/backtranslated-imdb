Thank you, Mario Van Peebles, for informing us not only of the existence of black cowboys, but also of a fascinating and easy-to-follow story. <br /> <br /> The plot, the backdrop, the music and the talent were all top notch. It was great that you used so many African-American artists to tell the story of the black cowboy. It was also good to see Billy Zane in this movie. Does he play a good guy? <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants to expand their thinking. It's an excellent film and I feel privileged to have seen it. I hope you feel the same way.
