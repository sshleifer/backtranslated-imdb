This excellent film starring Elizabeth Montgomery should have been released as a DVD. The same can be said for her earlier, also excellent film, a rape case. I only hope that my comments will prompt an enterprising soul to place Elizabeth Montgomery's TWO Films on one DVD to make it available to her many fans. I believe that the role of this excellent actress was unfortunately stereotyped by her role in Bewitched and that, therefore, more serious roles were not proposed. I'm sure that if these two films, maybe even a trilogy with The Legend of Lizzie Borden, came out as a DVD, her fans would update how much they valued her acting skills.
