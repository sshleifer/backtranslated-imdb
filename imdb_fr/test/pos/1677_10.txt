I see a lot of movies in the cinema (103 this year) and I must say it's by far the best movie I've seen this year, even though it was released in 1954! <br /> <I watched this ingenious work and felt absolutely ashamed of never having heard about it before the cinema at my local art house decided to show it for a week on this which looked like a new print. <br /> <br /> The best part of the whole film must be the 28-minute break in which there is no speech or music, just the sound of the men who do the robbery. Pure quality. <br /> <br /> Although very dark in places, it is illuminated by dry humor. <br /> <br /> Few films get 10 points out of 10, but they also get a gold star for their efforts !! <br /> <br /> If you have the chance to see this movie, do not hesitate, it's a classic. <br /> <br />
