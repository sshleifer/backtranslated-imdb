In Crystal City, a group of Mormons hired horse dealers Travis (Ben Johnson) and Sandy (Harry Carey Jr.) as wagon masters to drive their caravan to the San Juan River. Throughout the journey, they first meet the quackless cart of charlatan A. Locksley Hall (Alan Mowbray) and prostitutes Denver (Joanne Dru) and Fleuretty Phyffe (Ruth Clifford). Then, the sadistic group of boys Clegg decides to join the Mormon caravan to hide the patrol led by the Crystal City sheriff who pursues them. When the Navajos cross, they are invited to visit their hamlet for a dance party. When the train of wagons is near their destination, Clegg's boys threaten the settlers, forcing Sandy and Travis to adopt an attitude. <br /> <br /> "The wagon master" is another great West of John Ford. The sequences with the oar crossing the desert and the hills are impressive. The adventure of the Mormon group is funny and very funny and the songs integrate well with the plot despite their dating. My vote is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Caravana dos Bravos" ("The caravan of the brave")
