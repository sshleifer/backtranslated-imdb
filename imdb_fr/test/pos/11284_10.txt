A warning to potential viewers of this experimental film: the nature of the images and their effects are such that it is one of those types of films that you really have to watch on film, screened. The pixelation created by the digital transfers sucks a lot of depth and adds a lot of noise to an already abstract and grainy film. However, since this movie is almost not available in all formats, I guess you'll have to do what you can. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this great artwork is courtesy of the guy who would end up giving us the shadow of the vampire. It's a dark and dirty movie of the genesis of the elements (from what I can understand character names) through a horrible and surreal process. Begotten is a very good example of what is called abject art, a stylistic approach that seeks more to understand the sense of the visceral than the thematic. <br /> <br /> And visceral describes it. Technically, there is not much going on in the film, but the emotions that it will cause you are innumerable. The very repetitiveness of certain images creates a fascinating take on the senses. The sound editing and the score in particular are impeccable and serve the images extremely well. <br /> <br /> Fans of this film should look at the short film collections on the DVD of other films, Experiments in Terror I, II and III. Such films make me more and more sure that the realm of horror lies in the abstract, the abject and non-narrative, rather than in scary stories of ghosts and murderers. <br /> <br /> - PolarisDiB
