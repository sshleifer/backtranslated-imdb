It's a very nice film and well played. It's funny and sometimes hilarious. The final is a little disappointing because it tries to pack everything in a package too neat. The film will be best remembered for its priceless vignettes: the staging of Jane Austen, the camping trip for example. B & H does not attempt to reflect the predominant attitudes towards homosexuality and bisexuality. Most characters accept sexual diversity. In this sense, it is a happy holiday on the part of the homophobic society. And it's a celebration of flexibility, a loosening of rigid sexual categories - perhaps a joyful harbinger of things to come.
