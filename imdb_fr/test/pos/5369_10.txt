I was 10 or 11 years old when this movie came out and he has been with me for 35 years since. When the film was released, all the theaters in the St. Louis area distributed, as a "lure", a packet of flower seeds bearing the name of the film, and so on. On the back of the pack, we can read in a few words ... Plant these seeds at midnight. If a white flower develops, you are saved ..... but if a red flower develops, you are doomed !!! Suffice it to say that for an eleven-year-old, I did not sow the seeds for fear of what might appear. Here is the spoiler: At the beginning of the film, you see a small tank of toys moving in the mud. On a small road, a family leaves the city and, suddenly, the camera turns back to the tank, which is full size. He rolls on the car and you see bloody limbs protruding from the wreckage, then, just as suddenly, the tank is small again. <br /> <br /> The reason this film stuck me for so long was because I had an exact toy tank like the movie !!!! Unfortunately, I do not know what happened to that, but I keep this suspicious eye since! <br /> <br /> Turn off the light, insert the DVD, prepare a sandwich and watch this movie. It is very good!!!
