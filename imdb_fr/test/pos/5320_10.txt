Leland follows the story of Leland P. Fitzgerald (Ryan Gosling), a disgruntled teenager who apparently murdered a seriously retarded peer, the brother of a girl he was dating. The question is not whether he did it or not? Leland admits it immediately ?? but rather why. Interestingly, rather than a crime drama, Leland becomes a character story, examining why people do what they do ?? not necessarily the easiest soil to plow. <br /> <br /> And Leland offers the required indie band of busted people. In addition to the main character, there is also Pearl (Don Cheadle), who is his teacher at the juvenile detention center and who immediately sees that Leland is different. We meet Leland's distant and egotistical father (Kevin Spacey in a long cameo), who never seems to be moved by what his son did. But the real aromas appear when we immerse ourselves in the Pollards, the belated child's family. First, there is Leland's girlfriend, Becky (Jena Malone), an addict who can not stay clean; his sister Julie (Michelle Williams), perhaps the most normal person in the film, who is just trying to escape; and Allen Harris (Chris Klein), a young man who lives with Pollard and is Julie's boyfriend. Finally, there is Ryan (Michael Welch), whom everyone else nicknamed Goofball, who can not communicate and seems barely aware of his environment. <br /> <br /> Leland focuses primarily on her eponymous character, but the film slowly ?? from time to time too slowly ?? sinks into everyone's life by asking the main question: why do people do what they do? While Leland speaks openly about it in a journal that Pearl allows him to keep, examining the notions of good and evil and personal responsibility, all the characters in the film face a time when they have to make the fundamental choice of their own. happiness or that of others, perhaps the most fundamental choice a human can make. And the film examines what goes into these choices and their consequences. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the film, you are simply struck by the depth of the cast. Spacey. Cheadle. Gosling. Michelle Williams. Even Chris Klein ?? These are people who, overall, tend to raise the film in which they are, and putting them together is a great idea. For a space in the middle, the film seems to stall, moving as it unfolds; For a while, he seems to be content to ask questions and not answer. But when we get home and the film begins to take shape and gets closer, Leland becomes an extremely powerful movie. Leland's explanation of the world and its actions, at the end, bring each story back to the point and all the investments you made in the film report. <br /> <br /> Saying Ryan Gosling is excellent, it's like saying the sunny day is beautiful. At this stage of his career, is it redundant ?? He is one of the best young actors working today, and it is a pleasure to see him transform this character who could have been an inimitable character into a protagonist to think. Gosling employs here such a subtlety that he hardly seems to act; he has to deal with most of the movie in front of Don Cheadle, which we know he owns the goods, and not only is he doing well, but he is also raising the game of Cheadle. Cheadle is in great shape, giving Pearl a well-rounded humanity ?? For better and for worse. Spacey is a bit monochrome, but he is the character and he manages it very well. I was surprised by Chris Klein. With this level of actor, I thought he would be buried in the mix, but he's probably giving the turn of his career so far. A great job all around. <br /> <br /> Leland is a little depressing, and again, it is slippery in places. But that ends strongly and leaves a lasting impact on the viewer (on this one anyway). There is also a subtle comment about racism in the film (in Leland's first day of class, he's the only white man in the room) that, like much of the film, is very effectively treated. I would not go so far as to call this a mandatory visit ?? some might find it too slow or too strange ?? but I thought it was one of the best movies I've seen in a long time, much louder and more satisfying than most other movies. I would recommend it ?? with the warnings above ?? if only to watch Gosling perfect his art.
