At the beginning of the film, Cnyny Johnny Cave's character tells the Weights and Measures Office that, the previous year, unscrupulous shop owners had cheated the American consumer with more money than the overall national war debt ! Then he goes out and asks a greasy green grocer to sell him a four-ounce sack of sugar (oh, the horrors !!) and a skinny chicken that his butcher's scale has generously claimed to be six pounds. after which the fur - or in this case the feathers - flies away. Uh, fly. When a racketeer in politician costume tries to derail an investigation into the derisory practices of the poultry provider, our hero becomes a lone wolf leading the weight war on behalf of housewives across America. After all, four hundred here and a quarter add up and before we know it, we have anarchy! The rumor of his intransigence soon reaches the offices of the mayor and governor, and Cagney becomes a prominent man. If that sounds silly, it's not the case - dishonest retail practices are just a tool for conspiracy (or, as Hitchcock would say, McGuffin) and while this is unknown, it works just as well here as any anthology of Treasury Agent or G-man in which the fight is directed against dubious crooks who act beyond the interests of the common good of the country. The production standards are decidedly grade B, but Cagney makes this movie a real pleasure: it was his first film out of Warner Brothers after he called for the release of his unreasonable contract, and he seems to be comfortable with it. A lot of fun - the performance presented here is smart and sparkles with its unique energy and infallible charisma. The presence of Mae Clarke gives the whole production a precise impression of Warner. Supporting players achieve solid performances and the story advances intelligently after a rocky introduction that seems to start at three or four reels in history. .
