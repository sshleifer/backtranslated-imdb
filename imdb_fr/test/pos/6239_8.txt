Despite a silly principle, ridiculous intrigues and a low budget, Tourist Trap <br /> <br /> manages to be striking. An inventive film, beautifully marked, to see absolutely. You have to throw rationality out the window to understand what the director was trying to do. If you manage to do it, you will have a good surprise. Also note that this is one of the few semi-classic horror movies that have not been spoiled by many sequels.
