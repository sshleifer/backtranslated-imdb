It's been a long time since I wanted to watch this romantic drama (with a WWII background) and now that I've done it, all I can say is that it's a real chef-d ' the work of Russian cinema! <br /> <br /> Soviet films are known for their overzealous propagandist approach, but fortunately it is devoid of any emphasis - with undeniable interest in the central tragic romance between a promising artist and a lively girl , doomed to the outbreak of war for which he is willing but he will never return. The girl (a remarkable performance of Tatyana Samojlova) is also loved by the young man's cousin and, when she does not hear from her boyfriend, gives in to him and marries her. He is, however, an aspiring concert pianist, bitter that the war has reduced his chances of success and, knowing that the girl is still devoted to the soldier, begins to neglect her. Finally, the daughter of her beloved is aware, but at the end of the film, she learned to accept this as a sacrifice for their country of origin and is content to live with his memories of him. <br /> <br /> The film presents a truly astonishing camera work that uses the screen space extremely judiciously and, by frequently adopting tracking shots, inclined planes and strong or weak angles, gives great power to the emotional drama that is developing. The individual sequences are equally impressive - two in particular: the astonishing, frenetically modified and accelerated scene in which the girl avoids an abandoned boy being trampled by a truck; and the premature disappearance of the young man in an unfortunate incident on the front, undoubtedly one of the best of the kind I have ever seen (with the sun moving away from him, symbolizing the life that was flowing from his body, as he imagined it on the wedding day, he will never have!). It is also worth noting the scene where the girl goes to her parents' home to find her, who was desperately devastated during an air raid; as well as its violent final surrender in front of the concert pianist - whom she tries to resist by slapping her several times - occurring during a subsequent air raid and making particularly effective use of a set of inflated curtains! <br /> <br /> Disappointingly, the DVD R1 of this exceptional film is a baseless affair (the RusCiCo edition contains a few supplements, but, as an export, it tends to be very expensive and difficult to find to start!); Criterion published it in conjunction with another Russian war-themed classic, BALLAD OF A SOLDIER (1959) - which my friend from the DVD rental store told me he'll be out soon ... < The only other film I've seen from this director THE RED TENT, an Arctic epic (1969, though via the much shorter American version!), A star-studded international production based on real events; given the undeniable artistic quality of THE CRANES IS FLYING, I regret to miss now his famous documentary I AM CUBA (1964) several times when I was in Hollywood at the end of last year: in addition to receiving a production theatrical one week, has been shown more than once on television accompanied by a feature film "Making Of" !!
