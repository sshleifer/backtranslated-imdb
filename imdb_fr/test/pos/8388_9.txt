Inglorious Basterds is a dark and violent comic fantasy, gloriously. Built on the frame of The Dirty Dozen, Inglorious Basterds abandons the extended training sequences of The Dirty Dozen to immediately embark on the action. During the process, Tarantino corrects one of The Dirty Dozen's main flaws by letting the bad guys time to get on screen to remind us how bad the Nazis were. The Nazis with the finest screen time until becoming the most completely human characters in the movie, making them ironically even worse monsters. <br /> <br /> Bu splash training sequences, Tarantino is also able to give us a picture of the entire war, showing us not only British, American and German soldiers, but also a glimpse of the world of civilians French and German, collaborators and resisters. <br /> <br /> It goes without saying that all Tarantino The film will have a fantastic dialogue, but when Tarantino decided to make the French characters speak German and German, in addition to adding a level of authenticity Tarantino also made sure that his dialogue in French was as lively, funny and intelligent. like his English dialogue. <br /> <br /> Example: Colonel SS Landa (Christian Waltz), a Nazi "Jewish hunter", questions the French dairy producer Perrier LaPadite (Denis Menochet). Landa suspects LaPadite of hiding a family of Jews. While exerting a slight pressure on LaPadite, Landa asks for a glass of milk. After swallowing her greedily, Landa congratulates LaPadite for her daughters and cows, "to your family and your cows, I say bravo." The word "cow" means in French cow, but it is also a vulgar name for the vagina. If reprimanded for this vulgar word game, Landa could argue convincingly that he does not understand French well enough to say so, but Landa says it that way and considers it a threat. And LaPadite understands its meaning too well. <br /> <br /> This is a very subtle play and wordplay that many audiences would never accept, or at least they could understand the subtext without knowing the exact nature of the threat. The film is rich with this kind of detail. All French and English dialogues are chosen with the same attention to detail and, although I can not swear in front of German, I imagine that it shows a similar level of competence. <br /> <br /> Inglorious Basterds begins with the phrase "Once upon a time ... in Nazi-occupied France". Personally, it reminds me of the opening of every Asterix book and film, another comic fantasy in a war-torn, occupied France. Inglorious Basterds is, like Asterix, very funny in places, although the film also becomes very serious. <br /> <br /> In his most serious moments, Inglorious Basterds reminds us that the first victims of war are compassion and the ability to relax. as in almost every lengthened sequence of the film, Tarantino finds a new way to create cruel tension at levels almost unbearable. <br /> <br /> Tarantino also reminds us that the film is dangerous, even flammable and that its power deserves respect. . <br /> <br /> If you can see this movie as I did in a room filled with savvy fans listening to every joke, you'll see this masterful film of the way it was supposed to be seen. If you are not lucky, all you will see is a very good movie that offers a dark and funny punch.
