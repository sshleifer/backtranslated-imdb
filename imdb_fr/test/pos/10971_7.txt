It was really a pleasure to see; the dialogue was - for the most part - absolutely exceptional (I thought women's roles were a little better written, which is a good surprise). The performances were uniformly very good too. Frank Gorshin exaggerates a little when he tackles his various disadvantages, but this could be an overcompensation of what I consider as weaknesses in the way the character is written; he is VERY good otherwise. Harry Groener does the same with a slightly underwritten character (Tony), slightly exaggerating some more edgy scenes of the character. Ursula Burton is excellent as Sister Theresa, as she helped the film overcome some of its weaknesses. Seymour Cassel and Louise Fletcher are a little underused here, although their work has always pleased me. Shirley Jones, Wendie Malick, Jill Eikenberry and Faye Grant are also very good (I could not help thinking that Grant reminded me a little of Catherine O'Hara); Cloris Leachman rather tears in his role, with rather good results. <br /> <br /> I wish there was a safer hand behind the camera. Sometimes the framing or staging seemed a bit off-kilter or clumsy. Close-ups seemed overused (or used erratically) for me. And we do not always go on stage as gently as we would like. Part of the "hard" approach of the federal agent (music, costumes) was too exaggerated for me as well. And the few fantastic sequences did not really work. But there are things that have been VERY well done; the opening sequence taking place in Buffalo around 1970, for example. And, frankly, all the scenes about the work of Theresa's church (I guess the writer and the actress liked the character, which helps). The scenes between Malick and Eikenberry are VERY good. <br /> <br /> The plot is probably a little too confusing - there seems to be a little too much going on to keep them all sometimes straight, and the coincidences must be a bit too much. And the end bothered me a bit (should we REALLY be motivated by the biggest problem that remains to be done to succeed?), But the journey along the way is very enjoyable. It would be nice to see more independent movies like this one. <br /> <br /> 7 of 10
