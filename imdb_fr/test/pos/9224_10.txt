People tell how horrible the screenplay was and how horrific the show was, but Rainbow Brite and the Star Stealer is really a Japanese anime for kids. If you watch the anime today, it's done in the same style and it's immensely popular. I do not think this movie was ever designed to be seen by adults. Just as I do not think it was ever intended to be serious. The things that people seem to hate about this movie are the ones I really like. Rainbow Brite is one of the best cartoon characters ever created in my opinion. She is intelligent. She's funny She cares about the environment. She cares about her friends. This film can teach a lot to young children. My little brothers even liked this movie. I must say that this film taught me a lot when I was a child. When it came out on DVD, I was the first to buy it. It's a great movie for kids. And if it's not perfect, nothing is really perfect when you look closely.
