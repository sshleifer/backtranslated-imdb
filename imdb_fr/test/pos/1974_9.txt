Yes, I noticed that there are 347 other comments, I think it's a good sign for a movie, even if some are negative. I saw this movie 2 times and a half. I love it and I will watch it again. it's very smart, but I can understand why some people would hate it. they do not receive the call. Yes, I have a strange taste in movies, but it's a great movie. some lines are so fast, like the whole scene in the Chinese restaurant. I started to laugh. that and when he was in the assembly line talking to the contact. Jude Law was wonderful, even though he was funny, trying to hide his wonderful accent. Anyway, I do not consider myself a film goddess like some critics of this movie and if you have nothing better to do than write pseudo-intellectual comments about movies you hate online, I I'm sorry for you. why do not you write about movies you like, like me? I love how everything binds, it allows you to guess, even if you are wrong. the end was interesting and not exaggerated. it was purely intelligent. I would not compare that to the matrix because I think people have a bad idea. I went into this movie without hope, apart from Jude Law and a science fiction. I was dazzled. I have no idea of ​​another Cronenburg film, but I love it for its own merit. another clever thing was the prefiguration with the dog. definitely watch this movie.
