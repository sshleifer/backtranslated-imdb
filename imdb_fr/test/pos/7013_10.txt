As for most women, this film is the ultimate film for girls. With its hot chemistry, sexy dance channels and great songs, I mean a timeless classic such as (I already have) The time of my life and the wonderful It's like the wind that makes this movie. I love Patrick Swayze in this film and he shows that he knows how to sing and dance, it's so hot. He sings "She's like the wind" in the movie. The chemistry between Swayze and co-starring Jennifer Gray is incredible. I like all the dances and everything that goes with it. But saying this Dirty Dancing 2: - Havana Nights is also great, but Patrick Swayze does it. I love songs, dance, and everything related to it, but it's not Dirty Dancing. As I said, it's an incredible movie. Please leave a third because I like to see what's going on with Patrick's character, Johnny. The character of Jennifer could have been sexier but hey Patrick compensates if you see what I mean! Excellent film and I'm glad that Billy Zane did not win the role of the film. I heard some murmurings that he was destined for the role but they discovered he could not dance.
