It's the biggest film if you want inspiration to follow your heart and never give up on your dream. Elizabeth Taylor is Velvet and in her heyday (at least from her childhood), Mickey Rooney is a cynical friend who eventually becomes his coach and they leave for the Grand steeple-chase with his beloved horse "the Pi" - for " Pirate "- only for Velvet to become the jockey and have a chance of victory. For those of you who have not seen it yet, I will not give the end, but you should see it and once you have done, you will love it. Notice a very young Angela Lansbury as Velvet's older sister.
