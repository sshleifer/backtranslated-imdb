This film should become one of the funniest movies in history. His cousins ​​A Strong Wind, Spinal Tap and Waiting for Guffman are excellent, but Best in Show takes the cake. <br /> <br /> A film about the peculiarities of dog owners who show their dogs in a competitive way, it is the subtleties of the characters that make it so good. After watching the movie about 75 times, I came to the conclusion that there was no weak character or actor in this movie. There is very little interaction between the "groups" of characters, but it only seems to add to the beauty of the film. <br /> <br /> If you watch this movie and you do not find it as funny as I bill it, watch it again. The first time I saw it, I thought it was fixable but not too hilarious. It's a film that grows on you. Definitely, a movie that you will quote frequently. <br /> <br /> Characters: Hamilton and Meg Swan: A + if you get the DVD, discover how these characters are "born", amazing that these two characters can hit it so hard on the head. And to find out that they really did not use a script, they sort of invented the problem as they went along. <br /> <br /> Gerry and Cookie Guggleman: A cookie is especially fun and it does a fantastic job selling the Cookie character. Gerry (Eugene Levy) delivers his classic stellar performance of the hilarious discombobulated type, half weaker. <br /> <br /> Stefan Vanderhoof and Scott Donalan- A + Find me a character more funny than Scott Donalan, I DARD YOU! He will always be cataloged as this character for me because he was so natural and did not seem forced at any time. Stefan (Micheal McKean) was also very good and they meet here (and a brief appearance with the Gugglemans) shows why he is still in these movies. A great actor with a razor like a spirit. <br /> <br /> Harlan Pepper- B +, I do not want it to sound like he's not funny, but it's the only act "solo", it can not be as funny as the others above. He uses the dog more than others and has some other peculiarities for him. <br /> <br /> The rest is great too, there is no weak character. See this movie at least twice. Buy it, you will not regret it.
