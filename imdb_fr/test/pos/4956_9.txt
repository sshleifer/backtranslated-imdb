OK, yes, it's bad, yes, it's complete, yes, it makes the mullet look like an Oscar but look like if I was 13, the special effects were almost nonexistent in 90% of the films, back in the good Ole days where the movies needed a scenario ... OK, so even the plot is a little fishy ... but wow I started playing in this movie when I was a child in the 80s. rock cheesy , bad special effects, but the planes an aerial fight and he had queens a vision on the soundtrack .. see even the worst things have a ray of hope .. all in all if you want a bad movie to show a 12 years who hates computer effects (if there is such a movie) it's the ideal choice
