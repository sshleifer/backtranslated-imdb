I must admit that I fell into the cynical trap of believing that Australians could not do drama unless they cry, and I am Australian. Sad, is not it? Even though this film involves crying, it does not cry dramatically and its sincere emotion is apparent. <br /> <br /> This film is also a polar. I knew what would be the end result when I started to look at it, so I tried to guess who would do it. I missed a kilometer. <br /> <br /> I was stunned to learn that director Murali Thulluri was only around 21 when he shot this film. I would love to shake his hand. He knows how to make a movie. I hope there will be more to come. <br /> <br /> All the characters we meet before the credits of the main title (about 12 minutes) are an anti-hero. All troubled in their own way and all as selfish as the next. Even when they are nice. <br /> <br /> The saddest scene in the film, and there are some that are hard to watch) is the final scene where we are officially introduced to the real main character and talked about their nephew. This scene made me cry. <br /> <br /> My faith in the Australian drama has been restored. We are masters of comedy, but I was getting tired of comedy. <br /> <br /> Murali, if you check this, you touched my soul and I can only thank you for it.
