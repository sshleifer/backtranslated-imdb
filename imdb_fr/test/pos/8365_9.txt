I am a fan of Zhang Yimou and I finally found this DVD in the shelves of a Shenzhen bookstore after a long search in many places. <br /> <br /> It's a huge departure from Zhang Yimou's previous work, especially terms of style and place. The director himself said it was the first and only time he would try to shoot a black comedy in contemporary China. You can even say that this work is experimental in nature, compared to his other well-known big-budget and formal works. <br /> <br /> Filmed with a portable camera and a wide-angle lens for the duration of the film, the speed of editing, high energy performance and naturalistic tone never let go once launched. It presents a very realistic account of modern Chinese urban sensibility, which is here in Beijing. If you like and love this kind of black humor, you will love this movie totally. Also check out the hilarious cameos of Zhao Benshan (Happy Times) and director Zhang Yimou himself. <br /> <br /> A final point to note: I find the characters in this film, as in all other Zhang Yimou films, with similar personality traits - stubbornness, always trying to beat the odds and go up auctions. Let me know your thoughts on this. <br /> <br /> David Lee
