The very first time I heard about Latter Days was when I rented DVDs and it interested me because I'm a member of the LDS church. I found this film very sincere and in many places it made me cry. The reason is that there are too many years, I knew a young man who had lived what Aaron (played by Steve Sandvoss) did at Latter Days, but unlike Aaron, this dear young man did not survive to this test. He ended up taking his life after his church, his friends and his family denied him because he was gay. There have been many people who do not think that the things shown in the film really happen nowadays, but what is sad and sad is that they do it. For those of you who are gay and young, you have to see this movie and if you are a gay Mormon, you really need to see this movie. In addition, if you get the DVD, help is provided for you in the DVD. Suicide among teenagers in the gay world is very disturbing and this film touches it, but this part is hidden to a certain extent. The acting and the music are excellent. This movie sold all the movie theaters it showed, but it was only shown in major cities and had a very limited release. That's why, for those who would like to see this movie, I would recommend the DVD. The only people I know who do not like the movie are members of my own church and they did not see the movie because of the gay subjects and the LDS church. See the film, live the story and feel the emotions expressed in this film which, in my opinion, will not be disappointed.
