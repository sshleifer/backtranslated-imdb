Joe (Wes) and Jim (Adam) re-familiarize us with the beauty, isolation (psychological and physical) and total terror of the "most popular murder" in the Navaho Southwest area. The characterizations, the parameters and the plot are built continuously. even if, sometimes, the personal aspects leave us wanting more "..". with some interesting alternatives like "who did it?" Flashbacks (eg Peter Fonda, happy to see it) provide clues, but they do not go where you might think. Comics (for example, the preacher) are sweet and appropriate. Where "Skinwalkers" and "Coyote Waits" begin to slip ... "Thief" engages the clutch and four wheels around the next turn, never really sure what's out there. Disagree with Joe Leaphorn's manic comment to Jim Chee of "slowing down" for potholes. False ... there are no potholes in the plot, just tracks to follow. At the next episode! Great pictures (as always), attractive characters and more to explore!
