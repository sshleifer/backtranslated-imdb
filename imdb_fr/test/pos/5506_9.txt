Many people have said that this movie was not a good movie. From a horror point of view, I agree, it was not very scary, there were horrible ways to torture yes (the hooks go where they should not) but not scary. but it was a good movie from a comic point of view, I thought it was hilarious, that snider acted so badly with his stupid theological questioning and every second word he said was pronounced as "what is __, set ______ ", then the angry crowd at home with one of them holding a sign saying" we're not going to take it "(which is a twisted sister's song in the band, but I think the part that made me laugh the most was the guy's wife who was dead and snider was holding her up and making her dance, when I saw that I was bursting into tears ... so I would not recommend it to lovers of horror, but to those who love horror for his comedy, I recommend this movie 100%
