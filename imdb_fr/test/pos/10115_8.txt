The radio will make you laugh, cry, feel. This story based on a true story is the perfect film for a couple. There is enough for both. Cuba Gooding Jr. carries the main character to perfection. His performance is worthy of an appointment to an academic award. The film's compassion is obvious. The film evokes a lot of emotions. I sincerely enjoyed this movie.
