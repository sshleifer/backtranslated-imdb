The only conceivable flaw of this film is its title !! Please stop comparing it to the first one! I did it in my previous comment only to separate it from the first one. If you have not seen the movie and are curious, forget TOTALLY the first and invent another name. There is nothing like it and has a mood all its own. He is an excellent comedian in the mid 80s. I seriously doubt that such big names in this cast made the film because they were broken or even wanted to do the first one again. Anyone who has always wanted to kick the posh aristocracy should love this little opus. I maintain that the only reason this is in the bottom IMDB 100 is because of its title. I usually hate movies like these (ie adam sandler, farrell, farrelly bros ....), but this movie always makes me laugh hysterically. I do not know, maybe it's like a bad relationship that I can not get away with or just a ridiculous guilty pleasure. Anyway, it's the most underrated movie of the 80s behind "The Stunt Man". <br /> <br /> Robert Stack - We love you !!! (1919-2003)
