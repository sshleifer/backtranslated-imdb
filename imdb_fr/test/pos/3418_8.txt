... and normally I do not like surprises !! Watch this film by chance in a South African motel, second week of motorcycle vacation for three months in ZA. In addition to being well played and played, it helped me to understand the country's problems enormously. I just watched the "Million Dollar Baby" and I had to watch Hillary Swank since the name seemed a little familiar and her acting was superb. I did not know she was the lawyer of the "Red Dust". Well now, I'm not afraid she's disappearing like so many of Clint's acolytes before ... Now I'm asked to write ten full lines of comments, which is pretty ridiculous because I wrote this that I wanted to write. OK, that's it: I think if you come from a Western country, especially from Europe, watching will help you understand a little better why what's going on there! So that will hopefully fill ten lines.
