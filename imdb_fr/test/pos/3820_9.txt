I caught this show many times when I was young and playing tilt. My parents loved it. Now, in syndication, I feel how they feel. This show did what the limits and the twilight zone (new and old) of origin could not do. This show used old ideas and really original ideas. <br /> <br /> I still can not believe that Jonathan Glassner and Brad Wright did that. These guys were producers on Stargate sg-1. The show kept the audience rooted in history and created a truly scary atmosphere. This is what did not exist in the new twilight zone. Rod serling was added to the fear, the forest that lit up the atmosphere. <br /> <br /> The end, good or bad, was a frightening time. You could never predict what would happen. I always try to find the seasons on DVD.
