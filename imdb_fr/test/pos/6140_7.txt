I had not planned to see this movie, but I was not disappointed when a friend dragged me. Although there is no real surprise here, the guys are doing pretty well with their seemingly modest budget. If you've seen the trailer, you probably know what to expect from this type of movie and there's a pretty constant joke here, with some classic moments, the highlight being probably a great backtrack on what the guys were in the 1980s. Also, I read elsewhere that the end was a disappointment, but I found it agreeably different from what I expected of that kind. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie will not change your life, but there are enough laughs there to entertain you all the way through.
