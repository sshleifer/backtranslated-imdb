This film was a modern scarface. It kept me on my guard. This film is one of those rare epic films that makes you want to make a sequel. I particularly liked Damian Chapa, his performance deserved an academy, which he deserved for blood in the blood outside. The only thing I did not like was the backstage because it did not show the intensity of the film, and I would have liked to see less scenes narrated.But the movie was great and it's in my top ten movies of all time.More the acting was awesome there was not a bad scene in the movie, I loved it, Jennifer Tilly was perfect as well as the whole cast.I do not see how anyone do not like this movie, it was a super. Without a doubt a must.
