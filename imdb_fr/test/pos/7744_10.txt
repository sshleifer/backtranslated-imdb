"Tempest" is a somewhat self-indulgent discursive film. But like Lord Byron, another visitor to Greece, protested to his friend John Murray about his "Don Juan", as indulgent as himself and discursive, "That may be ridiculous, but is not it? life, is not it the thing? " > <br /> The links with Shakespeare's "Storm" may seem, as another commentator puts it, a little tenuous. But review the movie after replaying "The Storm" and they will look much closer. This film is tainted with irregularities, it is its painful mixture of simple normal narratives and sudden and jarring improvisations, especially between Cassavetes and Rowland. But to be honest, these scenes are the most remarkable and the most captivating of the film, even the most difficult to watch. <br /> <br /> The music of this film, composed by Stomu Yamashta, is also neglected. Especially well, it's the perfect little piece played to accompany the afternoon nap, while people, animals and, apparently, the whole island collapse to sleep away from the hottest part of the afternoon. It's a sublime moment, and representative of the best aspect of this film and the thing that keeps it a bit unified, the fact that (apart from the many flashbacks and the end), it's the story of a day on an island, from waking to night. <br /> <br /> Overall, I would rather watch this movie a hundred times rather than once seeing a spectacular piece of Hollywood shit. And in fact, I've probably watched it dozens of times. Most of the time, I see something that I missed before. <br /> <br /> (Confession: I'm biased, this is the second film I brought to see my Greek-American female goddess.) <br /> <br /> Notes about this movie: < <br /> <br /> - It was Molly Ringwald's first film, along with Sam Robards'; <br /> <br /> - The film was not shot on an island, but in Gytheion, the southern tip of the isolated Mani Peninsula of Greece's Peloponnese; <br /> <br /> - The primitive special effects (to current standards) were created by Bran Ferren, who later became head of Disney Imagineering, and later he was an advisor to the US intelligence community; <br /> <br /> - Paul Mazursky, the director, chose the title of his recent autobiography, "Show Me the Magic", from the screenplay of "Tempest".
