"Haggard: The Movie" is well written, well directed and well played. There are many moments of laughter and great skateboarding scenes featuring Margera. The scenes in West Chester, PA are beautifully filmed and the screenplay is simply funny. What I like in the film is that instead of being another unhealthy love story or another version of "Jackass", the film presents a dark and funny look at the ruptures, from an angle different. Most break-ups feature a naive woman overthrown by an unfaithful man. She then finds Mr. Right and has to tell his ex-cheater to get lost. This film takes a look at the emotional roller coaster of an angry man ... without taking himself too seriously. Ryan Dunn is doing a great job as a convicted man and with Bam Margera and Brandon Dicamillo as your best friends trying to help you through this difficult time, how can you take something too seriously? It's obvious that Margera and Co. are incredibly talented both behind and in front of the camera. I look forward to their future films and projects.
