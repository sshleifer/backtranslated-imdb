One of the two best movies of the year. A film well filmed, well written, well mounted with an exceptional cast. Lau Ching Wan and his friends (Dayo Wong Chi Wa, Anthony Sun Wong Chau, Francis Chun Yu Yu, Jordan Chan Siu Chun, Cheung Tat Man) had great chemistry before the film and their friendship shows in their performances. Theresa Lee plays her comic role well (although she looks a lot like a female version of Michael Wong, her gag seems to be a foreign-born Chinese surrounded by native HKers.) Since 1. fans have taken over alt.asian -movies and 2. John woo's Hardboiled. Of course, the end was expected, but I feel better encouraging the cops than a group of young gang members. Very pleasant.
