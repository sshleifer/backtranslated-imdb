The big names in the movie industry tried to do their part for the war effort, and Charlie Chaplin was no exception. This patriotic and propagandist image is part of his contribution, even though the war was almost over by the time of its publication. The tramp goes to war, performs with humor acts of heroism and strikes the Kaiser in the ass. It's a very funny movie, although I do not think it's one of the best. It's with "A Dog's Life" his best production for First National before he made his first masterpiece "The Kid". These are his first three reels, which contain sustained gags and more elaborate than he could normally orchestrate in Mutual's two-reel shorts. <br /> <br /> It can be difficult to balance a pro-war message with a slapstick antics and burlesque scenes on the front, but you would not think so much about watching "Shoulder Arms". In many ways, it is also better than a "more serious" drama with a similar message, such as Griffith's "Hearts of the World." Chaplin had become a true virtuoso of on-screen comedy at that time; he makes it seem effortless. He knew very well now that a movie with fewer gags - with more elaboration, refinement and meticulous timing - could be better than any Keockone-like joke, with around ten shots per minute. The sequence where Chaplin is disguised as a tree is a relevant example. Even with the wars raging, Chaplin can lift the minds of millions of people.
