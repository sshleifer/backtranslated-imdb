The film with its only play, its minimal distribution and its direct photography (with the exception of a few short special effects) reminds me of one of those old 60-minute theater dramas, so popular at the beginning of television. Nevertheless, the suspense weighs heavily on the poor widow of war Ida Lupino who tries to take care of his semi-psychotic man Robert Ryan before one of his mood swings kills her. And who could better play the troubled role than this great actor Ryan. He was not very versatile - watching him try a comedy is almost painful. But no one was better at the injured idealism (On Dangerous Ground) or the psychic pain of this movie. Few actors were able to express as much with their eyes as this lean and imposing silhouette. <br /> <br /> Lupino's problem is that she is locked in her house with a kind and kind man for a moment and furious the next. The suspense comes from his various ploys to keep him happy while trying to escape. It's a nail biting all the way. This is not one of Lupino's many refined roles in which she was so gifted. Instead, it's a role that a lot of smaller actresses would have managed pretty well. My favorite scene is Ryan and Margaret Whiting, a crazy teenager. Ryan already has difficulties with his masculinity and what others say about him. Then, when Whiting enters and finds the seductive Ryan rubbing the floor, she begins to become shy, flirting with her nascent sexuality. Sensing problems, Ryan pushes her away - finesse is not his forte. Insulted, Whiting attacks his manhood by calling his work "women's work". It does it. Until then, he was courteous and professional with Lupino, trying to put himself on a normal path. But Whiting touched his raw nerve. Now, it's devilish to pay as Whiting bounces, leaving Lupino to pay the price. It's a captivating scene, performed brilliantly. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this is one of the dozens of films produced by Lupino and her husband at a time when the public was moving away from these little favors of big-screen glasses. Pity. What an extremely talented figure, she was both behind the camera and in front. She deserves at least an honorary Oscar from a film industry to which she has contributed so much.
