I finally managed to get a copy of Dario Argento's opera, and I'm telling you ... it was about the time !! It was the last Argento movie I had not seen yet and I'm a fan of most of his works. I think most of his work is extremely important for the kind of horror but some of his films tend to disappoint (like Phenomena). But the idea of ​​Opera intrigue has always attracted me and it turns out that I was right !! I enjoyed every shot in Opera and I was fascinated by this film from the first minute to the last. Of all the Argento movies, Opera went straight to the top spot and I hope I can encourage as many people as possible to see this one as well. <br /> <br /> The script and the idea of ​​Opera's intrigue are rather simple. Especially compared to the previous movie Argento, Phenomena, who had too many ideas and ended up being a disaster. Opera's plot is frightening and scary, but at the same time it's an excellent satirical commentary - almost a travesty - addressed to opponents of explicit violence. *** SPOILERS *** A young opera singer (the magnificent Cristina Marsillach) is hunted down by a horribly sadistic murderer. At every massacre he commits, he forces Betty to look at his actions with wide eyes. Needles are attached to her eyelids and when she closes them, they tear. *** END SPOILERS ***. At this simple - but effective - idea, Argento adds many horrible elements such as crows, MacBeth's classic play (and curse) and the atmospheric location of opera and music. Especially the presence of scary crows are and extra value Old Masters like Edgar Allen Poe already knew that these black birds had a lot of mystery, and Dario Argento knows it too. <br /> <br /> Violence and gore are very well presented in Opera and that's what makes this picture a real Argento painting. His best in my opinion with Profondo Rosso in second position. I certainly hope to recommend this film to many of you. Especially for fans of horror (Italian), it's a must! Her favorite "Rewind" script: Argento shows her visual talent the best of the scene in which Betty's friend is shot in the eye as she tries to see who is in front of the door.
