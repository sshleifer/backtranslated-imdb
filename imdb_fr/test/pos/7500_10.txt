36. THE HOSPITAL (comedy, 1971) A series of emergencies took hold of the Manhattan hospital. Patients die on the left and right because of overcrowding and lack of staff ability. When a resident doctor is caught in the count of deaths, the Chief Medical Examiner, Dr. Bock (George C. Scott), is called in to investigate. Dr. Bock, who has worked as a doctor for too many years and has gone through his own mid-life crisis, finds the situation difficult. He decides to commit suicide. But then he meets Barbara (Diana Rigg), a young hippie beauty. Bock. <br /> <br /> Criticism: The black comedy staged a performance tour de force by veteran actor George C. Scott. He is good at playing serious and serious characters, whose strict morality is put to a severe test. The first half of the film unfolds like a melodrama, giving a good account of the hospitable life, and the upheaval that they undergo sometimes. But then, as things seem ready for a dramatic climax, it turns into blinding comedy. If Paddy Chayefsky's screenplay had kept its dramatic aspect, I wonder if Scott would have left with another best actor Oscar (he had already won, "in-absentia", the year before). His scene of failure (suicide) is one of the most heartbreaking scenes in the history of cinema. <br /> <br /> QUOTE: Dr. Bock: "I thought," No, Bock do not do it. You're a doctor, a healer, you're a necessary person, you're a meaningful life. "So ... I discover that one of my doctors was killed by a nursing couple ... how can you I maintain my sense of meaning to this?
