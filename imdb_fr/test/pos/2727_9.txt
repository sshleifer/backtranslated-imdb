Ms. Aparna Sen, the director of Mr. and Mrs. Iyer, directed this film about a young girl's struggle to cope with her debilitating illness. <br /> <br /> Meethi (Konkona Sen) is a distant child since childhood and has always shown signs of delirium, no one knows why. The dormant trend disappears however, when the work takes him to Bihar, the neighboring city, where she is raped by politicians. The resulting trauma also causes episodes of manic-depressive psychosis in addition to schizophrenia. She loses control of her control over the years, gets progressively worse and sinks deeper and deeper into her private "world". <br /> <br /> The juxtaposition of a "divided" elder sister and the way she dominates bad situation worse, is indicative of that there is a fine line between abnormal and * seemingly normal *. Ms. Sen also makes an excellent comment on the social alienation of these people. Social rehabilitation is a standard treatment associated with all life-altering drugs. But what about the poor and destitute, who are always on their own and usually fall apart? <br /> <br /> The relationship between Dr. Kunal and Anu was not necessary. In addition, the cafeteria scene where Dr. Kunal explains to Anu how true their world is, was superfluous. Anu should already know all that. The dialogue in English is sometimes a little embarrassing, although the acting game compensates for that. Konkona and Shabana prove that their reputation is worth it. Waheeda, Rahul and Shefali play very well their limited roles. <br /> <br /> Extensive research seems to have been conducted on this disease, which is very obvious. But it is not clear if MDP can coexist side by side with schizophrenia in the same patient. Also in his first part, Dr. Kunal recommends ECT (shock therapy) while invalidating the fact that it does not work for schizophrenics, but only for extreme PDM with suicidal tendencies and other forms of bipolar disorder. <br /> The end of the remarkable story suggests an unknown solution (perhaps no solution). The film could have ended on a more pleasant note, because all over the world, mentally ill people can lead and are balanced and successful if they are not very fulfilling, lives under good medical care. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, it is an excellent film made with extreme sensitivity to the subject. Hat to Mrs. Sen! No one in India could have done better.
