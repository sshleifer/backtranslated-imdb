I'll admit that I may have missed minute moments when I was not paying enough attention, but I'm tired of the story to agree that it's a big family film, from director Lionel Jefferies, who has played the role of Grandfather Potts in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. Basically, it starts with a happy upper middle class family living in London in Victoria. One night, the father (Iain Cuthbertson) receives the visit of two foreigners. He leaves with them and does not return. They settle in a cottage in the country, and here are the children; Bobbie (Jenny Agutter, whom I saw for the first time in Child's Play 2), Phyllis (Sally Thomsett) and Peter (Gary Warren) keep the spirit sharp, fascinated by the nearby railway. Every day, they greet the passengers of trains passing by faithfully and, with courage and vigilance, they also avoid accidents and become heroes. Their kindness makes them friends, including important personalities who can help discover the mystery of their missing father. Also starring Dinah Sheridan as mother / Mrs. Waterbury, Bernard Cribbins as Albert Perks, William Mervyn as an old gentleman, Peter Bromilow as Dr. Forrest, Ann Lancaster as Ruth and Gordon Whiting as Russian. He was number 29 on The 100 Greatest Family Films and number 24 on The 50 Greatest British Films. Very well!
