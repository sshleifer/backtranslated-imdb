A very strange film, disturbing but intriguing. I do not think I ever needed to see what a human being can do with his buttocks, and I doubt that I ever want to see him again. That said, there's a lot of fun, like Divine's in Jayne Mansfield's classic walk in "The Girl Can not Stop It" and putting pieces of meat between her legs in a grocery store. It's like being in a Russ Meyer movie. The acting is generally mediocre, with the notable exception of Divine.
