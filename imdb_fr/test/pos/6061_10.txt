Of course, I have some prejudices, but for the time, it was the most accurate representation of the Marines ever presented on the big screen. <br /> <br /> I was at Camp Pendleton doing infantry training when Webb brought his crew to film outdoor scenes and our company was invited to participate. It took about two or three days, as far as I can remember. <br /> <br /> Webb and Don Dubbins were serious and serious. <br /> <br /> During the shooting of our short scene - which seemed to take forever for an 18 year old - Webb was very conscientious about doing things right (navy things) and he did a good job , with one exception - this scene where a rookie wore sunglasses. It never happens for a lot of reasons. <br /> <br /> I have a video of the film and I'm going to bother my grandchildren when I can make them stay still for a few seconds while I show them their papaya when he was young. stud and being part of the greatest fighting force in the world (no boastful, but a fact). <br /> <br /> What amazed me then was how true the Marines performed their roles well. That was before I realized that IDs must have genes acting to do their job. <br /> <br /> The only movie I've seen since that is the equivalent of the DI is the first half of Full Metal Jacket and this part is higher only because of foul language. When the DI was created, curses were not allowed on the screen. <br /> <br /> Despite the lack of blasphemy, it's still a good movie to rent. <br /> <br /> Ooooo-rahhhhhh !!!!! <br /> <br /> Semper Fi, Do or die
