Duck_of_Death must watch this movie again, because his main criticism is completely unfounded. The film never forgot the deadline, and it was mentioned explicitly in several places. The crew never had conversations with Mission Control that did not meet the deadline rules. <br /> <br /> One thing I thought was a little far-fetched was the amount of risk involved - a crew was landing on a planet where the pressure would only last two hours? I doubt. Would an inhabited spacecraft go in the crown of a star? I doubt. Would humans land on a moon that was bombarded with huge amounts of radiation? I doubt. In addition, the ship seemed too robust. Would a ship designed like this run the risk of an atmospheric flight slowing it down? I doubt. Would he survive being hit by comet debris? I doubt. I think that in both cases, the constraints on the structure would be too important. But overall, the unlikely scenarios have been offset by well-done special effects, good editing and production, as well as by quality actors, in particular by the actors representing the ship's commander and the Russian cosmonaut.
