I did not read the novel on which "The Kite Runner" is based. My wife and wife, who did it, thought the film was way below the book, and I'm willing to accept it. But, in itself, the movie is good - not great but good. How does he accurately describe the ravages caused by the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan? How can he convince the intolerant regime of the Taliban that followed? I would note C + on the first and B + on the second. Human history, the African-American who returned to the country to save the son of his childhood friend, is well done, but it is especially on this subject that the book was much more convincing than the film. However, the most exciting part of the film - the kite competitions in Kabul and, later, a mini-contest in California - could not be matched by the book. I'll bet money on it.
