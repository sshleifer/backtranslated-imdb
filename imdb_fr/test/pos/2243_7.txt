Doctor Who, Rose, his alternative dad, Mickey, his alternative counterpart Ricky, and the small band of Mickey rebels find themselves at the mercy of this version of the Cybermen, this second part of the 2 episodes of Cybermen arc looks more like an episode of Doctor Who, as opposed to the previous part which, honestly, looked more like an episode of the late show "Sliders", which was in itself an excellent show. The bow as a whole has been quite nice, because I'm the type to subscribe to the maxim "ALL who is good at, but at the same time, it is inevitable that it is compared to the episode Dalek of the previous series. And such comparisons would only make this a less important job, as it is. I just think this story could have been done in one episode. Remember in the first part of the review that I said that such stories dealing with alternative realities generally have no lasting impact, well that's not the case here, but what changes in together feel connected and do not really match the character. <Br /> <br /> My note: C +
