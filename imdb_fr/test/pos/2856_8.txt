Betty Sizemore (Renee Zellweger) lives her life through a soap opera. The opera "A Reason to Love" is a way to escape her cursed husband and his bland life. After a shocking incident involving two successful men (Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock), Betty is shocked and goes to Los Angeles, persuaded that she is destined to marry the main character of the series (Greg Kinnear). <br /> <br /> Nurse Betty is this rare thing, a less known film with a cast of stars and a fluffy plot Rom-Com that surprises with its fantastic script and acting quality. Indeed, such a plot raises the question of the R rating to a question, but it is entirely justified. The shocking incident that sends Betty on the edge is a bit too graphic compared to the upcoming light and comedy comedy that looks like something from a different film, but it is at the same time necessary to credibly show the transformation of Betty in The doe eyes, the job she loves becomes. <br /> <br /> As Betty progresses, director Neil LaBute creates an extraordinary magic that makes the film unique and high above your standard error comedy. An example of this would be Betty's first encounter with her crush. She pours out her heart and he plays, thinking that she is auditioning for a role in the series. While we are aware of the ridiculous nature of Betty's ramblings, the music swells as she speaks, giving us the audience the emotional perspective of Betty. We almost believe what she says, and yet we understand that her mind is fractured. While other filmmakers try to accentuate the ridiculousness of the situation in order to extract any possible comedy from the scene, LaBute is sensitive to her main character and treats her with the greatest sympathy and the greatest possible understanding. <br /> <br /> The conversations between Freeman and Rock are priceless, the great storyline describes smart lines, line by line. Freeman, in particular, is excellent, as always, because his character falls slowly and blindly in love with his own ideal of Betty, not even knowing who she is or what has happened to her. Aaron Eckhart shows once more his versatility in the thankless role of not so good husband of Betty and he is almost unrecognizable. The other revelation here is Kinnear, whose representation of the soap star is not overcooked. The bastard clich√© of celebrity tends to be applied as thick as possible, and Kinnear resists, giving it a pompous but sober importance, even if it is simply a soap star. <br /> The soap opera is performed so well, it could almost exist. LaBute and his teammates put their finger on the nail with a good thing too. If the soap opera had been too satirical, much of the movie would not have worked. Making a parody "Days of Our Lives" as seen in Friends would have been the wrong choice for this film. The attention to detail is bearing fruit, as the style and feel of the drama begin to bleed more and more into Betty's reality, while remaining faithful to the comic and unintentional aspect of the genre. The scenes on the set are real, unlike some movies in which the atmosphere is so manufactured, one wondered why people who do it for a living can not do things well. <br /> <br /> The careful resolution of the last act, while being a little predictable, is overall satisfactory. It's a pity that after LaBute directed this wonderful film, the general public called him to lead the awful remake of The Wicker Man, a fine example of a man so well above the material he had been given . Unfortunately, no one can absolve him of all responsibility. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen nurse Betty, it's something to discover. If you have, it's worth the trip. Nurse Betty has a charm that is contagious, although it may not leave you thinking too much afterward. A hidden jewel nevertheless.
