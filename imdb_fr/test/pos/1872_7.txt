I firmly believe that a film, television series or any form of art should be fully appreciated once the time factor defined - namely when it is written, produced or conceived - should be taken into account. <br /> <br /> Yeh Jo hai Zindagi is one of these series. I remember seeing her in the mid-eighties on television and broadcasting via videotape libraries in the early '90s and laughing out loud and being hooked on her. That made me buy the DVD set of the complete series and a surprising surprise: the comedy and good times of the good old days simply fell flat for me. Even the very popular "30 years of experience ka" "GULAAAAB JAMUN!" and "Sofa cum bed" does not invoke the kind of gaiety I thought. The timing factor: for the 80s, it was the highlight of the success. The main event. The mother of all TV comedies. And it worked during age and time! Perhaps we can not say the same now, but watching the DVD reminded me of pleasant memories. <br /> <br /> I wish the seasons with Shafi Inamdar and Swarup Sampat to be longer. Satish Shah was incredibly good at the heart of the series, with equally effective support from Farida Jalal, Tiku Talsania and the Bengali neighbors. Rakesh Bedi is always present. <br /> <br /> All in all, an experience that will bring back memories to those who saw it in prime time may not appeal to younger viewers or novice observers!
