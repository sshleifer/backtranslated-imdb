Watching this little movie is pure delight from beginning to end. The story is always fun, the tension never weakens. The whole cast is beautiful. The association of Walken and Bracco works to perfection, it is almost an echo of a classic screw novel. Bracco is very sexy and very funny as a scoundrel who fights for his independence. For some reason, they gave Walken a very strange makeup and the strangest haircut I could imagine ?? it's a kind of parody of what Burt Lancaster had to Elmer Gantry. For me, it added to the pleasure. This is the first film in which I saw Miguel Ferrer, probably one of the most underrated actors of his generation. He is very good in a small role as a Bracco pimp. Even Jamaican thugs are a sight to behold. I can strongly recommend this movie.
