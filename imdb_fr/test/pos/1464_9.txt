The first episode of 'Man to Man with Dean Learner' that was just released was at least the origin of most episodes of 'Garth Marenghi's Darkplace' and introduced me to 'My Maisonette'. I hope it continues the good work of 'fake terrible' on my TV. Richard Ayoade is one of the best in the new breed of "alternative comedy" (I hate this phrase, but I'm too lazy to think of it another.) The comedians on television today. "Darkplace of Garth Marenghi" has been sold to all posts. Even from his brief stint at Nathan Barley, I knew that Ayoade was a serious talent and I'm sure he would have been great as Dixon Bainbridge in "The Mighty Boosh". To continue to succeed! As part of these programs, I also felt it necessary to expand my examination so that I could occupy a place in this public domain.
