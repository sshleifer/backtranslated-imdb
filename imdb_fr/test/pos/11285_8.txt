Begotten.The magic.The Terror.The slight trouble. <br /> <br /> This "begotten" is for the acquired tastes goes without saying, you can not watch it unless your friends are real art-movie buffs.You have to dig the weird, the macabre, the weird . You have to dig cool movies. And you have to dig to find diamonds. <br /> <br /> "Begotten" is one of the most visually dazzling and mystifying films of all time known to man.The visual part is something to see, something that no one can prepare for you But since the film is devoid of any kind of dialogue, the visual part is pretty much the only part ....

The soundscapes created for the film are magical and revolutionary but still. ... at the sight .... <br /> <br /> God commits suicide in a particularly bloody scene then of his corpse rises Mother Earth which impregnates itself of the sperm of God and gives birth to Flesh on Bone, a retarded child.She leaves her then and gets tortured by creatures resembling pagans.Mother comes back to him?) But she and her son are murdered by these horrible creatures. <br /> <br /> The film talks about the lack of meaning of life and the fact that we come to this planet to suffer and die. that when something dies, something else is born, etc. Nihilism. <br /> <br /> The No. 1 quality of the film lies, of course, in the visuals, the frame, these mesmerizing images, this supernatural quality .... After you have finished watching, you feel like an extraterrestrial It's THAT hypnotizing. <br /> <br /> When people say it should last 30 'instead of 70' they're right.No they are not, it could last 40 'It's just that everything happens at a pace In fact, the summary of the plot that I provided is all that happens in the movie, it's like a joke.It's still ... I do not know ... Glorious ... <br /> <br /> ... Like a flame that burns the darkness ...
