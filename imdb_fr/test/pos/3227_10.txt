Gilmore Girls is my favorite TV show of all time. they only broadcast the first two seasons in India but I watched the rest on DVD or read it online. It is very refreshing to find a show where the protagonist does not sneak into the back of her mother but maintains an open relationship with her. The chemistry between Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel who plays Lorelai and her daughter Rory is really great. all the actors are excellent and the characters, although extremely original, remain credible. the inhabitants of hollow stars show all the amusing quirk of the life of a small town, contrasting with the endless snobbery and social norms that make up the social life of Lorelai's parents in high society. On the one hand, there are dance-athons and fire-light festivals, while on the other side you have party favors, DAR meetings and cocktails. all the characters are developing a lot and there is a happy ending for more or less everyone. there are dramatic elements but also a lot of very spiritual humor. Rory's boyfriends are incredibly hot, as are those of her friend Lane. Basically, it's a cool, fun and satisfying show that encompasses all aspects of life and gives you the impression of -if you work hard enough and wait patiently, you'll get what you want, even if it's not was not what you wanted.
