Even an old DOCTOR WHO fan like me can stay out of breath watching an episode of my favorite show. It had already happened in the Eccleston final and that's what happened while watching this episode. However, this does not happen often but The Impossible Planet is an example of both the show and the television. This is a breathtaking television <br /> <br /> The doctor and his companion land in a mysterious place where they see a strange writing on the wall and where the public (many of whom will move behind the sofa) is immediately taken from short. A door opens and horrible monsters begin to hunt down time travelers. It could have taken a whole 25-minute episode of the original series, but all of this happens in the pre-title sequence. It may be that you miss the longer format of the original series, but at least this new series is tightly planned and if we are treated with a disappointing story, then at least it's usually only for a week. <br /> <br /> There is nothing to disappoint a spectator here. It is DOCTOR WHO at its best traditional. Writer Matt Jones and director James Strong have done their best to create a story that will be considered for years. They do it by constructing a tragic story. The doctor and Rose lose the Tardis and they find themselves stuck with the protagonists in the distant future. It is interesting to note that many stories never present this type of plot where the Doctor and his companions no longer have access to the Tardis, which makes it a more intriguing type of plot. The highlight is without a doubt the scene where Scooti goes to get Toby only to find him on the surface of the planet where he turns and beckons him out. Everything from acting to make-up to Murray Gold's music makes it a scene that really shocks audiences. <br /> <br /> I imagine right after this episode that the BBC's paintings received a tsunami of complaints from parents in distress about how traumatized their children were. were. It took them several hours to get them from behind the family's sofa and they now refuse to sleep with the lights off. To complain would be to deny the magic of DOCTOR WHO. Yes, it can terrify and yes, such images will burn in the mind of a child, something they will never forget, even if they live up to a hundred years. But I'll bet my life that those same "traumatized" kids would have spent the week begging, no matter what would allow them to watch the next episode
