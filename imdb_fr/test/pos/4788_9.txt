I saw that when I was twelve. It's the film that made me understand what a good mystery is. I had read the whole series of mysteries about Happy Hollisters kids and they were talking about a family of bloodhounds who still had their man. But we, the readers, were not able to solve the mystery with them. This film showed me that a good mystery is one that pushes the viewer / reader, in the end, to say "Oh !!!!! OF COURSE !!!!!!!"
