The Lone Ranger & Tonto set out to bring to justice a group of hooded looters who killed three Indians for a single appearance, without it being apparent ... until the Lone Ranger discovers after a conversation with the Indian chief Tomache that the man possessed a medallion. The five medallions given by Tomache to his friends as a gift, we will see later, once combined, will provide the brain behind the hooded raiders with a map of the legendary lost city of gold. Can the Lone Ranger protect the two remaining people in possession of the medallions before the hooded raiders get their hands on them? Is there really a golden city lost somewhere in the homeland? <br /> <br /> Looking at this, I continued to know what was going to happen before and everything seemed really familiar until I finally realized that I had seen exactly the same movie when I was not as a little kid .. and I remembered having a good time as a child enjoying this one with a group of friends. As an adult, the plot is somewhat predictable, but you know, even if it's not quite in the same category as the 1956 movie, it's still a lot of fun to watch. Clayton Moore is perfect as a Lone Ranger and Jay Silverwheels because Tonto steals a lot of this movie because it's probably in more action scenes than even the Lone Ranger. Some very familiar faces are here, including Douglas Kennedy as Ross Brady, leader of the Hooded Raiders gang, Charles Watts as sectarian sheriff and Ralph Moody as a kind Padre.
