The movie is really cool, I thought. It fits quite well with the original game, and some battle scenes are described in so much detail, it's amazing. I thought the movie might have been a little better if they gave you a little more information before the end, but trying to figure out what's going on is what's going on in this movie. <br /> <br /> The CG is beautiful, I do not think they could have done a better job in graphics. Every little detail, the way they move, the appearance of their swords, everything is perfect. The way they give the appearance of characters is almost identical to that of real people. <br /> <br /> The music was excellent, and I found it fun to listen to how the track was remixed from the original game, with new instruments and effects. <br /> <br /> In all respects, I would recommend this film to anyone who loves rhythmic action and a good script. I would definitely play the game before watching the movie though.
