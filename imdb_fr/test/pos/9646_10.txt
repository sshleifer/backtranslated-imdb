I felt obliged to give some feedback on this movie I rented to Blockbuster. This film has it all - comedy, drama, crime, suspense and "realism". <br /> <br /> This movie also has a lot of action with just the right amount of humor! I will definitely watch it again! There were some fun roles as well as action packed dramas. I appreciate the movies that make you wonder what will happen next. <br /> <br /> Writer / director, Travis Milloy, should do more movies !!! Overall, this movie was great! I am looking forward to his neighbor! Travis Milloy has a real talent as a writer and director.
