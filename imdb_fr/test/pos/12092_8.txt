This is an excellent documentary and the comments above briefly summarize how great it was, so I will not repeat the same compliments. But Faith akin, being a Turkish-oriented guy who probably knows this country more than an ordinary European, falls into the trap of Orientalism, to which other Western artists usually fall. But come on, man, you have Turkish blood and your film could be deeper and could describe what goes beyond "the old town of Beyoglu". This is a missed opportunity for Akin for this reason. The performances of Muzeyyen Senar and Orhan Gencebay are a preview of the film and Ceza (a very talented and nasty Turkish rapper) makes a trashy speech about American gangsta rappers, which I totally agree. I will recommend this film to my American friends.
