I was expecting a lot from this film and I can say that I was not disappointed. First, this film, as a world tour of winemaking, allows the viewer to enjoy beautiful places. Interviewees are also very interesting and fun, especially Hubert de Montille. Shooting can be confusing as the camera is still unstable and often focuses on secondary elements in the backgrounds. You may not like it, but I do not consider it a defect. <br /> <br /> The themes in the film may also be a little confusing, because globalization is not the only topic. But Nossiter managed to give his film consistency throughout. A great success of this film is to reveal all the characters involved in the wine industry as they really are, avoiding the clich√© "Good against Evil". This could be the main difference between "Mondovino" and Michael Moore's documentaries; Nossiter's point of view appears in a subtle way, through the opinions of his favorite characters. The richness of this documentary is based mainly on the characters, the story of long-standing winemaking families, such as De Montilles, Mondavis, Antinori and Frescobaldi. Nossiter lets the viewer discover that wine is kind of related to families, rather than just being a business and an industry. This film does not want to drink wine, but to discover vineyards and winemakers. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie as an oenology student and there are many ways to get it to learn. I give this documentary 10 out of 10, despite its technical peculiarities.
