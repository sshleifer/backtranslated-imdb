One of Chaplin's longest films to date, Burlesque on Carmen is an intelligent and surprisingly complex parody of what was then Prosper Merimee's famous "Carmen" story. I was a little confused about the difference between the 1915 Burlesque list on Carmen by IMDb and the 1916 version. Based on the duration, I guess it's the 1915 version I saw, because that of 1916 has another 20 good minutes more and, from what I read, it is about 20 minutes useless and unimpressive. <br /> <br /> From the beginning, it's clear that Burlesque on Carmen is one of Chaplin's most complex and ambitious endeavors to date. It begins with a long story, told through headlines, about the tragic love story. of Carmen. <br /> <br /> Carmen is sent by a group of gypsies ("A group that turned the GYP into a gypsy."), to seduce a Spanish officer so that he can carry out his smuggling operation. It is an intelligent group of chaplinesque criminals, whose leader, Lillas Pastia, "spent 50 years learning to steal, thinking he could be offered a job in politics". <br /> <br /> Interestingly, I've seen some almost misogynistic messages and jokes in some of Chaplin's earlier works, but none has been as obvious as in this one. Towards the beginning of the film, as the band of gypsies travel, there is a scene where mules and women load, and an inter-title explains that "mules are those with long ears". In case you can not say it, I guess. <br /> <br /> Chaplin plays the role of Don Jos√©, the unfortunate officer who must be seduced by Carmen. He is described as "a brave soldier and a lover of women". This is not quite exaggerated for Chaplin, who raised the slightest doubt about his ability to play a convincing cartoon soldier a few years later in the brilliant game Shoulder Arms. And of course, he did not have to act like a lover of women. <br /> <br /> What is different here, of course, is his refined military uniform and disciplinary discipline, intermingled, of course. , with some of his traditional slap-stick moves. I seem to be a little guy in a position of authority, who strives to maintain the respect of his subordinates by exerting a gruff exterior and frozen. <br /> <br /> Soon Carmen enters ("loved by all men under 96 ??"), and she immediately begins to flirt with Charlie. I should mention that for a good majority of the film, it is amazingly faithful to the original story, full of jealousy and tragedy. Chaplin is strangely convincing as a jealous lover, able to conjure up a jealous passion I've never seen of him. There is at least one scene where he is really a little scary. <br /> <br /> Chaplin has great gags of sight in the film, like a hilarious dance on a table and classic sword fights towards the end. And his youthful charm and soldiery are also a winning combination, although there is another particular waterfall involving a group of men pushing a huge door that was not very effective at first, but still continued and again, probably about five times longer than it was worth While it's worth noting that when it finally fell, it was clearly revealed as a movie prop. I still enjoy such glimpses of the old movie sets. <br /> <br /> The end of the film is its strongest part. This is very similar to Romeo and Juliet, but when you think that Chaplin will lead a great thematic experience by moving away from his traditional style, there is a hilarious twist that resembles that of vintage Chaplin. Good work!
