Many of us who are dedicated to the "art" of the film will ignore or forget that movies are also commercial enterprises. Most of the time, they are far too expensive to produce to be anything else. In light of this, it often seems to me miraculous that very good projects are made from time to time. From time to time, filmmakers exceed the budget of film production so much that the businessmen responsible for the financing of the company will be hit hard financially and will of course become very unhappy. I would like to know exactly how this happened, which has often led both the major studios and some major critics to "shoot" for the photo when it is finally available. Terrible expectations are generated and often what people expect to blur their perception of what they see. <br /> <br /> You can see this phenomenon at work in the imperfect, but beautiful '62 re-make 0f "Mutiny on The Bounty", and you can certainly see it in the reaction to "Heaven's Gate ". Cimino took too much time and cost United Artists too much to make this picture. The company was mortally wounded by its excesses and, without a doubt, influential figures came to see its reputation forever ruined when this strange mammoth epic was finally published. There are always many moviegoers who do not like long, heavy images. Narration in this film is not accomplished with a great economy or a steady pace. Like Stanley Kubrick, Cimino often chooses not to specify the statement he makes with a given scene. Instead, he expresses it in such a way as to give the viewer the feeling of living in the present moment, thus allowing his imagination time to participate deeply in what is presented. Many people do not react so favorably to this approach. They want the story to advance quickly and clearly and they become easily impatient and confused by this type of film. These factors have undoubtedly contributed to the failure of "Heaven's Gate" at the box office. <br /> <br /> By nature, a film editor, I am deeply frustrated by two problems with this film. Here and there, a scene is clearly too long and could easily have been cut without compromising its effectiveness. We then arrive at the gigantic battle scenes at the end of the image. As far as they are concerned, the clarity of the narration is indeed compromised. If you liked the movie until that happens, your understanding of what is supposed to happen may not be clear and this is a frustration. Not having seen all the raw footage, I can not say if new shots would have been necessary, or if some critical elements of the plot could have been clarified through a careful re-edition of certain moments. Given the time and money invested in this photo, more attention and thought should have been given to this problem. <br /> <br /> There are other problems, some of which are mediocre and do not always sound good, but they are really minor concerns. The reason why I am so disturbed by the problems mentioned above is that, like so many others these days, I also feel that, in any case, Heaven's Gate is so beautiful to see and treat so magnificently great historical, political and sociological problems that it is a little less of a masterpiece. Despite its weaknesses, it is so spectacular and so powerful that it stands out from most other Hollywood movies I've ever seen. I would like to remix a lot of sound. I would like to reorient and re-edit the scene where Ella is killed, but the quality of this image is such that these considerations become really trivial compared to the value of the total production. I should add that it should always be seen on a giant widescreen to get the glorious effect that it is so capable of producing.
