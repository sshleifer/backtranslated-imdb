I chose to watch this film for one reason and one at a time: Samuel L. Jackson. I happen to like it a lot. As I had not seen any tastings or trailers for this neglected film, I entered this one without any real wait. <br /> <br /> Jackson did not disappoint, while Lazarus, an unlucky blues man in the Deep South, and perhaps delivered his most powerful performance of all time, including playing and singing excellent tunes of blues. But the real surprise here is Christina Ricci, at best an aerial stalemate in real life, who took on the role of the city's sexually abused tramp, Rae, and made her a credible, even likeable character. Watching the resolutely non-sexual relationship evolve between Lazare and Rae was simply incredible. <br /> <br /> Justin Timberlake, actor of the pop star turned actor, should begin to cause "dysfunctions of his wardrobe" and rear up around a pop scene. At best, his forced performance was distracting from the real story. <br /> <br /> This film is raw, sandy and sometimes quite "in front of you". Everyone will not like it. Those who do, however, will quickly put it at the top of their favorites list.
