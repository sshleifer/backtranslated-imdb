Guest from the Future tells a fascinating story of time travel, friendship, the battle of good and evil - all with a small budget, children acting and few special effects. Something to learn from Spielberg and Lucas. Kolya "Nick" Gerasimov, a grade six student, finds a time machine in the basement of a decrepit building and travels a hundred years later. He discovers an almost perfect and utopian society, where robots play guitar and write poetry, everyone is nice to oneself and everyone benefits from all that technology has to offer. Alice is the daughter of a prominent scientist who invented a device called Mielophone that can read the minds of humans and animals. The device can be used both judiciously and effectively, depending on the hands in which it falls. When two devilish space pirates of Saturn want to dominate the universe and try to steal Mielophone, they fall into the hands of Nick, a schoolboy of the twentieth century. The pirates on the rails, he returns to his time, followed by pirates and Alice. Chaos, confusion and funny situations follow as pirates without luck attempt to blend in with the landlubbers. Alice enrolls in the same school where Nick goes and demonstrates superhuman abilities in physical education class. The problem is that Alice does not know what Nick looks like, unlike hackers. Moreover, hackers can change their appearance and literally transform themselves into anyone. (Hmm, I wonder if that's where James Cameron got the idea for Terminator ...) Who gets to Nick - and Honeyie - first? Excellent plot, non-stop adventures and excellent soundtrack. I wish Hollywood movies for children like this one ...
