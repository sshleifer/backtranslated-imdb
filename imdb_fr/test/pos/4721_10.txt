This film should be seen by as many people as possible, as it focuses on human rights issues in Burma. When I first saw this movie in the mid-90s, it completely changed my life. I knew very little about Aung San Suu Kyi or her movement for democracy. It affected me so I wanted to know more about the situation. Any movie that has the power to make you want to learn more has done its job well. Patricia Arquette is superb as an American who, because of a personal tragedy, has become reckless with her own life decisions and is caught up in the ensuing conflict. It's a powerful film about a subject that deserves more publicity. As the film itself says, the 1988 militant campaign for democracy was not televised and went largely unnoticed to the world. I implore everyone who reads these comments to take the time to learn more about the tragic plight of the Burmese people. <br /> <br /> It's time for this film to be released on DVD. Can we do something?
