The "madness" of the vampires, in my opinion, proved that she was worthy of such a categorization. Last year, there were many sub-genre films from a multitude of countries. I reviewed a lot and I have a few others to discuss. Forgive my indulgence, but since then I have recognized the trend as a phenomenon (which is the case and, coincidentally, is my favorite staple food). I am now going to settle a bit outside of North America and present you movies that you have not seen yet. <br /> <br /> Among the many effects of Twilight, we find "vampire movies" and "girl" movies. I hate this sexist categorization, which has the effect of polarizing a generation of fans into "sides". I think men are prone to hate to some extent the work of Stephenie Meyer (and her offspring) because they feel they betray that an archetype that has always been theirs is now released. It is unlikely that women will appreciate future "neutral" photos as they have grown up with irreproachable expectations that have been applied four times. We need more directors to create vampire movies that both sexes are able to enjoy (unevenly) if vampires will survive the madness and stay relevant. Cue: Thirst This Korean movie was directed by Park Chan-Wook of the Oldboy fame. There are two ways to dissect it. Either he rides the expectations between the sexes and is universally unpleasant, or it's a mess that does not decide which target audience he prefers and therefore should not be looked at by anyone. Do not let me convince you that the film has no inclination. His director is a man whose fame is the action film based on a story. His protagonist is a man and has a passive-aggressive interest in his lover (more on that later). Nevertheless, his desire for a woman he knew before and after mortal life is not artificial and his attention has returned. There is a male inclination in this picture, yet it is not so one-sided that women could not enjoy it. The same can not be said of the Daybreakers or New Moon. <br /> <br /> The plot follows a novel by Emile Zola called Thérèse Raquin, which I did not read. According to Wikipedia, the novel is about a case that develops between a married woman and a single man. He kills her husband on a fishing trip and starts going out with her. Both of them are unable to have sex because they imagine the body of the dead between them. They are led to madness, but take care of the sick mother of the woman. At the end of the novel, they try to kill each other, discover their plans and commit suicide. <br /> <br /> Now, transcribe this almost 150-year-old French novel into modern South Korea and you're thirsty. Chan-Wook does not embellish the story enough to make this place a must-attend event. He often ignores many of his own ideas to follow his inspiration. I think the most memorable moments are when his scruples are disturbed by the story. His use of the mother-in-law as a foil for their bad relationship is simply perfect. See. <br /> <br /> The protagonist is originally a pious Christian turned vampire after a defective blood transfusion as a result of volunteering for a new drug. He becomes the god with whom he was once in love. People flock to him and consider him a great healer. OKAY. It's really cool and could have provided a good foundation for her relationship. Yet this idea has little time on the screen as it turns into a realistic figure of Christ who tries to maintain his virtue even if his lifestyle requires him to give it up. Instead of confronting delusional people, he sips rather the blood of patients hospitalized in a coma. <br /> <br /> Let's continue with the Christian allusion. The woman incites the vampire to kill her husband. Her overprotective mother-in-law suffers a stroke and finally warns family friends of her stepdaughter's betrayal. The man kills her but resurrects her. Both invite old friends and the woman starts harassing humans without mercy. The man says that's enough, decides to go to a beach and forces her to wait for the sunrise with him. They both die, but he redeems his crimes (and his own, but the film describes his evil more visibly). <br /> <br /> The character of the woman is a caricature and his job allows him to explain his behavior. She is an uneducated housewife, while the man is a priest whose mortal life was restrictive. Vampirism magnifies their characteristics. She becomes a monster as one would expect from someone without knowledge. He becomes a demi-god with a spirit. His life is how atheists see each other and his life is how religious people see those without divine intervention.
