'The Dresser' is one of those so perfect movies that you really have trouble finding something to dislike these movies. Written by Ronald Harwood (himself formerly stylist of the legendary Donald Wolfit), he sparkles with energy and a true love of life behind the limelight. <br /> <br /> As "Sir", the overbearing actor and the main center of the play, Albert Finney is a joy to watch - whether to complain about the absence of a storm during the shot wind, blow of 'King Lear' or chat with his faithful steward, Madge (Eileen Atkins, still as good) on the good old days. Courtenay, Norman, plays fabulous show. He wriggles under Lear's orders, picks up a bottle to go to the pub, or vehemently denounces the former madman, Mr. Davenport-Scott (often mentioned). but never seen!). <br /> <br /> In an engaging support cast, there's Edward Fox in Oxenby (an arrogant supporting lead), Zena Walker in his Ladyship, Lockwood West in the role of alternate Fool, and many more. . <br /> <br /> This film has great energy, bringing some of the paint to the fat of its origins on stage, it is true, but if played well, you do not notice it. Very well done indeed.
