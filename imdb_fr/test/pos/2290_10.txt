Resume the Oscars from 1992, and this film could be nominated, or even win. It was so good to capture his time and his double culture that he is part of the American and Japanese time capsules. If you wanted to know what life was like here or there, this movie will show you that. As an American, you will have the impression of being accompanied by a long vacation in Japan and, at the end of the film, you will be an unconditional fan of the Dragons, because you accept the inclusion of tradition and culture Japanese in their sport. , as we did with our culture in our own game. <br /> <br /> Jack Elliot (Tom Selleck) is a slugger and aging slugger of the Detroit Tigers who is traded to the Dragons, perpetual finalists dynastic Yomuri Giants , Japan's answer to the Yankees. Giants are admired for their success, but this success is also meant to make everyone want to pass, which is rarely done. The Dragons manager recruits Jack as the final piece of the winning pennant puzzle, and we still have what might have been Gung Ho on a baseball field, but instead a lot more. <br /> <br /> The cast was remarkable: Selleck proved that with a good script and a character that suited him, he could make a film as well as he had directed his television show, and the Japanese cast was just as good, up to Mr. Takagi from Die Hard. owner concerned about his image. The other actors, including the one who plays the role of love (also the manager's daughter), strong and independent while being faithful to Japanese traditions, go beyond what was imposed on him. She is an appropriate and supportive girlfriend for Jack. Even his father never tells him not to see him, almost sympathizes with Jack for what he endures, and a little relieved, he knows at least the man she has chosen to love. <br /> <br /> The baseball scenes are awesome, supported immensely by a pre-renown, Dennis Haysbert, as another former American expatriate and western mentor of Jack. The usual elements of fish out of the water are present and you can almost feel stumbling with Jack to fit into a country that does not speak our language and practice our habits, but copy everything we do. , including our national hobby. One of the most amusing scenes occurs when Jack, holding a magazine, informs his director that he has learned the tradition in Japan that one can get drunk and denigrate his boss, and that it can not be used against you . very humorous The intrigues and subplots are carefully connected in the end, but not too much, and nothing ends unrealistically. <br /> <br /> To call it a comedy, it's a mistake: it's a pure dramatic comedy, even a dramatic good humor The plot is too deep to be rejected in the same way as the critics called him an actor outside his championship who is trying to make a light film. The situations were fun, but in their place in a much more serious, deep and very detailed context that gives one of the best movies I have ever seen. Baseball cinematography rivals that of For Love Of The Game, for realism. <br /> <br /> Some say that the film is about baseball or Japan, but more than any other element of the workplace and how to get to work with totally different origins, with different agendas, and to somehow put aside their differences for the sake of society or the team. <br /> <br /> A very big film that should never have apologized. for himself as he did when he was in theaters.
