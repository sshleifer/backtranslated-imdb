How can one say something bad on this movie? Forgive Mel Brooks for being a brilliant comedian and making a movie more and more funny every time you watch it. <br /> <br /> The first time I saw that, I cried to laugh so loudly. Everything is funny. <br /> <br /> While "Robin Hood: Men In Tights" is not my favorite comedy (this movie is performed by "Real Genius"), it is prominently featured in my book. So go see it! If you do not spend all your time laughing, then at least you'll spend all your time chatting on Cary Elwes.
