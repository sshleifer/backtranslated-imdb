This story, which takes place during the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, has all the suspense of a good book or film about the Cold War while a multinational group of foreigners trying to get Jason Robards from Hungary to Austria. However, three things complete the story, making it a very good movie. <br /> <br /> First, actors use the very languages ​​of their roles. Russian soldiers speak only Russian; Hungarians only Hungarian; the Germans only German, except to a minimum extent to tell the story. As Debra Kerr is English, she speaks only English and, of course, Yul Brynner and a few other essential people in history also speak highly accented English. As a result, public empathy with travelers becomes paramount. The viewer shares all the confusion and suspense of being involved in an illegal border crossing when he / she can not understand any of the languages ​​spoken around them. Very strong feelings arouse public attention and, despite intensive use of foreign languages, the audience is never short of watching the film. No subtitles are necessary. <br /> <br /> Second. I was in Hungary in 1995, and I tell you, this film is absolutely right. From Gypsy music that dominates the dinner from the underground caves to the buildings where much of the action takes place to the village scenes, the realism is incredible. If I did not eat in the movie restaurant, I ate at his double. I thought I was walking down the main street of this village. (In fact, the film was shot in Austria). <br /> <br /> Third, and most importantly, this film brings together Deberah Kerr and Yul Brynner (after The King and I) and the magnetism that unites them as the story unfolds nothing less that Oscar qualified. Of course, Yul has already received an Oscar for playing this relationship. Acadamie was not going to give him another, but that's the quality of the film. Do not miss this one.
