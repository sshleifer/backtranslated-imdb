This film has just been screened on Channel Seven - Australian television - today. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, it was very interesting to see how the Nazis treated the Russian Jews ruthlessly, as everywhere else. <br /> <Kellie Martin did a great job. Her tears and frustration as "Frusia" were quite convincing. <br /> <br /> The Holocaust is part of our history that we must not forget. Schindlers List was not the first - and it will not be the last - account of survival and courage in this five-year nightmare. My family is Dutch and I will always applaud all the filmmakers who wish to keep the candlelight alive by saying that someone had the courage to stand up and help those who have been abused, raped and murdered for being "Jews ".
