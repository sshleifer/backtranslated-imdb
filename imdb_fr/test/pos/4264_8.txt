This documentary focuses on the events of Gothenburg 2001. In the Swedish media, protesters were described as criminals who represented anarchy and violence. This film shows that there are none, in reality, they are intelligent, articulate people who have something to say - And says it by the force of the bricks. They believe in a better world, a world where people can think and say what they want - without being targeted. But are their beliefs about the possibility of changing society realistic? I do not think so. <br /> <br /> This documentary sheds light on the issues of greed, capitalism and the future that this could bring. It's a great documentary that is not propaganda, because it's not shown as what they say is right. All that shows is what some people think and it's up to the viewer to decide if what they are doing and what they are doing is true or false. <br /> <br /> I have heard many people describe this propaganda of choice. I think they make a bad decision, because even if you sympathize with the police or the protesters, all you have to do is have more facts, for example, the kid who was shot says he think that's the case. It's nice to throw a brick through a McDonalds window because it's the stage between thinking and acting as you think. <br /> <br /> Overall, this film scared me because you really can not dismiss the facts that the few police officers who fought violent violence, were not convicted or even placed in detention even if the evidence that they had thrown bricks during the demonstration (and sometimes beat people with a baton, even though they were in the street without resisting) has as it should. <br /> <br /> Rating: 8/10 - Very good, but not the best!
