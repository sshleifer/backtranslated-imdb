Boogie Nights was without a doubt the best movie of 1997. I could watch this movie again and again and adore it. I'm in no hurry to watch this epic and catastrophic epic of Titanic again. The fact that Boogie Nights did not even receive the nomination for best film proves how predictable and narrow the Academy is. Only the sweet future of Atom Egoyan and Robert Zemeckis's contact were nearly as good as Boogie Nights. No other filmmaker in recent years has nearly made a film as successful as Tarantino's Pulp Fiction - until now. Paul Thomas Anderson took up the challenge and succeeded. Just as Tarantino kicked off John Travolta's career, P.T. Anderson gave Burt Reynolds the kick off for his career. No doubt Boogie Nights will also star in Don Cheadle, Heather Graham and John Reilly. Overall, a beautiful movie. The best since Pulp Fiction. Maybe even better.
