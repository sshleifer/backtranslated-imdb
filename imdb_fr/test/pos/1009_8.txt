I hate football !! I hate football fans! I hate cars! but this movie was the funniest thing I've seen for a while. <br /> <br /> I was given the chance to see this movie on weekends. All I have to say is that I laughed until I cried and when will it be available in the UK and Denmark. Girls, it's a football movie you'll need to see, it's hilarious! <br /> <br /> The fact that this film started as a crazy advertisement for a phone company is simply amazing, guys may not be well known actors, but it's real humor, with real people, and I applaud them for bringing this to the screen. <br /> <br /> WELL DONE!
