It's certainly not the best movie of all time. But this is definitely worth seeing for people with a particular mind. So, the one who loves sadness and depression, and the scary fairy tales at night, the wolves and the real madness - welcome! If you find a copy, of course :) As for me, I could only endure it once ... But since then, the wolves and Saint Lucia, drawings of children and a Christ without a head live in my nightmares.
