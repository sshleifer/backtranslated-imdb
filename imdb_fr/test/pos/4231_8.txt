The first Child's Play was an original and effective horror film. as expected, however, the two horrible suites seemed to spell the end of this franchise. <br /> <br /> well, when I heard that they were doing a fourth called "bride of chucky", I just rolled my eyes and whispered a "... when will they ever learn? " <br /> <br /> But when I learned that they had had a great director, Ronny Yu and a solid cast, including Jennifer Tilly, inspired by inspiring fear, my interest in the movie grew. <br /> <br /> this film is extremely well done. he has a remarkable sense of humor, a highly stylized graphic violence, an excellent cinematography and the incredible sexy Jennifer Tilly strutting during his first part. (I must add that she is also a fantastic actress.) <br /> <br /> she keeps the tongue in her cheeks without turning into camp territory. the doll effects are great and the verbal interaction between them is inestimable. It's more a horror comedy than a pure horror but humor is welcome and well integrated. <br /> <br /> I already heard that they were preparing a son of Chucky. if they manage to equal the quality of this film, this franchise may have made a comeback. <br /> <br /> Rating: 8.5
