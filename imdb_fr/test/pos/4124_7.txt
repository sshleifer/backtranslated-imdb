First, I'm a big fan of Buddy Holly. I grew up knowing who he was and I knew everything about this fatal plane trip that extinguished three incredibly bright flames like that. But I had never really listened to his music. I had heard a lot about it, yes, but I really did not go to see the real Buddy Holly before sitting down with the intention of getting something out of it. And let me tell you that my world is different now because of him. <br /> <br /> Because of this adoration for such an amazing man, I bought The Buddy Holly Story without seeing it before. I am torn on my views of this movie. Maybe it's because Buddy feels so alive that I can not stand to see Gary Busey in this role. I'll admit that he did a good job as an actor, but his singing seemed so forced. It seemed to me that he knew he did not look a lot like Buddy himself so he was using too much energy to try to get a similar sound. In some parts of the film, he succeeded. But others ... ouch. <br /> <br /> The film covers a period of several years, but I think that the portrait of this period could have been much better managed. I struggled to tell at what point in Buddy's life certain events were happening. I also had a serious problem with some of the historical inaccuracies. I think the worst was the representation of crickets. I understand that their real names can not be used and that, for simplicity, there were only two in the film ... and maybe that was a good thing. Because the choruses of the movie were worthy of scolding, and I did not like the way they were described as a hindrance to Buddy's career. Something else that really did not make any difference in the movie but that upset me was Gary Busey's teeth. They carried me outside! Buddy Holly had much better teeth. I do not know why I noticed it ... but I did it. <br /> <br /> I will finish this review on what I thought was the best part of the movie: the last performance of Buddy. Her last phone call to Maria, the performance of the Big Bopper, bringing him with Richie Valens to the stage, followed by the end of the break. It even surprised me, and I feel that it shows the audience that at one point Buddy Holly was so lively and energetic that his flame died out in the blink of an eye. It was a beautiful way to describe this horrible tragedy, I think. <br /> <br /> A good movie, despite the obvious problems. 7/10. <br /> <br /> Some obvious flaws may require work ... but not bad.
