If I look hard enough, flaws can be found in this movie, mainly with the script. I found Wolf's character not totally convincing. However, these are my only "complaints". Because when this movie started on Cable, I just wanted to record it and watch it later. However, from the beginning, with the mysterious music and Cameron Diaz making her dancing the dance of the 60s, I was riveted. I never got up until the end of the film. It seemed to me that I had never even blinked. <br /> <br /> The roles of Cameron Diaz and Jordana Brewster were excellent. The scenes were beautiful, the girls were beautiful and the music was haunting and very touching. The story was quite unique and sometimes had a surreal quality. The viewer would be more likely to like the picture if he knew the mood of the 60's and 70's, especially in the United States. Many scenes have been able to show something of this difficult time. It was a little more complicated than the simplistic assertion that they wanted to change the world and they ended up disillusioning, although this may be the most obvious aspect. Phoebe is learning more and more about this as the movie progresses. <br /> <br /> One aspect that does not seem to have been covered by other critics and that deserves to be mentioned is the way the two girls seem to drift into life after their father's death. They had both worshiped him and his presence had been a stabilizing factor in their lives and he had obviously loved them a lot. We read a lot today about boys who lost their father too early to lose themselves. This film discusses the impact of the loss of the father on abandoned girls, first on the older sister Faith, then on her younger sister. Their mother feels unable to want to be both parents. This type of dynamics is hardly present in other films, especially in many different layers of plot and sub-plot. Phoebe's internal struggles between reality and perceptions are gradually rising like layers of an onion. <br /> <br /> Speaking of plot, this movie should be better than it has here. I kept waiting for a big plot to be discovered about Faith's death. The way it solved surprised me, although others have guessed it much earlier. <br /> <br /> Maybe not for everyone, but I could watch this movie several times.
