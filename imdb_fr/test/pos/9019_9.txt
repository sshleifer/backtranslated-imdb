Well, I tend to watch movies for one of three reasons. Unfortunately, there are no Transformers in this movie, so I can only recommend it for the value of comedy and the pretty girls (laughing girls) <br /> <br /> the cinema that laughed regularly. Personally, I loved that for Laura Fraser, who in my humble opinion is in great shape!
