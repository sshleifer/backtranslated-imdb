Okay, maybe it's because I'm in Yangchun China when I saw this movie. Maybe it was because I finally had something on TV that I could understand or at least read the subtitles, or maybe it was just funny. Whatever it is, this movie was worth it. <br /> <br /> I had just arrived for my foot and head massage when they offered me the remote control to watch TV. Usually, I put out the damn thing, but I came across this crazy movie and I became addicted. <br /> <br /> The plot, if you could call it a plot, revolves around a cooking competition and is sort of a love story and the food in this movie is the real star. If you like Iron Chef and many other cooking shows in reality TV, you'll love the scenes with food in this movie. <br /> <br /> It's going fast and the subtitles are so fast you'll do better. to be at the reading speed for this one. However, the action is essentially slapstick, so you do not always need to read the entire subtitle to get an idea. <br /> <br /> The main actress is charming and the main actor is not bad to watch either. . They are both worth seeing. Finally, if you have time to lose and want to laugh, this is not a bad choice for both. <br /> <br /> I do not speak a word of Chinese, but I perfectly understood the cultural humor. of this film. For those who speak Chinese, it may be even better. Overall, I give this a 8 out of 10 and currently, I'm even looking for a copy to keep during my stay in China, and to keep for my return home, it will be a nice reminder to me of my stay in Yangchun . a silly afternoon at the massage parlor watching a silly movie.
