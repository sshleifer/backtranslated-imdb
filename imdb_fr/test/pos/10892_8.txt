There is not much that comes close to perfect rhythmic narration and suspenseful action-packed levels like "GoldenEye". When it came out, it was the best game of all time and even today it remains strong. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that this game became boring after a few months of play and that I did it again until two years later, I went back to his best, almost as if I played it for the first time. <br /> <br /> There are 20 action-packed levels, which is probably the most of all James Bond games to date. The most memorable level is probably the Tank level, which was probably the most explosive video game sequence at that time. And first-person shooting, as well as the use of Q gadgets, is what James Bond fans always want to use. <br /> <br /> Frankly, as a James Bond fan, I'm looking for aspects of a true James Bond experience. , which now appear in PS2 games. So this game, although it has a good action and usable gadgets, I expected a little more, even in 1997. I did not like either that this game has neither Q or M nor Moneypenny, nor any other MI6 member. While watching the movies, Bond interacts with these characters at least several times during each movie, but they are not visible anywhere in this game. And the vocal dialogue would have made the game more alive than the text dialogue used. They had the technology. They just did not use it. <br /> <br /> The most boring aspect of this game is probably that it follows the story of the film accurately, and that it is inconsistent in other respects. For example, you have to protect or save Natalya on many levels, even though in the movie she can take care of herself. There are also unnecessary levels, like the Boat level where you have to disarm some bombs (which is not in the movie), which adds nothing to the story. There are even levels where you save Natalya, but at the beginning of the next level, she is captured again. How? <br /> <br /> Oh good. Even these little things can not really belittle this game. And while I prefer new games, this Bond experience is an experience you'll never forget. <br /> <br /> 8 of 10
