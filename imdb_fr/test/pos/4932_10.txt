When I was a child, I loved "Tiny Toons". I especially liked "Tiny Toons: How I spent my summer vacation". I thought it was funny to laugh on the floor. A few years later, my friend had the video. And I thought I would watch it for the good old days. I was still on the floor laughing. My opinion, the Plucky and Hampton sketch is the best. They decide to go to "Happy World Land". And they end up having a crazy adventure to get there. All the sketches are funny. I am still looking for the video. So, if anyone has any advice. Write me please. <br /> <br /> This is one of the funniest drawings I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> 10/10
