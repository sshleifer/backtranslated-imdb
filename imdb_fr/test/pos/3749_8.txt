A woman and her aunt go to Scotland to find her evasive fianc√©. It is a very much criticized film because of its outcome, but until then, it is interesting, well played, strange and endowed with a beautiful scenery (by William Cameron Menzies, developed for 3D projection). Veronica Hurst is captivating and distinguished, a sort of chic and sophisticated Brit, Marilyn Monroe, still in love with Richard Carlson, who hides a family secret in her imposing castle. there are even bats in the belfry! She moves quietly to the last extraordinary room, when Hurst and her aunt (Katherine Emery, also narrator), sneak out of the castle at night to venture into the labyrinth and find what they are looking for in its center . When I was a child, I always remembered this sequence - there is nothing more frightening (nor claustrophobic) than not finding your way out of a maze of hedges 10 feet. Naturally, the two women separate, paving the way for a captivating suspense with horrible music. The end result is a little disappointing, because Carlson's epilogue at the end makes sense for all events, even to build sympathy. Worth to be seen.
