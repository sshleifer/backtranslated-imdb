As a former Highland Rugby (HR) player, I feel that I can eventually answer some of the questions and confusion that have been raised. I think I am also able to give an overview of the club and previous stories. Oh, and it's going to be a long post, I already know it. <br /> <br /> First of all, people who said that the movie did not show real rugby had a good argument. The film is full of bad tackles, misplaced people and so much more. If you want to know what a real rugby game looks like, you will not have the best idea of ​​this movie. But the fact is that nothing less than sitting down and watching a highlight or jumping into a game yourself will not be satisfying. It's Hollywood, not ESPN! Really, how many movies about the sport really make you feel like you're in the game? Not much that I saw. I think it's important to keep in mind that the film is about rugby players, much more than rugby. <br /> <br /> Next, the Haka is VERY an integral part of Highland Rugby. It's not something they just started in the movie. To be honest, I do not know how the tradition started, but Highland mimics the All Blacks in many ways. The uniform is also based on the All Blacks. The film did not explain well the origins of Haka and, to be honest, I do not think that is the case. But I can tell you that every member of the team knows exactly where he comes from and what it means. Regarding the person from China (?) Who said that only Maori can perform a Haka, I would suggest that they take a look at the All Blacks and tell me if they think they are all maori. Believe it or not, Utah has a very large Polynesian community and a good part of them like to play rugby for local teams. I am Hawaiian myself. Whenever possible, the Haka is led by a Maori. The team does not do it because they think they are Maori, they do it because of some of the problems presented in the film. The concept of unity and "those who left before" is an integral part of the culture of human resources, and the message behind the Haka, for all who know it well, supports these values. It was a song of a leader who thought he was going to die (Ka Mate), and those around him supported him by telling him that he would live (Ka Ora) and stimulate him. It's not for me to say, but it's the ideology behind it and the reason it's done. "Kia Kaha" is also a motto well used by the team, even though the actors have had trouble saying it. <br /> <br /> For those who questioned Highland's ability to play rugby, I'll remind you did not really play Highland in this movie. Many of the extras were former Highland players and other teams, but the main characters were all actors. Believe it or not, Highland is really very good at what they do and very well respected by the international community. Certainly, some years produce better teams than others (that's what you would expect with a sports team), but you do not accumulate the record of victories of the RH being just correct. In the year of my diploma, (1998), Highland was one of 12 teams invited to the World Rugby School Championship in Zimbabwe. The hand-selected teams around the world represented the best talent in high school rugby at the time. Highland obviously did not win the first place (New Zealand did), but they managed to take third place in the tournament, beating the Tongan national champions in their last match. And although US rugby will never reach the level of talent in New Zealand or South Africa, third place in the world is not serious. Highland also has a touring tradition in New Zealand every two or three years and usually comes back with more wins than defeats. <br /> <br /> The majority of characters featured in this movie are based on real characters and stories. I watched this movie with my brothers, who also played for Highland, and between the four of us, we were pretty sure we could identify almost all the main characters. Nobody knew a white Rasta. Of course, as it was not a documentary, Hollywood took some liberties, but to tell you the truth, not as much as you think. The film was actually quite accurate in showing the daily practices of 2 ½ hours, as well as the mandatory personal and weight training. Sometimes he was really running until you vomited. He also showed the service and other activities of the team (like the Chuck-a-Rama buffet) that were really part of teamwork. <br /> <br /> And finally, the film, in my opinion (obviously very biased) It was a very good movie. And I think the reason is that I looked at it as an inspiring sports film. I did not think it would be a pure rugby film or an Academy Award-winning drama. It was just a uplifting film about a rugby team, with morale, encouragement and a good dose of jokes for entertainment. I hope I have addressed some of the issues that people have encountered with the film and that you can now enjoy it for what it was. <br /> <br /> Kia Kaha
