Gake no Ue no Ponyo is a beautifully animated film and a relief of the many soulless CGI movies that are made. The pastel and crayon backgrounds were a surprise after Sen de Chihiro no Kamikakushi (Spirited Away) and Hauru no Ugoku Shiro (Howl's mobile castle) being so stylistically similar. The style worked well for the film and was exceptionally well done. The time and effort devoted to the animation of this film are greatly appreciated because they give the characters much more life, the details and the attention they take make the film much better. There are several big scenes in the movie that have a lot of movement and action. The biggest for me being a scene, Ponyo's sisters turn into a massive wave like a fish as she runs on it. The story is simple but fairly well written and played. The plot remained focused on character relationships and, although it was not the case, as well as in Tonari no Totoro (My Neighbor Totoro), it is still fantastic. I had the impression that each character had the appropriate screen time, unlike Spirited Away, which was so cluttered with distinctive characters that it could have been extended into an entire series. My only real problem with the movie was the end. The way it is written in the English version gives at least the impression that S≈çsuke will be the subject of a great test that will prove to be simply a promise made to his mother, Ponyos, that he would love Ponyo. Although more thought in this area leads me to think that the translation may not be as accurate as the test, it is the promise and that, deep down, it really thinks it. The film, however, seemed to end abruptly. Other than that, the movie was great and I highly recommend it.
