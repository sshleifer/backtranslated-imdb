'Crossing the Bridge: Istanbul Sound' is one of the best music documentaries I have seen recently and is more than a film about music. It is also a declaration of musical love for a fabulous city, one of the largest cities in Europe and the world, one of the most important cities in the history of Europe and Europe. Islam, the city that can serve as a bridge in the future, Europe and the Middle East or can mean once again, as has happened in history, the precipice between two worlds. <br /> <br /> Then there is music. The film's interesting approach to music is that it starts with modern music and we hear a lot of (good) rock and rap in the first third of the film. So, as a step back in time, the soundtrack takes us to roots, traditional Turkish music, commercial novels and exotic instruments that are fundamental elements in the landscape of Turkish music. In a country as complex and confrontational as East Turkey, the film does not avoid certain political aspects, such as the censorship introduced by the military regime in the 1980s or the relevance of songs by minorities, especially Kurds. One of the best musical moments is actually a Kurdish singer with a fantastic voice who sings in a cathedral-shaped hammam. <br /> <br /> We love the city and its music at the end of the year. the viewing and the audience of this film. I have never been to Istanbul but after seeing this movie, I'm sure I want to visit this place soon.
