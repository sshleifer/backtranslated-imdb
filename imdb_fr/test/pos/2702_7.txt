Whenever I hear Karen Carpenter's voice, I feel that old, familiar feeling of the 70s blues. What an extremely beautiful and mature voice she had. Cynthia Gibb in the lead role did a good job, however, I thought Karen Allen would have been a better choice. It's a tear-stained film that shows Karen and Richard's professional careers very well, but also Karen's personal difficulties and illness. The recording sessions in Herp Albert's studio are very well done. Whatever Karen Carpenter's situation was, there was a time when she was very special and brought a lot of joy to her fans and her music lovers. Even if you're not a fan of Carpenter, it's a beautiful story that shows how a great talent can fall victim to the pressures of society.
