During the brief period between Clint Eastwood's series of spaghetti westerns and his films Dirty Harry, director Don Siegel and himself teamed up to create this unusual picture. Eastwood plays a wounded corporal of the Union Army during the American Civil War who is cared for by a Southern Girls School until he recovers from his injuries. It's been a while since young women (most of whom appear to be teenagers) have a man on the scene and are therefore reluctant to hand him over to local rebel soldiers. The resulting situations are often humorous, shocking, erotic, or even downright grotesque, whereas Eastwood slowly regains its strength and begins to ruminate over the establishment. <br /> <br /> The basic scenario sounds almost like a porn movie. We have a male man suddenly surrounded by nubile young women. Most of them are sexually attracted to him. And he is more than willing to spread love among them. The material never really slips to the level of "tasteless", however. Eastwood, Siegel and cinematographer Bruce Surtees are so talented filmmakers that the film still retains its dignity. <br /> <br /> Eastwood's John McBurney is unlike any other character he's played with. McBurney is an amoral, accomplice and lecherous charlatan. He knows that most women, even the youngest, want his body, and he lets more than one tempt him. McBurney often uses flattery to drool women, then uses her sturdy physique to attract them. He is like a drunk player at a cocktail, often hitting different women even in the same scene! Finally, his lustful manners cause him great agony and loss in a way that you must see for yourself. This author would not think of revealing the specific consequences of his actions, but there is no doubt that he was waiting for them. <br /> <br /> Eastwood gives an excellent performance. He seems to be having fun with the role until things go really ugly, then he gets mean and ugly. Geraldine Page is a treat like the B * ch steel that runs the school. We know that she wants McBurney as much as the other girls, but with her checkered past shown to us in flashbacks, we discover that it's not all she's looking for! Mae Mercer as a school-owned slave also gives an excellent performance. She obviously knows that McBurney is a skunk from the beginning and she never lets her fake charm lower her guard. This is a character on which you will want to know more after the end of the film. She seems to have a greater knowledge of the world than anyone in the movie. <br /> <br /> The film was badly done in its theatrical release. Nobody really knew what to think about it, and some of its content probably raised a few eyebrows in 1971. For example, in an early scene, we see Eastwood romantically embrace a 12-year-old girl. Is he just trying to shut her up when the rebel soldiers get closer or is he really happy? Probably both! A fantastic sequence later shows that Clint gets on well with Page, but with his young assistant! Really interesting things in this one. It's a good thing that Eastwood becomes his star, otherwise it would have been forgotten for a long time. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended. 9 out of 10 stars. <br /> <br /> The hunting dog.
