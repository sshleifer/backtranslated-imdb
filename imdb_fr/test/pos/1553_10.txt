If you like alternative realities and contemplate what is real and what is only a fantasy, it's a thriller that will let you guess and make you think. Try to get a copy and see for yourself! I recently watched it at a L.A. movie festival and it was by far the best of the band I saw. It helped to make it something, unlike the others that were projected. It's very well run and the value of production is top. I would compare that to Jacob's Ladder in that it allows you to guess what is the true reality of the world in which we are. You must absolutely try to search for this film and if this film is presented in any festival Check it out.
