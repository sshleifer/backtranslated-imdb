The caretaker of the working class, proud and provocative (MBCribbins), is finally conquered by families of the upper middle class who have lost their chance. Father (MI Cuthbertson) incarcerated for treason - the penalty incurred being the death penalty at the time - let's not forget), mother (the very beautiful Miss D. Sheridan) brave and resourceful, loyal and loving, and mainly - older daughter (Miss J. Agutter) staggering on the threshold of adolescence - hurt and confused about the fate of her father. Mr. Perks, like many workers of his day, will have nothing to do with what he sees as a "charity" and it is a key moment in the film when he finally accepts the gifts of birthday offered to him by the children. not compromise its principles. Although the charming Miss Agutter received all the honors, it is Mr. Cribbins and Miss Sheridan whose performances dominate "The Railway Children". They both know how Edwardian society operates on both sides of the spectrum, but there is mutual respect and an unspoken understanding. . It's basically a movie about the family. At a time when a mother can kidnap her own daughter and give her a ransom and be considered "socially incapable" rather than adaptable to living in a decent society, and when two "human beings" can strike and kick to death to a baby without being accused of murder, the "family" can be considered as an old-fashioned, elitist, racist or even homophobic concept, but a century ago it was the glue that kept society at all levels. Mr. Cribbins' and Miss Sheridan's families are the archetype of our time. Strong and loving, bonded together to external influences, integral units with moral certainty mocked in the twenty-first century. What might seem like a dull and preached political tract is transformed by Mr. Lionel Jeffries into an enchanting hymn of hope, faith, optimism and courage. That all these attributes were once considered the norm and too often scorned and cynical is a reflection on our society rather than that of Miss Nesbit. This film, perfectly perfect, can hardly move people who are worried about the human condition.
