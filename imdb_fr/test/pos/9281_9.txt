I totally agree with GarryJohal's comments from Singapore on this film. Quote: 'Yes, non-Singaporeans can not see what the problem is with this movie. Some of the references in this film fly just above the heads of foreign viewers and it is mostly the Singaporeans who "would get" in reality. This is still not quite the truth and as a Malaysian-Chinese, I "understand" although I do not speak Hokkien, because we have the same problems in Malaysia. I know it's really hard to understand and accept as a reality, but it's certainly not a "story without history". I had the pleasure of seeing this film outside of Malaysia as it will be permanently banned also in Malaysia. Which means you get it in the form of "illegally copied VCD or DVD" or hope someone is kind enough to "share" it on the Internet. This is not another "violent drama for adolescents ..." because it describes in an interesting way the reality that exists in Singapore (and in Malaysia) (sad + humor). I was just a little sad to know that this movie suffered about 20 censorship cuts. Such a waste!
