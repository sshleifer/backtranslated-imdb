It's speculation. This film could inspire Paramount Pictures to shoot the movie The Core. Both films have something in common. The only improvement for Inferno is a better distribution. The cast of Inferno is always good. Excellent movie 8 out of 10. It's worth watching. This film has the truth, the heat waves are real. Heat-related power cuts are another truth. Where I live, I have actually heard transformers blow. Heat disorders are possible because people looking to cool off can become agitated. There is a lot of teamwork in this film. Once again, it's worth watching a movie. The film has a good distribution. The film has no slow points.
