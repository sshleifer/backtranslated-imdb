Although I'm not a golf fan, I attended a taste of this movie and loved it. The historical parameters, the glaring class distinctions, and seeing the pros and cons on both sides of the dividing line caught my attention. The actors and their characterizations were all mesmerizing. And I was on the edge of my seat during the golf segments, which were not only dramatic and exciting, but easy to follow. Towards the end of this film, "Seabiscuit" comes to mind, although "The greatest game ever played" is a much less complex story than this film. In both cases, the fact that the events actually occurred has reinforced my interest.
