I'm sure the film has some flaws in the logic, but it captivated me so much that I did not care. The film unfolds like a cheerful and fun child's play together with a Schwarzenegger action movie. It is filled with action, excitement and humorous moments. Sean Astin is fun to watch and I have not seen Louis Gossett Jr since I saw "Diggstown" in theaters. He's a good underrated actor and I love watching him on the screen. I'm just wondering what he's doing now. Unfortunately, he may be playing in many of these live movies. Let's hope my hypothesis is wrong. Anyway, it's a fun thriller, and I suggest you watch it. <br /> <br /> My score: 7 (out of 10)
