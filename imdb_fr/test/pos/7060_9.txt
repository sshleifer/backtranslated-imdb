It's easily the best of summer camp movies. In fact, few others are even fair, let alone entertaining as this one. <br /> <br /> The film is simply out to have good, clean, fun. Many people who went to summer camp when they were kids will see that it is presented here faithfully as it usually was, but with a zany comedy mixed up. Bill Murray, as chief camp counselor, Tripper, runs a fine overall cast. and is usually at the center of senseless madness. Tripper has excellent duplicates, usually broadcasting his jokes as pseudo-ads on the camp's sound system. <br /> <br /> Several major supporters have encouraged campers and counselors to build a myriad of fun and interesting intrigues. , while sprinkling among the many incidents of the hi-jinx camp. Spaz (Jack Blum) and Fink (Keith Knight) were two particularly well-made characters. The adventures (and mishaps) of these two are hilarious. Each has classic lines, and these are characters that you like and for which you are root. Look for Spaz in the pandemonium scene of disco dance. <br /> <br /> The girls in the story are also realistic characters. They are not idiots, naive, whimsical, over-excited, nervous, nor any of the other overused and abominable adolescent character stereotypes. Kristine DeBell, Kate Lynch, Cindy Girling and others make these characters believable. <br /> <br /> The necessary jokes abound, usually at the expense of camp director Morty (Harvey Atkin). The nature of these jokes starts to outrageous and progresses from there. However, with all the foolishness that passes, Tripper and the others have their serious side. For example, Tripper befriends a shy and lonely child, Rudy (Chris Makepeace), and takes him under his wing. <br /> <br /> The story ends with a sports competition against a rival camp. It's an excellent final "root for the outsiders". When the chips are exhausted, Tripper's motivational talk entitled "It does not matter" is inspired and one of the best moments in the film. And get ready to root: "Spaz, Spaz! Spaz !!!" "
