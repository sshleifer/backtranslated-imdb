Six out of seven people who have taken the time to comment on this film have very positive answers. The negative comment lies (or appeared) on the front page of the film's location in the IMDb. <br /> <br /> I found "What Alice Found" as one of the best movies no one has ever heard of. that I saw this year. His score of 6.4 is misleading and may depend more on the difficult subject than the quality of the film. Who would think that a film about truck prostitution is worthy of interest? Guess again. <br /> <br /> For me, "Alice" was an exciting psychological thriller. I was practically at the edge of my seat all the time. It's a very credible story with a realistic scenario and is very well written. In a fairer world, actress Judith Ivey would win awards for letting you guess whether she was good or bad. <br /> <br /> Ignore the rating and watch this fantastic movie. (And by the way, I wish there was a soundtrack album.)
