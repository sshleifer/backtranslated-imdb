I have seen this once probably like most people my age (55) in the 60's. I understand the dissatisfaction of the final product by both families. But it's a good movie, it was a super opera; but as a film, it's wonderful. This film should at least be broadcast in video format, the other generations can acquire a greater appreciation of good music and stories. The cast was made up of some of the biggest black actors of all time, most of whom are now dead; Only Sidney P. is always with us. Please do not wait until it is gone and the film, like all old movies, becomes unusable in the face of the ravages of time. Once again, it's a great movie that we do not see very often today, if ever.
