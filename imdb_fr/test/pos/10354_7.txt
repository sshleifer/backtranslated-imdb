I felt compelled to comment on this film because it is rated as the fourth lowest rated science film of all time on the IMDb base. WHAT!?!? Of course, this film is bad, but it's HILAIRE! It's not horrible at Ed Wood's level, it's more surreal and uneven. <br /> <br /> There are classic moments in the movie. The brain surgery is rough and even crazier when you know that the film was rated PG! Gor chasing his dolly before being thrown battery acid on his face - "Mine! Gimmee!" Zandor Vorkoff's speeches at the beginning of the film - "Before Amir, Kali was just another weak country struggling to free itself from centuries of stagnant feudalism!" Angelo Rossito also has some good lines- "No, Gor! No!" "You want those keys, are not you, my pretty girls?" It is absolutely false that this film is the 4th lowest on the IMDb, because it is ENTERTAINMENT. No matter how good a film is, if it still manages to be weird, bizarre, disturbing or entertaining, it has merit and does not deserve to be ignored and rejected. I will not defend most of Al Adamson's films, but this one, with Dracula VS. FRANKENSTEIN and BLOOD OF GHASTLY HORROR are fun enough to make up for their horrors.
