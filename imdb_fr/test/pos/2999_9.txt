I bought this movie because of Raquel Welch. She was beautiful in this movie as she played the role of Harry's girlfriend (Mike Wagner). Harry, a thief in bad luck, trying to make a last holdup. Harry goes to a funeral where he meets Vittorio De Sica and takes him on a tour. When things do not work, they set up mines to find the fastest way to get money. Harry and his band decide, with the help of Vittorio De Sica, to be part of the crowd. Rest assured that no matter what happens to the gang, the outcome will never be the same and keep you on the edge. The rest of the way out, you have to look for yourself. As far as Raquel is concerned, if you are a fan of here, you have to watch this movie because it has never looked so attractive to stand on the beach with a ******. I give this movie 10 weasel stars on the body of Raquel Welch alone. It was not for nothing that she was the most popular actress of the sixties. She was the sexual symbol that everyone wanted and nobody could get. Not only does she look good, she can act even better. If you like, Raquel Welch, then you'll like this movie
