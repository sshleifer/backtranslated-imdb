It's been almost 25 years since I saw this movie. I would consider this film as a classic of all time in a dramatic category. Anthony Queen gives one of the best performances of all time. In a few minutes he goes from laughing to tears. This film represents a splendid image of the transformation of humanity after the Second World War. How much of this generation and future generations have lost their innocence. It took me a long time to find this movie under his name "The 25th Hour". This type of film is not a lucrative business, but it's a treasure for some. I am very surprised why this film is not used more broadly for the media so that more people can take advantage of this image.
