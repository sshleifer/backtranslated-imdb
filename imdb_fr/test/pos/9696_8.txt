I have always been a fan of Jackass, as well as Viva La Bam and Wildboyz. And when you're a fan of something, your expectations are great, no matter what your "heroes" are going to play. And if there is one thing I've learned about expecting a lot of people you just like to watch and listen to, it's never to hope too much, because 99 times out of 100 you'll be disappointed. <br /> <br /> Although, when I heard that a Jackass 2 was getting ready, I thought, "Even I can not lower my expectations for this film", and as a result from that, I sat today, ready to laugh, but also to say at the end "Well, it was OK, but I'm a little disappointed". How wrong I was! All the members of the Jackass team bring this film well above the first, showing you the craziest stunts one after the other, thus making the whole world understand that they would do nothing to try to make wrong - and that's what we like! I cried laughing from the first minute until the very last minute of the film, sometimes even screaming with laughter, unable to control me! Cascade after waterfall, stuffing after farce, and hilarious comments about the stream - it just can not be better than that! Incredible from start to finish, guaranteed to make you laugh. I have two things left to say. PLEASE READ AND THINK God, that there is a Jackass 3 - these guys clearly have a lot to offer!
