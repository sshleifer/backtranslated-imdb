Faith Akin made me understand once more the depth of my passion for this city called Istanbul. Faith being called a city of cultural mosaics, Faith Akin contributed to its success thanks to the mosaics of music interpreted in the film. In addition, the highlight of the film, in my opinion, is the scene where Muzeyyen Senar (a diva of Turkish music) sings at age 86, as she had done in her youth, and rolls the raki glass in the air without spilling. a drop, which is a traditional act of raki culture. She is just wonderful. Sezen Aksu (a Turkish pop singer) with her mystical and meaningful look at the end of her song that gives the film its Turkish title is no less of a culmination point. Finally, the wonderful landscapes of Istanbul can make you nostalgic if you are away. You must beware!
