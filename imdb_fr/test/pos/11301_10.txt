I just want to tell the woman above that the film does not credit Beethoven with begging. At first, they show it. Thank you. I think it's an incredible movie. They chose the right music for the movie atmosphere, the animation is wonderful and the voices of the characters were very well chosen. It teaches children to never give up and always have hope. Princess Annika does not give up and shows the children that they can do the same. The film also has humor for all ages, parents and children, to laugh. The colors in this movie are great and kids can really feel good looking at them. I watched this movie for the first time, now I'm a big fan and I'm sure your child will be too. Walmart sells tons of Barbie and Magic of Pegasus products so that your child can continue to enjoy the movie even if he is not watching it. Thank you!
