Kannathil Muthamittal is for sure an excellent film. I have to give it to Mani Ratnam for great staging and A.R. Rahman for good songs. The work of the camera is simply excellent and is similar to Black Hawk Down and Saving Private Ryan. I will be shocked if this film does not win an Oscar for the best foreign film or even the best photographic work.
