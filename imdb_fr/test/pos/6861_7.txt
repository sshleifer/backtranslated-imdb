A horror image finally ready to be parodic but still in play may frighten some of those who are nervous or easily disgusted when they see what they have under the skin. I laughed anyway. It was easy to decipher the real killer and his acting did not help. It only made Potente even more beautiful. Anatomy is not really an image of horror for foreigners of the genre, but those that are contained should be the subject of some unintentional laughter and an interesting peak of German horror cinema. 6/10
