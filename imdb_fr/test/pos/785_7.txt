Well, I'm a big fan of Italian horror and I love movies from directors such as Argento, Fulci, Bava Sr and Bava Jr, to name only the most famous ones. "Villa delle anime maledette" is one of the most underrated films of its kind, shot at the beginning of the cinema crisis, and director Carlo Ausino sounds totally new (although he directed six films) . This is the price that Italian directors have to pay for not working in Rome ...). But the movie is not so bad. And it's absolutely wrong to talk about "trash". OK, the plot is not so original. it reminds me of things like the Amytville series (the year is the same as Damiano Damiani's "Amityville Possession") or "Shock", Mario Bava's latest work. But you must think that it is the film of a director of photography (like the films of Mario Bava); The most important thing is the atmosphere, not the story or the characters; atmosphere very well created by the use of light and the movement of the camera. The rest stays in the background. I think the movie works; not so good, but it works; it's certainly better than many Hollywood productions like "The Haunting" that have a bigger budget, but no bigger ideas ...
