The last person who dies before the New Year is cursed to drive the Phantom Chariot for a whole year, picking up the souls of the dead. <br /> <br /> I saw a scene from this old silent Swedish horror film on Youtube and decided to find the whole movie. The work was worth it because it is an absolutely incredible film for the time. It has a wonderfully strange atmosphere. The old horror film directors have really created the perfect atmosphere. Unfortunately, many current filmmakers do not seem to understand how important the setting and the atmosphere are and opt for the fear of economic leap. The visual effects are excellent considering its production date. If you can find a copy of this, I highly recommend giving it a watch. 9/10
