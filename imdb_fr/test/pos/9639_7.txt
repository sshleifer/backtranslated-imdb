Good excerpts from World War I ships and aircraft complete this excellent war drama taking place in the Adriatic. Walter Huston is excellent as a commander who knows his place and it has no place for personal feelings. The safety of the ship and the mission must always come first. Robert Montgomery is the lieutenant who has not yet mastered the role a leader must play in combat. He makes bad decisions, endangering the submarine and his crew, but eventually becomes a "real man" after his military court appearance and removal from the Navy. Robert Young plays in a junior lieutenant rank and Jimmy Durante as a cook. Along with the tragedy of the war, an equally important love triangle of the war between Montgomery and Madge Evans plays the role of Huston's daughter and the wife of a tragically wounded aviator. Recommended.
