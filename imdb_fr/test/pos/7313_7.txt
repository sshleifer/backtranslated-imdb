Norma Shearer is dazzled as she is transformed from a crooked and crazy housewife into a potentially divorced seductress. Most of the 1930s have a grumpy look - the camera work is sometimes quite slow - but we have to forgive those pleasures for speaking for their glowing "qualities". As a guest of the eccentric globetrotter, Marie Dressler-Shearer mixes with a strange assortment of love-loving types, including her long-lost husband. The dialogs are fun, often nifty and the performances on the tail. Shearer and Dressler shine the most. Shearer even shows his piano expertise in musical brevity. Her strange but attractive posture and her "camera connection" are evident everywhere - and she strikes every note of emotion, sincerely and purposefully. For his time. . a good show.
