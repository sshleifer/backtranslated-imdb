A priest's egg, this one. I began by hating him, with his predictable 'Old Dark House' setting, his constant references to the recent horrors of the United States and their regular comings and goings in the dimly lit corridors. <br /> <br /> It's moments of originality. <br /> <br /> I began to wonder, once the murder began, how they would last with only a cast of six people, then we have flashbacks during a previous visit to the building and we have a whole series of bloody murders that are pretty effective. <br /> <br /> Naschy is fine and in the end it's a pretty good movie. It's not enough to jump and take one, loud enough.
