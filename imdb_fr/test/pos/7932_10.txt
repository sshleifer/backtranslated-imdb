I learned a lot from the reactions of previous viewers. Is there one that does not mention "propaganda"? Too flippant. "Perception depends on the concept". I love Fred Astaire's musicals, great songs and Fred's incomparable grace. But comrades, if you see rich, brainless, brainless parasites dancing about oppressed and unemployed people, this is a valid criticism of "capitalist propaganda". Every film is imbued with the values ​​of its time and place, not to mention those who finance it? the pipers who call the air. Great art transcends everything, like "Nevsky" and "All Quiet on the Western Front". I admit. I saw him forty years ago. But the images are burned in my brain. This is the biggest battle scene ever filmed. And it makes you horrified to be thrilled. "Plastic ice cream" was it said? This is the real death you are watching. Real extras have died doing this. Looks like the real thing is now defined as a special effect. Similarly, "too long" - for an age of loss of attention? Mozart had "too many notes"? Propaganda, the Catholic Church defamed? The Vatican ALWAYS stood there when they appealed to old favors to obtain the German Christian Democratic government. to recognize Croatia in the 1990s? remember chaos and genocides? Forget the accessories, Nevsky lighting painted the medieval world ?? like a Breughel. There is one at Hampton Court Palace showing a massacre. Dutch nationalist propaganda perhaps rude, but it tears the heart. Stylized acting game? So, what's Henry V (Olivier movie)? Naturalism? Does anyone believe that the medieval English knight killers have spoken so? As said, Prokofiev's music is beautiful. Only Ken Russell and Eisenstein had the genius and the ability to reproduce the sound and the image at this octane level of 100. OK, you want the bit and the bit. I will risk the nervous nervous each time. Eisenstein did not copy the Wehrmacht helmets, but his model seems to have been the buckets worn by the "Teutonic Knights" during Nazi reenactments of the 1930s. Eisenstein was a genius, but unlike Hollywood directors, he had almost unlimited time and funding (non-commercial) Modern Russian directors are released from political chains but have no money. Even Kurasawa had to make one last (awesome) film in Communist Russia. He was revered but without funds in his own country (a bit like Russell). How much propaganda is in the eye of the beholder? Imagine healthy people from another world who love peace. How would they react to Nevsky? Would the battle or mourning of the dead dominate their knowledge? If we did not know about gas chambers and SS, what about "Triumph of the Will"? Where can I get a Nevsky DVD, cheap?
