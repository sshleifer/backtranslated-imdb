This short film was the first short film published by Paramount Famous Studios and was one of many films made by the studio showing Popeye engaged directly against the enemy, most often the Japanese. While Warner Brothers, Disney and, to a lesser extent, other studios, often made short films describing Germans as leaves, the majority of Famous Studios' efforts were focused on the Japanese. Given the sea links between Pearl Harbor and Popeye, this is quite understandable. It's a short average. Seein 'Red, White an' Blue and spinach For Britain have aged better. But it's always worth watching. Recommended.
