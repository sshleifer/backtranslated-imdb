People criticize the NSNA because it is a low point in Bond God's career, Sean Connery, and because it is unofficial. *** MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS * First of all, this movie is better than any other Bond movie starring another actor, then Connery, all aspiring by my name. Sean Connery is the only real Bond, no one even approaches its hardness, its beautiful appearance and its sex appeal. Yes, this film is a low point in Connery's career in Bond, but it remains the best bond movie of the 80s. Sean Connery is the only Bond actor who is good at a later age. He did not become a mess like Moore, but kept his beautiful appearance and hardness, while gaining gray hair. So what? He's still the only true 007, and he's as cool and resilient as ever. Sean Connery is the one and only 007. And this movie is definitely worth seeing, no matter what anyone says. No canon aperture, but you can not have everything, do you? great theme song, though.
