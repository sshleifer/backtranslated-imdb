'Wicked Little Things' really separates from other zombie movies. First of all, all the zombies in the movie do not start exactly to bite you and tear you flesh with their bare hands. They kill you with either a spade or a shovel and you eat after. Second, they can not die. In most zombie movies, you can shoot a zombie in the head and kill them, but they will not die. Third major reason why this film separates itself, all zombies are children. How exactly did they die to become zombies? They were working in a coal mine when, suddenly, they were all killed in a collapse. Now they wander in the forest with their shovels and shovels, waiting for someone to pass in order to kill and eat them. Oh, they also go out at night.Yes, only at night.This makes the movie even more fun so it would be if they came out in the morning.In the violent and bloody chaos of this movie, 'Wicked Little Things' is a great choice if you are looking for a movie about zombie kids. Do not expect awesome things like "Dawn of the Dead" or "Land of the Dead", but expect a lot of coolness and violence that will turn this movie into a zombie fan. Everyone Give Taylor-Compton Scout from Rob Zombie's "Halloween" movie a huge asset to give her a great performance like the one she had in "Halloween". She really has to start playing in more horror movies.
