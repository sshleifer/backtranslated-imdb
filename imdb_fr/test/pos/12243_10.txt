This film has it all: fully developed characters, a realistic representation of work in Washington, bathed in warmth and humor specific to Albert Brooks. The absence of news on the network is even more problematic than in 1987. Remember that it was a pre-cable! It's so rewarding to be interested in complex people who are trying to achieve complex goals - and all of this is moving with blazing speed. Such a faithful description of friendships that switch to romance. See if you can spot John Cusack as the angry messenger! And do you recognize Peter Hackes from Broadcast News? Finally, if you come from Washington, see if you agree with Holly Hunter's directions to taxi drivers!
