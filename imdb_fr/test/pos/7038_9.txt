Ahhhh, 1984 ... I was young and stupid, and I was starting to taste these exotic cigarettes, while I was living in a squat in the Moss Side area of ​​Manchester, with the most incredible case of cockroach infestation. <br /> <br /> After a few of these doobies, this show was ROTFLMAO material - I was a passionate fan. Then I looked at the floor (or walls, or just about anywhere) and saw my own collection of "little armadillos" scroll by. <br /> <br /> I do not know if it was the chemical I remember thinking at the time that the declared surrealism of the series was fantastic - it was my second favorite thing on television at the time. era (number 1 was the season of Luis Bunuel's films broadcast by Channel 4). Radical art still lives! <br /> <br /> You must also have this theme theme! .... I swear I will never drink again ....
