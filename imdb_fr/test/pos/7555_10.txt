A wonderful movie about people. I saw Four Friends for the first time during his first appearance in the movie theaters and I have seen him several times since. If I do not watch it on TV, I will praise it with friends. Invariably, the people with whom I watched this movie find it enjoyable. He deals with friends from childhood to adulthood, in the 50s and 60s. It's very funny and moving, to deal with first love (and first sex), racism, war, politics - the 1960s. It can also be quite dramatic. If you like movies about people, this one is well worth it.
