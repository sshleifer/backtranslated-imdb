Rajkumar Santoshi tries comedy and achieves it. One of the few good movies that involves Salman Khan. A very funny movie from start to finish. All the characters contribute to the film and believe me, there are many. Aamir Khan, Salman Khan, Raveena Tandon, Karishma Kapoor, Paresh Rawal, Viju Khote, Jagdip, Deven Verma, Shakti Kapoor, Harish Patel, Tiku Talsania, etc. The direction, the editing, the sound is not up to par, but it does not matter, because the actors largely compensate what it represents.
