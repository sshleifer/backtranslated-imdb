I loved this movie, I saw it at the age of 8 and almost seven years later, I was able to see it again tonight. I really thought it had an interesting idea, the only thing that annoyed me was the end that I felt like a cop. 'Here it is difficult to find this movie and I was lucky to have seen it on BRAVO. I was also expecting to see more of Drew Barrymore here too!
