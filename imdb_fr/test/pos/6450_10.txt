I'm so happy that Zac was in 'The life of Zack and Cody's sequel' because it's my favorite show and he's my favorite actor. This is a really funny episode and a fun show !! I like everything about the show and the characters. All the artists are great. Keep playing Zac, and I'm so happy that almost all my favorite actors (including High School Musical characters) are on this show. Zac Efron is so "hot" and I have an autographed picture of him! This is not a photo copy, she came from America to Australia and did not arrive in time for Christmas. Plus, I have a music cup for high school with my name printed on it. (Scarlett 8)
