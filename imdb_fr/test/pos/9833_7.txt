I admit that I have been a fan of Harrison Ford for many, many years now, so it did not surprise me that I appreciate his performance here. But I also liked how the plot developed and I thought the cast was well done. I do not know if I buy Kristin Scott Thomas as a congressman, but she's a beautiful actress and a beautiful woman. I noticed her in the first impossible mission. Although her role was small, she was stuck on the screen. <br /> <br /> Here, she and Ford are playing with people whose wives have been killed in a plane crash. They sit together and that's where the plot takes flight. Apparently, Ford, a police officer in Wash D.C., discovers that his wife had an affair. He also discovers that the affair was with the husband of a member of New England. <br /> <br /> The story takes many secondary intrigues, Ford and Thomas finding themselves seduced by the revelations of their marriage, the discovery of lies, grief and anger over the loss of a loved one. <br /> <br /> I think the film is worth it, whether rented or captured by cable.
