Beware My Lovely comes from a play written by Mel Dinelli who apparently loved writing about scared women. His first and best effort was the screenplay for The Spiral Staircase. He also made a suspense thriller "Cause for Alarm" by Loretta Young a few years earlier. The play that Dinelli wrote was originally titled The Man and gave 92 performances on Broadway during the 1950 season. It was Dinelli's only effort on Broadway and starred Dorothy Gish and Richard Boone. <br /> <br /> The roles played by Gish and Boone are assumed by Ida Lupino and Robert Ryan. For some reason, RKO thought to eliminate the age difference. Dinelli himself rewrote his piece for the screen, so I wonder what he thought about it. Admittedly, the problem of fragility has been completely eliminated from history. <br /> <br /> This is not the only thing that has been eliminated. People are all wearing vintage clothes from the First World War and yet there is no mention of when this story unfolds. a vintage of the same era. <br /> <br /> The film is almost entirely shot in Ida Lupino's house, where she hired an itinerant stranger in Robert Ryan as a handyman. The film is a good lesson not to hire strangers without reference. It turns out that Ryan is a schizophrenic who imprisons Lupino at home about a day. <br /> <br /> Both do good work even with the changes made. Movies like Beware My Lovely are what a small studio like RKO did best. Had this been done at MGM or Paramount, the bright traps would have submerged a solid story.
