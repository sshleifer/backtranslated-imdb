FBI agents Mulder and Scully are tasked with investigating the mystery of what happened to an Arctic drilling team in this first episode of X-Files, which David Duchovny himself sees as the one of their first episodes "rockin". It pays tribute to the much-acclaimed 1977 John Carpenter theatrical feature "The Thing", and we can see the similarities. Visually, colors and lighting combine to give the story an infernal quality. The design of the production and the artistic direction are particularly impressive. plans from outside the Arctic camp are so reminiscent of the previous movie that they automatically create feelings of déjà vu for some viewers. Naturally, our heroes are threatened by time, so the sound design, involving the wind, evokes memories of "The Thing". <br /> <br /> The culprit is an old worm that had been exposed to the team; once inside a host, it stimulates aggressive behavior. This allows the paranoia aspect to take root fully, and the way the script is designed does not know for sure who is infected and who is not. This gives rise to the inevitable scene of tests. This episode shows how tensions can cause breaks in groups. This even allows Mulder and Scully to have moments when they are not sure they can trust each other. <br /> <br /> The invited guests are a good small group of actors: Xander Berkeley, Felicity Huffman and Steve Hytner the scientists obliged to accompany Mulder and Scully in the mission and Jeff Kober as a pilot who takes them at the camp. You can also see Jason Voorhees' representative, Ken Kirzinger, as one of the unfortunate team members. <br /> <br /> Incidentally, there is a direct link between "Ice" and "The Thing": the artistic director Graeme Murray, who worked on both projects. <br /> <br /> 8/10
