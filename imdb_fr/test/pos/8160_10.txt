In 1982, a small film called MAKING LOVE shocked the audience with its frank and open description of a romantic love story about two men. <br /> <br /> I had been waiting for years for a good old fashionable romance between two men; In recent days, this is all this and more. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's soapy, melodramatic, clich√© and quite cheesy. That's what makes him so wonderful. Nothing is comparable to a good romantic film, and this film is romantic in the best sense of the word. <br /> <br /> Regarding the question of religion, sorry, but these things happen and happen to gay people even now. The Mormon Church is not the only one to reject its gay members. Homosexuals of all religions have faced severe judgment and rejection. <br /> <br /> I loved this movie. It perfectly combines a fantastic romance based on the daily life of the characters. If I could give him more than ten stars, I would do it. Good love stories never go out of style; big love stories like LAST DAYS are unforgettable. <br /> <br /> It's time!
