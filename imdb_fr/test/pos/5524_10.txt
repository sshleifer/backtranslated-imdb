The job title was "Do not spank baby". <br /> <br /> Wayne Crawford became a successful producer, with films like Valley Girl, Night of the Comet and other films, though he was not too good at this gem. And Abe Zwick, a little known man, should have shot a lot of this movie but did not do it. Filmed at Moberly Studios in Hollywood, Florida, Tarzan's first films were shot on the same floor. This film is definitely for those who appreciate the abstract. The film was originally shot with nudity and many more graphic slasher scenes. For reasons that only director Tom Casey knew, the bloody slasher scenes had been labeled with LSD and nudity had been removed. Although this version is worthy of a look for those who are so inclined, in my opinion, the original version would have packed the punch needed to make a full version of Cult Classic Slasher 70.
