What often threatens to become a soppy and sweet drama about a misunderstood youth of the middle class results in a surprisingly dark and moderate film by John Frankenheimer (his first film, though he started on television, making among other things a previous version of this film). script). <br /> <br /> We are still in these semi-mythical ones? The 50s, when teenagers were driving jalopies and jeans were still the overalls. James MacArthur (adoptive son of playwright Charles and actress Helen Hayes, and later entering pop culture as Danno of Hawaii 5-0) is involved in a minor incident in a movie theater that earned him to give a punch to the manager (Whit Bissell). and be reserved at the police station. His father (James Daly), a successful film producer, receives the call, does not listen to his son's version and pulls the strings to convince him. <br /> <br /> But MacArthur continues to carry a flea on his shoulder, which even his mother (Kim Hunter) can not spill. Things get complicated at the Coldwater Canyon farm until MacArthur, trying to defend himself, organizes a resumption of the original incident .... <br /> <br /> The film does not really avoid the attitudes ?? and clich√©s ?? of his time, but presents them with a considerable shade: each personage is heard honorably; each point of view has its merits (and the reactions to the film will depend on what the audience will bring). There are flaws (the word "shabby", a standard rebellious euphemism of the time, is used about 30 times too often), but they are outweighed by the strengths. The film has a solid cast (the most notable of them being the excellent actor James Gregory, as a police detective) and a decidedly non-exploitative way of telling his story. From the perspective of the new millennium, MacArthur's warm water may seem a little tepid, but The Young Stranger remains honest and honorable. <br /> <br />
