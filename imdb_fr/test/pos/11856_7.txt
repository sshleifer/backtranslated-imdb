Sophisticated sexual comedies are always difficult to obtain. Watch the films of Blake Edwards, who is probably the master of the genre, and you will find as many failures as tubes. Indeed, if a film of this nature fails one day, he will never be able to fall back on the tried-and-tested humor of a teen sex comedy [i.e. "American Pie"], or warm the audience with the sentimentality of a romantic comedy [i.e. Julia Roberts's entire career]. He can only continue to push to the end and hope that the public can understand the almost necessary irony of his resolution. <br /> <br /> Written by husband and wife couple Wally Wolodarsky and Maya Forbes, "Seeing Other People" opens with couple of fianc√©s Ed & Alice [Jay Mohr and Julianne Nicholson] just seconds from the back of the car in front of them. When the frame freezes, we unexpectedly hear the thoughts and fears of both characters. From now on, we welcome the fact that the story about to unfold will benefit from the point of view of both sexes. <br /> <br /> Just two months away from their wishes, Ed and Alice already look like an old married couple and behave well. . In an early bathroom scene, their actions show how comfortable they are with each other and how long they have been together. Thus, when the line to advance the conspiracy is pronounced-at least likely of the two-it is as if the relation itself called for a change, even if it implied its own destruction. <br /> <br /> Once all the rules of the game are set [Ed can not sleep with her mother nor Salma Hayek], the two women go in different directions in the hope of finding a sex devoid of meaning to strengthen their relationship. At first, everything seems to be going according to plan, because their daily appointments only add to their passion. Predictably, however, as the deepest emotions of regret and jealousy begin to emerge, they soon find themselves separating and separating. All these actions leading to a resolution that you will like or do not like - depend on your degree of cynicism. <br /> <br /> For a comedy like this, you need a solid cast with support characters as strong as the tracks. And the director Wolodarsky does not disappoint. He selected two of my favorite actresses - Julianne Nicholson & Lauren Graham - and allowed them to make the most of their strengths. For Nicholson, who has always reminded me of a young Shirley MacLaine, she brings an air of naivety and vulnerability to Alice even when her actions seem less than correct. As for Graham, an actress who has proven herself capable of surpassing a whole set of Howard Hawks, she steals every scene in which she finds herself with an angry "no BS" character. <br /> <br /> As for the guys, Jay Mohr can be used here like Josh Charles. Byron Cranston is to be congratulated on "Malcolm in the Middle" for taking a British accent and letting it trail. But the real treat here is Andy Richter and his conspiracy involving single mother, Helen Slater. While her scenes seem almost to belong to another movie, they are by far the funniest and her stealthy stealth steals the show. <br /> <br /> For an independent production, "Seeing Other People" has a more personal and introspective personality. feeling - something that would be notable absent from a great Hollywood movie of this kind. Not to mention the fact that this film also has some really fun moments - unlike, for example, most Hollywood comedies. <br /> <br /> Note [on a 5 star system]: 3 1/2 stars
