I like this film. There is something for everyone. It's funny, sad, passionate and dramatic. The mixture of two completely different cultures creates a whole new world to which the spectator can not help but want to be part of. I must admit that I'm a bit biased, because Colin Firth is my favorite actor and nothing that he does is wrong in my eyes (!), But in this film, his formidable acting talent is apparent and he is further strengthened by the beautiful acting of his co-star Nia Long. Ironically, the problems that their love story causes them make it more believable and the simple features like the contrast between the colors of Matthew's clothes and those of Nimi make this film all the more enchanting. I challenge anyone who can not be moved by this story. I find it enchanting and I have watched it at least ten times since I bought the movie a week ago!
