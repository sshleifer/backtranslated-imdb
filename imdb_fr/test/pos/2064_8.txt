A schoolteacher from a small town (Geena Davis) slowly begins to realize that she has suffered amnesia and is really a secret government assassin! Soon, there are men after her and a small private investigator (Samuel L. Jackson). <br /> <br /> It was full of action, with great special effects and some really funny one-liners). Although the action can sometimes become a little silly, who cares? After all, are not movies supposed to be a good time? <br /> <br /> Craig Bierko is fun as a ruthless villain. The film itself was a good time. Just do not think too much about it, because if you take it too seriously, the movie will not be really fun, but stupid instead. <br /> <br /> This movie does not deserve to be called stupid or any other bad name.
