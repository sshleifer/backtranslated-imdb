The secret agents of the comics have made their comeback in recent years, with "Austin Powers" by Mike Myers and "Johnny English" by Rowan Atkinson, and more recently Steve Carell in the big screen version of the hit show " Get Smart! " <br /> <br /> In 1974, David Jason wore a shoulder bag and a briefcase filled with documents marked "Class√©". <br /> <br /> "The secret life of Edgar Briggs' was his first role in a sitcom, having been an actor in such series as" Six Dates With Barker ", the series" Doctor "and" Hark At Barker ". <br /> <br /> Humphrey Barclay had found him in a pier theater in Bournemouth and had been impressed enough to include him alongside Michael Palin, Terry Jones and Eric Idle in the show. children's comedy titled "Do not set your stage!" <br /> <br /> "TTSLOEB" interprets Jason as "Edgar Briggs", a well-intentioned but incompetent agent of the secret intelligence service, while John Steed wearing a bowler hat, Briggs had a trilby, while Napoleon Solo was carrying a radio pen, Briggs had a pipe, objects fell to pieces in his hands, he read confidential documents in bed while his wife (Barbara Angell) read Woman's Own (once, it would be the opposite). saw two Russian helicopters in a heliport, he accidentally activated the Tannoy system at the airport and broadcast his plans to capture them! When he hid in a train to photograph a meeting between a S.I.S. the man and his contact with the enemy, he went with him on board and took him directly to Brighton! When he tried to organize the defection of a Russian female scientist, he took a "shortcut" to escape his pursuers, before finding himself desperately lost in a parking lot. Yet, like "Inspector Clouseau", he always seemed to win at the end, to the dismay of his colleagues. <br /> <br /> As mentioned before, he was married. His wife, Jennifer, understood the kind of work he was doing. Although they once quarreled, she shouted at her from the window of their building: "Secret Service This, Secret Service That, You Never Stop Thinking of the Secret Service!" He shouted, "Think of the neighbors, they are not supposed to know that I am in the secret service!" <br /> <br /> Briggs was part of a team of agents whose number included "Coronation Street". the wicked Mark Eden (he was the psychotic Alan Bradley) in the role of "Spencer", Michael Stainton in the "Buxton" and Elisabeth Counsell of "Doctor At Sea" in the role of the charming "Cathy Strong". They responded to 'The Commander', played by the late Christmas Coleman. The captain was kidnapped during an episode, leaving Briggs temporarily in charge of the S.I.S. - which naturally horrifies everyone. <br /> <br /> This hilarious show was directed by Richard Laing and Bernard McKenna, who had written for the series "Doctor". Rather than usurping Bond, it was more like sending out serious spy shows such as 'Callan' (although there is a Bond theme). Stealthy meetings in underground car parks, unraveling codes, stolen missile plans, that sort of thing. Jason brought a lot of energy to the role, making many of his own stunts, such as Briggs falling off a ladder while decorating his apartment and running down a hill in a wastebasket, reminiscent of the Movies " Pink Panther". <br /> <br /> "Briggs" had all the ingredients to please. Unfortunately, it was not networked. In the London area, it was installed on Sunday at 7:25. where he was beaten in the ratings by the soapy drama of B.B.C. 'The Brothers'. It was then moved to Fridays at 7 o'clock. because I.T.V. wanted to present his latest US import - the T.V. version of 'Planet Of The Apes'. Briggs never found an audience. Jason's next major show is the same: 1976, "Lucky Feller". It was only in 1977 and 'A Sharp Ofake Of Breath' that he found his first successful solo vehicle. <br /> <br /> You can see the title sequence (with two short clips in German!) from this series on Youtube. Unfortunately, that's all you can see. Jason will not allow the repetition of his previous shows, nor his release the D.V.D. It's a shame. For the moment, however, Edgar Briggs' life will have to remain top secret. <br /> <br /> CODA: I have recently seen several episodes and I am happy to say that it is incredibly resilient.
