.... is it possible that ITV does not want to release this absolute classic because it would show their current Mike Bassett series? When I discussed Mike Bassett with co-workers, I mentioned the Bostock's Cup as a much superior offer and was surprised to find that I seemed to be the only person in my office who saw it. It can not be just for a movie that has to be the funniest thing I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Let's face it, ITV does not have the biggest recent record for comedy production so do you think they were jumping on the opportunity to repeat at least something that is really funny. Maybe if this could be combined with a lucrative phone competition where we think the coach driver will then go, then they might be interested. <br /> <br /> Go ITV, there are still some who would like to watch an original drama. Do the decent thing. Repeat and then take it out to DVD.
