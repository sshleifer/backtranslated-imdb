This DVD game is the complete show "15 episodes" of "Surface", a TV show made by Universal in 2006. The total duration is 10 hours and 34 minutes, plus some bonuses (deleted scenes, interviews with actors, special effects, featurette). ). It was a relatively high budget show and a large part of the budget is presented on screen in the form of a quality production design and special effects. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, more than 10 hours is very time consuming and, as usually happens with these kinds of things, the overall quality starts to drop over the last few episodes. I found the first 7 episodes (discs 1 and 2) extremely attractive and the rest disappointing. "Surface" was produced, written and directed by Josh and Jonas Pate; and it seems that they were surprised by the success of the series and unable to gather enough quality material later as they rushed to fill the order for new episodes. It even seems that additional authors have been added to subsequent episodes, because the characters (who were already the weakest part of the series) lack coherence with the way they were played in the first episodes. The series has been canceled and although the last episode provides a conclusion, there are still many things outstanding. <br /> <br /> This is essentially a science fiction story about genetically created dragons; sort of televised mix of "Jurassic Park" and "ET". The story begins as a puzzle when a submarine of the unmanned navy is found drifting at sea, boaters on a Texas lake are sucked into a whirlwind, a lighthouse in Africa is destroyed by a huge monster, etc., and as long as things stay In this wave, there is a lot of tension and suspense. A human element is introduced in the form of three American families, one on each coast and one in the Gulf of Mexico. Laura Daughterty (Lake Bell) is a marine biologist from California who discovers a strange creature emerging from a thermal vent below the ocean floor. Rich Connelly (Jay R. Ferguson) dives with his younger brother in the gulf when a similar creature drags his brother behind (so he's never seen again). <br /> <br /> Miles Bennett (Carter Jenkins) is a teenager from Wilmington who finds strange eggs in the ocean. He takes one home where he hatches into an "ET" type dragon. He will spend the rest of the series trying to hide his strange pet from his family and local authorities. These dragons may look like lizards, but they look more like indestructible electric eels, emitting electromagnetic impulses, causing lightning bolts, emptying the sea of ​​fish, and breeding like a group of wild rabbits when they find a thermal vent under them. marine of boiling water. As long as it is uncertain whether they are intelligent, extraterrestrial or harmless, the principle is interesting. Once you start to suspect their origin, everything becomes very tired and predictable. <br /> <br /> Jay R. Ferguson (a stunning actor in David Hasselhoff's tradition) plays mostly Richard Dreyfuss's character of "Third Guy Encounters", so you know that with a better actor and a better director it could have been an interesting character. You will increasingly hate this character in every episode. Unfortunately, what begins as three parallel stories is quickly condensed into two as Ferguson and Bell (a low-budget version of Sandra Bullock) are soon paired up and involved in a series of moronic adventures that are almost as unlikely as the stuff "Jason Bourne". gets in. You expect holes in the plot and the need to suspend disbelief in this type of show (it may even be part of the fun), but their adventures are not just improbable, they are completely boring. There are three consecutive episodes featuring Ferguson and Bell in a submarine that will make you dream of the excitement of a one-day actuarial conference. <br /> <br /> Jenkins (Miles) is the most powerful member of the cast and the segments with his dragon pet (Nimrod) are quite often interspersed with the boring stuff of Ferguson-Bell to keep you under control. eyes. And these segments benefit from the presence of the magnificent Leighton Meester (from the famous "Gossip Girl") as her sister Savannah. Apparently, the producers have understood the importance of this idea for the target audience of their "teenagers" and what they have done positive with the last episodes of the series was to present Linsey Godrey (Caitlin) as an interest "priority" for Miles. So, as Savannah's screen time decreases, Catlin is gradually integrated. <br /> <br /> In retrospect, they need a third scenario to keep the audience sufficiently engaged and it would have been better to limit the adult melodrama to the benefit of a second group of young actors. <br /> <br /> Again, what do I know? I am only a child.
