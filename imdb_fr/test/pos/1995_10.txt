Everyone seems to compare that to The Matrix and 13th Floor, and when I saw it for the first time, I would have accepted - I was waiting for The Matrix and I was a little disappointed. But after repeated viewing, my respect for this film has grown enormously. <br /> <br /> It should be kept in mind that The Matrix is ​​an excellent action movie that contains philosophical mumbo jumbo. The 13th floor is a passable action movie with some philosophical gibberish a little more interesting. Existenz is not an action movie at all, and is not (as many believe) about "reality" or a concept as "deep". It is the human tendency to intentionally replace reality with an artificial world (both by its origin and by its behavior), imaginary. <br /> <br /> The most frightening moment of the film is when Allegra Geller repeats the scripted "line." That's when you realize that the players have voluntarily given up their free will to This is made even more scary in the end when D'Arcy Nader (or rather his player) comments on the possibility of spending his life in the game. I totally understand the "realistic" philosophy, which proposes worlds in which people simply locate the correct predefined path to the ultimate goal is ultimately a recipe for a soulless existence Live "in the game" is not living at all, it is a tempting way to go his time on earth As Allegra comments on the real world, "nothing happens here." You could also immerse yourself in someone else's imagination and pretend to do something interesting. I have to ask if Cronenberg considers this as a self-indictment, given that he himself offers worlds to experiment with 90-minute clips.) <br /> <br /> Leaving the cinema after watching this movie for the first time, I thought it was one of those movies you could only watch to see how it ended. But after seeing it many more times (thank you SciFi Channel), I realized how far it went. Seriously, if you have seen it only once, it deserves another viewing.
