Adam (Eric Jungmann) is surprised by his former classmate Harley (Justin Urich) in the back seat of his car as he goes on the road to the wedding of his beloved Betty-Ann. Adam broke with the inconvenience and the moronic Harley because of Betty-Ann. During their road trip, Harley makes fun of some rednecks in a bar and their car is then chased by a giant monster truck on the road. After a few incidents, they hitchhike Sarah (Aimee Brooks) and earlier the trio is terrorized by a scary monster driving the monster truck. <br /> <br /> In spite of one of the most boring characters I have "Monster Man" is an amazing good horror comedy. The story is a collection of clich√©s, starting as "Joy Ride" or "Duel"; then he turns to one of the countless scams of "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"; there is a surprising twist, ending with a hook for a suite. There are hilarious scenes, Aimee Brooks is extremely sexy and this movie really entertains. My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Monster Man"
