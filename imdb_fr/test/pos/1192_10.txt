I will not say anything about music, because this subject can be so deep that it can become a huge separate critic, so let's focus on a brilliant film ... Without doubt, one of Forman's best works. <Br /> <br /> The simple story of love, friendship, freedom and ideals ... oh yes, ideals for which even pacifists are ready to go to war ... <br /> <br /> There is not one. Fake Word, Single Fake Character, Simple Fake Feeling in the story, because love, freedom and friendship are not a complicated thing for the characters in the movie. These things are not something that "everyone can see from a different angle" These are not things that require a lot of thinking to understand ... their love is simple, their friendship is simple, their ideals are so simple as the word "simple" itself and that's why these characters are so profound. <br /> <br /> Berger, the head of a hippie performed by Treat Williams, is a living guy to live and it's the greatest happiness for him ... he has his ass - (as he sings in one of the scenes of the movie) and it's enough to make him happy with his property ... <br /> <br /> Berger never accepts that something can be done ... and his C ' is true ... If he wants to go to the banquet of a rich guy with his old dirty clothes and his huge long hair, he will ... if he wants to go to another state just to see his friend, he do it that ... he never thinks twice ... he just does it. <br /> <br /> How? why is he so powerful? the answer is simple: because it is FREE. <br /> <br /> Just look at how the wind is waving the hair in this movie and you will understand everything, maybe even you will free yourself too.
