There's something to pay when you meet Nami Matsushima (Meiko Kaji), a scorpion woman and a dangerous group of thugs (including their sadistic pimp and his disgusting lady), operating a prostitution network with an iron fist. , do exactly that. Hell has no rage similar to Scorpio, and a determined detective, Gondo (Mikio Narita), seeking revenge for decapitating his arm after handcuffing, will do all that is necessary (.. and this includes intimidating anyone who might know where he is) to catch Nami. Nami finds an ally in prostitute Yuki (Yayoi Watanabe), who provides temporary shelter. Yuki has a retarded brother who suffered a brain injury at work and has to take care of him (in a troubling revelation about incest, she also provides her sexual needs!) .. she actually keeps him in prison in a room working in the streets! Meanwhile, Nami is targeted by a vile neighbor as soon as she finds her own place (she works as a sewer), and he threatens to turn her into authorities (.. Nami was an escaped convict who had escaped from the subway the cops) if she does not provide him with sexual favors. His wife pours a teapot of boiling water all over her face and body, resulting in death, and the prostitution clan comes looking for Nami to pay the debt of losing a very important member of their organization. That's when Katsu (Reisen Lee), the lover and confidant of the pimp, realizes that the person responsible for the loss of their loyal member is his former inmate, Scorpio. By submitting it with a liquid drug injected, placing it in a bird cage (!), Katsu adorns himself with his imprisonment. What finally feeds Nami's rage is the death of a prostitute outside her cell, victim of a late forced abortion, who is bleeding to death. Finding a scalpel in her hand (from the operating room), Nami will free herself from the cage and attack each member of the clan responsible for the prostitute's death. The series of scalpel killings gives Gondo the opportunity to catch Nami. He will trap her in the underground sewers beneath the city, but can he catch or kill her? Especially if Yuki comes to his aid? <br /> <br /> Trust me when I say that director Shunya Ito or his film crew was not forced because FEMALE PRISONER SCORPION: BEAST STABLE is another pervert, disturbed and disturbed. ultra-violent entry in the series very entertaining. Endowed with good production values ​​and a visual stylistic talent to capture all the madness in an imaginative way, Ito takes you right (or he did me) into the twisted drama that still exists when Nami Matsushima is on screen. When you have a sequence of extended opening credits during which your anti-heroine runs through the crowded streets of the city with the severed arm of a man handcuffed to her, the viewer must know what it's all about! The incestuous sub-intrigue is just weird (.. and she was shot down with the frazzled brother running out of her cold, numb sister with dead eyes looking in front of her!), And the whole abortion sequence is pretty hard to get to side. But the angle of the abortion, as disturbing as it is, motivates the revenge of Nami. Despite Nami's imperfect manners and criminal nature, you'd rather see her take away those idiots than the other way around. Interesting angle with Detective Gondo too. Gondo is ready to break the rules and he becomes a force of nature against anyone who opposes his way of capturing his mortal enemy. His destiny at the end, his visit to another enemy of Nami, in an isolated cell, while monitoring it, sums up perfectly what makes these films so ridiculous and yet so entertaining. The scalpel murder is a montage of scumbags collapsed, in various places, the blades protruding from the flesh, Nami leaving crime scenes highly motivated to erase the entire clan in memory of a victim who died of regrettable circumstances. While the film is essentially a comic adventure, there is a sadness that permeates, and few characters leave without flaws. I imagine that many people will forget SCORPION's unrealistic realism mockery: BEAST STABLE (.. specifically how Nami manages to escape capture on many occasions, realizing her revenge goals, repaying all those who made her wrong). but I watched it as a violent action shot, much like the movies of the 80's, and I appreciated what it was. As always, this film features beautiful Asian actresses and colorful monsters. Meiko Kaji, almost always reserved / silent, but looking coldly at her enemies with violent intent, is in great shape (in more ways than one) and Reisen Lee, her disgusting opponent with cross-eyed eyes, runs away with the image as a perfectly accomplished enemy despicably abusive and worthy of psychological torture (... when both are in prison, Nami's ways of torturing her are sweet). My favorite scene has nothing to do with intrigue, but is so wonderfully wrong. It shows a dog discovering the torn arm of Gondo, walking down a street, finally finding a place to rest!
