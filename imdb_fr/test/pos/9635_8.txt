OK ... this movie (like Segal's latest movies) goes one step beyond "knocking him out, kicking him in the groin, shooting him in the face, taking revenge on the bad guys for hurting my cousin's cousin. niece "What Seagal did for a while. Geepers, Steven started thinking and using his dollars to make movies with real ideas. SURE .... there is a lot of action in this film, but also a little thought and heart. It's not an Oscar film, but it's worth it, unless the viewer is so fond of cerebral violence that it's painful to think longer than a second. It's worth a rental..or two !!
