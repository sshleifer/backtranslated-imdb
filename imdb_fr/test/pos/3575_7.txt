The performances of Jim Varney as Harem Girl and A.U. are incredibly funny - at a level beyond Chaplin and Keaton. Linda Kash is terrific in her unique role in the hometown as a waffle waitress in search of adventure. Unfortunately, the remaining 90% of the movie was incredibly bad because of the atrocious plot. The directors of Ernest Goes to Africa have not taken up the creative challenges inherent in producing low-budget films. Only to see on the cable.
