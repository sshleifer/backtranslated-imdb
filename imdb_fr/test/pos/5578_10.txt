I heard about this series in 2001 that a friend of mine was recording every week on television. I never bothered to look good even though I knew the show through the magazine I watched from time to time in the bookstores. I recently bought the series 1 on DVD and became addicted to this fascinating and original series. At first, the characters seem improbable, but it's amazing how fast they grow and develop to form a united force. As they begin to take care of each other, it becomes easy to worry about what's happening to them (keeping in mind that this is just a TV show and they're fictional) . <br /> <br /> However, this is not the PC world of Star Trek and, while each character shows a good trait, each has its own flaws and demons he must handle. Individual stories mixed with a multiple arcade make it one of the most complex and rewarding TV experiences I've ever had the pleasure of watching. I absolutely enjoy watching each of the characters interact. <br /> <br /> This strange new world in which we are presented is brilliantly described in the eyes of astronaut John Crichton and as he learns and adapts to be for each other. On the side of the galaxy, strange extraterrestrial creatures, different cultures, being tracked by a character who wants his death and being treated as inferior by his comrades, we can easily understand what he must feel. As he gets used to his surroundings, the spectator and his compassionate, willing and courageous character are a pleasure to watch. <br /> <br /> I only watched seven episodes of Farscape season 1 and can not wait to continue. through the seasons two to four and the mini-series. Maybe one day we could all enjoy a season five. Highly recommended to watch and well worth taking time to watch. Buy and enjoy! 10/10.
