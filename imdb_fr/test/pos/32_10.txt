LACKAWANNA BLUES is a beautiful play by Ruben Santiago-Hudson and an even more refined film as the author adapted his own life story for the screen. This brilliant film ignites the screen with rich colors, refined music, brilliant editing, superb direction by George C. Wolfe and a cast so amazing that they impose a mandatory reminder! Yes, it's as good as that. <br /> <br /> The story is based on the life of the author as a 'Junior' child (Marcus Carl Franklin) raised in the inimitable home of Rachel "Nanny" Crosby (S Epatha Merkerson) , a lady who has dedicated her life to helping the poor by transporting them from the South, psychiatric hospitals and streets to Lackawanna, New York. The boy remembers all the lessons he had learned from the lives of the inhabitants of the house - strange characters with a painful past - and the disintegration of his biological mixed family, saved by Nanny. The innumerable characters in the house are too numerous to describe, but they are portrayed by some of the best actors in the field: Terrence Howard, Rosie Perez, Mos Def, the beautiful Carmen Ejogo, Louis Gossett Jr, Jeffrey Wright, Ernie Hudson, Charlayne Woodward, Jimmy Smits, Patricia Wettig, Macy Gray, Liev Schreiber, Kathleen Chalfant, Lou Myers, Harper Hill - the list goes on and on. <br /> <br /> During the film, we are introduced to the cruelties of racism, the history of desegregation, the dynamics of drug addiction and violence, the contagious joy of the contribution of African music. American to our musical culture and the courage of a worthy woman who fought against all the difficulties that the world can overcome to maintain the dignity of those with whom she came into contact. S. Epatha Merkerson is totally overwhelmed by this role, a role she shines as a beacon of reason in a chaotic world. It offers one of the most amazing performances of recent years. If this film had been screened in theaters rather than as an HBO film, it would have no doubt added the Oscar to be placed next to its Golden Globe award. <br /> <br /> The whole casting is exceptional and Wolfe manages acting and history like a master: like riffs in a jazz piece, he spends little moments of conversation with each character and Junior, as well as flashes of story scenes with the matrix of dance festivals in local clubs brimming with incredible blues, jazz, dance and joy. The production team has mounted this small miracle of an image with extreme caution and never loses a moment of attention on the part of history. Highly recommended, almost mandatory! Grady Harp
