I have always been fascinated by silent films. See actors and actresses from 100 years ago present something. Injured by the high-tech special effects of today, I always try to imagine what it was to watch a particular movie at the time of its original release. It is useful to appreciate the cruelty of primitive cinema. <br /> <br /> "The life and passion of Jesus Christ" is a very charming production of Pathe, originally filmed in 1902, then enlarged and finally published in 1905. a series of famous religious paintings that come alive, separated by title cards, and you'll have a pretty good idea of ​​what this movie looks like. For example, the scene in which Mary and Joseph rest as they escape into Egypt is almost identical to the painting of Luc Olivier Merson dating from 1879, "Stay on the Flight into Egypt", even going to Mary sitting on the famous Sphinx. While some might find these "living paintings" an unimaginative escape, I found them very charming and very nostalgic. <br /> <br /> The sets and costumes seem to come straight out of a theatrical production of the life of Christ. Maybe and develop a passion game of the day. The makeup on the casting is very theatrical, so much so that a close-up of Jesus is almost comical. Here again, where others might be embarrassed by their fear, I was charmed. <br /> <br /> The film was shot over a period of 3 years, the continuity is not so bad. The biggest flaws are the casting changes made during this period. The characters of the apostle John and Jesus, aged 12, change in the middle of the stage, much to the surprise of the public! <br /> <br /> The best unintentional humor of the film is in the scene of the birth of Jesus. The baby literally appears, as if by magic, in the manger between Mary and Joseph. Maybe it was just my state of mind when I watched it, but I laughed! If only childbirth was so easy !!!! To top it off, the actress who plays Mary seems to be bored throughout the stage (in fact, throughout the movie), as if that kind of thing happens every day! The times have changed! <br /> <br /> As simplistic as this film is, compared to today, it's really a wonderful window on the past. I recommand it! <br /> <br />
