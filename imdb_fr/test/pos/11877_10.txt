I am a big fan of Larkin's works, I think he was one of the greatest poets of the twentieth century. The film itself gives great justice to the bard of Hull. Wonderfully portrayed by all actors in their roles. Bonneville renders a service to Larkin sexually repressed, he avoids any impression and avoids becoming a caricature. The use of his poetry was the highlight of the piece itself. Rather than highlighting the massive intensity felt by Larkin, the use of his words helps to better understand the plot and adds a much darker but more fascinating atmosphere. The most pleasant.
