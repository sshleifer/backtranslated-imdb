Piper, Prue and Phoebe take Dr. Griffiths to the mansion to try to save him from The Source's personal killer, Shax. While Phoebe searches the Shadow Book for a spell to defeat Shax, Prue and Piper are attacked by Shax and chase him down the street. Unbeknownst to Prue and Piper, they were filmed by a journalist and her cameraman using their powers and broadcast live on national television. With Phoebe in the Underworld, Prue, Piper and Leo must find a way to repair the damage done. Leo goes to Phoebe's home and tells him that the Charmed Ones have been exposed as wizards. On the surface, Piper is shot by a wizard-dummy and Prue has to take him to the hospital. The problem here is that crowds are blocking the driveway. So Prue has to use his magic on the crowd and they go to the hospital. Piper is declared dead and a SWAT team settles. Leo learns of Piper's death and goes to Phoebe's home. Cole is asked to ask the source to reset the time, and the source agrees; only if Phoebe turns to the dark side. Phoebe agrees, but the deal will break them. On the surface, Prue and Piper are fighting Shax. Prue screams for Phoebe, who unknowingly is in the underworld. Shax throws Piper and Prue through a wall and Dr. Griffiths through a window. Prue is not declared dead until the episode of the first season of season 4, "Charmed Again, Part One". <br /> <br /> "All Hell Breaks Loose" is a gripping episode that made me sit at the edge of my seat. Sad that Prue is dead, but happy that there are still five seasons of Charmed. My vote; 10 out of 10. EXCELLENT
