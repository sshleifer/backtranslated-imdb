Okay, I concede that part of the science in "Doppelganger" (or "Journey to the Sun") is rather misleading. The idea of ​​an entire existing planet undetected (because we can not see the other side of our sun) does not hold at all - any astronomy student 101 knows that another planet the size of the Earth would cause gravitational disturbances in the movements of other planets. This is how astronomers have deduced the existence of Pluto, after all, and that is how they regularly found comets, asteroids, and moons. <br /> <br /> And the idea that a mirror Earth was evolving almost perfectly parallel to our Earth, to the English scientists and their human counterparts for every human being born on our Earth ... coming out things of fiction "hard science" on the territory of "Twilight Zone". This is not necessarily a bad thing, but it does require a major suspension of critical thinking to accept and appreciate. <br /> <br /> But man, this movie hit me like a teenager. I was still used to the more cheerful and optimistic sci-fi movies when the hero finally won - even "2001" could be interpreted as an "optimistic" ending. <br /> <br /> But in this case: Thinnes attempted to dock with her mother ship in orbit so she could return to her own land, and then be fired from her berth (Something about the polarities that are not reversed because her 'doppelganger' was not doing the same thing, apparently Thinnes' 'doppelganger' 'decided to be happy in her new home.) Thinnes' boat started the down to the CounterEarth launch site, and I was sure he would get there. get the damaged craft to land safely and try again, armed with new information to succeed, as well as its sponsors. After all, he was the hero, and the hero always wins. <br /> <br /> Instead, Thinnes could not keep control of the crippled craft, and the ship's crash at the launch site was so horrific and devastating that it killed everything the world (with the exception of the project manager) and destroyed everything. records of the project and the existence of Thinnes. Thinnes never went home and died needlessly, his secrets never revealed. <br /> <br /> With the exception of the Planet Of the Apes series, I had never seen an end so sad and so serious, and it is still in my memory, especially the terrible devastation of scene of the accident that occurred at the beginning of the move. (you knew the spaceship will never fly again!) and the one at the end. <br /> <br /> I would love to see this movie again and see how it has held up over the years.
