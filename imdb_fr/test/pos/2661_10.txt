The awakening of humanity is the theme of "2001: The Odyssey of Space", a process that takes place in a space-time continuum. We "see" our primordial past and "infer" a cosmic future. The forces of intuition thus become the doors of perception, in our current collective journey. <br /> <br /> In this transcendental perspective, a conventional and egocentric plot seems superfluous. Our frenetic conflicts and our important dialogue are absorbed by evolutionary change and are irrelevant in a world as vast as understanding. It is a hard lesson for a vain and aggressive species. So it's not surprising that some of us grumble about the slowness and minimal story of the film. For insightful viewers, the pay is a source of amazed and amazed inspiration. <br /> <br /> In this film, mainly visual, geometric symbols guide our intuition. Circles and bows represent nature. Right angles represent conscious intelligence. Some people think that the black and elegant monolith is a Von Neumann probe. May be. Without a doubt, the monolith is a visual metaphor for an extraterrestrial intelligence whose physical form is never shown. The mystery is deeper than the explanation. <br /> <br /> "2001 ..." is unique among the films in their content and scope. Cinematography is out of the ordinary, visual and special effects are breathtaking and sublime classical music. I rarely use the word "masterpiece" to describe a movie. But Stanley Kubrick's 2001 "Space Odyssey" is an art in the highest sense, like Leonardo da Vinci's "Mona Lisa" or Vincent van Gogh's "The Starry Night".
