Passion In The Desert is an example of spatial grandeur. It is a visual narrative, illuminated by the magnificent cinematography. Passion was filmed in the deserts of Jordan, Egypt, Morocco, Namibia and Tunisia. <br /> <br /> We are in Egypt, in 1798. Augustin, a soldier of Napoleon, escorts the writer and artist Jean-Michel Venture De Paradis on official mission to document, measure, draw and paint the cultural references of the Egypt: its dunes, its magnificent ruins and its mysterious people. <br /> <br /> But can you really "document" majestic sand landscapes, fractured buildings and wild Bedouins? Can you really capture the essence of Egypt, nature, man and time? <br /> <br /> Jean and Augustine are lost in the glittering and hypnotic gold desert, whose vastness overwhelms their senses. <br /> <br /> "One can not get lost in Egypt! There is the Nile and the sea!" says dehydrated Augustin. He soon discovers an old winding cave that leads to a palatial ruin. <br /> <br /> Delirious and almost delirious, he tries to rest; a disturbing sound awakes him; his eyes, his body and his emotions become hypnotic in time as he falls into a sensual and sensory experience .... <br /> <br /> A wild and elegant female leopard looks at him, and their story of love begins. ... <br /> <br /> A bold love story, a daring film.
