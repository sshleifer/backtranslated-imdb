I'm really fed up with sitcoms; you feel that you always know what's coming, so it stops being funny. On the other hand, Hi De Hi, you rarely know what's coming and it's a lot of fun. I just bought the second series of the series (series 3 to 4) and I'm surprised how much I appreciate all this - again. I have only praise for the writers or actors (or the many members of the team not seen) because the entertainment they offer is well worth the wait. The jewels from this series and the respect that actors have acquired through it speak for themselves. Croft and Perry created pure gold, some of which shine in Hi De Hi.
