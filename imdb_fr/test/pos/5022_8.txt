I have traveled a lot abroad, whether on business or as a tourist. For both types, I assure you that the best advice is also the oldest: always drink the wine of the country. In this film, Archangel Michael arrives on Earth for business, finishes it quickly and decides to stay for a little tour. Boy! Does he "drink the wine of the land." <br /> <br /> Could man be drunk forever with liquor, love and fights <br /> <br /> He would get up in the morning and go to bed at night. <br /> <br /> These are things you can not do in paradise so he appreciates them as he is here! Of course, it turns out that he had two or three other tasks to deal with, and though he is less direct about these positions than he was about the first job, he's just as successful. The final scene is a bit schmaltzy but it's also wonderful. Jean Stapleton will be dancing with John Travolta.
