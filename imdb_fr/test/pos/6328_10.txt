A fun party, full of silly jokes, sometimes even cruel. Not the best movies, but definitely worth watching. David Niven and Stewart Granger are their usual charm, Granger being a particularly charming and ingenious man. Ava Gardner, always so wonderful, with such an absolutely irresistible character. The scenario is typical, but full of fun surprises, especially regarding the unconventional relationships between Granger, Gardner and Niven.
