A good movie for horse lovers and most others. It's a horse racing movie, and a movie "The little man has a chance", and it's a "How far would you go?" movie. Walter Mattau proves once again his adaptability as an actor. He fits perfectly in the skin of Lloyd Bourdelle, a good for nothing at Louisiana Cajun. This film gives you a rare glimpse of the drag racing on a Lousiana Cajun horse. He has a young quarterback who is one of the best hopes of racing. "Had nothing but a gas station and a good horse." The Bourdelles seize this opportunity to win the success by taking the Shadow horse to Ruidoso, New Mexico, to prepare to run in the American Future. But how far will Lloyd go to win fame and fortune? Scenes of Lloyd spewing tobacco juice and waiting for the departure of his truck are also memorable in this film.
