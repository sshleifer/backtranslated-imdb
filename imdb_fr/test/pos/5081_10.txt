I think it was the most remarkable thriller I've seen in a long time. The search for the film was thorough, the writer Kelly Sane left nothing to chance. The cast was seasoned (fantastic performances all along). Omar Metwally was outstanding. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is poetic, enchanted by music and has a very satisfying effect. <br /> <br /> Rendering is an area where even the media are afraid to walk. This is really a wake-up call for those involved in espionage and the legal network that constitutes the "war on terror". <br /> <br /> A woman came out of the theater and asked me "does this really happen"? That in itself speaks of the masterful success of Gavin Hood.
