I have a 4 year old daughter and, before this movie, she only talked about Disney princesses. She has watched this film and can only talk about Princess Genevieve and all her sisters. I really recommend this movie for all girls. This film is one of the best in the Barbie collection. It shows all the good values ​​that a mother would like to encourage in her little girls. With the beautiful songs and dance moves, my daughter gets up and tries to imitate her. The extras are also good, we even work on the quality of your memory. I would certainly have said it's a must for kids and adults.
