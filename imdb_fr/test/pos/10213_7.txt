I saw this years ago, and it's entertaining, but not deep. The basic story is that of a young man who dreams of Midian, although he does not know exactly where he is or even if he really exists. <br /> <br /> Spoilers Follow: Be bitten by another. Then he has to help the other members of the Nightbreed because they are attacked by Canadians. (With the exception of accents, they all act like good boys, unfamiliar with the Canadian psyche, huh?) Someone observed for "monsters" or "Nightbreed", replaces "Jews" and for Canadians / humans , substitute "Nazis" and you are supposed to have a glimpse of the fight of monsters against humans. Well, maybe. <br /> <br /> One of my main objections was that, even though the underground city was interesting, it was rather run down and, frankly, dirty. It must be a convention for films with underground colonies. One would think that if the monsters were good guys, some would have at least a little sense of decor. <br /> <br /> The story is a little thin, but it is to present the characters. But it's pretty fun for a repeat view.
