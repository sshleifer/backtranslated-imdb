The avoidance of clich√©s is one of the main achievements of this film. When you hear a vague glimpse of history ?? Erasmus students of different nationalities sharing an apartment in Barcelona ?? you predict a collection of European stereotypes in a wacky entanglement. Not at all! In fact, it's a well-judged comedy about a young Frenchman, Xavier, who tries to make sense of human relationships. There are a few minor roles remarkably observed (the arrogant French neurologist, the unbearably irrepressible brother of the English girl, the abandoned mother of Xavier) and a refined visual humor, especially in the first scenes making fun of the complexity of the procedure. request. So what does Xavier learn about relationships? Nothing positive. In place of a conventional happy ending, is there a regrettably heavy final on "identity" ?? Xavier became "all the friends he made himself. Nevertheless, this very pleasant film deserves its great success. I saw it in Luxembourg with a mixed audience, who had fun and even applauded at the end.
