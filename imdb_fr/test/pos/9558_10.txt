In this offer, just look at the current annual Westminster Kennel Club offer for parallels. Incredibly funny and captures the true essence of the competition. We can only imagine the spirit of the producers and the incredible talent of the performers. I too would have nominated this film for a Globe Award and I think it's one of the funniest I've ever seen.
