I was surprised watching this movie, how much he had "captured" me. No, the actors did not behave like typical Hollywood actors, but it's not always bad either, as this movie proves. Quite different from the Disney standard, it's still a refreshing ride! They also give you a taste of what it probably looked like without being "educational". A movie that everyone should see and appreciate. Many people like to discuss "precision" in any movie of this type, but the basic idea is not lacking. Slight reproach; East and West Germany, seen on any map, would have West Germany on the left, East on the right. The film sometimes delays you slightly, because about half of the scenes have West Germany on the right side of the screen and other times on the left side. Even during the same events, they move. Perhaps a little more consistency would have avoided this slight distraction. Go see him!
