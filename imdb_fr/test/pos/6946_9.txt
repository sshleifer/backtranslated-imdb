Even a decade after the broadcast of "Frontline" on the ABC television channel, the "news" programs still use the same tricks. Day after day, "Today, Tonight" and "A Current Affair" are hiding behind the professionalism of the journalists, yet they feed us only tired stories about lean and dubious craftsmen, shameful network promotions and puffs of useless celebrities. -rooms. Having often been subjected to this emptiness without entertainment between "The Simpsons" at 18:00 and "Sale of the Century" (or "Temptation") at 19:00, I was too aware of the little tricks that shows would be used to attract ratings. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, four actors in the making ?? Rob Sitch, Jane Kennedy, Santo Cilauro and Tom Gleisner ?? were also all aware of all this and they expressed their frustrations in one of the hilarious and hilarious media satires you will see on TV. The four presenters had already had a comic hit, with their last memorable television show being "The Late Show," the brilliant Saturday night variety show that spanned two seasons from 1992 to 1993, along with fellow comedians Mick Molloy. , Tony Martin, Jason Stephens and Judith Lucy. <br /> <br /> "Frontline" offers a set of colorful characters, each with its own distinct and offbeat personality. The news program is directed by Mike Moore (Rob Sitch), an ambitious, pretentious and insensitive narcissist. Mike works in the illusion that the show plays a vital role for society ?? he is still convinced that they "maintain their journalistic integrity" ?? and his executive producers have excelled in making him believe that. Mike is basically a puppet to bring the news to people; From time to time, he feels that he is guided by the nose, but this thought is usually shattered by calls to his vanity or promises of promotion. <br /> <br /> Brooke Vandenberg (Jane Kennedy) is the senior reporter of the series. She is constantly concerned about her appearance and public profile, and according to rumors, she has had a love affair with just about every existing male celebrity. Another equally amoral journalist, Marty Di Stasio, is portrayed by Tiriel Mora, who played memorialist Dennis Denuto memorablely in the Australian classic "The Castle". Emma Ward (Alison Whyte) is the executive producer of the series and the only beacon of morality on the film set "Frontline". There is also the very entertaining meteorologist, Geoffrey Salter (Santo Cilauro), Mike's best friend and confidant. Geoff earns his living by always agreeing with Mike's opinion and laughing excessively at his jokes before admitting he does not have them. <br /> <br /> For each of the shows of the three seasons, we have different EP, executive producer. Brian Thompson (Bruno Lawrence), sadly deceased in 1995, runs the program during season 1. He has decent moral principles, and is always polite to his employees, and yet is more than willing to put them aside. favor of high marks. Sam Murphy (Kevin J. Wilson) arrives on stage for season 2, a hard-talking producer who knows exactly how to train Mike; the last episode of the second season, when Mike finally takes over, is a classic moment. Graeme "Prowsey" Prowse (Steve Bisley), EP for the third season, is brutal, unpleasant and sexist shamelessly. It is remarkable that you end up loving him. <br /> <br /> With its distribution of distinctive and exaggerated characters, "Frontline" has a lot of fun with satirizing news programs and their dubious methods to gain ratings. . Most episodes have been shot quickly and cheaply, often involving many plot ideas from recent experiences, but this does not affect the news of the show ten years later. Celebrity cameos come in abundance, with some of the most memorable appearances, including Pauline Hanson, Don Burke and Jon English. Watch for Harry Shearer's hilarious appearance in Season 2 of "Changing the Face of the News" with Larry Hadges, an American hired by the network to reform the show. <br /> <br /> Especially in the third season, I noticed that "Frontline" boasted a form of extremely crisp black humor, unusual for such a light comedy show. Really fun moments come from Brooke, suddenly subdued by abortion, the murder of a crazy bandit and Mike treacherously betraying the hopes and dreams of his best friend, to be told that he is a good friend. The last minute of the series ?? less a scene added during the credits, which was probably added just in case a fourth season would be produced ?? It was probably the darkest and most accomplished end of a comedy series I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Below you will find a very tentative list of my top five favorite episodes of "Frontline". half an hour is an absolutely hilarious and punchy satire. <br /> <br /> 1) "The seat" (Season 1) <br /> <br /> 2) "Give them enough rope" (Season 2) <br /> <br /> 3) "Addicted to Fame" (Season 3) <br /> <br /> 4) "Basic Instinct" (Season 2) <br /> 5) "Add sex and stir it" (Season 1)
