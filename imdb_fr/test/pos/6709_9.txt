Many people say that the end did not make sense, but it did. With the death of the vampire woman, the bond with the land was broken and the boat took off, having collected many Lifeforce from hundreds of thousands of souls. What revitalize these hexagonal cells and create new bats. It seems they do not have carnal sex, like legendary vampires. <br /> <br /> Space vampire bats can be ridiculous, but killing them with a shot at the center of the force beneath the heart is consistent. All you can ask for is consistency. The viewer must suspend his incredulity, even for science fiction. <br /> <br /> The only problem is to be a sword or a stake, not bullets. This creates a supernatural twist that does not fit science fiction. So that's a problem. <br /> <br /> The only major inconsistency I've seen is killing the male vampires with the sword, but the soul of the girl and Carlsen are heading towards the ship. I suppose the souls of the men have also mounted the ship, but are not shown. <br /> <br /> What about all humans killed? Do their forces that (the "souls") ascend on the ship as discrete entities, is the whole life force fused into one, to be used as it sees fit? In other words, all human souls that went aboard the ship could be reincarnated as bats. <br /> <br /> The basic concept is no more ridiculous than Star Wars "Force" or even a reincarnation. <br /> <br /> This movie was above a kitchen sink (Dawn of the Dead, Alien, Dracula), but in many ways profound. It was also a beautiful love story. The beginning and the end were ethereal. It started ("what happens to me") and ended with a love story. <br /> <br /> Most of the film's critics are about the fact that it's weird. So what? Bizarre is an art form. As far as ridicule is concerned, everything is fine. The concept of plague is much more interesting and subtle than the extraterrestrials who have just killed people. They might not have needed Patrick Stewart's blood to get a picture of the girl, but it was a very distant and surreal scene. <br /> <br /> Another reason why the movie is hated is because of the end. But the end corresponds perfectly to the beginning. People are so excited about the naked girl that they miss the heart of the film. It's a love story, from start to finish. It starts with Carlsen and the extraterrestrial spaceship girl and ends in the same way. So that's fine. Most people are obsessed with the hero who kills the monster, and this movie did not end that way, that's precisely why I love it. <br /> <br /> Instead, he has a happy ending, with the 2 of them returning to ship, to be reborn. Much cooler than the hero is killing the monster, but that's exactly why he bombed. It was not at all a horror or even a scifi / horror, but a love story, with a beautiful beginning and ending. All those souls that sparkle on the ship. And the vibrant crystal room of a new life. <br /> <br /> Most people can not cope with a love story that is also Alien meets the Dawn of the Dead and Dracula.
