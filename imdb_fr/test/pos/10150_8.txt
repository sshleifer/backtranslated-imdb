Less thriller than a colorful adventure with elements full of suspense, MAN WHO KNOWS TOO MUCH can not be compared to Hitchcock masterpieces such as VERTIGO, REAR WINDOW or PSYCHO; it's more like fun adventures than flying to north and north to west. Filmed mainly in Morocco and London, the film tells the story of a married couple (James Stewart and Doris Day) whose vacations are interrupted when they innocently take offense at a plot to assassinate - and when their young son is kidnapped to ensure their silence. <br /> <br /> James Stewart and Doris Day are quite effective in their roles of the American couple, and the characters are given an unusual twist: Stewart, a Midwestern doctor, is outgoing but has contact with the "ugly American to foreigner "about his personality; Day, who plays on a popular stage and a record star who retired as a result of her marriage, has a suspicious nature. These qualities of personality and background play extremely well in the story. <br /> <br /> MAN WHO KNEW TOO FALLS contains many famous scenes; The scene in which Stewart drugs the day before telling him about the kidnapping and the very complex sequence of Albert Hall, involving hundreds of cuts, are very powerful. Less often noticed, though just as satisfying in my opinion, are the more subtle scenes in which Hitchcock associates a hint of suspense with perverse humor, as when Stewart tries to detect it in a taxidermist shop and Day excludes "Que Sera Will be "(written for this film) in the most inappropriate way during a cocktail party at the Embassy. <br /> <br /> Even though the MAN WHO KNOWS TOO MUCH does not have the depth and impact of Hitchcock's greatest work, he remains a pleasant film one that compares very well with his work in his outfit. It's Hitchcock-light, but recommended. <br /> <br /> Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer
