It's one of the smartest movies I've ever seen. Script language, costumes, landscapes, plot, characters, etc. are all supreme. You will not be bored. I watched intensely or even just listened to this film working so many times that I lost count. Scarlett ages gracefully, acquiring a wisdom that will eventually outgrow her years. This film takes you from Tara to Ireland, where his family is from, and you'll see the results of another civil war that took place there, this time between the Irish and the British. <br /> <br /> This film describes the double standards of men at the time - a man is always respected if he has girlfriends and whores, but not a woman. If she is only seen in a private place with a man, the company accuses her of irregularity. And of course, Scarlett always thought off the beaten track, breaking the rules when necessary to create the necessary change, help people and / or survive. <br /> <br /> The beauty of Scarlett is definitely for the bones. His strength, self-esteem and wisdom grow with age. <br /> <br /> I remember her words when I'm confronting too many things on my plate, such as "tomorrow is another day" and how she behaved, her determination and to her courage, and where she learned the lessons. It's a good movie to show your girls, because it teaches a woman how important it is to respect herself and that men, especially those who are very beautiful, can have two faces and treat a woman differently, according to self respect. An attractive woman needs to learn what this movie teaches. <br /> <br /> For me, this film is like a therapy, and it's better than Gone with the Wind. The second part takes place in Ireland and anyone of Irish descent will cherish Scarlett's landscape, characters and character.
