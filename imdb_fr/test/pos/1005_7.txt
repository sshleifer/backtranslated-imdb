In this special TV show, Jon is the one who needs a life. The highlight of his day is counting the tiles on the ceiling and rearranging the sock drawer. Not satisfied with this, Jon takes Garfield to a support group to meet people. How many people will be interested in a loner of 20 years or less, whose best friend is a cat? <br /> <br /> After several unsuccessful attempts to find a girl, including a captivating dance scene that rivals the fusion of Flashdance and MC Hammer in The Office (the disco is dead, says Jon), it's more than shocked to find a cute girl who is as stupid as him. <br /> <br /> Of course, they get along, but Garfield fears John is forgetting him and prefers to have children rather than a cat. Fortunately, Jon's new girlfriend is allergic to cats. <br /> <br /> With a smoother animation than in the past, this is a longer episode of Garfield and Friends.
