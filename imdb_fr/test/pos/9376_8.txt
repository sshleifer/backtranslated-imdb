Without a doubt a "must" for all movie fans. <br /> <br /> Thanks to a refined script and a clear and precise direction, a prestigious cast meets and functions as a well-oiled clock to produce a psychological crackerjack thriller. <br /> <br /> Wonderful features describe the film's powerful message about racial and religious tolerance. It is difficult and almost unfair to choose a particular performance because there is no weak link in society, but Robert Ryan as a hateful and violent white supremacist is really cold in the back. <br /> <br /> Making this film in the 1940s would have taken a lot of courage. Now, all these years later, at a time when contemporary films are dominated by a ridiculous overabundance of rude language, naked breasts, silly acts and deafening soundtracks, it's refreshing to get back to the basics of realizing quality movies with "Crossfire". <br /> <br /> Another low-budget jewel of the Hollywood archives.
