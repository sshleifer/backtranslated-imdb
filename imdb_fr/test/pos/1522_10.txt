I caught this movie late at night and I never knew what hit me. It was one of the most disturbing films I've ever seen, and yet I was on the edge of my seat, waiting to see what would happen next. Alan Rickman is an excellent "villain" but this character beats all the others. I have never been so touched by a movie! It's been 6 years and I still can not forget "Closet Land".
