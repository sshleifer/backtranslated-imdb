I just saw some episodes of "Eleventh Hour", but I must say they were enough to impress me. This series is so impressive and interesting ... I will definitely follow it. <br /> <br /> First of all, I must say that the acting is excellent. Patrick Stewart plays his character - Ian the scientist - in a credible and casual way, and he makes the public believe in this character. Other characters, such as Rachel, are also believable and, although they are sometimes a little cold - because of the way the series is filmed - they are interesting. <br /> <br /> The stories told by this series are also interesting. For example, one of the episodes I saw involved cloning and a man trying to clone humans. The way the episode was developed and how Ian - Stewart - continued to follow the clues and save the people was incredible. In addition, it made you think of ethics and the question of whether it could be good or bad. Anyway, I think it's a good TV show. I just hope it goes on like this - interesting, challenging and with a good interpretation. Even if it is filmed in a cold way - little lightning, cold photographs, many close-ups - it never stops being interesting. Highly recommendable.
