I would just like to point out (in addition to advocating for the series to be published on DVD) that a show does not have to be realistic to be entertaining. Nowadays, with all the blood and cold blood in the news and in the police drama, reality shows, etc., it's nice to get lost in a good cheese show with entertaining characters. The PWOG is perfect. Was it Emmy material? No, but it was great anyway. <br /> <br /> I also have to vote for the second cast - they were more charismatic than the cast of the first season. I totally agree that the first season had a more serious atmosphere than the second season, but I was definitely more sucked by it. Even though the series has been out of order for years, I will never stop hoping it will be available for purchase.
