I do not think this caricature was as bad as some might think. Of course, I was only five years old when it was released. But I found it very entertaining at the time and I would always take a look at it today if he had the opportunity. Batman and Robin having been dubbed by Adam West and Burt Ward brought a nice touch and gave me a sense of familiarity as I watched also reruns of the animated series "Batman" of the 1960s, at that age. This caricature also had new twists that I had forgotten, like "Bat-Mite" for example. Looking back, I'm sure he was probably as annoying as many people think, but he did not bother me much at the time. As far as I can remember, his voice was like a cross between Dumb Donald and Orko. Gee, I wonder why? :) Anyway, take a look if you can and decide yourself. You might be surprised.
