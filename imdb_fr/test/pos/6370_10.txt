Michael Ritchie's "The Couch Trip" is a wonderfully anarchic comedy about what makes a good psychiatrist. It is so subtle and nasty that you start to realize the real scathing satire. It is also the best film of Dan Akyroyd, realized in a particularly successful cinematographic year (1988). First, "The big spaces" and now this. <br /> <br /> Akyroyd plays the role of John Burns, a career scammer who simulates madness to escape prison. Now, a silly comedy would be right about it. But "The Couch Trip" uses this as a springboard for everything else. The Beverly Hills psychiatrist, George Maitlin (Charles Grodin, subtly hilarious here) has a nervous breakdown and a replacement is chosen: Lawrence Baird, who happens to be the psychiatrist of Akyroyd! You can pretty much guess what's going to happen, but the big thing about "The Couch Trip" is not what's going on, but how it's done. <br /> <br /> "The Couch Trip" gives Dan Akyroyd the best role he has ever had. His John Burns is one of the original comic book creations in the history of cinema. Wicked one liners and physical humor are part of it, but what makes it special is that Akyroyd makes Burns an adorable character. We are rooting for him and love him very much in the 98 minutes that follow. <br /> <br /> But Akyroyd is not alone here. He receives strong support from other major comic actors. Walter Matthau joins the hilarity as a scammers minister who discovers Burns' secret and commits blackmail. Charles Grodin "slowly burns" his way to another great comedic role as an exhausted psychiatrist. Grodin was one of the most underrated actors in Hollywood. It's criminal, they did not use it more often. Richard Romanus epitomizes Grodin's lawyer for slimeball. <br /> <br /> "The Couch Trip" is one of many unpublished films made by the late Orion Pictures Corporation. MGM has spent a fortune buying the Orion Library, but it has not really benefited from its acquisition yet. "The Couch Trip" joins "Dressed to Kill", "Blow Out" and countless other people to pick up the dust that rots in the safe. Shame on MGM for their inaction. Hopefully with the new direction, "The Couch Trip" will find the audience and the respect it deserves. <br /> <br /> **** on 4 stars
