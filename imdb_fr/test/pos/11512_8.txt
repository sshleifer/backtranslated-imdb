Reading the other comments here at the IMDB, I had very high expectations before seeing "The angels of the universe". I was not disappointed and, by awarding an 8 to the film, I would say that I can justify this note. <br /> <br /> The film has incredible performances, especially from the main person, Pall. Supportive actors also do a very good job, like patients in the psychiatric facility, parents, and Pall's brothers and sisters. The music also deserves mention, supporting the film throughout, giving depth and feeling. Although the film is very Scandinavian, it does not leave aside the humor and has a kind of objective authority on the life of Pall. Still, if you want to see a cheese comedy or something light, it's not for you. It's a story about people with mental problems, about how they are treated in society - but mostly about Pall. <br /> <br /> I recommend this film to all movie lovers. It's one of the best films in Iceland, even in Scandinavia.
