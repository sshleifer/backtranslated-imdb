I've seen pretty much every Coen film, and I have to say it's one of their best movies. I would not dare say it's better than "The Big Lebowski", but it was great on its own. <br /> <br /> I thought the story was very interesting and sometimes hilarious. I liked all the characters, especially Tim Blake Nelson (Delmar) and John Turturro (Pete). <br /> <br /> There is nothing wrong with this movie, but this movie is not for everyone. It might be wise to say that if you like other Coen brothers' films, you'll also like this one. And if you liked what you saw in the trailer, I think you'll like the movie, but do not hold me back. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I hope you'll like (d) the film as much as I do. Thanks for reading, <br /> <br /> -Chris
