I had never seen a film by John Cassavetes until two years ago, when I first saw the murder of a Chinese bookmaker in a Berlin cinema, which I found interesting, for to say it diplomatically, but not so special, I immediately wanted to see more of his work. Since then I have tried - with a focus on trying - to look at his other work, SHADOWS in particular. I must admit that it took me some time before I really enjoyed the movie. In the beginning, Cassavetes was filmed, raw, improvised and brutal, which delayed me a bit and I considered it an original experience - absolutely - but imperfect and dated. But now, after examination, these small imperfections make it look so fresh even today. <br /> <br /> Shot with a minimum budget of $ 40,000 with a crew of six, SHADOWS offers an observation of the tensions and lives of three siblings in an African-American family in which two of three brothers, Ben (Ben Carruthers) and Lelia (Lelia Goldoni), have fair skin and may be considered white. Cassavetes demanded that the actors retain their real name to reflect the actual conflicts within the group, but felt that the film dealt with human rather than racial issues. Cassavetes shot the film in ten minutes and its jagged montage, a reaction against the "homogeneous" production values ​​of Hollywood. Cassavetes' main source of inspiration - at least in the cinematographic style in which the film was shot - was that of the Italian neo-realists, while professing his admiration for the pioneering spirit of Welles. The use of amateurs and improvisation may resemble some of the neo-realistic Italian directors, but with his bebop score of Charles Mingus and Shafi Hadi, the film looks very different, very American, as never before. <br /> <br /> The song with the feathered girls, "I feel like a pop-lollipop" (or something like that), reminds me of light years, an old story. But no matter the date, today is a delicious time capsule of the late 50s in New York. I think this is one of the first films made by budding filmmakers who realize they could shoot an independent film, without Hollywood, improvised and without a real budget. Seymour Cassel, who played and played in SHADOWS, says that it was THE NAKED CITY (1948) by Jules Dassin who was the first and who inspired them all, but I think it was the one who really opened the eyes to future independent American filmmakers. Camera Obscura --- 8/10
