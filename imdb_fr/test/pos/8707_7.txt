"Subspecies", like many other horror movies, gets a raw deal on IMDb. The majority of viewers have a deep contempt for horror and when they rent horror movies from time to time, they want to either laugh or admire excessively bloody scenes. Unfortunately, the "subspecies" are not particularly laughable and are not so bloody, so they are poorly rated. Too bad. <br /> <br /> Of course, there is a lot to criticize here. Non-actors are flat, subspecies have a poor special effect, and nocturnal scenes are too bright. But what are you waiting for? For a directly video horror movie, "Subspecies" boasts decent production values ​​and higher integrity than you could anticipate. The Romanian scenery of the film is practically unique (I think it was the first American film made in this country, post-communism), and the places, both inside and outside, are beautiful. The scenario contains moments of intelligence, especially when he is interested in local folklore (all phony, I'm sure). One way or another, filming and smart scripting get married - "Subspecies" has its own very distinctive world. To go on low praise ... it could be a lot silly. <br /> <br /> Fans of the most abominable aspects of horror will undoubtedly have a kick for the vampire vampire who drinks blood, Radu. It's quite effective in this film - powerful, with a hoarse voice memorable - but I like it better in the sequels, when the actor Anders Hove gives a more self-destructive performance and camper. A totally sincere Radu is a bit silly. Free nudity and subspecies themselves, which are clearly only in the film, are also ridiculous, as producer Charles Band has a fetish for evil creatures (see also Puppetmaster and Demonic Toys). <br /> <br /> But I linger too. a lot about the flaws of the film. For what it is - the horror of a vampire directly in the video - "Subspecies" is perfect. The suites offer better production values, more violence and more reflective scenarios. I recommend them even more. Still, this is not a bad start for the series.
