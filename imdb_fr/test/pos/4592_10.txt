This movie is "the" stupid comedy of the year and probably the best thing of Mike Judge since "Office Space". If you're a fan of Mike Judge or if you like shows like Futurama, you're doing yourself a disservice by skipping this little known and limited release. Although the DVD boasts very little "bonus", this movie is certainly funny enough to compensate for its "lack of value". <br /> <br /> This film is about an army grunt named Joe Bowers (played by Luke Wilson) that is part of a very secret army experiment designed to preserve the personnel of the army in peacetime so that it can be thawed in time of war to fight for our country. However, things take an interesting turn because the general in charge of the operation is broken in a circle of prostitution and the experience is almost forgotten. Bowers and his girlfriend Rita (played by Maya Rudolph) are both aroused in the year 2505, where, over natural selection, America's population has become increasingly stupid. Now, Joe and Rita have to find their way to a time machine to come back in 2005 with the help of Frito (played by Dax Shepard). <br /> <br /> What I really liked in this movie is Mike Judge satire comic on the course of US history over the last 50 years and on the progress of the humanity over the next 500 years. Advertising in the film, which has become a staple of American culture, is the best evidence of this. With broadcasts like South Park in mainstream media, it's easy to see how to draw conclusions that in the future, blasphemy has become a marketing tool. This is humorously portrayed in the film with subtle things like "Fudd-Ruckers" changing their name to "Butt-F ### ers", and a billboard displaying the ad "If you do not smoke Tarryltons ... F ## # You! " I can not help but laugh at the role that Carls Jr. plays in this future, with its slogan "F ### you ... I eating", and their automated kiosks displaying their "Extra Big" -A ## Tacos ". (with more molecules)! This film contains everything for which I go to the cinema. An excellent sharp and witty comedy, as well as a captivating storyline, make this DVD a record for ages. Be warned, though. If you're not a fan of Mike Judge, if you do not like "Beavis and Butthead" or if you do not have a sense of humor, then this movie probably will not suit you. Otherwise, I would say it's probably the funniest movie on 2506 ... I mean 2006.
