I had the pleasure of seeing this film at the age of 10 (already having an interest in Egyptology). I know that artistic direction and costumes have subtle mistakes, but the most important of all is the best film to date, with the look of the 18th dynasty. <br /> <br /> The film only approaches the film "The Egyptian" by Mika Walteri ", in the plot.A lot of the text has never been filmed, because we must take into account the length <br /> <br /> The score of B. Hermann and Alfred Newman is magnificent !!! Performances as follows: The late Edmond Purdom gave an excellent performance as orphan orphan adopted by parents under the age of Age 4. He states that he keeps to himself, that he has the best education possible and that he is a rather emotionally distant man, given his education and his high intelligence. > <br /> Jean Simmons is good as a maid tavern humble, honest loving and sincere Bella Darvi, people have complained about her accent, she is Babylonian.We do not see very well in the movie why Sinhue is so obsessed with Nefer Nefer's obsession Nefer Nefer's correct name In the book, Sinhue savored his Carnival and revenge early in the plot leaving the drugged body of Nefer Nefer Nefer to the workers of the "House of the Dead". <br /> <br /> Gene Tierney, in Baketaten, is awesome! When she tells Sinhue that he is pharaoh, she seems to be able to devour him (in his weakness). She is intense, brilliant and coldly beautiful. <br /> <br /> Michael Wilding is tragically heartbreaking in his mission to get everyone to know his God. I believe we are looking at Ankhnaten through the lens of Egyptologist A. Weigall. A vision at the time that had a feeling before the messiah about the vocation of Ankhnaten. Did his monotheism influence the Jewish people? Notice Psalm 104 and the other images of Egyption in the Psalms? <br /> <br /> Mr. Peter Ustinov provided the alter ego to Sinhue. He is wise of the street and cunning a survivor. Excellent actor as always. <br /> <br /> Mature has never thought much about himself, his Horemheb agrees as an ambitious "super patriot" who ends up having Sinhue murder more than one person in his quest for power (Walteri's book) . <br /> <br /> I had the impression that the end of The Egyptian was confusing because the personality of Sinhue changed too easily. He has a living son (Toth dies in the novel), the power is entrusted to him through his half-sister Baketaten, he knows the world now and masters international affairs. So he lit up? He could have changed the priesthood of Amon if he could. <br /> <br /> But NO! Sinhue abandons everything, everything, including the future of his son, to become a ragged beggar preaching a monotheistic love? <br /> <br /> This change was immediate and is the main flaw of the script! <br /> <br /> look of the film, color, most of the costumes (Nefer Nefer's gold dress was too much above because she is more richly dressed than the royal family), the music is beautiful. <br /> <br /> I'll watch it film again easily. <br /> <br /> PS I know you probably know that Horemheb did not directly succeed Ankhnaten, but I could not resist the assertion of this fact.
