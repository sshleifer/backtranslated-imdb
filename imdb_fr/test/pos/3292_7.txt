It was a strange film. I liked the adventure, even if it seems to target children. (SPOILER AHEAD) Ironically, the main character murders a federal official. Then he is a runaway fugitive. They then blew up his house and he finally committed suicide. Looks like they should have made a movie for a more mature audience or more family friendly. <br /> <br /> It was a strange movie.
