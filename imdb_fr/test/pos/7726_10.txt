Even for the amateur opera audience, the name CARMEN is immediately recognized as an opera by Bizet about a gypsy whose capricious loves destroy men. But although opera is now considered a must-see of all opera repertoires, the true story of the wild Gypsy girl created by Prosper Mérimée in 1845 has never been told as well as in this cinematic version by the Oversized Spanish director Aranda ('Juana the Loca AKA Mad Love', 'Lovers', 'If they tell you I fell', etc.). Embodying the author of the novel as the main character in search of the story of Carmen, one of his lovers - José - is the perfect way to tell the story of this famous gypsy wild woman. <br /> <br /> Carmen (the amazing and talented Paz Vega) works in a cigar factory in Seville, a factory adjacent to the military station where the real Jose (Leonardo Sbaraglia) is stationed. Carmen is stormy and in a fight triggered by a fellow worker drawing attention to the fact that Carmen is a gypsy, Carmen murders her colleague and is arrested. José is physically attracted to the voluptuous Carmen and when Carmen flirts with him, he agrees to allow him to escape - his return on investment is the promise of a night of passion with Carmen. Carmen maintains her pact, providing Jose with her first sexual intercourse, and José is sentenced. Due to his lack of military discipline, he loses his rank and is imprisoned for a period of time. However, upon his release, José meets Carmen again, kills another officer and fears fleeing to the hills to live with Carmen's smugglers and gypsies. people. Many incidents occur to try to weave a passionate bond between lovers, but when the true husband of Carmen is released, destructive behaviors take hold of those who include Carmen's passion and her relationship with a bullfighter. The passion of Carmen and José ends tragically. <br /> <br /> One of the factors that makes the story (so well adapted to cinema by the director Aranda and Joaquim Jordà move so well is the role played by Prosper Mérimée (Jay Benedict): his interrogation of José completes the history of Bizet The acting is superb, the cinematography of Paco Femenia and the excellent score of José Nieto contribute enormously to the success of this very good film, a must for the fans of the opera Carmen and a magnificent drama for spectators who admire historic pieces are highly recommended Grady Harp
