A very funny movie. Michael Douglas "do" is worth watching this movie because if for no other reason. I would like to see him play more of these low roles in life. He was great, like all the performers. <br /> <br /> The film immediately seemed like an American Roshomon, funnier and easier to watch because he was American and did not need stinky subtitles! In a funny movie with a laugh every minute or so, two of the best were with John Goodman (not someone I'm crazy about) - 1. He tells the priest that Jewel does something he likes and likes to say " I had to erase the smile from my face. " The visual shows that he does not smile and is clearly a guy who never smiles, but probably does not know it. 2. The scene at the end between Goodman, all dressed up for Jewel in his policeman's uniform, and struggling with Reiser, who's leather, leaning over a table ... and both protesting while they're not are not homosexual with another happening on the scene - this alone deserved a special Comedy Academy Award.
