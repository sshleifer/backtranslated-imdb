I'm a fan of 80s B movies in which the hero is a bit naughty, a strong man who finds love - and this film keeps its promises! how Sharky will not be killed (and does not take a beating! I think it's realistic). However, he does it and it is not via an excessive cascade of 'Die Hard'. The team of the past with which he works unites, hence the title. His team is made up of all the characters, marginal people at work because they are not completely compliant. These representations are funny and nice - they have a real feeling. They are confronted with a murderous ice cream vendor, with a good team to him. The result is an excellent film noir.
