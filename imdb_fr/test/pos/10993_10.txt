In the lands devastated by Hollywood Productions, this film - in itself - is truly "MANNA FROM HEAVEN" !!! <br /> <br /> In what could be described as a "cute" movie, about 350 years of experience in the cinema (very good - about a hundred years!) brightly illuminates the screen to tell a story deception, remorse and redemption over a Catholic family in Buffalo, NY. <br /> <br /> Really well placed to take its place in the genre of film "well-being", this little independent film company CINQ SISTERS PRODUCTIONS Burton Sisters will leave a smile on your face and a joy in your heart, while renewing your faith. in humanity. <br /> <br /> From Buffalo's spectacular opening scenes to the latest credits, the film manages to tell a story that could have been told about any family, anywhere. Yet, in a way, this family reunion and "family by association" in a small indistinct house in Buffalo does more than suit. If you've never been to Buffalo, you'll leave the theater with the thought of "strolling" for a visit! Images of the sights of the city and surrounding area help give the film a picturesque and realistic tone, which suits it perfectly. The tranquil beauty of the "Queen City of the Great Lakes" compliments rather than harms the story told. If only more films took advantage of the natural beauty of the "second cities" of this country instead of running somewhere on a sound stage, the end result would be much more credible. <br /> <br /> Great performances by Shirley Jones, Frank Gorshin, Wendy Malick, Jill Eickenberry and other band members prove once again that true talent lasts longer than the Hollywood "flavor of the week"! <br /> <br /> GO TO SEE THIS FILM! <br /> You have been wandering for a long time in the Hollywood desert!
