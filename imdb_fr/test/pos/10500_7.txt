Thanks to The FilmZone for showing this sordid sex movie at 1am. I really enjoyed it. To be honest, I was expecting a lot more than a sexy cast with McKayla, Dru Berrymore and, of course, the talented Chloe Nicholle (as Rebecca Carter). <br /> <br /> The production values ​​are really bad, mainly because of the small budget but a little more effort would not hurt. For example, cinematography gives the impression of a hard core porn movie. There is absolutely no effort in the lightning. But let's ignore this fact because, let's be honest, we watched "Pleasures of Sin" because of the large amount of sex. <br /> <br /> The sex factor is pretty good and offers explosive and explosive scenes. Chole Nicholle offers the best performance of the female cast. <br /> <br /> My advice is to watch this movie if you are in the mood to have good sex or just to watch if you are a fan of Mrs. Nicholle. <br /> <br /> Recommended only for sex scenes; do not wait for anything else.
