Caddyshack 2 has an awful reputation, due solely to the fact that it is a sequel to a well-kept classic. People have criticized the film for a lot of reasons, but they all end up coming back to the fact that it's not Caddyshack. <br /> <br /> I would start by saying that we should just remove Caddyshack from the equation and consider this film according to its merit, but I think it would be unfair. The film has a lot in common with its predecessor. The topics related to the class "snobs against slobs" and the desire to integrate into a higher class than yours are as present here as in the first film. The two things that are really missing here are Bill Murray and Rodney Dangerfield, who are replaced by Dan Ackroyd and Jackie Mason respectively. <br /> <br /> I'm not about to argue that Akroyd is close to Murray in the film, but Jackie Mason is an admirable successor to Dangerfield. He stands out between Dangerfield and Arnold Stang, but without biting too hard. I would not say he's almost as funny as Dangerfield in Caddyshack, but his character and his dilemma in the movie make a lot more sense. <br /> <br /> Chevy Chase is just showing up. and a handful of times in the movie, which is another common complaint. Perhaps these opponents in particular have not noticed that he only appeared a few times in the first film. For my money, her scenes here are a lot more fun, although they are a bit over-turned. <br /> <br /> While I am on the subject, it is really the direction of this film that makes it fall. He seems to be much more aware of himself in his attempts to laugh. Many jokes are laborious and there is far too much Gopher, who seems to have assumed a much more anthropomorphic personality and voice, just in case we do not understand that it's supposed to be funny. <Br /> <br /> Characters are also hit at home, especially smarmy yuppy kids. Jackie Mason rarely misses a beat, he's always friendly and very funny, but we did not need the tango sequence! The director clearly does not agree with Harold Ramis. That's not to say that Caddyshack was subtle, but the jokes here are just a little overcooked, and most of them are unnecessarily decorated with an unusual musical replica. with something to say about class and identity that very few films at the time said. Do not be fooled by the appalling rating on IMDb, check it out for yourself.
