This film is a jewel ... an undiscovered classic of Gerry Anderson. <br /> <br /> The origins of "UFO" and "Space 1999" are evident in this film, including the list of actors including the late Ed Bishop and George Sewell who both went on "UFO". <br /> <br /> It is unfortunate that Anderson, despite his many television successes, did not have the chance to develop his talent on the big screen. Just think of what he could have done with the movie version of "Thunderbirds" (which he rightly denied the person!). <br /> <br /> I am sure you are offering "JTTFSOTS" / "Doppleganger" luck that you will appreciate its good qualities.
