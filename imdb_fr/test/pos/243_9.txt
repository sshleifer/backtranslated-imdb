A fantastic music starring Gene Kelly and Rita Hayworth. He has a nightclub where she dances. She is not yet a star, but she has a big chance when she was chosen to cover Vanity, whose owner was in fact in love with her grandmother. When he sees the resemblance, he immediately chooses it for a contest that his maganzine organizes. Hayworth's new notoriety first works wonders for Kelly's club, but his star is rising so fast and so high that his grip on her begins to wane. This is not the most original plot, but both tracks really succeed. It also helps that the scenario is excellent. Kelly is not yet at its peak, especially his actor. His dance, however, wow. Hayworth is the star, but Kelly claims the most memorable moment of the film as he dances passionately with his own reflection. This is obviously a takeoff of the dance of the shadow of Fred Astaire in Swing Time, but I think that Kelly understands it, which is hardly conceivable. In fact, this must be the most astonishing dance sequence in film history, except perhaps the An American finale in Paris a few years later. The rest of the songs are also excellent and the musical numbers are even better. Too bad that Rita did not sing her own songs (well, she may have several songs, because her voice sometimes seemed different). His dance is wonderful, as is the rest of his acting. It's hard not to love him. She is truly one of the few really beautiful women of the classical era. Not plastic like many of them; no, you can really see the warmth in this woman. His smile is so disarming. Phil Silvers plays Kelly's best friend and he's also very funny. The Kelly-Hayworth-Silvers trio is obviously the core that has become Kelly-Reynolds-O'Connor's trio in Singin 'in the Rain eight years later. One of the biggest musical numbers of the film seems almost completely stolen by the number "Good Morning" of Singin '. I think Singin 'in the Rain is the best movie because Cover Girl is a bit rough. This roughness, however, only adds to the charm. Some aspects of this film beat Singin 'in the Rain, and even An American in Paris. For example, the central relationship involves more emotions. Instead of the old dominant man chasing the little girl (Leslie Caron and Debbie Reynolds were just teenagers, after all), we have a very good relationship with two people who seem more equal. There is no chase - an aspect that unfortunately makes many of the best musicals a bit sour, you have to admit. Kelly and Hayworth have been a couple since the beginning, and when it starts to fray, I really feel it. 9/10.
