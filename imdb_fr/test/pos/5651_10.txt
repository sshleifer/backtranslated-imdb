This film is a coup de grace, we refer to Fires on the plain, (burning at the end of harvest times). A happy memory for Tamura, he often sees it in his mind, and at the end of this dark film, I love a man dying of thirst, he thinks he is at home and this last illusion is all that remains to him. Billy Wilder's big carnival (Ace in the Hole) is the only film (which comes to mind) that is as dark as Kon Ichikawa's little masterpiece. Although I think the whole movie is brilliant. Two scenes that come to mind are those where a platoon of Japanese soldiers trying to escape (crawling on their belly) are ambushed by Americans and massacred, True Horror, and as a pretty American soldier Filipino girl. soldier smoking a cigarette on the side of the road, she smiles while hopping, then her face turns angry when she sees two Japanese soldiers trying to surrender, she catches a gun and kills them with joy , The American soldier tries to stop him but has no chance, it says a lot about the atrocities committed by the Japanese in the Philippines, all in all, it is an excellent film if you have the courage to support it.
