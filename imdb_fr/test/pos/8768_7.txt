Excellent thriller Hitchcock with Robert Cummings, which proves once again that he could really face a storm. <br /> <br /> This time, he's a factory worker at the defense factory caught in a terrible plot when his best friend is killed at the factory. <br /> <br /> Priscilla Lane is the girl who is suddenly interested in Cummings as the plot thickens and he is pursued from California to New York <br /> <br /> There is a diabolical plot by a group of rich 5th columnists to destroy from within. Hitchcock was known for playing the upper echelons of society involved in his long career as a director. <br /> <br /> Ironically, the film implodes at the very end. As we see what happens to the guy who killed Cummings' friend, we do not see what happens to the rest of the gang, again, many of them representing the high society.
