I can not believe I missed this one. Made in 1970 with a budget that would probably allow you to make an indifferent episode of a soap opera, it is about an hour and a half of sustained shooting and sharp as a movie knife. You will find the outline, the plot, etc. elsewhere on this site.Consider that everything was shot with a single 16mm portable camera ... the whole dialogue is improvised ... none of the "actors" had appeared before a camera before ... It looks like a recipe for a disaster. Instead, what we get are hippies against cops running in the California desert in what evolves to become a "who is not fair ... I'm on that person's side". The only problem is that the director forces you to change allegiance and after 90 minutes, we still do not know who has one. Brilliant ... quite brilliant.
