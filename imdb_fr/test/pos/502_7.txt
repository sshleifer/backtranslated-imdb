Interesting twist on the vampire thread - fast, strong and moody. Despite my initial fears, Kris K is doing well and Snipes, aka Blade, has a great physical presence. A lot of blood, steel, money, bodies on fire and exploding provide a nice distraction :) of 110 minutes. If you like the black look of The Matrix, then Blade will seduce you. Blade even offers a "dodge balls" sequence.
