Francis Ford Coppola's "Apocalypse Now" is not a film about the Vietnam War. Do not confuse it with one. It is placed at the rear of the war, but it is a metaphorical exposition of the more and more serious effects of war on the human psyche. It is also one of the most daring films ever made, produced or even conceived (second after the trilogy of The Lord of the Rings.) Qualifying it as a masterpiece would be a euphemism of proportions as ambitious as the level of production of the film. <br /> <br /> Opening without credits and following a memorable first scene playing on the melody of Doors "The End", while Captain Benjamin L. Willard of Martin Sheen hallucinates in front of images of helicopters and napalm, the plot is essentially presented in the first 15 minutes: Willard's mission is to "put an end ... with extreme prejudices" to Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando) who has always been dismissed by the war, to background of the Cambodian jungle and, as his general says, "operating without any decent restraint, totally beyond any acceptable human conduct.And he is still on the ground commanding the troops." Kurtz is a col onel delirious which is currently venerated by a large group of followers who have dubbed him a god. For Willard, this work seems a little more manageable than a real fight, but the journey he is about to undertake will be a personal quest that will question the limits of his human behavior. <br /> <br /> Teaming up with a small crew, they board the vast expanses of the river in a rickety boat. Along the way, Willard learns about all things Kurtz. During Sheen's hoarse voice, he details his reflections on the abundance of documents he reads. Kurtz was a very decorated and respected green beret. He was a normal man with a family, until a part of himself succumbs to the horrors of human brutality and moves himself in the path traced by Willard. The descent into the jungle is marked by a hypnotizing aura that echoes the fighting that takes place not far away. Eventually, the power of experience weighs on the group as a drug and a kind of cell isolation attacks their senses. But Willard seems insensitive and desensitized in his quest to find Kurtz. Reading about this mythical figure, he is attracted to the power of man and why he became what he has become. We know that Willard's slow decline will be parallel to Kurtz's. <br /> <br /> Marlon Brando has been revered for decades. His presence: incomparable. His genius: undeniable. But for those who do not know his acting prowess and are not used to his physical nuance, Brando can be perceived, in the eyes of an uncompromising spectator, as a hack. He is most certainly not. Brando was hard to work with, difficult to interpret and impossible to understand, but his talent for unmistakable jabbers and unprecedented monologues is irrefutable. The man obviously knew what he was doing, even though we did not know it. His colonel Kurtz is a being with unlimited illusions and continual depth. <br /> <br /> If the film is an indication of the trips to hell, the actual experience of Francis Ford Coppola with the realization of this masterpiece is a tale of the life of a man's fanatical struggle for produce a movie. It is reported that Coppola was planning to commit suicide during the 200-day filming schedule. The film was not just an undeniable fight to be made; it's an exhausting film to watch. The sweat and blood of Coppola filter through the pores of the local population and his dedication filters through the holes of Martin Sheen's haunted soldier. <br /> <br /> I can not help feeling a strong nostalgia for this type of film. At the dawn of all that was original and unprecedented, films both stimulating and stimulating were commonplace. Audacity aside, Apocalypse Now is purely cinematographic. My respect and admiration for Mr. Coppola are first rate. But I shudder back to what has become the norm for current cinematographic standards: the lack of innovation. It's not just the non-originality of today's film world; it's the fact that no one seems to care about telling a story or telling a story with heart. But we still have big ones like Coppola's masterpiece, a film that was full of his ability to give us something deeper than we could understand. <br /> <br /> This depth in Apocalypse Now is the step in the madness. Murder can disturb. The loss of innocence can disturb. But it's the damage from the inside; the innumerable dams of images that torment us, disconcert us and move us away from our everyday world and the memories that invade our deepest thoughts that eventually separate us from humanity and propel us into the realm of instinct, wild and animal. If the idea of ​​killing does not provide food, the act of killing provides man with his basic catharsis.
