A great movie. Each moment masterfully led by Toyoda and his crew. The actors play credible performances all around. The visuals are haunted, beautiful and sometimes beautiful, landscapes of the city and the Japanese country. The sounds, courtesy of the Japanese group 'Dig', are never excessively upset as one would expect from soundtracks. It is strangely atmospheric and well adapted to the scenes in which they occur. <br /> <br /> All in all, they've set everything right ... Well, if they did justice to the story, perfection would be the only thing everyone could have accepted. <br /> <br /> The true greatness of 9 souls is the fascinating story. The prison break film is perhaps a lost genre nowadays, and the film on the roads loses its appeal because of the reduced size of the world. But this story easily mixes something new with these two genres. <br /> <br /> Nine convicts enjoy the freedom and possibly the opportunity to return to their place in society. Will society accept them? will they really be liberated from their dark past? and can they stay together long enough to stay alive and discover? <br /> <br /> Every convict has an interesting story. Their crimes are as varied as their apparent fate. The feeling of brotherhood that reigns among them keeps the story at the heart of the drama and provides hilariously funny situations. And because of the nature of their origins, violence is always an expectation. <br /> <br /> After all that, all I can say is that you give him a watch.
