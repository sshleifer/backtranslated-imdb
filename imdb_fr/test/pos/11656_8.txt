This film tells the story of a Catholic nun, counselor of the convicted murderer on death row. The film describes what she does as a nun, who has no productive role. She could have doubted her current role. But ultimately, she plays the role that only a nun can do, who has only faith in Christ. In America, there are so many movies describing convicted criminals or jails. These scenes, especially the performance, are too different from Japan.
