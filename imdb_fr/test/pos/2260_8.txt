Not having read the book, I was more open to the new interpretation that each director gives to his media (which is a film, not literally "literature reproductions") of this particular film. that the Holocaust in Russia (and neighboring countries) finally caught the attention.The Nazis were particularly cruel to the Russians and Russian Jews.If you read the stories and you see the monuments built in Smolensk and in the surrounding areas, you will understand this film and the reasons why many remained silent when they should have spoken. <br /> <br /> It was certainly time to chronicle this film and I hope that other stories will come out.
