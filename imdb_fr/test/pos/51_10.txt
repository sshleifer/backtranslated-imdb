It was absolutely one of the best movies I've seen. <br /> <br /> Excellent performances of an exceptional cast of A-List that will make you go from smiling to laughing through tears. <br /> <br /> I could not help but worry about the characters. Ms. Merkerson will amaze you, as will the young man in the lead role. <br /> <br /> I also thought that the scenography was excellent. The viewer is really placed inside each era as it is presented. <br /> <br /> The music is an explosion, too. Nice selections to represent the mood, the weather and the place. The Blues Man is a stereotype, but he delivers great songs. <br /> <br /> It's a beautiful story that will survive many repeated viewings. Take the time to watch it!
