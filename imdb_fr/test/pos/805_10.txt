This is an absolutely true and faithful adaptation of 'The Hollow'. We could argue that the mystery is not the best at Christie's, but what makes "The Hollow" special is the characterization and I found that the actors, more or less without exception, were perfect in their roles. In such a cast, it's hard to pick out outstanding performances, but I have to say that Sarah Miles is just perfect as Lucy Angkatell. What is extraordinary is that it not only translates Lucy's tactlessness, tactlessness, and loveliest qualities, BUT she also succeeds in uncovering the underlying truth that in fact Lucy does not is not really so beautiful! Megan Dodds is also very good as Henrietta and Claire Price very affectionate like Gerda. John Christow is really a bad character, but Jonathan Cake still manages to show us what his women see in him. <br /> <br /> As I said, the scenario faithfully follows the story. The only confusing thing I found is that the relationship between Midge and Edward is really wrong and I think some of them had to end up in the cutting room! Their story is however secondary and the main story is very well done. Everything is so beautiful, really capturing a perfect English autumn. <br /> <br /> This is a beautiful film in all respects and deserves a visit.
