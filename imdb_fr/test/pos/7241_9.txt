Although not quite as good as a murder is advertised, which was not only delicious, but almost surpassed the book, it's an excellent fit. And you know what, it's a huge improvement over Geraldine McEwan's version. Now, I'm not proud to blame Geraldine McEwan's adaptations, two or three of them were surprisingly good, but others have started well, but have been ruined by a mediocre scenario, a confusing final solution or the two. Geraldine McEwan's version suffered from a frantic pace, and the two problems above, and I would consider the second of the worst adaptations of ITV, the worst being Sittaford Mystery, which, even on its bottom, proved dull and confusing. This adaptation of the book Nemesis is a huge improvement. Not only does she respect the book, despite some liberties, but it pretty much solves the problems of the ITV version. Although the character of Lionel seems rather irritating, more by his writing than by his behavior, and by one or two moments of slow rhythm, this is solid as an adaptation of a decent book. It is beautifully filmed, with beautiful photographs and period details, and the music is always excellent. The performances are wonderful this time and make the most of a well-done screenplay, with Joan Hickson as brilliant as Miss Marple and strong turning points by Liz Fraser, Helen Cherry, Joanna Hole and Anna Cropper. Margaret Tyzack however stands out with a frightening and moving performance as Clothilde. Overall, it's worth looking at, better than the recent version in just about every department. Bethany Cox
