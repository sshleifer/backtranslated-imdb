I love watching the mile of Jericho. I mean look at peter Strauss running the mile, it's like watching usain bolt sprint at 100 meters. I think Peter Strauss is an excellent actor and should make another movie running. It is fast as lightning has a lot of energy and can run a mile in less than 4 minutes and that my friend is amazing. no living man can race in the rain Murphy, I mean the man runs 80 miles a week, nobody does it except him. I have looked at the thousand Jericho hundreds of times and will look at him more. the big movies are watched more than the movies that are not. I thank the authors of this film for having dedicated years of his life. They are great people and I bless them all.
