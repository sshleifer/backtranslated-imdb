The Royal Rumble has always been one of my favorite events and I have been a wrestling fan for a few years now. The other series may have better matches, but I have always found the match of rumble full of enthusiasm. <br /> <br /> I will not reveal the winners of the matches, because I do not see it is right to spoil the results of a review. However, I will comment on their quality. <br /> <br /> We have the 4 standard matches, then the big rumble event. Two of Smackdown and two of Raw. <br /> <br /> Shawn Michaels and Edge pledge for Raw. It turns out to be a good match of two talented guys. It's a game I recommend to watch. It is difficult to summarize without revealing the winner. <br /> <br /> Next, we meet the usual Undertaker against a nasty monster, whoever he is. Giant Gonzales, Yokozuna, Kamala ... well this time it's Heidenreich. It's also a coffin match. Typical Undertaker Tariff. Look if you are a fan. I must admit that I am only for the entertainment factor. This can hardly be considered a classic wrestling match. <br /> <br /> The next two games are the title matches. For once, Smackdown manages to snatch Raw. Their title match is exciting and enjoyable, but with an anti-climax and an end in the end. The Raw match is a pretty boring and boring affair, which is a shame because I am a fan of both guys involved. <br /> <br /> Now, here is the main reason why I like the event, the turnover. It's a very good year this year. At the event, we all had a pretty good idea of ​​who could win, and this may not be a big surprise, but hey, it's very nice. There are the usual ways to eliminate people. There is the symbolic guy who does not go to the ring, the competitor who is ridiculous and we all want to be defeated, and someone is eliminated by a previously eliminated fighter. He has his usual ups and downs and I loved the end, especially Vince McMahon's entry. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this show. Not the WWE in good shape, but it's still good. Add that to your collection.
