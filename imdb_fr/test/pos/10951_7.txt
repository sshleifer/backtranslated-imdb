A vampire prince cracks for a human girl, unaware that his brother is a famous vampire hunter. This is the underlying theme of this martial arts hustle that borrows the ideas of "Underworld" and "Buffy The Vampire Slayer" but manages to retain its own style. The British title and Hong Kong "The Twins Effect" puzzles me because there are no twins involved in the story. It turns out that the two main female characters are played by Hong Kong pop pop stars played under the pseudonym "The Twins". Do not let this discourage you. These girls can play (at least pretty good for this type of movie) and add a lot of charm to the procedure. Jackie Chan presents himself for a few appearances, adding a strand of his own brand of blinding chaos to the proceedings. All this is very fun for those who love their vampires served with a touch of ironic humor.
