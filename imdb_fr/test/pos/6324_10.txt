I just discovered this fantastic series and I just can not get enough of Garner's laid-back IP. The series continually displays an excellent level of writing and episodes full of suspense. <br /> <br /> This episode, Sleight of Hand, is a little different. Abandon humor for a more serious ride for Rockford as he searches for his missing girlfriend. <br /> <br /> The mystery is great and its revelation is convincing enough. It is based on a book (I do not remember the name) and it could easily have been extended to an episode. Garner excels here while Rockford gets tough and really means business. It gives an impression of "black" all along, the dark lighting and the general atmosphere echo the great black thrillers of the 40s and 50s. <br /> <br /> A very good episode of a series of class A. Easily deserves a 10.
