For some reason, some shows fail ... some rightly, others no ... Buddy Faro was a clever show with interesting characters and a pleasant black humor to watch ... Maybe it's not had never been destined to be a big hit, but there was a "quirk" about it that made it nice ... that being said, it seems like I was perhaps the only one watching ... Dennis Farina and Frank Whaley were playing perfectly in their respective roles ... quality of production and writing was excellent and Vegas was the perfect backdrop ... I hope the first and only season will be released on DVD because I think that it deserves some notoriety ... maybe at least on television.
