This is one of my favorite James links in games for the following reasons: The missions are fun, they have a lot of action, they can be difficult, which makes them fun to use the weapons you use. The James Bond look in this James Bond game is pretty. You can see Pierce Brosnan in him, which is cool and all the other characters in this game look like the actors who played them in the movie. There is no way you can not have a good time playing this game, I loved it. In addition, the game follows the movie more or less perhaps with some additions, but it follows the film quite well. Also, this James Bond game has very good graphics for the Nintendo 64 and it's a pity that there is no voiceover in this game, but they worry as long as the game is fun to play . ****** out of **********
