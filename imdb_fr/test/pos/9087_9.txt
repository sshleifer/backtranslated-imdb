Medical students play chicken with a process that simulates death in order to obtain a (hopefully temporary) vision of the afterlife. Some twists and themes are a little off and the game of actors sometimes goes beyond. But the underlying message - about the forgiveness of God and others for our real or supposed sins - is positive and unique in the cinema and distribution is very very good. The last sequence between Julia Roberts and her father is so well done that, years after seeing it, I still have shivers to think about it. Highly recommended.
