"Beyond the Clouds" is an artistic group of four superb vignettes each offering insights into the relationships between men and women, from the most tenuous to the most turbulent. Although the film offers superb cinematography, exquisite visual beauty and a host of great performers, there is little meat on the bones of this fragmented work. A foretaste of a relationship can not give fullness and synergy suggests that it is possible to do much more with a story in two hours than with four. Nevertheless, "Beyond the Clouds" will be a fodder for the dilettantes and a visual feast for the whole, although superficial, on stilts and without substance.
