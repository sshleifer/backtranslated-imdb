Having seen the full version, I found the film beautiful. This caught my attention from beginning to end; the tension was wonderfully transmitted. Nasaan Ka Man describes the typical Filipino family with precision in the presentation of her secrets and lies. Even the religious culture, the human tendency to keep appearances and maintain a pure reputation are shown with extreme vivacity in the character of Gloria Diaz. There is not a small scene in this film that has no purpose - the cinematography is excellent and the writing brilliant. <br /> <br /> Although the plot is great, I personally found that the twist in the end, the revelation about Jericho's character was not as shocking as it should be. But then maybe it's just me, because otherwise, Nasaan Ka Man is a very cleverly designed movie. <br /> <br /> The cast was good at first, but Deither and Claudine were the icing on the cake. Do not miss it if you're looking for a Filipino movie that will surprise and exceed expectations. Congratulations to the director.
