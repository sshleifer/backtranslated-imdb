I'm not particularly worried about Michael Jackson. In addition to being pedophile, I really do not like his music, with the exception of a few songs from his flagship album, THRILLER. This is one of them. I like this video because it is one of the first and most important music videos ever made. <br /> <br /> It was directed by John Landis, best-known horror lover as director of AN American WEREWOLF IN London. This clip is not really a clip but rather a short horror movie. Mr.J. and his date are in a werewolf movie. When they leave the movie, they are attacked by a horde of bloodthirsty zombies, when Michael Jackson makes his famous dance "Thriller". <br /> <br /> You know, it's a very good song with good synthetic rhythms. This and "Beat It" are probably the only two Michael Jackson songs I can tolerate again and again. I particularly like Vincent Price's cameo as a narrator. His distinctive voice is perfect for a music video on the horror theme. Even if you do not like Mr.J.'s music, you have to see this video at least once. By the way, he was good before becoming a scary white woman with a fake nose.
