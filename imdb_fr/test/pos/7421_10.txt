"Happy Ever After" ended when his characters, "Terry & June Fletcher" were revived for a more popular and popular sequel - "Terry & June", although their last names went from Fletcher to Medford. <br /> <br /> Terry got a new job. June and he are then transferred to Purley, where they find themselves with all kinds of unexpected memories, unwanted guests going at an inconvenient time, the boss inviting himself. to dinner and Terry trying to risk his arm at the DIY but pulling it every time. Another IMDb user described the show as "not smart" and "never well written". All right, it was not smart, but it was the goal of everything. As for "never well written", some episodes were mediocre, I admit, but overall, I found it extremely well written, very fun and very well played. <br /> It was warm. slapstick, not very different from the BBC sitcom "Keeping Up Appearances". Eight different writers contributed to the nine series, which gave the series considerable scope. Terry Scott was a comic book genius, as he has proven in productions such as "Hugh & I", "Carry On" movies and of course, here! June Whitfield was also a legend in comedy. <br /> <br /> I like some modern shows, such as "Still Game", "The Catherine Tate Show", "Legit" and "Empty". I even liked the "alternative comedy" - "Naked Video", "The Young Ones" and "The Comic Strip Presents", but I'm more inclined to enjoy a vintage comedy like this. The humor you do not need to think is great when you feel depressed and want to elevate yourself. For the record, "Terry & June" was a wonderful thing. A special note should be made of the catchy theme melody that captured the show's atmosphere extremely well!
