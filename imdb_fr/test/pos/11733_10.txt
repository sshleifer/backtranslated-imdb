The jazz soundtrack gives the impression that it sounds like a Clint Eastwood movie. <br /> <br /> In fact, everything seems to be embodied by Burt playing Clint. The story is good and the film is full of liners that I carry with me so far. (Reynolds to the villain: I'm going to pull the chain on your friend, because you're in my city, and you want to know the worst - you're in a far-off state!) <br /> <br /> Highlights: The Technics 1500B Mill Reel is a nice dress up game for audiophiles! <br /> <br /> Charles Durning eclipses listening to wiretapping tapes of prostitutes having some sort of sex on the phone. (You should see it, trust me, it's hilarious.) <br /> <br /> Brian Keith plays the guy like a tough guy. (And do it well!) <br /> <br /> Bernie Casie's concern for Zen. <br /> <br /> Rachel Ward. WOW! (Where did she go?) <br /> <br /> Doc Severinsen and the Tonight Show band play as usual. (Joe William's guests on vocals, Manhattan Transfer re-recorded "Route 66".) The soundtrack sets the tone for the whole affair. <br /> <br /> Should we say more? It may be Reynold's best film. <br /> <br /> (Yes, he plays himself, as usual, but it works!) <br /> <br /> Have fun!
