Gray can make the English language stand out like no other. It tells a number of events linked by the writing of a manuscript (the "Monster" title), some sad, others incredibly amusing, all in its characteristic and sarcastic style. If you liked "Swimming to Cambodia", you will love this one. I actually thought it was a bit more interesting and better told than "Swimming to Cambodia". A real masterpiece.
