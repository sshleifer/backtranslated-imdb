My boyfriend and I went to The Guardian. At first, I did not want to watch it, but I loved the movie. It was really the best movie I have ever seen. They portrayed the USCG very well, they really showed me what they are doing and I think they should really be better appreciated. Not only did that teach, but it was really a good movie. The film shows what it really does and how difficult the job is. I think being a USCG would be difficult and very scary. It was a good movie all around. I would suggest this movie to everyone. The end broke my heart but I know why he did it. The scenario was great I give it 2 inches. I cried it was very emotional, I would give him a 20 if I could!
