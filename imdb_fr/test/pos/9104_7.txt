(Very sweet spoilers, a basic schematic of the plot, no real details) <br /> <br /> IF you are going into this movie with low enough expectations. I saw this film at a free screening a few days ago in Maryland, and the only reason I agreed to go there was because it was free. I was expecting some chuckles, but since I've never been a big fan of Tenacious D, that's all. <br /> <br /> The first ten minutes of the film are hilarious, as we are given a glimpse of Jack Black's modest Christian origins in a midwestern US city. The film then takes us years into the future, at the first meeting between JB and Kyle Gass, the second half of Tenacious D. We see the formation of the group and the genesis of its name. Finally, as the title indicates, the second half of the film details their quest for the legendary "Pick of Destiny". Once again, the beginning of the movie was very funny, and most of the film at least kept smiling. That said, there were times when it seemed a bit long; it's only 100 minutes, but it seemed to me that it should have been a little shorter. The story is as absurd as it sounds, and it's not a movie you see if you want a real plot. Which is good, except that it means that a lot of jokes are very random or missing ... and when they're missing, they're missing a lot. Same thing with the songs; it's a musical, but a lot of songs lost their appeal after the first minute or so ... then all the same. <br /> <br /> I would say that the rating R really saved this film from bombing; The humor of the D simply could not work without swearing, sex and references to drugs. But unless you're a real fan of the band, or at least you know how to appreciate his comedy style, I'd recommend saving money and renting. "Pick" will make you laugh a little ... but is it worth 9 dollars? I do not think so. I was tempted to rate 6, but as I think many would appreciate it enough to warrant seeing it in theaters, a 7 seems more appropriate. Make sure it's your style.
