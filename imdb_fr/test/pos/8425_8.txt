Although this production has received a number of poor reviews, it is pretty good for its age. Also note that this is not a BBC program, it is simply that Granada Ventures granted them a license when the Jane Austen collection was released on DVD. <br /> <br /> How does it compare to other adaptations of the same novel? The best-known version today is the 1995 film starring Amanda Root as Anne Elliott and Ciaran Hinds as Captain Frederick Wentworth. This film was of course shorter, but was a good overview of the story. The previous version, with Ann Firbank and Bryan Marshall in the same roles, had four hours to tell the story and moved at a more serene pace. <br /> <br /> Firbank is 10 years too old for her role, but she is very good - Marshall is excellent as Wentworth, a man disappointed by love and bitter for interference. And hidden in the cast are people who also contribute - Michael Culver, later seen at Cadfael, under the name of Harvill; Richard Vernon, later to be found in the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, as Admiral Croft; Noel Dyson, previously in Coronation Street, as Mrs. Musgrove. <br /> <br /> One of my critics is that the hairstyles are a bit awkward and the costumes are awful! Nevertheless, this should not interfere with an extremely pleasant adaptation of Austen.
