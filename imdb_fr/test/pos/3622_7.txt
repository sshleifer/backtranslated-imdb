Spike Milligan's books and plays have defeated filmmakers over the years, and Puckoon's 2002 is unfortunately no exception. The novel, which dates from 1924, concerns the partition of Ireland, particularly its effects on a solitary community (the "Puckoon" title). Due to a colossal error, half of the village is now in Northern Ireland, the other half in the Republic. The inhabitants go to the toilets at the bottom of their gardens to find a fence of barbed wire blocking their way. The drinkers crowd like sardines in a corner of the pub to enjoy a cheaper pint. A dead person must have a passport bearing his name before the villagers can go to the cemetery to bury him. <br /> <br /> "Puckoon" is a kind of Irish "Under Milk Wood" with comic characters and surreal events. abundance. The main character, Dan Milligan (renamed "Madigan" in the film) is badly played by Sean Hughes and converses with the narrator (Richard Attenborough). Milo O'Shea, Griff Rhys Jones, David Kelly (Robin's Nest), Freddie Jones, Joe McGann and Elliott Gould are also in the film. <br /> <br /> Interviewed for the "Making of" documentary Puckoon, writer / director Terence Ryan expressed an eternal admiration for the book. It shows on the screen. But, alas, like the unfortunate film of The Hiker's Galaxy Guide, a good book does not necessarily make a good movie. The problem with 'Puckoon' is that, like other Milligan books, they just do not work on the big screen. "Puckoon" is essentially a collection of jokes in search of a plot. <br /> <br /> It's impossible to compare the film to train wrecks like "Sex Lives Of The Potato Men", "Fat Slags" and "Lesbian Vampire Killers", but then it's not as good The last half hour was marked by the police, the British army and some locals who hid explosives in a coffin, which is very tedious. to the book is the main reason for its failure as a film. <br /> <br /> The other problem is the total lack of charm. 'Waking Ned' had a lot, while the TV series' Father Ted was far more funny Spike lived long enough to see the film and apparently enjoyed it, his daughter, Jane, is Madigan's wife. <br /> <br /> The highlight for me, however, was was the quote from the beginning: "It does not bother me to die!" said Spike: "I do not do that 'do not want to be there when it happens! ".
