These critics need to find a new job !!! This film is based on a true story, which made history. It illustrates admirably how, even in the fog of war and tragedy, love can conquer all. The breathtaking Chephallonia of Greece captured my heart and soul as if I too were there. The Blue Eyed Cage and the delicious Cruz were incredible! Together, they perfectly described how a Mediterranean couple can only get closer in time of war. This film will touch your heart like mine you have to go see it !!!!
