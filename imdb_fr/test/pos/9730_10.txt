This is probably one of my favorite so far, although I have the first one and have seen Curse, Legacy and vs. Demonic Toys. The only better than this one is PM vs. DT. The curse is the worst of the series, superior to the first, then to his legacy. I recommend people to see this and vs DT. Those who say it stinks are so wrong, the story is well written and it's a cute movie. It's a classic movie that even the youngest kids can watch and not be so scared looking at others. Well, here is my review, you can call me Gipdac (it's easy to know where it comes from: 101 Dalmatians series, you can watch it on Toon Disney at 4:00). Oh and do not laugh, I'm a guy, you'll see more of my critics in due course. If you want to know why I'm looking at it? I'm 12 years old! Tip: take a mental meal, arrrrooooooooo! I also agree with you, first subject, but people who love others, because they are more exciting than horror and puppets are made to look more scary. Also, you can call me Gipdac.
