The film is certainly not perfect, but despite that, it is very fun and fun to watch. I am the first to admit that Victor Fox is not really attractive and that his music and style are rather tacky. I also agree that the film has strange distractions and that some scenes do not work well. So what? If it makes you smile and you like it, do not care? Does each film have a meaning? Does each film have to be perfect? No. A person could be shaved by admitting that she loves this movie. Once again, so what? There are adorable characters, it's well shot, the acting is generally good, it never gets too much maudlin or dramatic, it's weird. Look how many people love I Dream of Jeannie. Is it perfect? Damn no! And even if it's very different, I advise you to check and you will be in a good mood after seeing it.
