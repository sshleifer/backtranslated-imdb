There must have been a sale on this story in the 40s. An epidemic threatens New York (it's still New York) and no one takes it seriously. Some might say that Richard Widmark and Jack Palance did it better in Panic in the Streets, but I do not agree. <br /> <br /> There is always something in these Poverty Row productions that really touches a nerve. The production values ​​are never so perfect and the acting is a little rough, but that's the very reason why I think this movie and those that look like it are effective. Rough, grainy, edgy. And the casting. All the second actors or actors on the list have passed their peak. No ego here. These people were happy to have the job. Whit Bissell, Carl Benton Reid, Jim Backus, Arthur Space, Charles Korvin and the melodious voice of Reed Hadley sinking in the background like crude oil. By the way, I went to the hospital several times. how come my nurses never looked like Dorothy Malone? In this kind of movies, they do not interfere much with makeup and hair, but they really managed to turn Evelyn Keyes into a witch. Or maybe they simply skipped makeup and hair. In any case, it was rather effective. She plays the role of a jewel-smuggler who picks up a case of smallpox in Cuba while smuggling jewels for the ultra-bad Charles Korvin (who, in the meantime, hurts his sister) . Customs officers are looking for her because of jewelry and the Department of Health looking for her because she is about to depopulate New York. No fourth amendment right here. Everyone is bothered. <br /> <br /> You have to have the right attitude to enjoy a movie like this. I have a brother who scours movies to death. If they do not meet Orson Wellian standards, he bombards them without mercy. They must have excellence in making a film by David Lean, the score of Wolfgang von Korngold, the sound and art of Douglas Shearer and Cedric Gibbons, respectively. It's not that. <br /> <br /> But I have the right attitude and if you do the same, you'll love this movie.
