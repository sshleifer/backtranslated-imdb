It was a fantastic movie! I like to watch again and again. The actors were great. The film kept me on the edge of my seat. I would recommend this movie to anyone. I wish Lifetime to put this film on DVD. I would definitely buy a copy. This movie just proves that you have to be very careful about who you are linked to. You may think you know someone, but you never know. My daughter watched the movie with me. She thought it was great. All I know is that I will watch this movie every time Lifetime releases it. I wish Lifetime to redo the movie, but use the same actors and display it on the big screen.
