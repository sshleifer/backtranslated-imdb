GZSZ is the longest daily soap in Germany and cult! I started watching it from the first day and became addicted from the start. Over the years, many things have changed, old characters like Heiko, Elke, Tina, Saskia, etc. are gone, and new ones have appeared, such as Mary, Kai, Cora or John. I must say that I liked GZSZ better in the years 1995-2000 because today, the series is too focused on the young characters. My favorite character is Sonja Wiebe because she is the most intriguing person ever on this soap opera and she is also one of the most interesting characters in the series. Tina Bordihn was excellent as the first Sonja, but as Tokessa became Sonja's redesign, the character improved again.
