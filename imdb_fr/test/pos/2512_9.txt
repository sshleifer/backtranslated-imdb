This film appears quite often on the cable channels and, I see that I watch it again and again. The performances are fantastic, and the material is so exciting that there is always something new to remember from the movie. <br /> <br /> Maybe I'm too often distracted when I watch movies at home, you know the exercise, the dogs bark, the phone rings, the popcorn ends during the credits. But this film talks about people and what motivates us, what drives us, what causes divisions between us and what inspires us. <br /> <br /> For me, movies like The Love Letter put me at risk for new movies. Frankly, I'm surprised that the film is not better known. I would love to see Blythe Danner and Geraldine McEwan in many other roles. They are a pleasure to watch. Kate Capshaw is beautiful and I had no idea what she would be like. Ellen DeGeneres plays a much more complex role than simple comic relief. <br /> <br /> This film provides interesting visual elements that constitute an appropriate background for the characters and their interactions. I find it refreshing every time I take the time to look at it.
