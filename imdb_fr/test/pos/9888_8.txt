I saw this film last night at the Phila. Film Festival. It was an interesting and amusing film with endearing and moving scenes. Peter Falk was excellent, as was the rest of the cast. They were credible and played their roles well. The film may have been a bit long and the conclusion was satisfactory. The audience laughed in the right places. The family dynamics were great and although it was a Jewish family, it could have been Italian, Irish or other, including Greek. I recommend this film if you are interested in laughing at a subject that is not often treated that way. IOT makes you think about the consequences of your actions and how they affect others in your life and those that are not clear.
