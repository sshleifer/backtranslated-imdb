First of all, I would like to start by saying that it is a refreshing start to see a British drama that finally seems credible. <br /> <br /> Patrick Stewart plays the role of justice (Ian Hood), government scientific adviser, with his constant and unwavering views on authority and his thoughts on the future of science in the "world" real "and his feelings. to be used or abused by others. <br /> <br /> Not only is the cast carefully maintained throughout the series, but the characters seem more believable than most other British dramas. <br /> <br /> Ashley Jensen also offers a first-rate performance as a bodyguard named by Dr. Hood (Rachael Young), she brings a refreshing vision of the unscientific and indifferent scientific view of science daily. Some very fun and memorable moments between them. <br /> <br /> The way the series keeps all the scientific elements more realistic I Find a positive character and more attractive than the psychological book we are so used to in other television series Fiction or Science Fiction. <br /> <br /> There are however some notable disappointments with the series, every time an episode ends, I'm disappointed not to have seemed to cover every aspect of the plot and sometimes leave open stories not fenced. <br /> <br /> Keeping in mind that this is still the first series, I hope we will see a return to form in the near future where these open stories can finally be concluded significant that they rightly deserve. <br /> <br /> For fans of science-related, slow-paced intrigues, this is the perfect show to watch as it always manages to stay believable and more importantly.
