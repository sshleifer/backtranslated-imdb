I was really surprised when I saw this movie for the first time directed by Iain Softley; it differs in many ways from the usual mass production in Hollywood. The plot itself is simple: Kevin Spacey plays the role of a patient suffering from Prot, who claims to belong to the planet K-pax and who arrived on Earth by a beam of light, while Dr. Powell, interpreted by Jeff Bridges, helps him solve his illusions. .. First of all, I have to admit that the cast is perfectly chosen: Kevin Spacey is really brilliant in describing the intriguing character of Prot, always walking in the line of demarcation to convince us of his reality and then make us wonder he is delusional. or not ... Some of the gem scenes include the one where Prot innocently eats all the banana (even the chime) during a session with Dr. Powell; or the scene of the observatory where he confidently shows his knowledge of the K-Pax system to astonished astronomers ... Jeff Bridges, meanwhile, is the subtle and rational side of this film, which he delivers perfectly. There are many other excellent actors (like Ernie, the convincing director of Saul Williams) that make this movie really work. <br /> <br /> K-pax has it all, comedy elements; Sci-Fi, same psychological thriller (concerning the identity of the Prot), but above all, it can be classified as a comforting drama. The main premise of the film is quite complex, but the director never lets go of it, it always keeps it credible and yet interpretable in both directions. The camera and photography play an almost crucial role here. This is the main idea of ​​the journey of light. We focus a lot on the shadow-light game and the light settings. One of the memorable scenes is where Dr. Powell holds a crystal figure in his office that refracts the light in a beautiful way while he suspects the whole time the idea may be true? <br /> <br /> Subtle and slow, intriguing and enjoyable, K-pax is truly a jewel to watch, a film of its kind that may not suit all tastes, but those who see it - could fall in love with it.
