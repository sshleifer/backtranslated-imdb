Running out of time is somewhere in the middle of Johnny To's cannon, in the "good guys" category. As a crime thriller, it's not terribly original or overwhelming and the action scenes will not take you away, but there's more to it. It's a Johnny. After all, he has to film. <br /> <br /> Andy Lau has 72 hours to live. He decides to play a strange game of cat and mouse with a negotiator hostage of the Hong Kong police, played by Lau Ching Wan. It's the plot in one word. On top of that, stack layers of meanders that keep an interesting procedure. He sometimes becomes too complicated for himself but never lets him make the most of it. However, just when Johnny To is about to hand over a smooth, well-made detective film (which, let's face it, is worth a dozen dollars), it slips in bits and pieces that bring to life a revival , bringing the soul and heart of a well oiled skeleton. <br /> <br /> The concepts of synchronism and minimalism (basic elements in his work) are explored with great impact. Always subtle, let the images speak for themselves, giving them time to develop with long and slow shots, exemplary cuttings, everything is there. A little love affair on a bus between Andy Lau and a girl is one of the highlights of the film and part of the "heart" I'm talking about. So simple but so powerful. Ditto for the car scenes of Lau and Lau Ching Wan and for the confrontation in the bowling alley. <br /> <br /> However, something prevents me from claiming that Running Out of Time is a masterpiece. He has all the abilities and know-how up to a notch, but he can also be too hard-working or bland at the same time. When he's good, he's really good. There are even isolated moments of pure brilliance that are TOO good for their own good, leaving a bittersweet aftertaste for the rest of the film. I am convinced that if he puts his heart into it, he can make a very good movie. In this case, it is another of his films that is flawed but enjoyable. Under the astute style of HK, it's black humor and sincere drama that make it a compelling film. It's worth watching, definitely.
