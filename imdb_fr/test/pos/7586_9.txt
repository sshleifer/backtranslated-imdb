I have seen more than 2000 Studio-Era sound films, including many of Deanna Durbin's Judy Garland, Lena Horne, Shirley Jones and Universal, as well as a decent amount of musicals and operas recorded in live and in studio. And I assure you that no one is responsible for singing in front of a camera and a microphone, or maybe anywhere ever, ALWAYS TOUCHED THE SOLO OF DURBIN here ... mono soundtrack and crap microphones from the 1930's and the rest. The Canadian girl sings this piece of "Il Bacio" as if she lived and wrote herself and then found herself for a retrospective in Italy late in her career, not like a child who learned it from her music teacher. <Br /> <br /> If you pass this Extra on the DVD - or if you switch to Garland Solo - you are staving off, because this cheap MGM teaser has just captured one of the greatest performances of the 20c.
