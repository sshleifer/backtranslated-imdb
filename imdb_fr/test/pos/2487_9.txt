Punishment Park is a pseudo-documentary directed by Peter Watkins. The premise is that dissidents of the nation (hippies, musicians, protesters, pacifists, etc.) are arrested and tried by a court, then sentenced to imprisonment or to the management of the Park of Punishment. It is an exhausting trek of 52 km across the desert to an American flag, followed by the police, the National Guard and various other authorities. The idea is that if you reach the flag, you are released. The court consists of a group of conservative types, condemning all the behaviors that do not look like theirs, and there is no result except a jail sentence or the option of "Punishment Park" for those who are in process. There are many things in this that still sound true today, which is quite disturbing in itself. Water is promised to the mid-course runners, which is not true, and the following officials are mostly a sadistic group that does not want to train much. It's not a very graphic film, but its ideas and themes are more shocking than anything else. The scary thing is, it could happen. Not a very optimistic film but to see absolutely. Warning: this could make you angry. 9 out of 10
