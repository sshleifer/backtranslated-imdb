This film is all that Tenacious D fans can hope for. Director Liam Lynch in partnership with The "D" is a mix of epic proportions. Of course, you have to understand the humor and format of Tenacious D. When I saw it, the audience did not laugh too much, but the reason is not a lack of humor or intelligent jokes. This film seems to have been made public by an unsuspecting public who has not been familiar with the musical duo. This film stays true to its roots. For the few of you who have seen the HBO TV series and heard the album, they have not forgotten what their audience likes. As in the TV show, we noticed in the trailer scenes of JB and KG apartments and, of course, the microphone nights open at the beginning and end of each episode of Tenacious D. The soundtrack is phenomenal and every song carries you away. <br /> <br /> ... And Dave Grohl plays a fantastic devil. <br /> <br /> This is the perfect movie for those looking for a hard time and rocking musical.
