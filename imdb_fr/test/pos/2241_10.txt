This is one of the best episodes of Doctor Who EVER. We have the Cybermen, the Cyber ​​Conversion units (may scare young children) and the rude doctor doing one of his best acts. Well done David Tennant. Good scenes as if it were a movie, with thrilling scenes in some streets, an invasion of Cyberman's base and leave the world different from ours, basically a 45-minute movie. <br /> <br /> Being Part 2 of Rise of the Cybermen, this will never disappoint. The Doctor plus an evil enemy (Daleks, Cybermen, Master, Sontarans, Davros, Autons or even Macra) is a battle to the death, just be careful with the young children who watch this.
