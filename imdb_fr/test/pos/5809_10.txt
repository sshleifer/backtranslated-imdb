Years ago, with "Ray of Light", Madonna reached a truly incredible artistic level. Since then, she has sometimes exceeded her own standards. This production of concerts, with its hypnotic montage, amazing dances, hallucinatory light effects and trance-inducing arrangements, goes a long way. Madonna's apparent ambition - bringing peace alone to the world through music and dance - may seem absurd or absurd to some. But damn it, someone has to do it! Thanks to the combination of the remarkable talent of everyone involved in this production, "Confessions Tour Live from London" once again places it among the ten most prestigious artists in the world, whatever their medium.
