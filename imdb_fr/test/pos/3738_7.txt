Eichard Gere & Diane Lane are back in another romantic love story. It's a great team, BUT in a way, this film will not be among the best, <br /> <br /> Director George Wolfe uses a script by Ann Peacock & John Romanao for Nicholas's novel Sparks and does a remarkable job. It's another story of two strangers meeting and falling in love with each other, then they go, then when they are about to meet again and start a life together. <br /> <br /> SPOILER but not really. The tragedy occurs, one of them dies. <br /> <br /> How many times have we seen this before? <br /> <br /> Those who have never seen tear-men like this one will love him more than me. This story has almost all the clich√©s. <br /> <br /> The only reason this has the notes I'm going to give it. is because of the acting quality and excellent production. The cast, in addition to our 2 stars, includes Christopher Meloni, Viola Davis and Scott Glenn. they all give good performances and do the best with the equipment they have been given. <br /> <br /> There is a good storm sequence, but not over, The sex scenes are well prepared, without nudity and almost without fault language, <br /> <br /> Notes: ** * (of 4) 82 points (out of 100) IMDb 7 out of 10)
