This film, based on Gerrit Wolfaardt's true story, is one of the best films I've seen about race relations in South Africa; a very good history lesson of the turmoil of the 80s in South Africa. I place it in the scale of American history X as to how a young man can be seduced by the Aryan doctrine and how the "certain" segments of the Christian church have taught a false doctrine concerning the race to justify an injustice. <br /> <br /> It is a strong message of forgiveness and redemption, rare in today's movies. The violence is well done to show the gravity of Gerrit's crimes and the grandeur of his transformation. <br /> <br /> A word about Jan Ellis who played the role of Gerrit Wolfaardt. It transports you into the darkness of Gerrit's beginnings towards his enlightened transformation. He went to dark places as an actor and must be commended for his performance. <br /> <br /> Another remarkable performance was that of Mpho Lovinga, who plays the role of Moses Moremi, a victim of Gerrit's crimes. He was able to pull some places of pain that really touched you by watching his performance. <br /> <br /> Very good movie to show to teens.
