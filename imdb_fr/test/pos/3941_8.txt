are you crazy? this film has talent that are you to criticize a film that was made by famous directors and producers? I mean you have to watch a rotten version because if you had a correct version, you would not think it's low resolution game graphics. <br /> <br /> This movie is for fans of hongkong cinema on the other side of what Asian people like to watch ... you're so overwhelmed ... hongkong cinema is totally different from Hollywood cinema, hk cinema is a class apart ... so if you do not like to watch Hong Kong producers' movies do not let yourself understand how much time it is to watch ... just let others enjoy the movie .. <br /> <br /> and personally, I saw this movie and I love its story and the way it was made ..
