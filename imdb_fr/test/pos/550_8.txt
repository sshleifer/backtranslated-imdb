My summary in one line suggests that it's not a good movie, but it's not true. I liked the movie, but I was probably expecting too much. <br /> <br /> Adele, who is steadily portrayed by Susan Sarandon, has not turned out to be a very likeable character. She is unstable and irresponsible to a point that would be unforgivable if not for the enormous love she has for her daughter. That's the only thing she can do without fail. Adele's daughter, Anna, is a sad girl who is so busy filling in her mother's gaps that she does not seem to be between 14 and 17 years old. Naturally, this makes Natalie Portman the perfect choice to play Anna because she never seems to be between 14 and 17 years old either. Portman assumes this role with such ease that you almost forget that she has not shot movies for 20 years. Yet, even with two strong leads, Wayne Wang never seems to attract the audience as he did with The Joy Luck Luck and more with Smoke. Although I have not read the book, the film feels as if it has made the necessary changes to the story to make it appear on the big screen, changes that could clear the pungent character of the story. I enjoyed the movie for the pleasure of watching two wonderful actresses do their work, but I never got lost in the experience and I never told their fate.
