I really enjoyed this movie - I like prison movies in general (I do not know why - I'm sure a psychiatrist can get something out of it!) I spent a night in prison there is more of 20 years old and I knew then I would never go back - I had the individual version of "Fear all right"! (I locked myself in an isolated cell of Alcatraz for a few hours, with the compliments of a ranger, but that's another story!) Anyway, the genre really interests me. The soundtrack, especially "Sympathy for the Devil" of the Rolling Stones, was the perfect backdrop for the film. To this day, I think of "The Jericho Mile" every time I hear the song.
