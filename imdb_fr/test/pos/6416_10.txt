In the last days of 1999, most people in Taiwan died. A strange plague delighted the island. Supposedly transmitted by cockroaches, the disease sends its victims into a psychosis where they act as insects. Finally, they die. The Hole takes place in a building in ruins (particularly well created, congratulations to the decorator!). His two protagonists live one above the other. The woman is on the lower floor and the pipes above her apartment are fleeing violently, threatening to destroy her food supply, not to mention her sanity. She calls a plumber to check it and accidentally makes a hole in the floor of the man's apartment. The two have never met before and they come into contact through the hole. <br /> <br /> The scenario is pretty brilliant. Few films are both amusing and completely human, exploring in depth the human condition, especially feelings of loneliness and despair. The management of Tsai is simply beautiful. Like many other Taiwanese directors, he uses a lot of long shots. But unlike, say, Hou Hsiao-Hsien, Tsai does not use them excessively. In fact, I do not know if I've seen them used better. They are always effective and never tedious. <br /> <br /> It would be wrong to review this film without mentioning the musical numbers. Yes, The Hole is also music and excellent music. In the best scenes of the film - which says something, given the quality of all the other scenes - the man imagines that the woman is a singer, almost a cabaret singer. These numbers are entirely choreographed, often with dancers and auxiliary singers. In a stroke of genius, Tsai makes sure that these elaborate numbers unfold in the ruined building, the signs of apocalypse and undisguised decay. This provides both a pathetic sense and an absurdity. <br /> <br /> The Hole is a film that deserves to be seen. It should be a cult classic, if nothing else. Before going to see this, I was told it was a decent movie, but probably the worst of Tsai Ming-liang. Well, if that's true, I'm looking forward to seeing another one! 10/10.
