Become the most expensive film ever made in the Czech Republic, it automatically thinks that it will be overexploited and clich√© (for fear of the budget). However, with a budget of 8 million euros and half the film in English, it was not really a big-budget, high-risk film. <br /> <br /> What we have a great epic tale centered on the friendship of two people, the youngest Karel and the old Frantisek. As pilots in the Czech Air Force when the Germans invaded before the start of the Second World War, they left the country to go to England and joined the RAF. <br /> <br /> Their friendship is put to the test by the love of the same woman. However, there is a bond of friendship that goes beyond simply being friendly. Their friendship is an elegant metaphor for the attitude of the Czech people and their country. Remember that they were not the winners, the defeated Germans can only be invaded by the Russians. <br /> <br /> Fun, exciting, intriguing, beautiful, sad and enlightening, this movie is one of my favorite war movies. I especially like the way they make fun of the British in an incredibly affectionate way and that gives an amazing glimpse of how the British army fought the Second World War. <br /> <br /> Forget the recent American efforts (Peal Harbor, Saving Private Ryan), it's the best movie of the Second World War over a long period.
