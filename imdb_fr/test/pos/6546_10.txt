This is one of my favorite movies of all time, if you are not in cars, then forget it !! This film features one of Australia's biggest muscular cars, the XYGTHO. Yeah so the acting game is not the best - it was never done to win an Oscar. The action in the car will keep you more and more. There's a great collection of muscle cars dating back to the '70s and an Awesome '57 Chev - with a really cool cat driving it! There is also a really nice song sung by Terry Serio, the main actor. The acting game is quite funny when you take it lightly, but the smokin and drag racing tires are the main focus of this movie. Large fast steel cars (NO PLASTIC CARS), and some pretty slippery streets. I recommend it only to people who love cars and not to those looking for great acting.
