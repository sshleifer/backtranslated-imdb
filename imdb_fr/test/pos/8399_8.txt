After reading and watching Gone With The Wind, I found it very difficult not to compare this movie to the original. Although I thought that Scarlett, the novel, was superb, the film did not succeed. It was a completely different story. Of course, there will never be Scarlett and Rhett other than Leigh and Gable, but the new actors have worked well. I loved how the book and the movie ended the story of Gon With the Wind, because after reading it, I felt a disappointment, because it had stopped and the readers were wondering what had happened. Scarlett finishes the story very well and Alexandra Ripley did a great job on the book. I just want the film to follow the story even more, even if it's great in itself.
