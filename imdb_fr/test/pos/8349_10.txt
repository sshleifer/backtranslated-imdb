Since I watched the trailer for the DVD "The Little Mermaid II: Back to the Sea", I had the feeling that this movie would be great because I'm a big fan of Disney. And guess what? I am right! This film is a worthy successor to the original classic "Lady and the Tramp". <br /> <br /> It tells the story of Scamp, the malicious son of Lady and Tramp, who wants to be wild and free instead of living a dog's life. Although the film may not be as good as the first, it has an excellent moral that you could not find anywhere else before watching it. <br /> <br /> I admit that the film is not suitable for everyone, but those of you who hate it, all I can say is that you do not have mind for that and I suggest you do not go see him again. But hello! It's a really great story, packed with animations, music and brilliant vocals featuring Scott Wolf (Party of Five) and Alyssa Milano (Charmed). So, if you have not seen the movie, why stay there? Go take the copy !!!
