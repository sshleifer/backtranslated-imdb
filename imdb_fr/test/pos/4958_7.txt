I'm sorry, but I can not help it, I love watching Iron Eagle. Now, do not get me wrong, I'm not saying it's a great movie. No, I'd rather say it's an endless and entertaining film. For the people who cut this film into pieces to be unrealistic, they are a little late. Of course, the Iron Eagle plot was ridiculous. But I think his target audience was kids, and I remember thinking it was cool when I was little. Now, I find it amusing as a guilty pleasure, a bit like Road House. This film is part of the great pantheon of films on the power structure of adults for children, inspired by the 80s. You must remember D.A.R.Y.L, Real Genius, E.T., etc. If you ask me, watching Doug and Knotcher "Ride the Snake" at the beginning is worth the cost of the DVD. All this sequence was so STUPID! But, at the same time, it was hilarious, funny, totally 80s, all these good things. Iron Eagle is a big guilty pleasure of the 80s. The hairstyles, the dance, the music, the dialogues, everything is funny like hell. I have Iron Eagle on DVD and for me it was totally $ 9.99 at Best Buy. If you like to laugh at watching dated and unrealistic action movies, this one is a must. Oh yes, and I think his plot was only slightly stupider than the other 1986 fighter pilot action movie, Top Gun.
