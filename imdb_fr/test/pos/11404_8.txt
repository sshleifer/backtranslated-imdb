I was skeptical before going because of the horribly assembled trailer that made it look like an equally horrible film. I was pleasantly surprised by the fact that I did not waste my money. I think the success of the movies comes from the way it is scary and the environment of the house. Small things like sensor lights create a real discomfort. The shadows and the cold feeling of the house make it easy to say that no matter how much you know about horror movies, anything can happen in the movie. The acting is far from perfect, they were not bad either. The main character is convincing, even considering the annoying dramas for teenagers around him. In the end, the movie impressed me a lot. <br /> <br /> This is definitely a movie I would recommend.
