This film talks about Viola (Amanda Bynes) and her quest to defeat the boys 'team at her school in Cornwell after eliminating the girls' team. She goes to rival Illaria school and joins the men's team. She falls for Duke (Channing Tatum) who thinks he is a guy and loves Olivia (Laura Ramsey) who loves Viola as her brother. <br /> <br /> I was in a version of the room of the 12th evening and the beginning was very modern. So, I knew the game well. I was very excited to see this movie and when I saw it, it exceeded my expectations. He kept many of my favorite lines and I could see great connections to the room. Although it was like the game, it was not so complicated. It was also more of a girls' movie than I expected, but it was good. It was very funny. It takes you into a lot of love stories and crazy lies. You've seen how Alto (Amanda Bynes) mistakenly thought about what guys think and its complications of living in a guy's world. You also see his roommate, Duke's (Channing Tatum), get the impression. I really liked to see the characters being portrayed in a modern way. He also tells the modern theme "Follow your dreams" but this time he has a twist. I think this film was a fantastic film about a girl who loved football and who stood up for herself, her family and her dreams. I think this movie will be the big break for a lot of rising stars.
