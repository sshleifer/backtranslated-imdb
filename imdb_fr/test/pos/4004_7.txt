First, at the time I wrote this comment, I had already read what kittiwake-1 had written about this game and I was confused. This is a video game and not a real movie. I mean, I would choose a good Deniro movie myself or play a video game every day. But, man, what are you talking about? Now that I have that, let's move on, okay? The video game adaptation of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is, as you may have guessed, based on the movie of the same name. What is strange is that this film was released three years after the release of the film. Whether it's slow development time or laziness, no one really knows it. At least, I do not know. <br /> <br /> The game allows the player to play the four main characters of the film: Jen, Shu Lien, Li-Mu-Bi and Dark Cloud (whose story is a secret bonus that is unlocked for a game These four characters have fighting styles based on how they fought in the film. However, the real pleasure of the eyes lies in the gestures of escape that allow each character to avoid the attacks of the enemy in the most impossible and the most challenging of the first in the world. <br /> The story is obviously based on the story told in the film. The story of the game is told with the help of synthetic films and in a subtitled Mandarin language (a nice little touch, considering that I prefer the foreign language song of the dubbed film.) And the other characters of the movie and even (not much of a surprise, because virtually all video game adaptation has done so) changes what has officially happened in the movie for the game to have more action. I had never thought that Jade Fox would go so far as to engage. <br /> <br /> The real bonus of this story is the ability to decide the end of the game. What if Jen had all the ingredients to heal Li-Mu-Bi in her possession? What if Jen did not get her comb back? And if Li-Mu-Bi had not found the green destiny for the second time? Your actions will decide the outcome of these scenarios and the fate of the characters in this game. This is really the best feature of the game. <br /> <br /> Yet, despite all its strengths, it also has some flaws . Enemies often tend to become a nuisance after a while and the camera angle tends to be fixed on the less useful places. Even special features (which are unlocked after beating the game) are not enough to forgive such hardships imposed on the player. <br /> <br /> If you liked the movie, you can enjoy the game. However, this game is the only way to immerse yourself in a playable version of such a beautiful and amazing movie. <br /> <br /> Of course, you could have chosen a Deniro movie instead. .
