It was in September 2003 that I heard that the BBC would resurrect DOCTOR WHO and make it "bigger and better", but I had already heard these rumors in the press and thought they were all - rumors . But it was later mentioned that Russell T Davies was about to produce and write the show, and then on a Saturday afternoon in March 2004, Channel 4 news interviewed the featured actor - Christopher Eccleston . Yes, Christopher Eccleston is an actor who has always impressed me since I saw his film debut in LET HIM, and if he had been interviewed on television, it had to be true. Over the months, more and more information was leaked, Billie Piper was being screened, the Daleks would come back, and The Mill, the Hollywood effects company that created FX for GLADIATOR, had been responsible for realizing the special effects of the series. Several weeks before the first trailers announced the return of the new series, London massive billboards informed the public of the return of the series, tabloid newspapers broadcast a mass of photos of extraterrestrials and Christopher Eccleston participated in shows as diverse as BLUE PETER, MASTERMIND (who had a special edition of DOCTOR WHO night), THIS MORNING and NIGHT Friday with JOHNATHAN ROSS. In fact, this new series of DOCTOR WHO had to be the most animated show in the history of British television: it is better that it was good <br /> <br /> So it was good? No doubt it was a big hit, with almost every episode being one of the top ten shows in the charts. To give you an idea of ​​its ranking success, only one episode of the previous series (The Ark In Space, second episode - February 1975) was among the top five films on television. The opening episode of the series was ranked number three with two more episodes beating or equaling the previous record and this is at a time when competition is stronger in terms of choice and television stations. Let's laugh and applaud the fact that Dr. WHO has once again stuffed HIT ME BABY, CELEBRITY WRESTLING and manhandled ANT AND DEC on Saturday night. Of course, much of the success lies in the breathtaking images and cast of a well-known prestigious actor in the role. For the most part, everything you see on the screen here is all you will see in a Spielberg / Hollywood movie. There is a Dalek invasion force of tens of thousands, exotic extraterrestrials, a 19th century Cardiff that resembles a 19th century Cardiff and night filming which is actually a night film and is not made sticking a black filter on the screen. I promise you will hear a lot more from the directors who worked on this series. Joe Ahearne in particular will be a day in Hollywood A list <br /> <br /> The new DOCTOR WHO series has some flaws. and all should be fired from Russell T. Davies. It may be controversial whether the soap opera and the post-modernist elements are successful or not (in my opinion, this is not the case), but what is undisputed is that the scripts weaker are all written by RTD. As I mentioned in my review of CASANOVA, he deceives the public and he does the same thing here: faced with armed soldiers pointing their weapons on him, the Doctor launches a "plan of attack delta" which has no sense for the audience but allows him To escape a difficult situation, a naked Captain Jack suddenly removes a laser he hides and RTD scripts are full of this type of cheats and denouements type deus ex machina. In fact, the last episode is greatly marred by the ridiculous concept of what is the "bad wolf" that seems to have escaped RTD more than The Doctor. And endings of which I try to remember if some of them really belonged to the Doctor? More often than it is a secondary character or the doctor's companion who saves the day. The series is called DOCTOR WHO is not ROSE TYLER, so can we see the main character saving the day, as he did in the classic series? One last point about the doctor's performance is the way it was written as a smiling dive. Eccleston is best known for his serious and lugubrious roles and he is absolutely breathtaking when he shows his sorrow, like the tear that runs through him at the end of the world, but most often he is written as "Tom Baker on speed" character. Why did not Eccleston do a lot of comedy in his career? It's not very good for that <br /> <br /> Do I start to hate this show? Sorry, I did not want to, but if some expectations have been met or exceeded, others have not, and are almost all due to Russell T Davies who, fortunately, contributes less to the scenario of the next WHO DOCTOR series. . Let's see more traditional stories of a human outpost threatened by monsters, as we saw in the 1960s and 1970s, imagine a story like The Sea Devils with a huge budget headed by Joe Ahearne! Oh and one last request - can we see these "NEXT TIME" trailers dismantled? They reveal all the best pieces of the episode of next week
