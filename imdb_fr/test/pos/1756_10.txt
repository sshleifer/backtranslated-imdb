Hello again, I thought about this movie all my life. I saw it when I was 5 years old in Los Angeles, California, in 1942. What a great story to be good to each other, kindness and charity. You forget that these are the bugs in relation to each other. It was just like people. I like this movie and my grown children too. Such a beautiful color in this film. I need to see this movie again. There is a story about an envelope in the film, which I can not remember the "why". <br /> <br /> Thank you for your attention.
