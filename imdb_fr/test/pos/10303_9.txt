This is an excellent example of absolutely irreproachable, thought-provoking, moving and humorous Hollywood filming. Kevin McKidd and Paula Sage are superb. <br /> <br /> In fact, I watched it on TV late at night and I understand why I missed it at the movies. This is not the kind of film that the "mega" multi-screen cinemas broadcast nowadays, it's a shame. <br /> <br /> I'm going to get the DVD. Not for those who prefer, the current trend to special effects and no history. If you liked the bestseller "The curious incident of the dog at night", this film will please you. <br /> <br /> This film is one of the best Scottish films, such as "Small Faces" and "trainspotting". All movies in which Kevin McKidd also plays. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
