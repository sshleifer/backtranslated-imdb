I do not understand how people could not like this movie. You have Gossit Jr., the kid who played the main character of Stand By Me, Sean Astin and many other great actors. A lot of action and fun that you do not see anymore in today's movies. It's a shame. <br /> <br /> This is an underrated film that is part of other great movies like Let's Get Harry. The 80s and early 90s created such great films that will never be overtaken by current standards. <br /> <br /> They tried somehow to recreate this film in Masterminds, but they had problems acting. Patrick Stewart was the only thing the film had to shoot, but obviously that was not enough.
