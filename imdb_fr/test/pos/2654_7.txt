"2001: An Odyssey of Space" is planned for 2001 and the main character is HAL. A computer. That's right, a computer that speaks and thinks alone. This was done in 1968 and think that in 2001 it would be conceivable that computers talk, it's a joke. If it was in 3064, a talking computer that had emotions and made its own decisions would be considered as stupid as that. There is nothing in this film that causes any kind of emotion. It causes two reactions and one is called: sleep. It starts with nothing, but a black punch for more than two minutes. Then, the first shot we see with some kind of lighting is the sequence "The Dawn of Man". So, if it's in chronological order, the darkness before that, is the birth of the world? <br /> <br /> During the sequence "The Dawn of Man", where comes a huge monolith ?? off the ground, from the sky, we will never know where it comes from, but for one reason or another, that's where it is. Apes leave Apesh! Did they find this monolith that only the man could have made, but that's the trap? the man has not evolved yet. So who made it and where did it come from? What is his goal? Monkeys find a tool. Monkeys use bones to fight a group of opposing monkeys. Monkeys with weapons are now the dominant group because they used their minds to gain an advantage. The most advanced monkeys, and especially the most intelligent and innovative monkeys, are the dominant group when they took control of the watering point. <br /> <br /> We jump quickly into space, millions of years later, where we see a lot of spaceships floating around classical music. We can see the earth, the moon, the sun, the universe and for a film made in 1968, the visual effects are amazing, but outdated. The score is legendary. Cinematography is spectacular. The editing is atrocious. There are countless shots of boxy-looking space ships floating in space for infinite duration. Once on board the ship, there is not much left to say. For an hour, Kubrick shows various shots of life in space. Kubrick shows us the life of an astronaut, which is very boring, and we understand the message perfectly. The interior and exterior spaceships are bulky and old. Remember what the first mobile phone looked like? Me too, but that's the future of 2001. All the characters have clothes and hairstyles that look like 1968. The chairs are decorated in bright red tones and have a weird shape because we all know that at In the future, we will sit in strange chairs. Computer screens are hideous and it is long before HDTV that clarity is excruciating. Looks like all the TVs are from 1968, so it's not that futuristic. Like all films made more than 20 years in advance, they have a terrible and unconvincing aspect. Just because it's Kubrick, we should not say, "Well, that's what you'd think." No I will not. Just as if I did not think a computer would talk to me in 2047. It will not happen and if someone was making a film right now, it's been 30 years and had a talking computer, thinking about laughing. the stupidity of it. Just as I did with "2001". <br /> <br /> HAL is the most animated person, shoot ?? I just called him a person. HAL is a computer, but he has more life than any of the silent characters in the movie and actually thinks he is alive. HAL is the only thing alive and he sees humans as his caretakers who look after him while he does all the work. HAL "reads" the lips of one of the rare conversations between Dave and Frank, and he "sees" that they plan to disable it. This is where the only dramatic part of the movie comes in - A battle that ensues between a red light and a guy in a spaceship trying to get into the bigger spaceship. Oh, the drama. Once HAL thinks he has the upper hand, Dave returns to the spaceship, proving the ingenuity of the man. Dave terminates HAL. HAL pleads for his life as he fades slowly, which, like everything else, seems to take forever. <br /> <br /> The final act is as tedious as the first two. Once again, the monolith found by the monkeys appears at the end. He comes from nowhere, again. Then a baby is born in a placenta-like shield overlooking the Earth from space. What does Kubrick say? Is it transformation? Dave to a baby? Does man evolve again? Does Kubrick say it's the end of the man and the beginning of ?? whatever this extraterrestrial thing? Maybe I'm going crazy trying to figure out what this crazy director is trying to say, but the more I think, the more the beginning and the end make sense. There are so many unanswered questions, especially regarding the monolith. If you can get through the film, it should be thought provoking. <br /> <br /> In the end, the film struggles to get where it wants. The first act and the third acts are strong, but the second act meanders, hovering in the same place for what seems to be an eternity. There are intriguing things in the movie that will provoke a reflection if you give it a chance. Once the beginning of the film makes sense, the end works much better, even if you still do not understand what Kubrick is trying to say, which I do not do.
