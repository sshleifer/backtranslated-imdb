With the success of "Rebel Without a Cause", a tidal wave of teen movies has appeared. We can say that it is one of the best. A very young McArthur excels here as a teenager not too troubled. The story focuses more on the perceptions of delinquency than on any traumatic event. The support cast is memorable, Frankenheimer heads as an old pro. Just a story of a young man who finds that others take his actions far too seriously.
