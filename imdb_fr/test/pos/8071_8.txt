Some would argue that Argentinian director Esteban Sapir's Antena is an anachronistic futility exercise; that, if the silent films to which Sapir pays homage were at the forefront of cinema when they were shot, they are outdated today, leaving La Antena an insignificant singularity. I do not agree. Fervently. Antena merges silent film conventions with 21st century technology, making it the ultimate exercise in post-modern filmmaking. <br /> <br /> The film takes place in the timeless "The City without voice", so called because citizens were left speechless by Mr. TV, a dictator / media mogul with his hair painted. The city resembles that of the seminal metropolis of Fritz Lang (1927), perhaps 100 years before this film. They are all skyscrapers, television antennas and expressionist animation panels. <br /> <br /> The inhabitants of the city are relieved by La Voz (The voice), the only person to whom the word is offered. Voz is forced to sing on Mr. TV's television channel, his face still being covered by a hood (kept even when she is naked). But when Mr. TV also devised a plan to steal the writing, La Voz and his son without eyes joined a renegade family to try to give the people freedom of speech. <br /> <br /> Antena is nothing but pure cinema. Anxious to respect the conventions of the silent film, Sapir must rely on images to tell his story. There is sound, especially in the almost continuous score of Leo Sujatovich. It evokes the best of silent film music, as well as the inherent ingenuity inherent in the dieg√®se of the film, such as the beep of car horns or the rhythmic rhythm of gunfire. And the whole movie hides under a familiar roar, as if it were shown on an old projector. <br /> <br /> There is also a lot of dialogue. But instead of using intertitles, Sapir brings out the characters' words in the frame. They are bigger or smaller, filling the screen or floating gently in the air, depending on what is being said. Think of a more imaginative version of the subtitles in Night Watch (2004). <br /> <br /> Fortunately, words do not hijack images. Which is really a chance, because La Antena has some of the most creative and original images ever seen, all captured by the sumptuous black and white photography of Cristian Cottet. There are expressionist urban landscapes. The hooded singer and her son without eyes. There is the abandoned antenna of the city, which looks like the rotting remains of a colossal spider. And there's the sinister Dr. Y, whose talkative mouth is displayed on a television screen hanging on his face. <br /> <br /> La Antena is reproached for having relied too much on her images while skirting on the allegorical depth. But, again, I do not agree. It is true that the sudden appearance of a swastika-like mind control machine, or the boy without eyes that seems crucified on a Star of David, seems out of place, a bit above a well-built fairy story. <br /> <br /> But the absence of obvious symbols (with the exception of the two previous examples) plays in favor of the film. This allows us to make our own idea: to decide to infer a political sense, to consider The Antena as an allegory of fascism, the danger of capitalist monopolies, the power and responsibility of the media; or simply take the film for cash, as a visually stunning adventure in a world both unique and familiar. <br /> <br /> The sacrifice of an explicit depth in favor of a single imagery may seem like a compromise. But, really, when a movie looks so good, it's hard to care. There is more imagination and art in every part of La Antena than Hollywood can shake a drifting stick. To conjure up almost 100-year-old films can be futile, but in doing so, Sapir may show us what is missing from today's movies. He may be telling us that the time has come for another artistic revolution. And he may be right.
