I attended the premiere of this film at the 2005 Phoenix Film Festival and was very impressed by the talent of the director, Jeff Hare, who exposed the news story on screen. The characters were perfectly integrated and allowed us to examine in a very warm and humorous way the question of a superior wishing to die "on his own terms". Peter Falk was brilliant as Morris and the support group of family members and friends was perfectly interpreted in his roles. The interaction of family, friends and strangers with Morris has created a realistic vision of how families are addressing the issue of their parents' aging and their desire to die with dignity. <br /> <br /> Although this film is ostensibly a movie Jewish actor and his family, it's really a film about all families. The jokes that the family and Morris have cracked during this adventure through the life of a "Force of Nature" are fresh and realistic. Childhood rivalries, adult successes and failures, and children's hope are integral to this scenario. While many will wonder how to make the topic of suicide "humorous", I thought the treatment was logical and timely. If you are not afraid to shed some tears or laugh at the whims of a family struggling with this problem, you MUST SEE THIS FILM. <br /> <br /> The film was awarded the "Best Film" at the Phoenix Film Festival.
