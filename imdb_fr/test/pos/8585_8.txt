Being myself Belgian, I am interested in the history of Congo. It's our only colony for many years (Rwanda was a Belgian protectorate, but not a colony) and that's part of the history of our country. Nowadays, it seems very common to say that everything the Belgians did in Congo was wrong, especially in the 19th century. I'm not saying that bad things did not happen. Of course, they did, but at the time, it was not abnormal. Do you really think that the French or the British were much nicer in their colonies? No, they were not. At the time, it was "normal" for our King Leopold II to use the Congo to make money. It was his private property (it did not belong to the state at the time) and he tried to make the most of it. Of course, abominable things, like being cut off, have happened and, if the current standards are unacceptable, at the time, it was common practice. And it must be said, all this has not happened in recent decades ... I know several people who lived in Congo for many years before the declaration of independence of the Congo. It's true that they had several black servants, but they are very nice people and I really can not imagine that they have already treated them badly. As far as I know, they have always treated them with great respect (however, I do not say that all Belgians have done so). In fact, if they were not old (almost 80 years old now), they would like to return to the Congo. <br /> <br /> The advantage of this film is that it gives a historically accurate view of what happened during the last years of Belgian governance and the early years of Congolese independence. The story is not so black and white (maybe not the best words in this context, but how else to explain what I mean), as I feared. This does not mean that everything the Belgians did was wrong and that all the Congolese did good. This shows to what extent the Congolese, in their haste to become independent of the Belgians, accepted without reserve the help of the Russians and the Americans, who were both more interested in raw materials such as copper, diamonds, bauxite , the rubber. , ... and to place the Congolese in their political "camp" and were not so interested in their independence. This not only gives a good idea of ​​how Lumumba has become more powerful, but also of how Mobutu played a dual role. This shows the Belgian reaction to some of our compatriots who were raped, threatened and even murdered (my father was one of the paratroopers who were sent to Congo to rescue the Belgians). This gives a good idea of ​​the political problems that Lumumba encountered because the province of Katanga did not want to be part of the Congolese Republic, the role that the Belgians played in the assassination of Lumumba ... all this is part of the film. <br /> <br /> The story seems to be very accurate and the characters really look like real ones. This film was able to give a very good idea of ​​life in the Congo in the late fifties and early sixties and should be seen by anyone interested in the history of the country. But this should also be shown in history classes, especially in Belgium, because it is a part of our history that should never be forgotten. I give it a 7.5 / 10, maybe even an 8/10.
