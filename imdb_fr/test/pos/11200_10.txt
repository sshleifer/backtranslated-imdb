This is the latest film from a trilogy by the brilliant Turkish director, Nuri Bilge Ceylan, whose latest film, Mayis Sikintisi - very Cehovian - has been featured in prestigious film festivals. Unlike his previous films, the story of Uzak takes place in Istanbul, one of the most populous cities in the world. However, in the Ceylon film, we see only minor traces of this huge crowd. Instead, he chose to focus on two characters, a photographer and a family member who comes from his small village to find work on transatlantic ships. The photographer, who, we know, has also immigrated to the city, seems to be inhabited by the customs of urban life, and not only in the material sense. In his relationship with his parent, we first see him as a caring and tolerant being. However, when he could not find work, our suburban character begins to be disturbed because he shares his private "space" with someone whose departure date becomes ambiguous. I will not reveal the tactics he has developed to get his relative out of his life so as not to harm your greatest pleasure, but suffice it to say that Ceylon shows us the tactics we acquire in the routine of life. suburbs; 'tactics' to keep our own private space, 'tactics' so as not to communicate with other people, 'tactics' to prevent our relationships from gaining a complex nature (since our own experience, we think, is sufficiently complex) . The Ceylon film presents a clear picture of what the human being becomes within the boundaries of the modern (or postmodern?) city by describing the two characters in different ways. But he does not condemn any of the two characters for that, but instead uses cinematographic language to emphasize this difference. For example, looking for new opportunities, we always see the character coming from the village in open spaces. Even inside the house, he prefers the balcony as the preferred space. On the other hand, we always see the photographer in enclosed spaces and usually at home. Although there are more than 10 million people and many adventures, lots of interesting things to discover (or are there?), He prefers to stay at home, watch TV, etc. His home is like his temple, a kind of sacred place. <br /> <br /> Anyone living in a big city and aware of the lived experience, will find in Uzak something that belongs to him. If you like this film, I'm sure you'll like the other two films from Ceylon, Mayis Sikintisi (May Clouds) and Kasaba (The City). Go find them!
