It's a simple and beautiful movie about a man who is determined to find an answer, which he does not necessarily need but has structured his whole life. It's heartbreaking, it's hilarious, it's glorious, it's tormenting, it's delicate and dynamic, I say it's genius. I read Jonathan Safran Foer's book "Everything is illuminated" (mainly because I heard Elijah Wood played in the movie adaptation), and the characters delighted me. I burst out laughing more than once. And every time someone talks about what it's about, I hear the same worn out response, almost like it's a big fat word: "That's about all looking for a man who saved his grandfather from the Nazis. " Yet this story is so philosophical. It goes further than that. This conversation about the ring and "just in case". It really makes you think. Suddenly, this story merges from a simple quest to an inner metamorphosis, and I find myself looking at things a little differently. <br /> <br /> I recommend you rent it before, if you ever read it, because the book a lot of obscene and downright perverted stories that were not included in the movie, mainly the family story of Jonathan who was not needed for the movie. <br /> <br /> A bit of triviality, I heard, is that Wood's current girlfriend has a camouflage in this movie as a drummer of the band that Alex is organizing for the show when Jonathan get off the train to go to Ukraine. <br /> <br /> You spend half of the movie trying to figure out exactly what it is and Jonathan, because his character is so withdrawn, like a turtle in a shell. <br /> <br /> is beautiful and, in my opinion, one of Elie Wood's best films.
