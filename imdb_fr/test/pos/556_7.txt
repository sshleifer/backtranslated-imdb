Susan Sarandon and Natalie Portman play Adele and Ann August, a single mother who is the very definition of the word "dreamer" and her solemn and pragmatic daughter. Adele, eager to make a fresh start in a big city, moves them from Wisconsin to California. <br /> <br /> Decent, if not exceptional or particularly memorable, with serious and sad moments. This pushes some emotional buttons, that's for sure. The best thing it offers is a solid cast, and Sarandon and Portman are pretty good in the lead roles - though their characters are sometimes one-dimensional. <br /> <br /> Could be better, could be worse. <Br /> <br /> I gave this one seven out of ten.
