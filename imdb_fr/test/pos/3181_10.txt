It was an excellent show. It happened on PBS at home in Chicago and I remember Cindy Herron (From EnVogue) playing the teenage girl. The show covered topics such as sex, peer pressure and puberty. It was a middle-class black family that had a daughter and a son of teenagers who had moved to a middle-class neighborhood in Oakland or elsewhere (I can not remember). I remember several episodes, but the one I remember most was when their cousin had her period for the first time. I was probably 7-8 when I watched it for the first time and was able to follow the program. It was a big show. I do not remember the name of the guy who played the son in the series, but I always confused him with Kevin Hooks.
