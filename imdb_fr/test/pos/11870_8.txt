Liv Tyler. Liv Tyler. Liv Tyler. Yes, it is difficult to keep your mind away from this enticing beauty (which gives a radiant performance, perfect as an image), as it simply has the tongue moving. "One Night at McCool's" is an incredibly eccentric and steamy black comedy, with old-fashioned nuances, related to her familiar, chaotic and clever story, in which three men covet the woman and treat her to her advantage. When you see Tyler, is not it amazing that you are fascinated and do anything? it's anything to see her happy and live her dreams. Just like Tyler, this feature has something rather intoxicating as we see Matt Dillon, John Goodman, Paul Reiser (who is great) and especially Michael Douglas (who plays the hired assassin with disconcerting ease, but a hairstyle doubtful). really have a good time with their roles. The consuming plot opens with the three main characters (Dillon, Goodman and Reiser) telling how they discovered this divine presence and the possible effects it has on them to achieve a senseless climax. There is a chain of unpredictable events (ranging from fruity to sensual), where everything would be virtually linked to some irony (snowball) of the fate of the characters (who see them leave their comfort zone reserved to accomplish this girl) . The management of Howard Zwart is brilliantly colored: it balances the gags of the film and amusing situations so amusing so complicated. One of the best comedies under the radar of the last decade, which will put you under the thumb of Tyler.
