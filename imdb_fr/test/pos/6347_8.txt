This is not a masterpiece of Larry Mcmurty, but it stands out as a good western, as do all lonely doves. who has always played the role of Woodrow call, makes a very beautiful representation of his own style. It is also easy to see that they were looking to use this as a stepping stone to the TV series (both versions) and that the writers knew how to keep the flavor alive. William Peterson was great in this regard. the character he plays in this movie - this guy can do everything he seems <br /> <br /> he deserves to be enjoyed by westerns fans <br /> <br /> 4 of 5 stars
