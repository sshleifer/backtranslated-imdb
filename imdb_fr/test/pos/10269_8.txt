A year after Love, your neighbor made his I.T.V. For the first time, he followed the road taken by "On The Buses" and "Steptoe & Son" on the big screen, on an image made by Hammer Films. It begins with a moving patriotic speech extolling the virtues of England's green and pleasant land, then a cup of Eddie and Bill walking down a street, fighting furiously. This turns into a strange sequence of black and white neighbors ransacking their respective homes. At least the original theme is preserved (even if it is sung by someone other than Stuart Gillies). <br /> <br /> The local newspaper - "The Gazette" - is organizing a contest to find the best neighbors, the winners of a cruise in the Mediterranean. Barbie suggests to Joan that they should enter. The question is whether Bill and Eddie can stay friends long enough to win. This is the main part of the plot. The film is usually episodic. A piece is lifted directly from season 1, Bill and Eddie going to the club on the pretext of "doing business with a union". In reality, they will see a stripper (do not meet two girls). In another part of the film, Bill, along with other black factory workers (in the series, he was the only one), broke a strike that Eddie helped create through various stratagems (including the passage fraudulent barrels of beer). While another (apparently inspired by Powell and Driver's "For the Love of Ada") sees Eddie's talkative mother (the gorgeous Patricia Hayes) becoming friends with Bill's father (Charles Hyatt). <br /> <br /> The climax of episode 1 Season 1 reappears in a developed form. Once again, Bill puts paint and a towel to terrorize Eddie, but his friends join him and they dance around a drum containing a naked Booth, in order to be able to pretend to cook and eat it. Eddie then has to go home naked (surprisingly, there is less nudity than in Episode 2, season 2). <br /> <br /> The film ends with the gain of "Reynolds and the Booths" Your neighbor contest and the cruise together, but there is an unexpected twist involving Joan's crazy brother, Cyril (James Beck - "Private soldier" of "Dad's Army"), who works as a steward. <br /> This is your typical sitcom-in-movie from the 70s, with all the flaws that prevail in such films. The laughter is dispersed and interest decreases after about half an hour. The cast is completed by familiar faces such as Melvyn Hayes (played as "Terry", a character from Episode 2 Season 1, played on this occasion by Leslie Meadows), Bill Fraser (as factory director), Anna Dawson , Lawrence Andria (who seems to have been in all the British comedy movies of the 70s, mainly portrayed as nymphomaniacs), and Arthur English. The director, John Robins, was also responsible for the movie "The Man of the House". <br /> <br /> Funniest moment - while Eddie sleeps in a quiet part of the factory, Bill paints his face in black. The first time he knows about it is when the director's secretary is screaming in terror. The tables have been shot!
