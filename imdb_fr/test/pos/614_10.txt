I was expecting everything to go well, having seen some great ozon moments and read a lot about it ... but this movie is brilliant - intelligent, very bright (emotionally and visually), perfect for every moment. every movement is there for a reason, everything is so closely and primordially true and honest. it's the film about beauty and innocence; about its simplicity.
