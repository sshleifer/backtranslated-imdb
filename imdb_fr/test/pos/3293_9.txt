This story has a special place in my heart for thirty-one years. As a boy, I loved the stories of mountain men and wilderness. Books such as "Call of the Wild", "White Fang", "The Frontiersman" and "My Side Of The Mountain" influenced me immensely. I wanted to live like a mountain man, but nothing inspired me more than when I saw this film on television in 1975. I wanted to be like "Trapper". However, as I got older, I found myself too domesticated to live like that. Nevertheless, I always break the idea of ​​living this kind of life. I agree with other critics of this film that the screenplay has the simplicity that prevails in "Disneyisque" movies, but if you can look beyond the mechanisms in which it was shot and see the heart of the story, the real themes so I think you are pleasantly touched. I make a point of watching this film once a year. After thirty-one years, I still have a shiver that runs through me when I see a torrent of snow tumbling down the mountain and hear the trappers laugh. <br /> <br /> -Good luck, my old man stay free- <br /> <br /> PS If you want to know more about the true story, I found this link on Rat's crazy trap River: <br /> <br /> http: //www.mysteriesofcanada .com / NWT / madtrapper.htm
