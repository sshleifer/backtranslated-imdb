The adaptation of "Picture of Dorian Gray" on stage by John Osborne is a fine tribute to Oscar Wilde's novelist and playwright. On screen, with some editing, he becomes a bit neglected due to the deletion of 3 crucial scenes of the play (including an important scene between Basil and Henry showing that the time has passed.) The acting is however brilliant. Sir John Gielgud finds his roots in Wilde as Lord Henry, and although he has about a decade of too much for the role, he becomes totally the enigmatic, cynical and life-lover that Wilde so meticulously reproduced in his new. Jeremy Brett is also strong, offering a moving portrait of anxious artist Basil Hallward. Peter Firth, although not at the origin of my vision of Dorian, manages the role with style and grace ... and later with a convincing tension of cruelty. The support troop is also good, Gwengud's former co-star, Gwen Francon-Davies, gracefully interpreting her aunt Agatha, philanthropist, and Judi Bowker, a touching Sybil. The spirit, the pathos and the tension of Wilde's work have been remarkable. My other problem is hair styles. Many of them seemed out of place, more like the Victorian versions of the 1970s than the current style. However, on the whole, the acting and the writing raise this production to a high level. level of excellence of the small screen.
