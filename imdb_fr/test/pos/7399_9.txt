Where to start, I love the scary snow monster named Jack Frost. The whole concept works well for me, we thought he would be back and he was. Changing the local into a tropical resort works. See old friends and meet new characters. Scott MacDonald does a great job as Jack Frost, you can tell when an actor is having fun playing a villain, you can see him or, in this case, hear him in the show. Yup, Jack Frost 2 is a well received sequel that is better than the first. I have a complaint, little Jacks or Jacklings, as I call them. They looked like puppets. I think they could have done a better job with the Jacklings, the mouth could have opened wider, but the CGI was good and overall, the film as a whole deserves to be watched again and again. If you liked JACK FROST, this suite will please you. No questions or debate, 9 BIG STARS.
