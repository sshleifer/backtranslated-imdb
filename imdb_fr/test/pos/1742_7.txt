I was really starting to enjoy this show. It just started slowly and we did not give her the chance she deserved. It's summer, many people do not watch TV at home. I know there are some singing talents and competitions but I like them like many others. Believe it or not when American Idol is over for the year I miss. Even though it was not an American idol, I thought it had potential. I feel bad for the singers in the series who are really starting to grow on me. I wish they would reconsider and put the show back on. I think the cancellation was hasty. The only complaint I would make about the series is that I did not care too much about the judges.
