The role of the economy in the North American industrialized market must always have been theorized in the countries of origin of engine creation. Individuals and manufacturers such as Mercedes-Benz and Bavarian Motor Works (BMW) have certainly understood the North Ameircan market opportunity with the purchase of fuel and the number of cars purchased per household. This type of economic phenomena gave rise to the concept of Speed ​​Racer. <br /> <br /> After Japan's new constitution, the industrialization of this isolated island island of Japan must again seek opportunities through economic partnerships with its global neighbors. It has also generated economic opportunities in the European and North American markets, and even in the global market. <br /> <br /> Speed ​​is a passionate young pilot who, unknowingly, is driven by his father, the demanding Pops Racer, who has challenged himself all his life to improve the machine at winning races. It was actually Pops Racer who drove his first son, Rex Racer, to the verge of destruction, with his strategy of optimizing the technology he developed. As a mature runner, Rex finally realizes his own intrinsic values ​​and becomes independent while feeling compelled to thwart his young boredom, Speed. <br /> <br /> Rex Racer's exact relationship with people like the inspector is never really clear, but dramatized. Rex is finally accused of being a type of agent for a country or organization because of his ability to occupy places where there is no other explanation as to how he would have known that Speed ​​was in danger. Or, the fact that certain situations of illegal activities constituted his secret knowledge is based on a perverse plot. This brings a level of cloak and dagger romance to Speed ​​Racer. <br /> <br /> The mix of speed innocence with Trixy, Sprital and Chim Chim brings a level of comic human nature. This concept is a good form of rhetoric to balance themes and intrigues when they occur episode by episode. Thus, instead of a dry police story, the thrill of driving international racing cars, the romance of the cloak and dagger and the comedy of human nature come together in a story, Speed ​​Racer.
