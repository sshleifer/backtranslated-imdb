A nice and pleasant film full of Mediterranean landscapes (Cephallonia is a very beautiful Greek island) which retains many characteristics of the novel. I think Greek landscapes add something special and magical to a movie. One thing I did not like at all was that the main characters, like Mandras and Pelagia's father, are not Greek actors but strangers. I mean the actors tried to express the Greek way of life, but for me they did not succeed and it was very clear. Even their pronunciation when they were trying to use Greek words was terrible and it was bad for the plot of the movie. Irene Papas was really great in her role, a typical example of a mother living on an island in the 1940s, who lost her husband and tries to live alone with a child. John Hurt, Pelagia's father, also played very well. He reminded me of a Greek in many of his reactions.
