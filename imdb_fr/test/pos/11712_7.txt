Burt Reynolds directed this action movie and (surprise!), He is actually a very good director. This film starts well, as Burt tries to go bankrupt with a drug dealer and is demoted to the Vice Presidents' Brigade. The troupe presents quite amusing scenes, Brian Kieth always eats something, Bernie Casey has more class than all his colleagues, and Charles Durning loses control of his team. <br /> <br /> Vice cops stumble over an expensive call bell that may have something to do with a series of murders. Sharkey spends days looking for Dominoe's apartment (Rachel Ward) and starts to really love it from a distance. <br /> <br /> Just as they get closer to the crime leader, Dominoe is murdered. I will not reveal any surprises in the plot, but the first hour of this film is excellent. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the scenario becomes very clich√© and incredible afterwards. <br /> <br /> Why would Burt Reynolds confront the crime official with his big secret? Of course, it makes the guy sweat, but it kills a lot more cops. And it is not credible that Dominoe and Sharkey make love after one day, even less if their life is in danger. And in the end, what happened to all the policemen who went to the building with our heroes? Is there not a SWAT team? In addition, the movie never really tells you how all the bad guys are connected and why they have to kill so many people. <br /> <br /> There is a very effective torture scene on a boat near the end of the film, which is probably the only scene in the movie that is really heartbreaking. It is unfortunate that the highlight is typical of the shoot. Nevertheless, this movie is certainly fun if you like crime and action movies. Do not think about the holes in the plot, and you'll have a good time.
