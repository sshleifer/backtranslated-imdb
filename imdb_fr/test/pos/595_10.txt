I have always loved the Muppets. Although the entertainment of most children has not been so enjoyable at the moment, the Muppet was. The Muppets are very, very funny. These are probably the most sympathetic children's characters of all time. <br /> <br /> The Muppets do not only have their own show. They have also played in many movies. from the Muppets Christmas song to the Muppets treasure island. Muppet's film, Muppet's first film, was also excellent, like the series and other films. <br /> <br /> The Muppet movie tells how they all started. Kermit the frog lived in a swamp. Until the day a film director tells him that there are auditions for frogs in Hollywood. So Kermit takes off for Hollywood. On the way he meets many people such as Fozzie Bear, Gonzo the Great and Miss Piggy. In addition, a pervert man tries to capture Kermit. <br /> <br /> All Muppet movies are very enjoyable. I mean they are all very funny. This film has many appearances. Such as Steve Martin, Mel Brooks, Elliot Gould, Carol Kane, Richard Pryor and Orson Welles. Muppet's films are all very enjoyable. I heard that Jason Segel would soon play in one of them. I can not wait to see it.
