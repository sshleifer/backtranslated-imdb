The incredibly sexy Rosie Holotik interprets the role of Charlotte Beale, a new nurse in one of those movie-like asylums where the doctor in charge has her own, unorthodox ways of treating the inmates. Dr. Masters (Anne MacAdams, A.A.K.A. Annabelle Weenick), takes her aboard reluctantly. Inmates do not appreciate Charlotte too much. <br /> <br /> Between mystery and horror, this initial effort by the director of movie B, S. F. Brownrigg, has an oppressive feeling. These colorful psychos, including a nymphomaniac without self-esteem, a nice giant who has already had a lobotomy and a supposed "judge" who speaks in legalese, dominate the screen with their disconcerting presence. <br /> <br /> It's an image that works pretty well and that creates a sandy atmosphere right from the start. A few brief flashes of graphic violence also help to give it this old-fashioned quality of exploitation. <br /> <br /> It gets more intense as the at-risk heroine struggles to maintain her mental health, offering an unreal encounter one after the other. Mrs. Callingham, citing poetry, is particularly effective in quoting poems. <br /> <br /> For cheap cheeses from the 1970s, it's quite effective, with a particularly unpleasant climax. I had a lot of fun watching it. <br /> <br /> 7/10
