Kane is a killer named Jacob Goodnight, he lives in this old hotel burned, where eight convicted teenagers will clean up. Most of them die with the exception of 3 of them. In my case, it was not the best writing or the best ever. I always thought that the massacre scenes were really well done. Like when the only girl is going to be eaten by hungry dogs. The best was when he pushed the cell phone into the blonde girl's mouth. Kane was a really serious horror movie actor, he looked serious all the movie and it would never change. It was his only look at the whole movie. Big scenes of action and killing, I do not think I can give him 10 out of 10, but 6 looks good.
