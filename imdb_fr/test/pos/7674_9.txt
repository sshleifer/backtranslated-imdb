I was given the solo "Summertime" in 5th grade for our spring choral concert. From that moment, a great appreciation of Gershwin's music arose in me. I love the mesmerizing melodies of this Gershwin opera. At the time I was in grade 5 (about 10 years), I learned to use the LP and I liked the soundtrack very much. I recommend seeing this movie and if you can get the soundtrack, get it - you can sometimes find it on eBay - an old used disc. I searched and tried to find the soundtrack on a CD. The songs on this disc have wonderful musical arrangements and I sincerely hope that the CD will be purchased for purchase, as well as the film and the restoration of the film. It is truly a wonderful job that present and future generations could benefit from. Some may think that the movie is slow and monotonous, but I find it just the opposite. Although Poitier and Dandridge have doubled the musical voices, I think the voices fit well with faces and personalities. A person's voice and singing voice can be very different. Porgy and Bess and the songs of this opera will always have a special meaning for me.
