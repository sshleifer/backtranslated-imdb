Pierre Jolivet plays a character of Don Quixote, unable to speak, living in a world incompatible with modern life. He trusts his armaments - helmet, sleeves and spear - made from embellishments, seat cushions and discarded office furniture. Just as Don Quixote rode Rocicante, "The Man" (literally) straddles his craft, transcending lost lives and catching up with the hard and devaluing modern world - rising above the earth, far from the difficult situation of the modern man. The two characters go in search of adventure to try to repair the wrongs of the world. Both characters are guardian knights of values ​​unknown to most other characters in the story. <br /> <br /> Unlike Cervantes' tale, in this film, we identify more directly with the anachronistic ideals of the main character. We can only compare this strange and hostile landscape to the lush and beautiful world in which we live. Our frame of reference is the imaginary realm of which the lonely knight remembers perhaps. Our vision would be one that expects the main character to triumph, conquer, change his world (for the better) and plunge it back into a world of abundance that no longer exists. <br /> <br /> We watch this movie and see a real knight among a world of humans. Don Quixote considered himself a true knight among animals. <br /> <br /> With the story of Cervantes, we can only see the dreamer, without really understanding the scope of his anachronistic displacement. In the story of Besson and Jolivet, we see the new world through the eyes of Don Quixote, because we value the same visions and ideals as the main character of the crusade.
