Two Hands is an extremely enjoyable Australian crime choir, which ultimately succeeds in the way the film easily combines tense dramatic moments, characters and very funny situations, to give the film the right balance. The movie comedy happens naturally, and the laughs were not designed too elaborately and were not worked too much. It's really fun, thanks to the fact that each character in the film is an excellent cast and that each actor / actress recognizes and can relate to Australian humor. They describe it very well and very realistically. Of course, they are immensely helped by a fantastic script by author / director Gregor Jordan. I was reading another review of this film by an American who had seen it, and he strongly criticized it, making it look like a Pulp Fiction clone. I think they are just rubbish. This film does not try to be Pulp Fiction, the meaning and style of each of these excellent films are totally opposite. Without wanting to appear superior or arrogant, I think I understand perfectly this film; humor, sincerity, characters, etc., you must be Australian or at least understand the culture, what the other guy obviously had no idea. Some Americans, including critics of some non-American films, seem to ignore (and have trouble understanding) anything that is not an American product. It's a shame, because it's a very good movie. The love story between the main character and the girl is also described in a very real, sincere and sweet way. I am very proud to have this film in my collection. 4.5 out of 5
