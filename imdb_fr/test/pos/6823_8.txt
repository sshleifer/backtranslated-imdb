I think I was one of the people who found this other roth pearls. his performance, as awarded, was staggering. the story told so eloquently by Francis Ford Coppola 25 years earlier is gradually unfolding and gives way to the development of characters. Roeg proves again that war does not have to be a conflict to be interesting. A story of contrast is in a most wonderful place. Ruthlessnes and beauty go hand in hand, while loneliness should become your best friend. It bears witness to a more sinister past of a little golden age kingdom that lands on a coast full of riches for a country of the world, if you send the good men. In short, a beautiful film directed by Nicola's with a sublime cast.
