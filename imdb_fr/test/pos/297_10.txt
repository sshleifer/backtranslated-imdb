Bright actors and brilliant image !! I love the chopper scene with the music at first, it is so moving and both real and surreal! The Vietnam War was far from human and I believe that this kind of cinematic series has terrible human beings who can act under certain circumstances. Modern war movies spend so much money on effects. This is just a simple smart movie that takes you beyond your imagination. A film that really describes evil and hate mixed with fear and fate. The world is crazy and the power of will and friendship, love and passion. A must-see movie and without a doubt the best war movie of all time! Many have tried to copy but there is still no film as close as this one!
