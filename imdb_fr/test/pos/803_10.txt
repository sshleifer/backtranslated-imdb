The film was very good. I am passionate about mystery and I usually see who will be killed and who killed. While I knew who was going to be killed, I did not know who did it. I was not happy with the portrayal of Gerda's character, but given the year the film was set, it's possible the woman was so "disgusting". Know that if these Poirot movies are good, they simply do not have the same dynamics as the series, because they do not have Japp, Ms. Lemon and especially Hastings! David Suchet is definitely Poirot. I saw all the actors who played it. The worst was Peter Ustinov!
