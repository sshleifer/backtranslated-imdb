Although I am firmly convinced that SITR is Gene Kelly's best film, but this one is pretty good. I loved the music and the dance and the end about how Gene got the girl. My favorite part is undoubtedly the dance of Gene with his alter ego. I love watching two Gene Kelly for the price of one. This shows the real talent of Mr. Kelly. I think it's a movie that everyone should watch at least once in their life. So, you have not seen him go out and find to watch him today! I'm sure everyone has a friend of Gene Kelly who has this movie in his collection. So go to their place and blow up some popcorn and enjoy!
