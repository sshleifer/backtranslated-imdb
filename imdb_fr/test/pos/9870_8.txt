... do not like this movie and everyone will understand why. The plot is poor, as is the actor. But in my opinion, it's better than Halloween 5, even if it does not give many surprising moments. Some scenes are really well directed. But these few moments do not give the reason to praise him. I do not despise violence in movies, but H6 features extraordinarily loud and bloody scenes that do not fit the Halloween movie tradition. The most sucking aspect about H6 is lack of tension. No comparison with the first masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Halloween 6 receives only 4 out of 10 stars from me. If you want, praise him. But do not expect a great horror experience .... <br /> <br />
