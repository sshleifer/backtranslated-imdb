A very moving film, a big surprise from Brazil, a country that usually exports films on social themes, violence, sex ... The magic realism is a very difficult task, and I believe that João Falcão has succeeded wonderfully. It seems he did not really intend to make a realistic film, far from it. Although many people think that the film was adapted from the play, he said in his interviews that he had founded the film on the book. Another mistake is to think that Falcão was influenced by the series "Hoje é Dia De Maria". The television series produced by Globo was made after the film, but was broadcast before ... Unfortunately. <br /> <br /> The negative point is photography, by Walter Carvalho. It seems that he did not understand or understand the concept created by Falcão. The story is captivating and universal though it takes place in a small town in Brazil. It could happen anywhere in the world. A good movie, I highly recommend it.
