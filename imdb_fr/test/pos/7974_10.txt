Hell to Pay is a bit bloody for my taste, although it's not worse than many movies. Nevertheless, I enjoyed the parade of seasoned stars and the western landscape & everything; but the scenario was very weak and I could not really see the purpose of it all. However, the music that accompanies the film largely offsets this dull film. <br /> <br /> Where do the guys, Nate and Noah Cryns, who wrote this music come from? They are great!! From the beginning of the music, it's far better than anything I've heard in years. I think it's maybe the best I've ever heard! Although the action of the film did not inspire me, the music evoked the exact emotion necessary for each scene. I was transported to the Old West on time in the opening credits and I really felt like reliving those old days through music. <br /> <br /> This film is definitely worth buying music and a trip back in time to see the old western stars again.
