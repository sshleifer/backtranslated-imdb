I got free tickets via the Times to see this famous little Irish movie called 'Inside I'm Dancing' ... I did not know it, so I had no preconceived idea before going there. <br /> <The film is about two guys who are confined to their wheelchairs and live in a house. Michael (Steven Robertson) suffers from cerebral palsy and Rory (James McAvoy) from muscular dystrophy (please excuse spelling mistakes!). They are a link, because Rory seems to be the only person who can understand what Michael is saying. They end up leaving home to live alone in an apartment in Carrigmore. They immediately use the help of a pretty girl (Romola Garai) to look after them. The two friends eventually fall in love with the same woman. It's the story in short, but there are a lot of laughs and tears along the way ... actually ... being badly prepared as I was .. I found that tears flowed all too often! In reality! I do not think I cried so much while watching a movie from The Elephant Man !!! This movie is a huge drain on emotions ... both in fun and sad stuff. The acting game is absolutely perfect! James McAvoy is my advice for greatness ... he is a great Irish actor and I think he has a great future ahead of him. Steven Robertson who plays Michael was also superb ... and it is only until today that I discovered that he did not suffer from Cerabal Palsy and it was just great actors! Brenda Fricker is also in this film and plays very well the role of Home's Manager. The other big part should be Romola Garai, she was wonderful as a love interest, and I think we'll see her more on the big screen in the near future! <br /> <br /> What makes the difference This film work is not only the synergies between the two main actors, but the script ... which is so much # wit # witty that it is literally in fire! I still can not help but repeat some lines in my head, even now. <br /> <br /> The photography is good, although very dark, but it captures a certain type of region of Ireland. The music is also excellent in this film, as well as the choice in Songs ... the use of the Johnny Cash cover of the title of Nine Inch Nails 'Hurt' is inspired !! <br /> <br /> If I had to summarize this film in one word ... it would be "emotional". This film is very very funny ... and then the turn of a piece is very very sad! I still can not believe that two days after watching the movie, I laughed and almost cried! This film is amazing ... and I hope it will go far! Although I can not see it, his advertising budget is probably very small! <br /> <br /> Then go see it! I urge you ... you will not regret it ...
