It is a film with a theatrical message mixed with intelligent moments. Movies like these are the middle ground of great actors, they like to throw the ball into open pieces like these. The Angel that was not what we see in old books and churches is a rather pleasant change. Dogma, Kevin Smith's play, echoes almost in the same blinding vein. <br /> <br /> - = 0) Watch this movie for a good day after swallowing it. Maybe so many movies try to be complicated that we forget the simple movements of movies like this one? Probably one of the funniest items I've seen in a long time, I met this one on VHS in a garbage can because someone's basement had been flooded this summer, and I took a handful of cassettes. <br /> <br /> in a wastebasket or on the big screen, sweet comedies like this are fun, you just do not have to tell everyone in a trendy nightclub that you like or in a swollen political party. Keep it for yourself and I bet a lot of people will borrow it from time to time.
