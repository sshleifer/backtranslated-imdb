If it had been done 2 years later, he would have been banned! The number one MUST SEE the recommendation of the day !. The best Rouben Mamoulian movie I've seen so far (I have not seen J + H yet, but I have not seen it yet). <br /> <br /> It is not surprising that this film gets less than 200 votes. A larger greyzone that did not care about what was good would never be seen before the 60s. Morally ambiguous and dark like the grain of the 70s but with a certain charm too. Of course, it had to end at the end of the 1930s and, unfortunately, that does not seem to have been rediscovered. <br /> <br /> Seriously. It has everything. Great actors: Gary Cooper, Sylvia Sidney and Guy Kibbee, not so sweet this time. And a very good director. So far, I have not been the biggest fan of RM, but I loved his films and, with that, he enters a new league. One of the best 30's movies I've ever seen! This is something I never thought I would have existed! 9.5 / 10
