I was really and wonderfully surprised by "Oh brother, where are you?" The video store was out of all the movies I was planning to rent, so I came across this. I went home and I plunged into the fun. The Coen have made a wonderful movie again. But I think the first time you watch this movie, you get to know the characters. The second time, now that you know them, you're laughing so hard that it could hurt you. I urge anyone to see this because if you are not, you really miss a movie gem for ages. 10/10
