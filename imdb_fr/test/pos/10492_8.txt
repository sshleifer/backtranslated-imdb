Of the 600 or so Western Spaghetti made, it must be in the top twenty somewhere. You can not believe that this has not received any criticism! Gemma is excellent in this area. Van Johnson is good too, even though his doubled voice is a bit killer, but it's the charm of Italian style. Beautiful photography and some perfectly staged actions. All the secondary characters are well played. The severity of the racist tendency among the wicked is quite severe, even by today's standards, creating emotional depth for the Gemmas character in some of the situations that occur. The absolutely fantastic score of Luis Bacalov. See this in the beautiful widescreen DVD of Japan. A spaghetti must have.
