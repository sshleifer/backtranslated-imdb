Wow! it's even better than I expected! the best animation film Asterix! and it's so good to hear Roger Carel repeat the voice of Asterix! I certainly recommend it to anyone who likes Asterix comics! but I suggest you go see the French version, because it is surely the best and you hear the original cast! Did you know that Roger Carel has been playing at Ast√©rix for almost forty years? I think he did a wonderful job! and Celine Dion's song at the end of the rally is great! the music is good, the drawings are good, the actors are wonderful ... in a word: a masterpiece! Go see him! you will not regret it!
