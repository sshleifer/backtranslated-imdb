I saw this film for the first time at a preview in Fredrikstad, Mr. Zwarts' hometown. There, among directors, musicians and other Norwegian celebrities, I laughed and laughed ... I just could not stop. If you like a comedy with black humor, clean lines and great acting, this is a movie you MUST watch! It's like mixing "True Romance" with "The Wedding Singer" and adding a trait of "Mad About You" Hilarios! <br /> <br /> 10 points!
