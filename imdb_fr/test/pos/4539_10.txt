This is one of my most favorite movies of all time. Pretty pathetic, do you say? Well yes. But Chris is incredibly funny. His innocent brilliance appears in this film more than in any of his other films. Look at the two motel scenes, when Spade gets caught with his zipper down and the other: "JUST FOR GOD'S LOVE !!!"
