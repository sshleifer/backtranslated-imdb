An interesting film based on three novels by Jules Verne. Considering today's special effects and computer-enhanced animation, this film is a historical marker of cinematic resourcefulness and imagination. Karel Zeman brought to life the lithographic images of Jules Verne's original texts. It's a must for science fiction and classic history buffs. <br /> <br /> I give this film 9 out of 10. Enjoy !!
