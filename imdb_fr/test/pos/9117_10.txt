I was able to see a preview of this film through UCLA's screening program and let me tell you that: THIS FILM IS INCREDIBLY GOOD !!!! I have seen a lot of movies, but few made me laugh as sincerely or talk about the movie as much as this one. I had a decent respect for Tenacious D before seeing the movie, and now I'm crazy about them. I will certainly buy their album when it was released on the 14th and will see this movie again. <br /> <br /> If you wanted to see this movie, go out and see it !! This is well worth the extremely high price of movie tickets these days, as you will surely start laughing all the time. <br /> <br /> Besides the comedy, the glorious and divine music that comes from KG's guitar and JB's voice is impressive. The audience is stunned to be able to create such incredible harmonies and riffs in conjunction with such ridiculous (and hilarious) lyrics. If this is nothing but the music itself, this film is worth its price of admission. <br /> <br /> The story is wonderfully coherent and combines almost every aspect of the traditional "D" story and its features, great new songs, hilarious comedy and some superb cameos, this movie ranks among the best! Go see him !!
