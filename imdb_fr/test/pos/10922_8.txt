Some films want us to think, some want to excite us, others want to amaze us. But sometimes, a movie only wants to make us laugh, and "In & Out" certainly succeeds in this department. <br /> <br /> Howard Brackett (Kevin Kline), a teacher at Indiana High School, is going to be married to a classmate Emily Montgomery (Joan Cusack), teacher, in three days, but the whole city is more excited about Appointment of former resident Cameron Drake (Matt Dillon) to the Oscars. But when Cameron wins an Oscar for playing a gay soldier, he thanks his gay teacher, Howard, for inspiration. What follows is that Howard denies it in a hilarious set of incidents and that it's really a spin. <br /> <br /> Kevin Kline is awesome, exalting gay stereotypes. Joan Cusack is really chic for antics. Debbie Reynolds is completely hilarious as Howard's mother. And Bob Newhart is also very enthusiastic as a leading homophobe. <br /> <br /> Gay screenwriter Paul Rudnick really achieves a delicate balance here. He knows the stereotypes and exploits them in a way that is tolerable for conservatives in the Midwest and harmless to the gay public. It's not really progressive, but it's funny and harmless, and it's certainly a step forward from the previous year's "The Birdcage."
