Ok, I love this movie !!!!! I watched it again and again. It's so hard to tell who the attacker is. You keep thinking that it's one person, then another, then back to the first person, then to another person. The suspense is so intense that you want to fast forward your TV to the end to see who it is. <br /> <br /> SUMMARY: Gail Osborne is raped and left at home. She is in the hospital and begins to tell how she was raped. It ranges from meeting his stable boyfriend to his teacher who loves him, to his ex-boyfriend, to all the different stories, to all the suspects. But who did it? <br /> <br /> I like acting, they have a lot of talent here. The suspense is wonderful and the settings are superb. If it's on TV, watch it. *** 1/2 stars 10/10
