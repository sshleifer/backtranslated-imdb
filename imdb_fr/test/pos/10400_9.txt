Like many horror fans who were looking for the next anxiety movie, we plundered the Asian horror market for all we could have, leaving no ghost-haired ghost unreturned. We had good reason to do so, the Asian market had generated wonders as terrifying as Ringu, Dark Waters, Juon - The grudge and the tale of two sisters. By the time Takashi Miike began tearing the mick of the genre with One Missed Call in 2003, the market seemed to be drying up, leaving him open to mockery and derision, despite the ongoing pursuit of Hollywood's Hollywood Remake Machine. Now, do not get me wrong, there were still a lot of good Asian horrors being done, as Marebito and Shutter, to name just two, will one day become classics of the minor genre. But the ghost-haired lady had definitely eaten at the party and was about to bring home this vagabond to foolish success! Then comes a movie like Noroi - The Curse. A film intelligent enough to pay a subtle homage to its roots, while throwing the rule book through the window. What I am going to describe in terms of intrigue will probably make you think that there is nothing new here. The film is a documentary about one of Japan's greatest paranormal investigators who receives stories and gives information about ghostly events. He begins to investigate a woman's claims that she regularly hears a crying baby in the next house. Yet there is no baby in this house, except for a middle-aged woman and her son. These two disappear sharp when the journalist passes his nose, but other strange coincidences begin to appear. A psychic girl, a mentally ill clairvoyant, a pretty young actress who had a strange vision, many dead pigeons and a very sinister demon named Kagutaba, leading to a truly terrifying confrontation in a small historic town. . <br /> <br /> Saying more about the plot could spoil the fun a little. The film is shot in the "fake documentary" and incorporates television and report footage, and subtitle labels let you know where you are in terms of time. The film made more than a few comparisons with the Blair Witch project, but apart from the filming format and the scary trip into the woods late at night, the comparison ends there really. <br /> <br /> What to refresh about Noroi is the way he does not address the modern horror audience. If you expect croaking ghostly women to come out of the attic, look elsewhere. The strength of the film lies in the slow and gradual development of terror, a terror so deep that it will stay with you for days after watching it. The highlight is rather weird, but by the time you think the movie is over, you're treated to the "real" end when the credits begin to roll, and, sweet and sacred, it's a killer. In terms of the game, it's especially convincing. You get a 'comical' relief from the crazy clairvoyant covered in foil, but it soon disappears halfway through the movie. The film also feels a little more "nasty" than the horror of Asian ghosts, because some events are also violent. <br /> <br /> All in all, Noroi is watching for yourself, late at night. Not since my first visit to Ringu, ten years ago, have I been so pleased to watch a horror movie. It's the one that will itch you until it's too late, then it's under your skin. Let yourself go to this one completely. And not a ghost lady with loose hair in sight? No wonder it's just out of Japan, let alone an American remake is still aligned. Check this one if you can, essential viewing in my books!
