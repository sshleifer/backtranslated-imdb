This film has something that most other movies of its kind do not have: intelligence and good messages. Accepted, it is the story of a child named Bartleby (Justin Long) who is rejected by all the colleges to which he addresses himself. His parents are incredibly strict, frustrated and disappointed. Thus, Bartleby and a few other students facing similar problems start a fake university to pledge to their parents while they were all college students. Everything is not going as planned and the film is about them. But behind this conspiracy that seems ridiculous, there are good messages, a moral and a new perspective on the American education system. The college they created, the South Harmon Institute of Technology, accepts those who have not been accepted anywhere else. The message is that you do not need "money, tradition or fancy books, you just need a desire to improve yourself. it's a completely unorthodox school, but the film teaches that it's always ok - and different (whether it's a person or a school) is not necessarily bad and everyone should have the opportunity to improve - despite being "weird". it is a message of non-conformity and traces of anti-authority are also scattered. But not only are the messages great, it's hilarious! haha I laughed very hard. the humor can be subtle, but it can also be blatant and an excellent mix. Fraternities, beware.
