Where do I start? Do I have to say how much cinematography is. Do I praise some scenes that show the creativity of the directors? Do I tell how realistic the scenes on Ellis Island are? Should I mention that, to change, we do not have the scene of shots to watch Statue Of Liberty. (Now, immigrants are looking at the statue from the ship's railing, it's a clich√©) <br /> <br /> Now, what do you like, two major things, one being a modern song score and even a bad start. <BR /> <br /> Second and almost deadly, the film is boring, it moves so slowly that watching dry paint would be an improvement. <br /> <br /> The duration of 118 minutes is too long and the film seems unfinished. We do not see any scenes of this family in the United States. Our hero says he wants to find his twin brother. I would have liked the scenes of his futile, perhaps rather lucky research, instead of other stretched scenes. <br /> <br /> The film is a failure. <br /> <br /> Rating *** of 4 81 points out of 100 IMDb 7 (out of 10)
