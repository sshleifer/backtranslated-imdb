Almost all commentators have mentioned how some interview sequences overlap concert sequences. It is true and it is the biggest defect of this film. However, it is not so often, or so bad, that we should not see this video. If you are a fan of Black Sabbath, you must see it. In addition to seeing Black Sabbath in the 70s and early 80s, I saw them in 2005 or 2006, while they were also featured in OZZfest, as in this video. The concert was amazing, and very similar to this one, which is why I rented this in the first place. It's about the best geezer-rock on the market. Check it out.
