Shelley. <br /> <br /> According to the pocket novels "North and South", "Love and War" and "Heaven and Hell" by John Jake, this is a television mini-series from 1985 to 1987. His success is further due to the success of "Roots" soap opera similar to the period of the Civil War / soap opera broadcast about a decade earlier in the 1970s. Patrick Swayze, at the beginning of his career and at the time, made many films such as Dirty Dancing that would make him famous, as well as Orry Main, a young man from South Carolina and born in a plantation that leaves for West Point. There he meets George Hazard (James Read), who is supposed to be the hated enemy, the Yankee North, but with whom he is closely related. Soon, Southern Hands and Northern Hazards become friends despite the turbulent period that led to the Civil War. The theme of family, friendship and what to do, even when the nation is disintegrating, is at the heart of this other TV drama full of action and romance.

On Jakes' novels, we see a condensed version of it, and some modifications have been made to make it a sort of historical romance with history lessons, and the characters can be found in all the major scenes of the Civil War - Harper's Ferry where the abolitionist and feminist Virgilia Hazard (Kirstie Alley) loses the love of her life, the ex-slave Grady, Fort Sumter, Vicksburg, Antietam, Gettysburg, Appomatox and we are aware of the White House where we see Abraham Lincoln (Hal Halbrook) To face the war in his conscience, we meet all the important actors, including Lee, Grant, Sherman, Jackson and Davis, as well as several actors. gold-era stilts in Hollywood - Robert Mitchum, Elizabeth Taylor and Olivia De Ha. Villand have cameos and it's interesting to see them. This is not a historical fact, it is a historical fiction and a purely theatrical entertainment. But it has cliffhanger endings and a beautiful cinematography, costumes and places. It's like watching an epic movie that lasts longer than Gone With The Wind with war scenes! The scenario can sometimes be bad and the acting game may not be the best despite the good cast. Swayze gets involved like Terri Garber, but some performances, like Kirstie Alley, James Read (as George Hazard) and Leslie Anne Downes as Madeline, beautiful and strong, are very good performances. They shot in sets and in southern places. The music is enchanting and this is a good movie in which we look for good guys and watch the program of the bad guys to finally get their success. All fans of Civil War movies and Jakes novels should look at this. It is available on DVD and VHS.
