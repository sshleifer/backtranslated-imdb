In the credits of "Shadows", after reading "directed by John Cassavetes", we can see some blank letters on the screen: "The film you just saw is improvised," they say. I always go on to say that words are so important in films since filmmakers started using them, because basically there is no film without a script and many other reasons. <br /> <br /> Cassavetes pursues the same goal, and he believes in the freedom of words; "Shadows" is the perfect example. It is a film without real main characters, without a real main plot; it is mostly people in different situations who are discussing. Yes, some situations are related, but Cassavetes, apparently always eager to talk, uses a fast forward technique when the characters leave somewhere or escape from someone and do not speak. <br /> <br /> Appearances are everything in this movie. For example, there is a brilliant score, filled with jazz influences and fantastic solos, and one character says he is a jazz musician and trumpet player (Ben, all the names of the characters are the same as those of the actors). However, you never see him playing trumpet or jam with a group; he does not even talk about music and walks with his friends in the city. They talk a lot and everything that goes through their heads; ranging from the intelligence of each of them to the hilarious analysis of a sculpture. <br /> <br /> "Shadows" is funny in its intellectual references in games like the one above, because these friends are not cultivated. The only major female character in the film (Lelia), however, wants to be an intellectual. But again, she has a very interesting conversation with an elderly man at a party, about a book she's trying to write and how to deal with reality; but nothing to do with being intellectual. During this evening, a woman makes an intellectual statement full of complexity and asks a guy next to her: "Do you agree?" "Yes," he says, but you can tell he does not know what she's talking about. <br /> <br /> Another character, a singer (Hugh), speaks of his days of glory on occasion, and we see him perform only once; but no reference to the music industry there. Cassavetes focuses on the singer's relationship with his manager (Rupert), which usually consists of discussions on insignificant topics and not on actual "musical" discussions. The important contract of the trumpet player in "Shadows" is therefore the time he spends with his friends. that of intellectual girls is his way of managing romantic relationships (one of the highlights of the film) and that of the singer is the link with his manager - Appearances. <br /> <br /> The reason why performance is not important in this film is simple. Cassavetes needed people who could master improvisation, no matter how good they were. I think some people are not, but they certainly know how to improvise in a scene and you can see how well they are doing it. "Shadows" does not apply to performers; it's a way of doing cinema, based on the magic of conversation; and there we could say that the performances have a meaning. <br /> <br /> That's why, in every conversation, the camera is like a stalker, constantly on the eyes of each character, constantly searching for expressions associated with natural speech. There is a scene where the trumpet player and his friends try to flirt with girls. They are three, so each of them is sitting next to a girl (girls are three two) in three different tables. They all talk at the same time and the camera films across the table, and sometimes the friends look at each other as they say what they say. It's natural.
