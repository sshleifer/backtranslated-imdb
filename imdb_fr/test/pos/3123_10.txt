I do not think I really have spoilers here, but as I describe some fun scenes, I'll check the box saying "may contain spoilers" just to be careful. Now ... <br /> <br /> I do not know where to start. Now you know the story - horse traders Travis (Ben Johnson) and Sandy (Harry Carey Jr.) take on the task of guiding a Western Mormon wagon to its "promised land" and, along the way, meet various tests and interesting characters, including the Clegg family, outlaws. <br /> <br /> Everyone can enjoy this movie. You do not have to be a western fan to love this one. On the other hand, Johnson and Carey are two of the most quickly friendly characters you'll see in any movie. Carey in particular is lively and sociable, almost like a big kid - while Johnson is a little calmer and wiser, much like a big brother figure. I had a kick out of the scene where they sell to the sheriff one of their "nice horses" for ten dollars; then inform him that the horse has "some peculiarities - you could say misfires" ... Travis sews an elbow to the head, Sandy who lets out with a shrill whistle, sending the sheriff's new horse into a raging position. The look on his face as the horse finally throws it and the gallop is priceless. <br /> <br /> Pay attention to the music ... even if you never thought you'd be a fan of the Pioneer Sons, listen to "Shadows in the Dust" as the wagon train is shown in motion with some people walking between the cars. It's a very beautiful song - just a pity a half-minute or more in the movie. I want to hear everything one day. <br /> <br /> One thing that impressed me a lot about this film is that much of this film had to be almost as difficult to create as the actual situation it describes. Teams of six horses pulling carts on steep mountain trails, striving to reach the summit - it was not a simple and easy film. It must have been risky for the actors, the stuntmen and the animals. Crossing the rivers too, this film has a lot of authentic action that involves the movement of the train of cars. It is worth mentioning that Harry Carey Jr. and Ben Johnson were extremely competent riders with many years of experience in riding, roping and all kinds of cowboy activities. Carey grew up on a ranch where her family employed many Navaho Indians. In fact, he learned to speak Navaho before learning to speak English. No rhinestone cowboys in this film - "Travis" and "Sandy" were the reality, from one side to the other. <br /> <br /> Watch the scene as Miss Denver throws the pot of water out of her cart and hits Travis's horse in the face ... the horse starts to buzz, finally rejecting it. Look at Sandy's face when Denver tells Travis, "I'm sorry you fell off your horse." Another of my favorite scenes is where Harry Carey Jr. (Sandy) mixes a little tiff with one of the Mormons. They work back to back to prepare their equipment, and after Sandy is disgusted by the other player, they engage in a scathing fight that quickly turns into a fist on the ground. . Even after the elder (Ward Bond) lifted them up and separated, the two fighters continue to fight. The Mormon (named "Jackson" in the movie) gets a last free-kick to Sandy so high that he hits his shoulder. It's a really fun scene from start to finish. <br /> <br /> I do not know what else I can say about this movie, except that it has a good story, very endearing characters, beautiful landscapes and an abundance of balanced action with humor and a bit of drama. Oh, it was colorized, at least in the version I saw; It's not the most beautiful color film you can see, but I think I prefer it to black and white. I give this one a ten and I do not give a lot of 10. One of my favorite movies, no doubt. And, judging by the other reviews, I have a lot of company in this evaluation.
