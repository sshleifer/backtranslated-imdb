Colombian terrorists are holding an American military school hostage until their demands are met. The students decide to fight. Will they be able to do it? <br /> <br /> Silly premise but the movie really works. The group of young people who were arguing was already very strong when this film was released in 1991: Sean Astin (very cute); Wil Wheaton (the miserable air); Keith Coogan; George Perez (the Latin brand pledge who is very handsome, very muscular and especially shown in tight underwear); T. E. Russell (the symbolic black guy) and Shawn Phelan. None of them are very good actors (except Astin), but who cares? It's an unthinking action movie. The only other good performances are Denholm Elliott (ball director) and Louis Gossett Jr. as dean. <br /> <br /> Other than that, there is a lot of action, suspense, explosions and little brains. In other words --- FUN! <br /> <br /> Only complaint (and this is minor) - it's a bit too long (there are THREE terminations) and there is a LOT of occasional bloody violence (the R rating was well deserved). Yet, I enjoyed it very much.
