I just saw this film at the Sidewalk Film Festival in Birmingham, Alabama, which was actually a really fun and blown festival. It was the best movie I've seen all day long. A school-aged prostitute meets a middle-aged man and tries to end the deep depression together. It's an inside look at the darkest parts of human sexuality. The story stems from real facts, ripped headlines. A crude and dull dialogue and murderous twist at the end. The film contains a graphic sexual dialogue and nudity. Certainly not suitable for children. Too depressing for the tastes of some people. This is definitely worth checking in my opinion though.
