Well, I guess I was in the mood for a movie that really took me right from the start. This film was not. He was walking at a slow, deliberate pace for the first 40 minutes, but that did not really interest me. There was an inimitable and mysterious quarrel between the character of Jean Reno and an old man, but over the first 40 minutes is dominated by the wanderings of the main character, whom I did not know much and whom I did not really know. He walks alone for the most part, he does not meet anyone; I imagine that the director was trying to describe the loneliness of the human condition in this post-apocalyptic world, which is good, but I would have liked it to be reduced from 40 minutes to 15 minutes, because it can become incredibly boring. . <br /> <br /> But after these 40 minutes, things start to get very interesting. I guess I will not say more than that because I do not want to ruin anything. So, if you have seen the first 15 to 30 minutes of this movie and you plan to turn it off (as I was), stay there, it will be much better. <br /> <br /> One of the most interesting thing I found in this film is the fact that there was no dialogue, which really made me think about what was happening, how the characters felt and what their motivations were, why things were as they were in this apocalyptic post - world, which gives history a lot of room for interpretation by the public. And it's amazing how much a movie is more satisfying when the actors do not tell you what's going on.
