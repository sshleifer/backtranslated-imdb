I was lucky to see this film during a first screening in Brea and I'm crazy since. The film is based on Shakespeare's Twelfth Night, which I read and liked and saw on stage a few times, so I liked the references. But whether you like Shakespeare or not, it does not matter: the film is presented. It's super funny, witty and charming. Amanda Bynes is hilarious, as is David Cross. In fact, the whole cast is great - I'm just a big fan of David Cross. The cast is hot and the soundtrack has a lot of cool bands and some that I've never heard before, but I know they have a CD that will come out, so I'll definitely buy it. Everyone in our audience laughed from beginning to end, of all age groups. !!!!
