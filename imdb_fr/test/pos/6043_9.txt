A nasty private recruiter, Owens, tests the skills of the instructor, Sgt Moore (Jack Webb). No explosions, bloodshed or soundtrack or sex. It takes place in the USMC training camp at Parris Island, S.C., and most of the players are real marines. Memorable one-liners abound and the closing credit "dedicated to ..." is intense. With such strong male and female characters, this film could not be shot in today's delicate world.
