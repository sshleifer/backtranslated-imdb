I saw the world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival. It's a great movie. <br /> <br /> Real life spouses Paul Bettany and Jennifer Connelly play Charles and Emma Darwin in the middle of their struggle. writing and the decision to publish "Origin of Species". Taking into account the ramifications that this can have for their family and the future of humanity is presented in such a way that we do not suspect that an off-screen couple could succeed. <br /> <br /> Jon Amiel (who gave a heart-felt introduction) and John Collee do and great job of giving life to Randal Keynes' biography. They created very poignant and human moments, great cinematography and scenery as well as a generous part of the language that disturbs the theory of evolution that still divides. <br /> <br /> The surprise star is Martha West who plays Annie Darwin, the character around whom much of the story unfolds. She plays the precocious girl in a T-shirt. If his performance leaves something to be desired, his star should be on the rise. <br /> <br /> In short, it's a great film and, although it's a dramatic period series, the problems that keep it alive are still relevant today.
