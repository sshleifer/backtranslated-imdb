Bad for Ya really showcases George Carlin's talents. He is always so sharp. It's a pity we lost him this year, but his comedy will still live. This special show is literally one of the funniest I have ever heard a comedian play. Even if he makes fun of little kids, it makes you laugh as he says certain things. It's true that Carlin can literally create something that does not seem funny and make it one of the funniest things you've ever heard. I really enjoyed this stand-up, especially Carlin, and I would recommend those who would like to see more of George Carlin's stand-up.
