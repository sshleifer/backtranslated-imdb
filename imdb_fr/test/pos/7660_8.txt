The son of Hercules is badly wounded during a lion hunt that goes wrong. Hercules (a solid and engaging performance of Reg Park) must venture into a strange and dangerous alternative dimension ruled by goddess and revenge Gia the Earth Goddess (a deliciously perverse portrayal of Gia Sandri) and confront various monsters in order to save the soul of his son. Meanwhile, Gia's equally mean son, Antaius (a perfectly detestable trick of Giovanni Cianfriglia) comes under the name of Hercules and takes control of an entire city as a cruel and ruthless tyrant. Director Maurizo Lucidi tells the captivating story at a steady pace while maintaining a serious tone. This film begins a bit slowly, but actually begins to cook once Hercules enters the world of foggy and perilous subterranean spirits: Highlights of Enthusiasm include Hercules battling a humanoid beast, the Hercules climbing a tree gnarled giant of the undead. Better yet, the weird world of minds is just pumping a scary atmosphere (must love this thick, persistent swirling fog!). The hard physical confrontation between Hercules and Antaius is also total. Of course, we also have a big global volcanic eruption. Allvaro Mancori's precise widescreen cinematography gives the film an impressive sense of range. Ugo Filippini's robust and catchy score has a pretty, majestic breath. Okay, so this movie is a cheap but cheap job that uses hearty footage of "Hercules in the haunted world" and "Hercules and captive women", but it's still an entertaining draft. and entertaining.
