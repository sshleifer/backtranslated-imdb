It's an excellent original romantic comedy about love, work, public taste and midlife crisis. The main character is a talented director who decides to make a silly PG-13 movie to get out of the hock with the IRS. He has an excellent cast, a wide range of humor (from the clip to the slide) and a refined writing. It is also a twisted wink of the film industry. The metacommentary includes several excellent cuts between the reality and the film in progress. In some places, the film departs from strict realism. The result is a multidimensional masterpiece of twisted humor of midlife.
