Based on the book "Space Vampires" by Colin Wilson. It's (in my humble opinion) one of the best pieces of Sci-Fi Horror of the eighties. The effects (made by ILM) still stand up to current standards. The actors are mostly British and being British seems to give this film a greater depth of realism. <br /> <br /> The film was criticized by critics and unfortunately did not manage to behave well at the box office on both sides of the Atlantic. Tobe Hooper attributed the promotional work done before its publication to the main cause of his low income. But for some reason, it does not detract from the fact that it is an excellent film with excellent distribution and a well-paced plot. <br /> <br /> Do not neglect.
