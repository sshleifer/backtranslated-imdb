Fantastic Russian film about the second world war. Like most Russian films of the Second World War, The Ascent is incredibly heartbreaking. It's as dense in its symbolism. The story follows two followers, Sotnikov and Rybak (Boris Plotnikov and Vladimir Gostyukhin), who go on a mission to search for food. During their trip, they are spotted by German soldiers, who wounded Sotnikov. Sotnikov, in turn, kills one of the Germans, which creates problems for the two partisans and all the others they meet later. The biggest success of the film is its keen sense of place. Russia is frozen and snow-covered, and it is hard not to feel that the cold is spreading directly to your own bones. Shepitko gets closer to the characters, examining each cliff of their face. It was probably not the choice, but the film is framed at 1.33: 1, which gives the film a sense of claustrophobia. Although the whole film is a feat, I had the impression that the first half was stronger than the second. My main complaint about the film is that it develops by its apogee into a very subtle Christian allegory. I simply do not think that symbolism adds much to the procedure, especially when the debate between the two partisans already intrigued me. That's not quite right. I weighed the pros and cons of their argument. I started to lean towards the point of view of a certain character, then the director came up and told me that he was Judas! Despite some procrastination, it's always a must.
