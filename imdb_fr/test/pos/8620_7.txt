The accounts seem real with a human factor added to the mix. A lot of sadness. I'm glad I'm not him ... Another thing to add is that not all the women on this show are really pretty stories of real women. But, I do not think it concerned women, although it was the passion of JFK Jr. It's a shame. any loss of life is a shame. <br /> <br /> Seems to be a good story of his life. I recommend it if you like biographies and melodrama!
