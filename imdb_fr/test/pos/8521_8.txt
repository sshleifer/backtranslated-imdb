In the late '70s, rumors began to circulate in the entertainment industry about Sean Connery's possible return to the role he made famous in 1962, James Bond. <br /> <br /> Cubby Broccoli was asked on the spot in Brazil during the realization of "Moonraker" by Barry Norman of the BBC, how he envisioned the prospect. Naturally, the producer was reluctant to commit to an opinion. <br /> <br /> At the first appearance of 'Moonraker', Bond fans were outraged by what they perceived as a depreciation of the character, The Wars movement, like "Live & Let Die ", had been created a few years ago with the craze for blaxploitation. Many have publicly expressed their hope that Connery will return, if only to show Eon what a real Bond movie should look like. <br /> <br /> Years of legal battles followed. The original script, titled "James Bond Of The Secret Service" (later renamed "Warhead"), written by Kevin McClory, Len Deighton and Connery, was never filmed and remains one of the big unrealized blockbusters. <br /> A new script, closer to the story of "Thunderball", has been ordered. It was written by Lorenzo Semple Junior, better known as the man who placed the camp in 'Batman'. He also wrote "The Parallax View", one of the finest thrillers of the decade for conspiracy. Connery told Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais, screenwriters of hit sitcoms "The Likely Lads" and "Porridge", the feeling of needing a British touch. The spiritual title was suggested by Connery's wife, Micheline. <br /> <br /> "Never say never again", opened just before Christmas 1983 to a shower of praise; Normally sensitive critics were so ecstatic at Connery's return that they ignored all other aspects of the film. Many have used it to viciously attack the Roger Moore series, especially this year's "Octopussy". In truth, "Octopussy" is superior in every respect. "Never" does not lack the excitement and spectacle that is associated with Bond. This sometimes looks like a T.V. movie. The story had been done before and better in "Thunderball" of 1965, so "Never" would always be ranked second. He was also embarrassed not to be part of the official series, which meant that Monty Norman's "James Bond Theme" and Maurice Binder's gun logo could not be used. <br /> <br /> As a Bond, Connery is gorgeous and effortlessly returns to his most famous role. Play Bond as an older and wiser agent worked. Barbara Carrera earned her best role in the film as a wicked "Fatima Blush", a lady whose love for murder is such that she dances after (thinks) after killing Bond. Kim Basinger poses as "Domino". As S.P.E.C.T.R.E. the agent 'Maximillian Largo', Klaus Maria Brandauer gives a scary performance. However, Max Von Sydow as "Blofeld" is a major disappointment. The posters gave the impression that he would be a major character. In fact, it only appears in a few scenes. With a stronger scenario, he could have been one of Bond's biggest villains. <br /> <br /> "Never" has promised to go back on Eon bonds such as "From Russia With Love", but has not kept its promises. The gadgets were there, but were used almost with excuses. Bond's rocket motorcycle was a tired gadget, even in the '60s. The film tried to compete with Eon's Bonds in terms of humor. Bonding himself by throwing his own urine sample on the face of an assassin is a ridiculous moment, as you will find in 'Moonraker'. But the nadir comes with the introduction of Rowan Atkinson as official agent of the Foreign Office, Nigel Small-Fawcett. He gives a performance so terribly horrible that you wonder if he thought he was in a Footlights review. <br /> <br /> The music of Michel Legrand is horrible, the man seems to have never seen a James Bond movie in his life. <br /> <br /> Although the film was a financial success, it appears years later as the weakest link of the 80s. Connery himself was disappointed and no longer played in a film for a few years. years. <br /> <br /> 1983 was a good year for the 007 maniacs, in addition to Connery and Moore's movies, George Lazenby made a delicious cameo in the made for TV "Return of the Man from America of North: The case of fifteen years later.
