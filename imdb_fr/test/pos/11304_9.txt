I must say that in general, Barbie Movies impressed me. My fanatical niece Barbie, 5, watches her all the time. Needless to say, I've seen quite a few Barbie holidays, but I'm not sick of them. visually, has a lot to offer, especially the backgrounds, and the animation of the characters has improved with each new movie. One thing I noticed in particular is a big improvement in the animation of Barbie's hair in this movie. It contains a nice range of classical music excerpts and I think it's great because it exposes a new generation to the classics. This film is worth it, especially if you have young bullpen. They will be entertained for hours!
