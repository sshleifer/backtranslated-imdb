When I saw this for the first time on tape, about 10 years after it was released, I thought it was one of the best James Bond movies. However, after seeing him again at the turn of the century, I was disappointed. <br /> <br /> I think it's a little overrated just because critics were so happy to see Sean Connery put an end to his 12-year break in Bond's role. that they did not dare to criticize the film. I guess what disappointed me was the end. After investing two hours in the movie, you expect a less hokey end and more satisfying. And that may sound irritating, but I was disappointed not to see regular actors in minor roles such as Miss Moneypenny, Q, Felix Leiter, etc. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, there were many unique action scenes, especially early, and the two bad guys were interesting. I thought Klaus Maria Brandauer was the most intriguing of the two because he was so discreet and looked like the "nice guy next door". He was not your usual bad Bond. <br /> <br /> That had a lot of "skin" for a PG movie, especially with Kim Basinger in the lead role, never being an actress known for hiding her figure. The language was very docile, but most of Bond's films are pretty good in this department. <br /> <br /> In total, it's a "fair" Bond and nothing else. It's not because Connery is in it that it's going automatically. Roger Moore and Pierce Brosnan have proven that they can also play this role.
