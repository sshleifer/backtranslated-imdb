This is one of my three favorite movies. My only complaint is that the director, Peter Yates, had too many cuts showing the actors individually rather than as a scene, but the performances were so great that I forgive him. absolutely wonderful brilliant. The scenario is excellent and gives a very good picture of life on the stage during the Second World War (and therefore the life of the 30s). Many beautiful subtle touches, many broad and overplayed features, all perfectly done. Scene after scene, I am completely blown away, and then there is the heartbreaking climax.
