It may be a little crunch now, and it certainly can never have the impact it once had, but it's still a thrilling reminder of what Michael Jackson could do once. Looking back for the first time since its initial visibility, I was not struck by the traps of horror - picturesque, but amusing, and Vincent Price never sounded as sincerely, as discreetly as possible - that his Absorption of the horror film, allowing Jackson, behind the genre and makeup, to give us a revealing portrait of male sexuality. <br /> <br /> Because THRILLER is not really horror, in the same way that horror is not about horror: it's about this age-old theme, the sexual awakening of 'a young woman. The film begins in a movie theater, with Jackson's girlfriend uncomfortable with the images and the aggressive gender reaction. Of course, she is at an appointment and she is less frightened by the film than she expects from her boyfriend. <br /> <br /> The traditional image of the film they watch, the group atmosphere suggest socially conditioned expectations. It does not just push her to think about the body with disgust - hence all the decaying ghouls; the loss of her virginity is seen as a kind of death - but the sexual rite does not only concern her boyfriend, but her peers, her society, hence her visualization as a gang violation. <br /> This is brilliant, which is disturbing, the best thing the director Landis has ever done. Jackson, the most popular artist on the planet, was always ready to show that the frozen image of a star contained multitudes that did not reassure everyone. The song itself stood remarkably well: frightening and insistent bass rhythms, extraordinarily salacious lyrics, beautiful 70's disco ecstasy following the chorus, breaking timelessness and revealing the milky desire behind fear.
