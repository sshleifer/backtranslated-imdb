Intruder in the Dust (1949) Director: Clarence Brown <br /> <br /> Production: MGM <br /> <br /> An excellent tale about Southern Gothic, adapted from the novel Faulkner, about a black man accused of murder of a white man, who asks a young white boy with whom he befriended to help him prove his innocence. Lucas Beauchamp (Juano Hernandez) is an anomaly in this small town. He is a black man who owns the land on which he lives and does not think much about the sick social order that keeps peace mainly in this small town. Thus, when Lucas is found with a pistol on the corpse of Vinson Gowrie, the young Chick Mallison (Claude Jarman) (that Lucas saved once after Chick fell through the ice while hunting on his lands) fears The city finally has the chance to "make Lucas a *****". Arrested, and with a very real chance of being lynched before the end of the night, Lucas asks for help from Chick, the only person he knows "without being cluttered with notions". Chick asks his uncle John, a lawyer, to defend Lucas. While the man is initially embarrassed by his own ideas, he accepts and opposes the crowd that is gathering to save Lucas' life. <br /> <br /> The film has a rare franchise for its time and is for the most part free of moralisation. The character of the lawyer tends to speak with an extremely conscious dialogue that looks like something on the printed page but has minimal impact on the tone. This is due to the rich characterization of all others. Juano Hernandez, who was especially featured in Oscar Micheaux's films, is superb as the proud Lucas. Porter Hall as the father of the murderer, perhaps the best role in which I have ever seen, and Elizabeth Patterson in a brave old woman sympathetic to the case of Lucas, remarkable in the supporting roles. The setting is perfectly realized. It's actually shot in Oxford, Mississippi, Faulkner's hometown. Brown also uses the crowd effectively, it's always an anonymous crowd facing only one person (like Lucas when he's arrested or John when he goes to his office), it's very threatening. Or the grotesque of the whole city gathering at the prison to attend the lynching as if it were a parade. It should be noted that the scene is absolutely fascinating when Chick and his friend Aleck collect evidence in a cemetery. Robert Surtees (The wicked and the beautiful, thirty seconds on TOKYO, BEN-HUR) took the picture. <br /> <br /> *** 1/2 of 4
