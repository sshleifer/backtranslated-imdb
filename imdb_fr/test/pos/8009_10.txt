I like full house and step by step. I do not have a favorite episode, I like certain scenes. but some scenes that I do not like but I want to say that the reason I started watching this show is because it contained Suzanne Summers. and my favorite character was Dana. and Karen could be snobby now and then, but she had good character too. I just like watching family shows instead of garbage that contains a lot of drugs and violence. This show is a bit like other family shows where one of the parents is still strict on curfews and dates. Aside from step-by-step, my other favorite shows are Full House, Sabrina, the teenage witch, Gomer Pyle Usmc, the show Andy Griffith, and the Dukes of Hazard.
