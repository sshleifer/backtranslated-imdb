I loved this film! The old school kick! Love the idea. Love the script. Love the characters. I really really liked the Geeks! I was excited to see stupid ridiculous horror movies always honored. It was just with my favorites like Saturday 14th and Pandemonium. If you are a big fan of scary AND silly, then this is your movie! Only removed a star because I would like to have a better sound. Not bad the sound but I would have liked to have more. Great splash of blood. Great weapons of murder. Great costumes! I really like the nod to the big 80s teenage stereotype at the breakfast club. And I can appreciate the non-CGI suspense. Really a good action of the camera and a slight suspense instead of cutting CGI format. I would prefer to have good fakes that really imitate. <br /> <br /> Kisses to actors and decision makers! Oh, I loved the making-of too!
