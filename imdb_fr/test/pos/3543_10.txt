When I read the synopsis of "Messiah" in the TV guide, I was not prepared for what was in store. The story follows DCI Metcalfe trying to solve a case of horrendous murders committed across London. He soon realizes a pattern, there is a serial killer in freedom, killing people with names and jobs similar to those of the 12 apostles and their killings are identical to those of their corresponding apostle. The two-part series kept me on the edge of my seat, with Metcalfe pursuing the murderer closely, but he still misses him a few seconds later and discovers the macabre mess he has left behind his victim. "The Messiah" will surely provoke a lot of controversy, but it is nevertheless the biggest drama that the BBC has shown for a long time.
