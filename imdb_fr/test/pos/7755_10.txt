I first heard about The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya by a reviewer on Youtube. He literally slapped the series with a big devil, condemning him to breakage and confusion. Curious, I decided to watch the show (once I understood the order of episodes, thanks to those who made the lists), and I found it absolutely great and enjoyable to watch. Great memorable characters, full of life and absolutely adorable and hilarious; a unique and not too breathtaking plot that makes sense now that I watched the series; and two of the best animated moments in history, in my opinion. In addition, the themes of openness and end are excellent. <br /> <br /> The anime, based on a collection of successful manga novels, follows a simple scenario, once you understand it. Although the series focuses on the main character, Haruhi Suzumiya, the point of view of his friend Kyon. Kyon is a high school student who does not really believe in the supernatural (eg, Santa Claus, extraterrestrials, time travelers, ghosts, espers), but he ends up talking to Haruhi, who is the most strange school. prefer to go out with a stranger, considering all worthless men. She even joined all the school clubs to find something interesting, but left as fast as she joined. On Kyon's "advice", Haruhi decided to create his own club with the Kyon club. Housed in the literary club room, Haruhi trains the SOS Brigade - his mission is to investigate supernatural matters (think Scooby-Doo minus the dog, the masked man and the mystery machine). <br /> <br /> Haruhi "recruits" three more members. The first is Yuki Nagato, a kind of bookworm who speaks very little and spends most of her time reading and sitting. The second is Mikuru Asahina, a shy girl whom Haruhi forced into the club and who thinks he needs a cute mascot to get things done. Haruhi often forces him to put on costumes to reinforce his kindness. The third is Itsuki Koizumi, a friendly and sociable transfer student, always smiling. While Haruhi thinks her group is full of normal people, she can not be more wrong. Although Kyon is as normal as possible, the other three are rather unique - Yuki is an extraterrestrial, Mikuru is a time traveler of the future and Itsuki is an esper (a person who has ESP). All three came to watch Haruhi, who might have the powers of a god. If she was bored, she might be able to discover her powers and create a whole new world, and Kyon is involved in one way or another. <br /> <The show deserves to be watched with great characters, music and hilarious and wonderful moments. However, for the parents, there are certain sexual references, including the cleavage of Mikuru exposed or touched several times, and several expletives also used. Apart from that, the show is one of the big ones.
