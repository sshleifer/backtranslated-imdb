Sure, when I saw this movie at HBO, I was a little erratic when I followed the plot, but it catches my eye when I saw Dustin Hoffman. Honestly, I'm not passionate about watching old movies, but in the long run it changes my point of view. Seeing this moving film, I found myself once again sitting in my seat, not noticing that my tears were suddenly running down my cheek, then, after giving out a sigh, realizing the impact of what I just see. Kramer vs. Kramer is indeed one of the best classic drama movies I've known for a long time and even I could not imagine how much it touched me. The story was highly emotional, but not so saturated. The characters were not unrealistic for their roles; they possess qualities that make viewers appreciate them regardless of their position in the film, such as the role of Meryl Streep. She was a mother who honestly conceded her mistakes in the past, but she was then sure to defend her emotional motives for what she wanted. in a fair and square battle. Dustin Hoffman was too remarkable, I can not even understand how this guy could play difficult roles and suddenly move on to another completely different role, and then played it well. Even though I've seen movies often before, when I'm at home and digitizing movies that are worth visiting and I'm saving time, watching Kramer vs. Kramer will make my experience an interesting one .
