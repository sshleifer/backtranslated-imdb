I had heard about this movie, but I had not seen it until my daughter, who saw it on a flight in Australia, told me it was a good movie. I wanted to know if Rupert Grint, away from Harry Potter, showed the promise you see in Potter's films. I was not deceived. He became a good actor, showing a range of driving lessons ranging from a shy boy beaten by an obsessing obsessive mother to a young man worthy of himself and others. By browsing the lines of plays and poetry with his old actor's employer, he is obviously ready to assume much more complex roles in the movies and the stage. But the jewel of this movie was Julie Walters. I had seen it in Potter, Billy Elliott and Calendar Girls movies, and I loved it. In Driving Lessons, just like poetry and Shakespeare, her timing, language skills, and body language impressed me. I hope it was a makeup / costume, because it portrays an elderly woman with osteoporosis, although no mention is made of it in the film - as a nurse, I can say that she did it perfectly, portraying a woman on the threshold of old age, but clinging to the sparkling past she loved. It's one of the best movies I've seen in a long time, and I wish I'd seen it at the movies first-but I doubt he ever played anywhere else in Albuquerque. We are missing so many of these types of movies here.
