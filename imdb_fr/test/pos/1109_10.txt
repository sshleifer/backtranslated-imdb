I watched this film at Glenwood cinemas over the weekend as part of the Kansas International Film Festival, which, as usual, provided a thoughtful and eclectic sample of world cinema. <br /> <br /> I have been a staunch supporter of Australian film for a number of years. So I was delighted to hear that this movie was included and I was certainly not disappointed. <br /> <br /> Superbly shot, firmly directed, it's the mysterious story of a man and his journey to the heart of darkness. It reminded me a bit of Lynch's Wild at Heart, it contains this strange madness, but I was stuck to the film for other reasons, namely that it presents a portrait of Australia that is ... well, very credible. <Br /> <br /> I went to Land Down Under several times, once in the 1980s and about 7 years ago with my wife. <br /> <br /> I do not want to explain my vacation too much, but director Frayne seems to have some idea of ​​what I find so strange and eccentric about Australia, the country responsible for the ends of, by for example, Nick Cave on the one hand, and Steve Irwin (the "crocodile hunter") on the other. <br /> <br /> A mysterious moan - I would have preferred even more unknown. Australia. Much more actually. But I also realize that there is only an hour and a half to do everything ... 'Sigh.' <br /> <br /> But overall, this movie is really very accomplished.
