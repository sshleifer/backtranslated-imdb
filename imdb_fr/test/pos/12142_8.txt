I only saw half a dozen movies with Lino Ventura, but this one looks a lot like the others. He plays a laconic criminal - a man short in words and mastered but sometimes explosive. Given his quiet personality in films such as ARMY OF SHADOWS and SECOND BREATH, I noticed that his minimalist style of play was extremely effective. In other words, because he is so calm and mannered, he tends to notice bad deeds. And, like these other movies, he also has a very strong moral code, albeit crooked. <br /> <br /> Abel Davos (Ventura) and her partner, Lilane, both live in Italy and are career criminals. Both grew up in France and eventually had to make a flea because of their criminal activities. Now in Italy, as the film begins, they continue to live the life of thugs and the heat is on to catch them. Strangely, instead of going to a third country, they decide to return to France - even if Davos has been tried and sentenced in absentia - and if caught, could mean life imprisonment or punishment of death. Much of the first third of the film is about their clandestine return. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately for Davos, the return is not perfect and now it seems that all the cops in France are looking for him. Moreover, the reaction of his former compatriots to the crime is not at all what he expected. In fact, their lukewarm response to his return ends up triggering a series of terrible events towards the end of the film. <br /> <br /> On the way, Davos meets and is taken home by a stranger, Eric Stark (Jean-Paul Belmondo). Although Davos apparently has no friends, Stark and his girlfriend do their best to make a successful comeback. What throws another snap in this case, however, are the two very young Davos sons - what Davos will he do with them - keep them with him in his hiding place? <br /> <br /> All in all, it's a very good detective film - a bit like the French Film Noir. Unlike American Black, the many French versions I've seen have a more realistic and darker vision. Fatalism reigns supreme, that's for sure! The acting is first rate (especially Ventura and Belmondo), the direction is very safe and the writing is very nice, although I am sure that many will not like the end. It just seems that we add a point of view. I understood why they did it that way, but I can also see how it could leave a lot of dissatisfaction. As for me, it left me a little flat. Otherwise, an exceptional film.
