My favorite story of "tales of the crypt". Brion Jones was born to play the role of the manic lumberjack, the crazy fool Steve Dixon. Having already seen it in Tango & Cash, I can say that this actor never got the credit he deserved. A jealous husband takes offense at his wife's interest in a young, hardworking man he has just employed. And you know, when Dixon finds out he's going to have to pay a lot! The young worker Ted (Billy Wirth) receives a powerful blow that escapes him. Now, how is a blind woodcutter supposed to work? A tribute to black humor if there is one! The co-stars also do a great job supporting Ted when Dixon has his first suspicions that his wife wants another man. Dixon's behavior reinforced the bond that united colleagues. It was even stated that he had become a changed man when he was married. Although Ted should have done the wise and left when he could!
