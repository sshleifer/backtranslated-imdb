I love dogs and the most interesting character of this movie is a Golden Retriever. He is smarter, more beautiful, and more interesting than any human character. Like many other contributors, I have not read the book, but I doubt that changing my opinion on the film. It's predictable from the first five minutes. No surprises. Crazy scientists create a monster that breaks loose and a teenage boy and his wonder dog collaborate to destroy it. Overall, the movie is a dog. But as I said, I love dogs and give this film a score of 7/10. Look at it if it's on TV, rent it if you're bored and nothing else will catch your eye, but do not buy it unless it's on sale.
