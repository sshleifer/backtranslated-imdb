First of all, this movie will not be for everyone. There are scenes of extreme graphic violence and "disturbing" images that, by their very nature, will dissuade many potential viewers. Obviously, according to the critics on this forum - SUBCONSCIAL CRUELTY has divided those who have seen it. I am among those who liked it for many reasons. I think it was a very ambitious company (and quite competent ...) for a group of 18/19 years without budget and with little experience. I think that every aspect of the film - the staging, the acting of the actors (even if the performances of the character are more like a staging or a free form because of the nature of the film ...), the production, the effects, the score / its design - all are far superior to many of the films I have seen that exceed the budget of these children and are ten times more experienced. Honestly, I have not been so impressed by a horror movie at the "art house" since GENESIS by Nacho Cerda ... <br /> <br /> First of all, I do not pretend everything understand or seize everything. the graphic content of this movie - but knowing that it was not a simple narrative-type film when I first entered the movie, I was not disappointed with the way it unfolded. SUBCONSIVE CRUELTY is composed of 4 relatively short vignettes that all revolve around the theory of right desire / left brain / anger / psychosis versus constraint / compassion / "normality". To summarize very briefly each "chapter": <br /> <br /> OVARIAN EYEBALL has just a naked girl who has an eyeball cut to the abdomen. I'm sure it's a symbol of something - I do not think I paid so much attention at that time and it explodes pretty quickly. <br /> <br /> The next "episode" - HUMAN LARVAE - is a nihilist story, horrible and truly terrifying of a guy both in love and rejected by his pregnant sister, who gives in to the growing psychosis that leads to the shocking conclusion of this particular chapter. HUMAN LARVAE is the best of the group in my book, and will probably put you under the skin. Play-free narrative dialogue accentuates the growing tension because you know that something horrible is going to happen - but you do not really know what it is. Do yourself a favor and if you are interested in seeing this movie - do not do too much research about it. Enter with an open mind and an iron stomach and I think you will be pleasantly surprised, especially with this episode. <br /> <br /> RENAISSANCE has a group of people in a field breaking down and blowing trees, etc. . Apparently, an "artistic" interpretation of the rape of the earth or something of the sort. Not bad, but this one is pretty short too and I kind of missed out on that ... <br /> <br /> And RIGHT BRAIN / MARTYRDOM seems to be about religion and religious hypocrisy and also with HUMAN LARVAE, a Some of the most "difficult" images / messages of the whole ... <br /> <br /> OVARIAN EYEBALL is not a writing subject, mainly because of the very short run, but allows a decent transition between the madness ahead ... and REBIRTH is also a bit short and not quite so challenging, but HUMAN LARVAE (in particular) and RIGHT BRAIN / MARTYRDOM are so out of sync and well done that they amply compensate the other parties. I think the main reason I liked this one so much is that, shocking as it is, "repulsive", "violent" and "excessive", it is also very beautiful and we can say that it is a real job- the love of those involved. Nothing in the film is cheap or rushed, and even if the content is not completely decipherable, it's undeniably original - and that's what stands out best in my book. Do not rent all the "weird" movies that have an incomprehensible plot for their "originality", but "CRUISE SUBSTANCE" is the type of movie that I think I'll watch a few more times in the near future. what other interpretations could I draw from it? Once again, this film is ABSOLUTELY not meant for everyone - with some VERY extreme scenes of gore, murder, rape, incest, sacrilegious images, etc ... that are certainly there to shock the viewer by looking at him more near. I have to say that it worked for me and I look forward to the Hussain / Cerda collaboration that is rumored to continue. Check this one if you have a stomach - 9.5 / 10
