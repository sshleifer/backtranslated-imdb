I just watched Nightbreed for the first time since I saw it at the theater almost 20 years ago and, although I remember having loved it at the time, I do not remember having was as blown away as today. I really can not complain about anything in this movie. Craig Scheffer is excellent as the main character of Boone. I never understood why he did not have such a successful career because most of his debut is remarkable. As good as Scheffer is, Cronenberg is even better. His portrait of psychopath Dr. Decker is unforgettable and steals the show. The rest of the cast, including Doug Bradley, is very good, apart from the ridiculous ridicule of sheriff redneck. The graphics are good and, in some cases, great. The score composed by Danny Elfman is as good as possible and is among his best works. The end was epic, with nonstop action for almost twenty minutes. Overall, Nightbreed is a great achievement for Clive Barker. This is my favorite movie, just a bit ahead of Hellraiser. 9/10
