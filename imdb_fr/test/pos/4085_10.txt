I do not usually like this kind of movie, but I worked at home and wanted something to look at halfway. I was so absorbed that I stopped working just to sit down and finish watching the last half an hour without interruption. And of course, I do not usually cry in front of this kind of show, but I cried at the end. A lot of emotional nuance. Good acting and good southern feeling. John Corbett is one of the most talented actors of the moment, and the guy who played Luke was also very good. Strongly recommend.
