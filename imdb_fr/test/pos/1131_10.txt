I must say that I thought the Greek show would be really ridiculous and stupid. Since I'm part of a sorority, I did not want them to make the Greek organizations look bad .... <br /> <br /> but I think the Greek is hilarious. Yes, they have stereotypical sorority and brotherhood but it's not mocking but just a cute humor. <br /> <br /> All the characters are very friendly less Rebecca Logan (I can not stand her), Casey and Rusty have good chemistry as brother and sister. Then there is Cappie. Who does not like a guy like Cappie haha? His character brings a lot to the series. Rusty's roommate Dale played by Clark Duke is also hilarious. <br /> <br /> It's really fun to watch so get tuned for season 2. I can not wait to find it !!
