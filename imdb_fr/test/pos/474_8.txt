Some people are born with souls in mourning with their song sung singularly until they meet another soul as tortured and / or beauty as sweet as theirs and unusual magic occurs. YOU ARE ALONE is a brutally honest look at two tortured souls who intermingle for a moment of understanding and unity, but who are torn apart by the differences that unite them in suffering. Death is explored figuratively and literally. This is what happens when one's soul is dead or in the same way, too alive, too awake to reality. It's PAS life that you have imagined behind the eyes of passers-by. This film explores our pain at all, the frown beneath the playful facade, the pain underneath. The instinctive and ugly animal acts and thoughts become honest and de facto, then Bechard adds a hint of unexpected innocence and beauty to the mix, knowing that both linger in all of us. Bechard, the writer, is an expert observer of the human condition and, because of his uncritical attitude, presents life in a day that we often protect our eyes but want to see and understand. As a director, he focuses on the nuances of the actors' minds that are reflected in the character they play and the personal familiarity of the actors with the emotions aroused by each situation. It is the most faithfully written and directed representation of the experience of a man and a woman that I have met yet, even if the encounter between these two characters is probably not the "normal" encounter. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack encapsulates In each song, what characters would let their hearts blossom if they could and if it was strong enough. This is the real voice of each character sung through the beauty, pain, talent and emotional intelligence of independent beginner artists ready to explode in the alternative music market. The ideal soundtrack for those of us who have problems - those of us who admit that we have problems and those of us who hide them. <br /> <br /> I always enjoy exploring the darker aspects of life with Mr. Bechard's fascinating two. creative and realistic vision of life and the characters that evolve there.
