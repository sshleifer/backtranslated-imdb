I was one of the few who did my best to see this in the theater. I have often thought of it since. After two DVDs, I'm happy to say that it has held up perfectly. Like any good comedy, I laugh more at each viewing, both in anticipation of gags, but also after catching things missed before. <br /> <br /> Mike Judge is very successful in creating incredibly funny characters and integrating them into their world to make sense. In Office Space, the environment makes characters believable. The future of Idiocracy gives him the freedom to write and operate incredibly stupid characters. I will wait to see if they release a better DVD with some real features before buying it. But this film deserves the support on DVD which is not offered to him at the theater.
