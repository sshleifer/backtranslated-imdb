This film is an excellent example of what an independent film can be. The director does a great job on the distinction between emotional and physical violence. But in the end, he remembers what so many independent films have forgotten: he tells a good story. Watching this movie, I remembered how much of Hollywood's big-budget movies had become shy and mundane. <br /> <br /> The remarkable performance of Jorge Cordova, the main actor of the film, is particularly remarkable. As an evil thug (on the way to crime), Cordova plays a S.O.B. an accomplice, brutal, vain, sordid and suspicious, but he is so friendly that he will entertain you all the time. <br /> <br /> I read somewhere that these guys were part of the new wave of Latino filmmakers in Los Angeles - called La Nueva Obra, or something like that. Anyway, this movie makes you want to see more of their works. <br /> <br />
