I heard that after the first Oceans movie, the suites begin to deteriorate. I think this is not the case (at least not for this film). This movie is even better than the first movie! The original crew is back three years after successfully stealing Terry Benedict's casinos. Now, Benoit visits each of them to ask them to get the money back within two weeks. To do this, they have to do some hold-up in Europe to get the money. <br /> <br /> The acting game is very good. The distribution of stars exceeded expectations. Matt Damon, Brad Pitt and Catherine Zeta-Jones were probably the best of this movie. <br /> <br /> There are moments of confusion in this film. But that does not matter because there are only a few moments of confusion. Anyway, this movie is only for harmless pleasure. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's a great movie for the robbery. I note this film 9/10.
