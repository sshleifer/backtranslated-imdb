Produced in the same year as the first Lumi√®re films, it is a much more dramatic short film than the one the brothers tried to achieve until "Niagara" the following year. The engraving that remains is very rough, but it only adds to Turneresque's visual violence, as large waves of water rush against a solid pier and seem ready to overwhelm the camera, the viewer. <br /> <br /> If you watch A number of these short films, arranged in chronological order, and trying to stay in the spirit of the times, cause an additional shock in that, unlike single-frame configurations Enlightenment, this film has a montage that, for me, Anyway, it was as sharp as the razor blade in 'An Andoulu Dog). <br /> <br /> Unlike the unique vision of Enlightenment films, Paul opens up the possibility of multiple perspectives, freeing the viewer from the power of nature, beyond his reach as the Enlightenment could never. The second shot has a similar thrust to that of Niagara, but is less frightening because, thanks to editing, we avoided the danger. In a film like "The Arroseur Arrosse" or "Baby meal", the nature remains indifferent and powerful, uncontrollable in front of the camera. The film's basic grammar puts an end to its supremacy.
