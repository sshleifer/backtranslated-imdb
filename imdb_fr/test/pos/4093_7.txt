I have to make up for all the terrible comments. I love that movie. I own the movie and the soundtrack. I watch it every time I need a relay. Admittedly, it's not like the melody of music, but it's also fun if choosing to play in the cinema is not your business. I loved the late (and excellent) Bobby Vann, and James Shigeta has always been and always will be a favorite. I saw that when he first went out to theaters. I am a big fan of music and this one is 100 times better than Twiggy in "The Boyfriend". It's a modern musical and should not be judged by anything that has happened before. It's just what's best for dreamers like me who want to be able to find this place: no sickness, no war, no drugs, all the bad things in life are gone. It's nothing more than a good movie. That's what all movies should be. The title song of Shaun Phillips is superb and explains the whole sensation of the film. If the acting is not the best, we do not care. I like the idea of ​​the movie. Peter Finch, a very stiff actor, Liv Ullmann, beautiful as always, Sally Kellerman, a surprisingly good voice, Michael York, typical and Olivia Hussey, beautiful, convinced me that they were ordinary people. None of them behaved like an actor in a movie. They acted like real people, as I would if I found this place. Torn between going home and staying there, impressed by everything. Yes, there are flaws in this movie, but remember, it's not Citizen Kane, it's a good musical!
