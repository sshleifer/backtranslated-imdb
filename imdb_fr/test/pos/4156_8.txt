A few days ago, in Rome, a young Romanian with a criminal record assaulted and tortured to death a middle-aged woman who was returning home after an afternoon of shopping. A young Romanian girl, who had seen everything, told what had happened. <br /> <br /> This is why she launched a debate on the excessive flow of immigrants from Romania, generalizing them as criminals, without any distinction. > <br /> I'm only 15 years old, but I thought: what idea of ​​abundance does Italy give to these poor people? How do they ever see us as the land of plenty? Last night I finally saw NUOVOMONDO and my question had an answer. When you only have a donkey and goats, these propaganda postcards showing the United States as a land with rivers of milk and huge vegetables give such an impression. <br /> <br /> NUOVOMONDO is really a must-see movie. He balances an ethereal symbolism (rivers of milk, glances, hard and rocky mountains, name and character of Lucy / Luce) and a cruel realism (the mass of hope on the ship, the procedures at Ellis Island). There is a mixed cast, ranging from the angelic Charlotte Gainsbourg to the realist Vincenzo Amato, to Aurora Quattrocchi, a bitter and overwhelming woman. But was it really so difficult to enter the New World?
