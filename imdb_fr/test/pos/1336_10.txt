I just called my brother Paulie on the phone and he told me he was looking at Hoods and it was funny. So, as I said, never go against the family! The demand for more lines is acceptable because I like to express my own opinions quite often. If something is misspelled, it's probably my sight and not my brain. This gives me another chance to take my shots at "The Departed". When you know exactly what will happen in the last scene without any prior knowledge, it usually means that it was not so suspicious. All you need is a good director of the same type, I believe, who shot my favorite movie, "Goodfellows", but in a totally different way. I have to see hoods to make sure it was not better than "The Departed" Gibbs
