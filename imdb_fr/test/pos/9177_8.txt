-Love is hard to find in this fast food company in which we live. The man called Hitch makes it his duty to help men find love with women they are madly in love with. his rules are that he only helps you to find love and not just an occasional sex that seems a lot, but soon the word starts to spread and people start to get a wrong idea of ​​what he's doing, what who is starting to complicate the relationship with the woman I have come to know that he is madly in love with. <br /> <br /> -I must say that it's really nice to see Will Smith in a movie where he's not trying to save the world from aliens or robots. There is no falling effect of the jaw and it does not show his body strengthened. He is just a normal human being in this movie that was really nice. It does not necessarily stretch his acting skills in this film but, again, the story does not claim but it was still nice to see him relaxed and not to show his body torn to make us jealous. . His character here is like all his friendly, witty and charming characters, which almost all the characters in this strange love story seem to share. The character of Kevin James is just an ordinary guy who needs help meeting the girl of his dreams, which makes you really feel for him and root for him every step of the way. the only character that has been a sore spot for me is Mendez's character because she's so cold and calculating that it's hard to believe Smith could fall in love with her. He must like challenges, I suppose. <br /> <br /> - this is now the part of the review in which I'm going to make a joke about the fact that I would never need Hitch because I'm a player I wrote about 16 reviews for another website and I'm still working on a small project, so I'm a little jaded right now. While the film is full of charm and friendly characters with amusing lines, it falls slowly but surely into the sea stereotypical romantic movies in which, after the big scene where the terrible secret is revealed, everyone is forgiven and the relationship is even better than before. But hey, there are about 4,000 films on the underdog that overcomes adversity, so I guess another film with a predictable end that was made until death does not cause much harm. I also really like the message of the movie because in the end, you do not need a formula to find the right girl, but be yourself and everyone will play in the movie theme and why it works so good. I'm sure if it turned out that James's character was getting the girl after following all that Smith's character said, the movie would have been pretty empty, but as it stands, it works really well . <br /> <br /> Despite its predictability, it is a PERFECT date film. It's sweet, it's funny and it's romantic, so anyone watching this movie to date should have it after. and by some I mean sex
