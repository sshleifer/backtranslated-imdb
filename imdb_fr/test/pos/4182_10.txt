When I saw this film for the first time, I also expected that "our boys" would be cute and look more like a long version of the TV show. I did not "understand" at the time. But, years later, at a party, in the 1970s, in the 1970s, where some substances had been smoked, inhaled and with a lot of tequila, "HEAD" was late. realized what "HEAD" was all about. He usurped his own show, as shown by a song called "a fabricated image". As Davy Jones wrote in his autobiography, "They made me a monkey," he openly admits that everyone in the movie had spent all night smoking grass. They made fun of themselves, of society, of everything! A good film! However, as a 52 year old grandma, I do not "give up", I still watch this movie when I want a good LOL!
