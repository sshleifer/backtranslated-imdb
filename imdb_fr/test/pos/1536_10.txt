"Closet Land" tells a powerful story and has many subtle elements. You can read a lot about the plot of the movie, but you do not really need it. All you need to know is that the film is about an interrogation. Along the way, we learn a lot about the interrogator and the interviewee. We also learn that the world can be a dark and scary place. Especially when you have absolutely no control over it. <br /> <br /> Finally, the film is a warning (although the film has many different aspects) about what happens to people's freedom when they "look on the other side" and ignore the injustices committed around you. <br /> <br /> If you have about an hour and a half and you know where you can rent this room, I highly recommend it.
