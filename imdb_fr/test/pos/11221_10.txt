After careful reflection on this film, I find it far too easy to consider this as the boy's dream. In fact, I have received some spiritual strength from Northfork ....... Angels exist ... we are really entertained by angels ... most of the time we are not even aware of it. .. At a time of spiritual and emotional turbidity in my life, personally, I really needed this movie. Yes, as I wrote before, he talks to so many people ...... I can not wait to go to heaven ... <br /> <br /> "I'm sick of all FX effects and formulas, I found this film to be a real movie theater, all I can say is that it has touched me in so many ways, that I'm still fixing everything. North Fork is a wonderful film, it allows the viewer to take the spirit out of the gutter, the heart, the spiritual aspect intrigues me so much, be careful, you will need to use the brain and the heart that God has given you to follow the story, I think it may be a bit beyond the heads of some, but I feel that these are the people he is talking to the most about, and I want to watch it a few more times, that I can understand everything! <br /> <br /> The industry must study this film to realize our existence. <fr /> <br /> I thank all those who participated in the making of this film.
