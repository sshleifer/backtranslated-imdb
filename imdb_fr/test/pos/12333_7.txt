As part of an initiation farce, Julie (Meg Tilly Psycho 2) must spend the night in a mausoleum, but Karl Rhamarevich, a master of telekinesis, died recently and was put inside. When Julie's sorority sisters profane where he was lodged, the real terror begins. <br /> <br /> This little film had a good dose of atmosphere and I enjoyed the accumulation, the last twenty minutes are just great. Anyone looking for a lost jewel of a 1980s horror movie does not have to look any further. Very under appreciated. Plus, Elizabeth Daily is adorable. <br /> <br /> My note: B <br /> <br /> Supplements for Media Blaster DVD: Disc 1) Comments from director Tom McLoughlin and co-author Michael Hawes; and trailers of "The Being", "Franky, Bloody Terror", "Just Before Dawn" and "Devil Dog" (Disc 2). Montage of the alternate director (almost unassailable because of a bad impression) and featurette behind the scenes.
