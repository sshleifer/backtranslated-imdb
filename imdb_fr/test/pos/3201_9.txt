I guess I did not really know what to expect from this movie, there was a good cast, an interesting story and many other things waiting for it, but I still could not shake the feeling of fear that I had in my stomach about what it would be. I am happy to say that I was very happy with the result and that I regret to worry about it from the beginning. The opening scenes of the films were extremely intriguing and were enough to spark an early interest in the film. As the film progressed, we discovered the characters in the film, as well as what happened during the riots in the prisons. Like most critics for this film, I must admit that there are some tedious clich√©s, but it can not erase the general power of this film that reads like a good novel. The actors are all great, especially Chestnut and McGowan, and the film ranks among the best films for television this year. It is certainly worth watching if you are looking for a good audience drama.
