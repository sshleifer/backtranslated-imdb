This happens often, growing up, a Hollywood movie impresses a young person. It does not only last a lifetime, but inspires him to study ancient cultures as a career. Such was the case with the 1954 film entitled "The Egyptian". The audience was impressed by the sets, costumes and the quality of the game, so other films quickly followed. This is the story of an Egyptian boy whose parents were left sooner after his birth. With such a dubious beginning, it's not hard to wonder why he will spend his life asking questions. The Sinuhe boy, (Sin-oh-way), which means "He who is alone" (Edmund Purdom), becomes an adult and continues to ask why, even though he graduated from School Of Life to become a doctor . During his formative years, he acquires an ever-lasting friend called Kaptah (Peter Ustinov) and Horemheb (Victor Mature), who moves from a simple guard officer to the commander of the armies. His life has everything for him, be it a rise in social power, a convict sentenced to an outcast, a healer marveled and finally to a position in which he did not expect. The fine roles go to Jean Simmons with Merit, Michael Wilding in Akhnaton, Bella Darvi as a temptress, Nefer and John Carradine as a memorable thief. Tommy Rettig plays Thoth, the son of the Egyptian. In his last years, "The One Who Is Alone", finally discovered the answer he had sought all his life, bequeathed to his son, now supported by his friend forever. Excellent movie! ****
