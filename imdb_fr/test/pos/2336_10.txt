I liked this movie since I saw it for the first time at the theater. Some movies have a cast of characters and a scenario that marry in perfect synergy, and this is one of them. The characters illustrate some of the truths about getting the best out of people, working together harmoniously, building a team and achieving goals without ever preaching morals. The situations are well prepared and are compatible with the premise of the film. The tension goes up well and the humor is clear and constant. The film manages to pull me straight into the roots of the characters and laugh well. It's a film that feels good and comes. <br /> <br /> What surprises me is that a film that seems so simple can be as entertaining in the long run. The music is a perfect copy of the typical music of the post-war Navy films, which helps to create humor and emphasize that grandeur is in the eye of the beholder. The scenes in the credits are an excellent clip of "In the Navy", which deserves its own special feature in full screen. The scenes and sets are well designed, and the casting and the acting are going well. <br /> <br /> This film is a classic as big as ever, unpretentious. In fact, lack of pretension is what makes it so much fun to watch. I like these guys and this girl. <br /> <br /> The other day I thought about the movie and wondered if it was available on DVD. Luck came to us, and the DVD came out in May 2004. I headed for the store and took a copy. Then my wife and I had another hilarious night in front of the big screen. I rated this film as a 10 because it meets at all levels, much better than many big budget movies and Oscar winners. It's an entertainment. <br /> <br /> Listen to Fox's personal video: you have a good movie in your safes, and it's a shame to find a cheap DVD with very degraded colors only 8 years after its release. So, why not restore the colors and present the film as it was supposed to be? I would gladly pay a few extra dollars to understand the situation. I am grateful to have my own copy. Give us now the pleasure that the film deserves, and how about recreating the credit sequence as a special full-screen music video feature.
