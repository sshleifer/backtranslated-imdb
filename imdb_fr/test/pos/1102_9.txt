I saw this movie through one of the actors' agents, and it certainly corresponds to a lot of things coming out of Sth. Australia in terms of * your general *, which is rightly gloomy and gloomy. <br /> <br /> I thought the little boy in the movie was excellent. Most of the young actors are * pummeled * and embarrassing, but not in this case. He was really very good. As for jingo's * surrealism * stuff, well, I think this movie is just "weird". It's a real weird movie, with weird places, a screenplay, weird stuff all the time. But "good" weird as opposed to "bad". <br /> <br /> It's hard to think of other movies like this, but it's not at all like CARS ATE Paris, maybe more like a REPULSION, but actually I think more like a Hammer movie from the 60s. He certainly has an interesting spirit behind him. <br /> <br /> JINGO, My question also concerns the title. Why modern love ?? Anybody? Also, jingo, what did you mean by "abandoned god" when you were talking about Australia, hmmm? Just curious
