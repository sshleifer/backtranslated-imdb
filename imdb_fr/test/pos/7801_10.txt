Andaz Apna Apna is a movie that I love and its only movie, I do not mind to see at any time ... well almost all the time! This film is simply wonderful and is in my opinion the funniest movie I have ever seen! And yes, I put it on Hera Pheri ... right? Hera Pheri has scenes that you will watch but Andaz Apna Apna? Not possible! Simply because each scene is a scene to which you must pay attention! Aamir and Salman share a great chemistry and are perfect in their skin, but I will rank the characters in order of favoritism: <br /> <br /> Rank # 1. The crime master Gogo (best performance of Shakti Kapoor up to on the date and before the casting): Gogo is an innocent character who belongs to the well-known family of Mogambo (celebrity of Mr. India). Crime Master Gogo is in fact Mogambo's nephew, but for Mogambo, he is more than a charming, responsible, beautiful and charismatic son. Gogo makes the biggest mistake of his life by lending 36,000 rupees to Teja (as Balla said, "A cheat and a cheater!"). From now on, the only goal of Gogo is to find his future and find the money he has lost. Gogo realizes that he has more than 36,000 left to reach and begins like this ... Gogo's fight against the sinful world. <Br/> <br /> Rank # 2. Teja (Teja Hoon Hand, Mark Idhar Hai!): Teja is an evil character who is the twin of Ram Gopal Bajaj. Originally named Shyam Gopal Bajaj, Teja chose to change her name to suit her personality. Teja, like a child had always envied his brother and then one day, things got worse when his father gave all his fortune to Ram Bajaj. Teja decided to kill her father but in the darkness of the night, rather killed Munshi Harish Chandra (Raveena's father), although Teja does not regret his actions. Teja's only mission now is to reclaim her property and create her own poultry and bakery farm. Teja must also repay the loan to Gogo (but has no intention of doing so). To achieve his evil goals, Teja employs two people: Robert (Vijay Khote, who is very good at aiming) and Balla (Shahzad Khan, the clone and son of Ajit ... who is a very smart boy!) <Br # 3. Amar (Aamir Khan): wants to marry the rich heiress Raveena. So he sells his father's cheap salon and goes to Mumbai. Amar has no problem dealing with the big deal that Raveena's father will give him after their wedding and is ready to sacrifice his happiness and travel to London, if necessary. <br /> <br /> Rank # 4. Prem (Salman Khan): Prem is the second most innocent character to appear in the movie after Gogo and the way Amar tries to take him under a friend's mask is tragic. <br /> <br /> I won 'Do not reveal more characters because Jesus Christ! I will not stop typing! The film is absolutely beautiful! Go get the DVD now and beware of these cheap VCDs, as they have omitted many good scenes from the movie. <br /> <br /> The background music is a stud and the action is better than the Matrix, especially the final encountered. between Prem and Crime Master Gogo (attention), it appears in the climax. Andaz Apna Apna is also a drama with many negative and positive characters and teaches us a lot about life, values ​​and ethics. This teaches us bravery (why else, Amar would ask Prem to stay when they go to meet the kidnapper, even though Prem complained about having to go to the bathroom ???). Andaz Apna Apna is also a tragedy, especially the scenes where Salam is targeted by Aamir and receives an overdose of pills that upset the stomach. The part where Teja reveals his sad feelings about why he could not go to London and where Gogo is arrested at the end, without even recovering his 36,000. Andaz Apna Apna is globally a complete package. ... sit back and enjoy the ride! Bet there will be a second round after that ... and a third after! <br /> <br /> At the time, the movie was considered a flop and I bet no one liked it, but girded the belt! This film is a great success! Although there were not enough people in theaters, the movie is one of the best-selling DVDs at home and one of the most-frequently-watched movies on most channels. Producers have been mocking banks for a long time!
