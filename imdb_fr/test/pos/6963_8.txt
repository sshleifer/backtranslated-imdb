The beautiful and fatal Alexandra (Stacie Randall, beautiful blonde and sculptural beauty, who looks completely fucked in a black leather outfit) must find a magical amulet so that her evil demonic master Faust can penetrate our dimension. Jonathan Graves (the friendly Peter Liapis) has to stop him. Meanwhile, two pitifully funny creatures of "dwarf gnomes" are unleashed in Los Angeles. Jim Wynorski, a veteran schlock farmer, tells the story extremely stupidly at a brisk pace and does not take any of this nonsense lightly. The actors struggle with the silly material: the adorable Barbara Alyn Woods in the impertinent role of Captain Kate, Raquel Krelle in the role of the police, the sexy bitch Jeanine, Bobby Di Cicco in the role of Scotty, exciting partner of Graves , in the role of Monica and Ace Mask as the cheerful Dr. Rochelle. Mark Stevi's childish cookie cutter script, a bewildering sense of humor, Chuck Cirino's hopping Chuck score, the two dwarves wearing cheap rubber Halloween masks, JE's simple cinematography Bash, no tension or feminine nudity, strictly speaking. the sticky special effects (less than) all enhance the delicious cheese taste of this top slice of Velveeta celluloid. A piece of adorable drunk, brainless, entertaining.
