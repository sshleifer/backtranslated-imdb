If you have nothing better to do, then rent this movie, it's smart, it's funny, it will definitely keep your attention in mind for a moment. <br /> <br /> I discovered him while surfing on chains in a boring Sunday, it was on the cable, and for the faces I saw, I thought it was worth it, it made me laugh and for a movie on a Sunday with nothing else on TV, it was good. <br /> <br /> Liv Tyler looks amazing in the movie, although his role is not what I expected, it's a little bad for the game and for the rest of the team , I loved Reba in his role as Dr. I found it interesting to see the guy from the sitcom "What I like about you" playing the role of an almost gay lawyer. <br /> <br /> As for J. Goodman, I found it, as always a very good performance, Michael Douglas plays a small role, but its characterization was difficult for me to identify it. <br /> <br /> It's also a good movie to watch in company.
