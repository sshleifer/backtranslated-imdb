The 2005 Royal Rumble was broadcast live from the Save Mart Center in Fresno, California. The two best WWE championships were defended, The Undertaker fought Heidenreich in a Casket match, Shawn Michaels faced Edge in a grudge match that had been going on since last October and, of course, everyone for himself. The Royal Rumble Rope agrees well. Who would take the prize this year? Chris Benoit? Edge? Eddie Guerrero? Edge? John Cena? Batista? Edge? Shawn Michaels? The suitors were not lacking. <br /> <br /> It was Batista who won the popular victory in the main battle, but not without controversy, or should I say, a failed arrival. Batista and John Cena were the last two men in the ring. Batista was supposed to empty the young Smackdown! star on the top rope but everything went wrong and they both fell to the ground. The referees acted upright when we held a competition similar to that of Bret Hart and Lex Luger in 1994. That led the chairman of the board. Vinnie Mac headed to the ring as he could but hurt badly as he entered the ring. It was unusual to see Vince McMahon seated, legs apart, inviting the two men to resume the match. Batista then did what he was supposed to do for the first time and threw Cena on the ground to seal his own future with a championship game at WrestleMania 21. <br /> <br /> This year's sub-card Royal Rumble had a very strong line with most of the WWE's biggest stars competing. Each brand had two big matches each. <br /> <br /> Raw opened the night with the match between Shawn Michaels and Edge. It was a good technical contest. Fourth and last until Edge has the flag. It was a smart booking decision that kept Edge one of the contenders for the World Heavyweight Championship. <br /> <br /> The second match of the evening was the last battle of Casket between The Undertaker and Heidenreich. The match was not a classic, but did he still have classic Casket matches? It was fun. Especially when Snitsky was involved and Kane then pulled out the coffin to become a super pop. The Undertaker surprised no one when he won, putting Heidenreich and that mediocre conflict on his own. <br /> <br /> The first of two games of the night was John Bradshaw Layfields, defender of the WWE Championship in a Triple Threat against Kurt Angle and the Big Show. This match was very good. Again, not a classic but entertaining all the same. JBL took the win after pinning Kurt Angle. His celebration, however, was short-lived when, behind the scenes, Long informed him at No Way Out that he would defend the WWE Championship in a Barbed Wire Steel cage match with Big Show. It's not a very good way to spend the night on Sunday. <br /> <br /> And of course, there is no show without a punch. Punch of course as world heavyweight champion Triple H. His 2004 Unforgiven rematch with Randy Orton was much better than the original match. Too bad, because they do not seem to be comfortable in the ring and it would be an excellent quarrel if they did. Orton played the role of the concussion very well and lost to The Game. <br /> <br /> The first big game of 2005 was so good. He achieved his goals. Feuds finished and new ones started. We were now officially on the road to WrestleMania 21.
