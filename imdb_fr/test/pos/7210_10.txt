If you've never been "tromatised", it's the Troma movie to see first. A mind-blowing action game, a super-charged soundtrack and bust-a-gut humor blend perfectly with Troma's unique brand of storytelling and special effects. Although he remains faithful to Romeo and Juliet, the fact that he stays in iambic pentameter gives you the weird impression that it is closer to Shakespeare than this excessive video clip with DiCaprio and Danes. I assumed that I had seen the ultimate Shakespearian comedy when Moonlighting's casting had been reviewed, but nothing was nearing Tromeo and Juliet. I highly recommend the DVD version, which contains a second audio track with director Lloyd Kaufman, which is just as entertaining as the main track.
