I chose "The English Patient" for an additional credit transfer in history. I thought this movie would be incredibly boring. Instead, he became one of my favorites. He accurately describes the life of the Second World War and the love story is incredible. The love story made the movie so amazing. I felt this interesting feeling, passion or something like that. It made me want to watch the movie again and again. Kristin Scott Thomas and Ralph Fiennes are incredible actors and the way they played their characters is incredible. The wonderful look together and actually seemed to be in love. I recommend this film to anyone looking for a movie to watch as a leisure activity or for a mission.
