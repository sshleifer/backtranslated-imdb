The musical comedy from the 1979 film HAIR was vaguely inspired by the infamous Broadway musical of the 1960s, which became famous for its infamous nudity scene. The musical on stage is not really more than a group of skits juxtaposed with fun musical numbers; However, director Milos Foreman (who won an Oscar for making ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST) and the writers took up the basic principles of the play and the score and built a real story to make the show more "friendly". the big screen. In the film, the naive farmer Claude Hooper Buchowski (John Savage) is about to join the army and decides to spend a few days in New York where he meets a group of aging hippies (Treat Williams, Dorsey Wright, Annie Golden, Don Dacus) who drag him into a group of delusional mishaps, including the pursuit of a girl from the pretentious society (Beverly D'Angelo). The story is divided into a series of vignettes ranging from ridiculous to sublime, but it is beautifully photographed with a clever use of New York venues and imaginatively staged musical numbers (remarkably choreographed by the legendary Twyla Tharp). Treat Williams illuminates the screen as Berger, the unconventional and free-spirited hippie who does his best for Claude to relax and goes with the scene by Savage in the role of Claude, who brings a sweetness to the role of Claude. Annie Golden is a charmer because Jeannie, pregnant pregnant hippy Wright or Dacus, does not know who is the father and does not seem to care. There is an outstanding musical number after another here ... "Aquarius" is a tour of Central Park that includes dancing horses ... Treat Williams disrupts a sumptuous dinner in "I Got Life" ... "Black Boys / White Boys "Nell Carter and Ellen Foley, both vaunted, extolling the ethnic virtues of men, and" Easy to be Hard ", a powerful rendition of one of the best songs in the series, by Cheryl Barnes, singer and songwriter. ex-girlfriend and Wright's mother of his child. This is a beautifully photographed, well interpreted, performed and danced movie of a psychedelic acid movie that must be seen and once seen, will initiate multiple viewing, as this dazzling has a lot to offer to capture all of that in one show.
