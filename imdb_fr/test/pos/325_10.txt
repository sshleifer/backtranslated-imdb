This film is absolute gold. If you have not seen it, do it. Mani Ratnam stands out once again. This film also introduced me to Nandita Das, although everyone shines in this film. My only regret is that I have never found a copy with subtitles for the lyrics of the songs. We are led from the jungle of northern Sri Lanka to the serene beaches of southern India, as well as from the terror of war to ultimate conquest for the love of the human heart. Beautiful, subtle, witty, with some hidden surprises for the viewer, this film resists being seen and reviewed again and the history of the story, The Umbrella, is so well done, as we see the scene unfold from drawings in a book. Charming. Look at this.
