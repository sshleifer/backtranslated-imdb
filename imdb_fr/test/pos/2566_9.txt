then you will be a big fan of this movie. It's almost the same basic concept, a good mix of music, soul and drama. I admit that I was a little afraid to see this movie. I had only seen one white trash girl chained to a radiator. But I'm a big fan of Samuel L. Jackson and I enjoyed Hustle & Flow, so I thought I'd give him a chance. <br /> <br /> I am very happy to have done it. It turned out that it was not just the story of a young nymphomaniac girl trapped by a 60-year-old black man. The story had heart and was very influential. <br /> <br /> The music of this film has also brought a nice touch. Craig Brewer mixed his style of Hustle & Flow in this film, except that he took a new twist and used the Blues. His music scenes are always at the top of the charts in terms of performance scenes. It also has very interesting flashback scenes and gives you a feeling of general madness during more controversial scenes. <br /> <br /> Without a doubt, if you liked Hustle & Flow, you'll love this movie, and if you like you're a fan of blues, you really should go see that. I give him a very interesting movie 9 out of 10, and he is extremely underrated. shame. <br /> <br /> Go out and rent this movie.
