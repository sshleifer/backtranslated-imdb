I always knew that the day was coming. We all knew. There is so much oil in the soil, and one day we will miss it. But is there not enough coal to use instead? And wind energy, or something like that. What worrying future generations. <br /> <br /> Then this documentary hit me. Oil makes fertilizer, which is the reason for the first time in the history of the world, virtually no one lives on farms. When the inevitable oil shortages occur, many things - air travel, many drugs, plastics, suburban living - will become impossible. But the craziest vision of the documentary is that oil gives us so much energy with so little effort that without it, our lives must change. Even if the substitutes and conservation are implemented immediately, at best they will facilitate our landing in a strange post-oil world that (the documentary claims) could start NOW. <br /> <br /> Despite its dark message, the documentary is often very entertaining. It contains fabulous historical images (sober images of dark urban factories and amusing camping tricks from the 1950s) that remind us of why we moved to the suburbs. It also gives hope that a massive effort now underway could both ease the transition of oil and make the world a better place. <br /> <br /> My only complaint about the documentary is that it does not take the time to understand the mystery of why we find this stuff right now. How can this be a great urgency all of a sudden? We knew that in the 1970s we should be preparing for a post-oil world - and we started to prepare with research on alternative energies and small cars. If our failure to follow up on President Jimmy Carter's efforts 25 years ago sentenced us to a hard landing in a post-oil world, why did not anyone scream it on soapboxes? <br /> <br /> Finally, I found the documentary very persuasive; and that left me with the terrible thrill of being drawn from a very beautiful dream. This is a must-attend show for everyone who is not afraid to face a very likely future in which we still have time to do something. <br /> <br /> - Charles
