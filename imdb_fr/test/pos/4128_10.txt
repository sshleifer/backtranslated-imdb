"The Buddy Holly Story" shows the debut of the famous singer in the dunk Lubbock, Texas, until his rise to fame, until his tragic death in a plane crash. With the fact that Gary Busey, as Holly, plays his own instruments, this film is the biopic in its purest form. Some things seem a little mundane, namely the Lubbock who consider rock'n'roll as the music of the devil, but the masterful performances outweigh the weaknesses. If only one thing is sure in our big world is that Buddy Holly's music will never be bland. Whether "That will be the day", "Peggy Sue" or another of his songs, they always sound good after all these years. He remains one of the greatest singers in history. <br /> <br /> Just to show what Lubbock thought of his most famous son, they only gave his name to a street 37 years after his death! What a band of ingredients!
