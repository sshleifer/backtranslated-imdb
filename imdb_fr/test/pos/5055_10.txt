"Labyrinth of Passion" - with the possible exception of "Matador" - is the best film of Almodovar. He displays his unique personality at his best and less censored, before he starts to become more mainstream. Almodovar is pretty much the only modern filmmaker able to approach the wonderful madness of Preston Sturges. It is useless to try to explain what the film is about, the essential point being Almodovar's willingness and talent to bring his situations to the confines of mental health, sometimes likelihood and taste.
