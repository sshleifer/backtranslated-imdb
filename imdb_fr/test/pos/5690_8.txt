As a child, I loved the song "Never smile in front of a crocodile", and if I was in this state of things inspired by real events. Smile would be the last thing I think. Since the initial set-up, I've never been as rooted, caught up, and exhausted as when I watched this low-budget Australian horror movie, about three people in the Northern Territory trapped in a mangrove with a wait very crocodile. in the water below them. What really made the film alive is how realistic it was to convey to the public the fear and uncertainty surrounding the characters' situation. A semi-documentary camera work with a disturbing backdrop and authentic performances take you out of your comfort zone. What we get is a story of patient survival rather than just a bloody and total assault. Think of "Open Water (2003)", where his budget and limited time allowed him to remain discreet, but this minimal barrier improved the experience. <br /> <br /> The story that turns slowly could be black and white, but it never seemed to become disposable or succumb to stereotypical patterns. Not quite, and the connection between the characters was captivating even with a simple and straightforward script. Although you can say "less is more", actions and expressions illuminate the thoughts that plague their minds. The test is completely terrifying, because the threat is very strong and never seems to diminish. This is what motivates the chaotic adrenaline of the film and in which it lasts (even if it is buried) to the end. Writers / directors The economic tips of the authors Andrew Traucki and David Nerlich alienate and intelligently connect the viewer with his tense and stimulating psychological traits. In some areas, the notch rises, with suspense induced by pressure and striking images. The way the night sequence is performed is extremely terrifying and thrilling. Manipulating crocodile manipulative toys with its fresh meat in a shattering approach. Of course, some moments seemed unlikely, but it never hindered or distracted. FX sound is the key, and sometimes the lack of everything is gnawing at you. The music score of Rafeal May is modest and not really part of the mix, but it creates an organic sound quality. John Biggins' cinematography is beautifully crafted and quickly aggressive when mood changes. He was still moving and claustrophobic, but none of those jerky movements. The editing has been treated with care, and the effects have been professionally taken care of by superbly combining live crocodile images. <br /> <br /> Something like this production should also rely on the cast to sell to the story in a credible way and they do it. Diana Glenn, Andy Rodoreda and especially Maeve Dermody are convincing. Dermody takes on a lot of her responsibilities and she's holding on with an inspired twist. Now, this article could make comparisons with another crocodile killer movie "Snape (2007)", but the two could not be different in what they want to be and how they end up. If I had to choose, I would rely more on this outing for his only involvement in breaking your head. <br /> <br /> A remarkable effort on all fronts, all those involved showing potential to watch.
