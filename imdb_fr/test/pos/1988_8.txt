After his previous film "Videodrome", which clearly shows similarities with this film, the director David Cronenberg ventures again into the world of virtual reality, in which truth and fiction mix. It's a virtual reality taken on a whole new level. <br /> <br /> "eXistenZ" is a very original film, well directed and played, but above all very well written. The film presents a fascinating and well thought out concept, widely executed by director David Cronenberg. <br /> <br /> "eXistenZ" is a film that can constantly deceive you. Just when you thought you understood, another surprise is waiting for you around the corner. Things never look like what you think, especially when the boundary between truth and fiction is explored. You never really know what is the reality and what is the world of the game, until the end. This makes the characters and events very unpredictable and also gives the movie a great ending that will let you think even further. <br /> <br /> The film offers a perfect kind of narration in the form of a game, mainly with its character appearances and its confusing events. They must first complete a stage or task before they can continue in the world and discover the purpose of their life in the game. <br /> <br /> The film knows how to create a perfect balance between realism and surrealism. without ever going too far with one or the other. The narration keeps the film as simple as possible, although, of course, the film is not as easy to follow because of its events, dialogues and unusual environments. <br /> <br /> But the film is not only strange. In fact, I was surprised to see that "Videodrome" has a higher rating here, because it is a much more inaccessible and "strange" movie. The film is also always entertaining and has a good rhythm. This never allows the film to remain stuck in its most philosophical moments and its deeper meanings. This also makes this film perfectly visible for people who do not normally watch this type of film. <br /> <br /> The film is beautiful, with subtle and effective special effects, a superb visual appearance, which also gives the film a certain "feeling of play" required. <br /> <br /> The film is well planted, with Jude Law in a role you do not see too often in this one, that of a shy and uncertain person. This shows once again how Law is a versatile actor and is more than just another pretty face of Hollywood. Jennifer Jason Leigh was also an excellent woman leader. She did not really play in big productions, but with this film, she shows why she has always been considered a big movie star. The film also features other well-known actors, in much smaller roles, such as Ian Holm and Willem Dafoe. <br /> <br /> A very original film that deserves a visit, especially if you have already seen "Videodrome". <br /> <br /> 8/10
