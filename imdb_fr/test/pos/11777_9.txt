I have just received the Hardware Wars DVD, in a brand new brilliant package, which seems irresistible. Put it in my DVD player to find a lot of fun things. The extra content on the DVD is even longer than the movie. For those of you who (shame!) Have never seen Hardware Wars, this is a ridiculous and ridiculous parody of Star Wars (from episode IV, of course). Home appliances (such as irons, toasters, vacuum cleaners and waffle iron) replace Ty-fighters, X-wings, R2D2 and the Death Star. Instead of Princess Leia, we have Princess Ann-Droid, with her Cinnabon hairstyle. You understand, I'm sure. Crazy stupidity, and a fun ride for any Star Wars geek (like me!) <br /> <br /> Now, the DVD - wow! The comment of a director where he basically goes into the film, making fun of himself and the project all along. An interview with Fosselius on Creature Features (remember ?!) and the hilarious "Director's Cup" and the "foreign version" of the film (all the jokes of course). Anyway, it's great. I loved Hardware Wars at the movies and I'm delighted to have the DVD of my collection stuck between MST3K: the movie and Thumb Wars!
