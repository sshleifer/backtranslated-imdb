I like this film. I can be biased because I like dolphins. However, my 3 and 4 years old. old is going to sit and watch the whole movie ... It's not Oscar material, but it's really entertaining. The dolphin film is well made with a beautiful backdrop of seascapes and sunsets. My favorite scene is where Flipper "returns" the pop can come out of the water by hitting Sandy in the head. It's a funny and endearing moment that makes me laugh every time. On the other hand, the naughty jokes of the tyrannical boatman (forget his name) are a bit difficult to bear. And the shark scene is far from reality. Question: do dolphins really make so much noise? Or is there a serious dubbing happening here? Bottom line: my kids enjoy it and recycling continues through our VCR.
