I released this movie a week after Ichikawa Kon's death. I suppose if there is a way to mark the death of a great director, it is to raise him a glass of wine while watching one of his greatest films. Ichikawa had one of the best careers in Japanese cinema, but as he never had a distinctive style or theme, he often seems to be neglected compared to his contemporaries such as Ozu and Kurosawa (he was a bit more young than they, but not much). He is one of those filmmakers who defies the theories of the author - it is likely that his wife (who wrote the screenplay for this film and many more of his films) was as responsible for the quality of the films as himself. . But at his best, he was as good as any Japanese filmmaker at the time. In particular, he possessed great technical skills enabling him to tell complex stories in an accessible manner. But in terms of theme, this film could hardly be simpler - war is hell. No, really, it's really a hell. <br /> <br /> The fire on the Plain does not follow the normal rules of the kind of war. There is no real beginning - we start with the miserable Tamura, who is a simple soldier (although he is implicit, he is more thoughtful and more educated than most others - he is shown at one point that he understands English, but he shouts when others ask him how he knows it) is hospitalized, his unit is already in a deplorable state. The soldiers are defeated and starve. They are no longer an army, but a group of refugees, hunted by the local population and virtually ignored by the Americans, who have bigger fish to whip. Hunger and despair push the soldiers to the edge and beyond the madness. <br /> <br /> In the typical Ichikawa style, it's not only sinister, it's strangely funny in places (a very dark humor of course). <BR/> <br /> The highlights of this film for me are the outstanding performances of the main films and the living photography. The characters, in all their humanity, but also in their total loss of humanity, are too credible. It is this rare film that will refuse to fade from your head, even if you want to forget it.
