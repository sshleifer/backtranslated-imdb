This film took me by surprise. I saw him for the first time more than 10 years ago and he always stays with me. It's just boring, and personally, I would have ended otherwise - it did not discourage me to look at it again and again and recommend it to others. The game is fantastic. The cast and the director do an incredible job with the screenplay, and anyone who likes "different" movies, who has the patience to sit down and say, "What's that mess?" a chance. If you just want Alan Rickman to be clumsy or things to explode, it's not a movie for you.
