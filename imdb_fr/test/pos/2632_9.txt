I agree with all the above comments. This show was a pleasure to watch. Funny, witty, fantastic acting and crazy games. It is always a pleasure to find a show that is intelligently written, which assumes that the audience has brains and displays a subtle sense of humor. I would spend money in hard earned money to see it on DVD. And as long as we ask Smart Series to never have a chance ... How about DVD releases of Maximum Bob (another well written and strange duck show with a cast of delicious characters.) And add to the list ... Middle Ages or Frank's Place. There is a way to release these programs from safes and put them in the hands of devoted fans and new audiences.
