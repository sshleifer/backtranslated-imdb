Consistency is perhaps this movie's biggest problem. The film begins as a political satire fast, elegant and rather fun, but in its second half, the film takes a tone more serious, in the manner of Oliver Stone. This is of course also a very serious subject, but I would say that the film would have been much better and also more effective if it had been made in the same style as the first half of the film. <br /> For a biography and a film about the subject of this film, the film is also quite short with only 102 minutes of reading time. The film because of that does not seem to tell the whole story. Of course, the film insists on tracking the events that took place after the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan, but the film goes no further and it does not explain much about it, which seems to be an inexpensive way to glorify Charlie Wilson, without showing the other side of the coin. Moreover, the actual events in the film itself are rather simplified, even if the story is always said to be complex (unnecessarily) sometimes. <br /> <br /> Yes, the film would have been much better if it had not tried to be so serious sometimes and overall lighter with its style and atmosphere. The film should have looked more like "Wag the Dog" for example, which found a good combination of satire and delicate political issues. <br /> <br /> Because of this incoherent style and manner of storytelling, the performances are also mixed. When Tom Hanks plays his character more playfully and in a more comical way, he is just excellent. But it makes it difficult to take his character seriously in the most serious and most sensitive / shocking moments of the film. Philip Seymour Hoffman is always excellent, as in all the movies in which he plays. He also received an Oscar nomination for his role in this film. Most of the other actors just seem to be walking around this movie, just to be in the movie. This especially concerns Julia Roberts, whose character, I found it too mysterious to seem to have a sufficiently clear objective for the film. It made me a redundant impression and so is also really forgettable in this movie. <br /> <br /> It's not that the film is a bad watch, it's actually quite good and as nice, but if the film had dared to be a little more pointed, the film would have been better and above all more effective than what he was obviously trying to achieve. <br /> <br /> 7/10
