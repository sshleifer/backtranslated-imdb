Well, let me tell you ... Haggard is probably one of the most fun and useless movies you've ever seen. There's a mix of a unique story about a guy who's having trouble with a girl and everything going on back and forth, mixed with countless humorous scenes that will make you laugh all through the movie. Basically, if you've seen Jackass or the CKY series, I know what to expect for humor, since he has most people from these movies. Overall, I just had to give it a 10/10 because it's one of my favorite movies of all time. <br /> <br /> ~ F0rs4k3n <br /> <br /> (P.S.) The rules of Haggard!
