Like some people here, I like / love Stingers! In Norway, it was broadcast much later. It also means that we are in the 176th episode. (yes, that's right) I must say that I really like Stingers! It can make me cry, laugh, smile and so on. I think I'm going to die the day we reach the episode number 192. Stingers could be the series (except for Gray's Anatomy) that I'm really looking at! The actors are incredible! Especially Jacinta Stapleton! Personally, I think it is one of the best access we have! I know he does not look like SUPER known, but he's really an excellent actress! Stingers makes me want to be a cop! I LOVE! <br /> <br /> P.S: Do you know if you can buy the episodes?
