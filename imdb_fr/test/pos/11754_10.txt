Two big stars and a legendary filmmaker have created a magnificent, thrilling love story that is both memorable and moving in many ways. <br /> <br /> Henry King directed Jennifer Jones in his first hit, Song of Bernadette. This film and Miss Jones are perfect in this role and give a nice, edgy performance that captures the conflict between the character and Bill Holden who ran after the other in the 1950s with a series of blockbuster movies starting with Sunset Blvd, Stalag . 17, born yesterday, Country Girl, Picnic and, of course, River Kwai is superb in this role. It's hard to imagine anyone other than Holden in this movie. I loved the end and crying every time I see it. For all those who have already loved and lost, you will understand. For those who have not, you will not do it.
