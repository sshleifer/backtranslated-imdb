Two years after the success of "Airplane", Jim Abrahams and Jerry & David Zucker created this brilliant sitcom starring the great Leslie Nielsen in the role of the plain clothes inspector "Frank Drebin". Alan North in the role of "Captain Ed Hocken", Ed Williams in "Ted Olsen" and William Duell in "Johnny The Shoe Shine Boy". "Police Squad!" had uncomplicated jokes and clever visual gags playing in the background. Each episode would end with a freeze-frame simulation in which the characters in the image would remain completely motionless. One of the best "freeze frame" sequences saw one of the characters pouring coffee into a cup while he was still, which made it overflow! The guest stars were killed in the opening titles, one of which included Georg Stanford Brown being crushed by a falling vault! Despite positive reviews and rave reviews, "Squad!" lasted only six episodes before being canceled. That did not mean the end, five years later, the show was transferred to the big screen for the premiere of the Naked Gun movie trilogy.
