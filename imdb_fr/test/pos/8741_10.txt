From about 1965, American films took a turn for the shocking and iconoclastic that was great for the time - a kind of glitch that would pave the way for more daring dramas. However, as the very decade that gave birth to these films was governed by his own beliefs, most of the films released at that time are out of date. CACTUS FLOWER is no exception. Its very title suggests a romantic comedy "sunny" with occasional misfires. That does not mean it's a bad thing: on the contrary, films on risky subjects have to start somewhere and America is a culture rooted in specific traditions, themselves locked in deep hypocrisies, shocked for the pleasure of seeing an indirect reflection of the mores of time. At the same time, European films approach these same situations, stand out for a million dollars and have a longer shelf life, because what we consider scandalous is to ignore "Next" and move on. <br /> <br /> Toni Simmons (Goldie Hawn in her leading role), a very bright young woman in the sixties, continues her work with a much older dentist, Julian Winston (Walter Matthau), who has problems commitment. He can not marry her: he is already married. Toni decides instead of fading that she really wants to meet his wife and "make things clear." Her assistant, Stephanie Dickinson (a luminous Ingrid Bergman, returning to American cinema after an absence of twenty years), is a woman closer to her age who acts as if she and he had a perfect marriage and home. There's a reason for that: she's fed calm emotions for Julian, emotions he's unaware of, even when he's asked her to play his wife to stop Toni from wanting to strengthen their relationship. And then, it increases a notch when the perfectly innocent actions of Toni saw the action in the unexpected and he introduces Harvey Greenfield (Jack Weston) as "lover" of Stephanie. By the way, Harvey is also an elderly man who has an affair with a much younger woman (Eve Bruce) to whom he also lies in a very amusing scene. <br /> <br /> It's funny how 'looking is one who has always been there. What could have been a thankless role for Rick Lenz, who plays the role of Igor Sullivan, Toni's neighbor neighbor, turns into a man who not only sees Stephanie's true beauty but saves Toni from committing suicide . (Not the kind of comedy, suicide - again, this is not your average comedy.) And it's needless to say that Ingrid Bergman subtly and poignantly describes a woman who missed her chances at love, who became perverse, who told another that she was becoming the true person to whom she had always been destined. I can not imagine anyone else in this discreet yet profound role. <br /> <br /> You can enjoy movies like these and watch them as an entertainment escape - a product of his time - or be seen for the deep symbolism he carries, such as his title, to deeper of himself. It is a delicate film, in the same way that the performances of Hawn and Bergman are just as important because, by appearing to them so simple, devoid of blooming and laying, they never go out and proclaim what it is 'acts. Their game becomes "not really" but plays with real people, warts and everything. CACTUS FLOWER is a story that never seems to take itself too seriously, but it is profound and very human after all.
