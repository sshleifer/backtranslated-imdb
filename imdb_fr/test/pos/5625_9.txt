American Movie is a wonderful documentary. He follows the trials and tribulations of a very determined independent filmmaker who is struggling to finish his first film. <br /> <br /> The raw images and insightful content of this film are an excellent example of how documentaries should be produced. I also think the film can be very inspiring for those of us who want to be filmmakers themselves.
