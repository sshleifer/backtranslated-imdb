My partner and I sat down to watch this movie over a bottle of wine last Saturday and, although we initially booked for the first time, once the story started, it was actually rather captivating. The scene in which one of the characters was brutally murdered with knitting needles was particularly shocking and echoed the work of the author of the new Korean wave Park Chan Wook. The weapon of choice was a master shot and allowed us to see in Granny's psyche, dramatically changing the connotations of a loving, warm grandmother into a deadly witch. The dialogue was incredibly moving and lyrical, expressing the deepest paranoia of the protagonist. Pavlosky's staging selections also reinforce the annoying and manic atmosphere of nighttime events, pairing with Oscar-winning performances to create a frightening and stimulating masterpiece. The end, which I will not spoil you here, reminded my partner and myself of the institutional masterpiece of M Night Shyamalan, The Sixth Sense, for its distorting turn that made me think of it several weeks later. have been viewed. Definitely to watch, many times!
