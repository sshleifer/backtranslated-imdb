Shazam was fine, but Hero High was my favorite when I was a child, I mean before Sky High (2005) and Zoom (2006), there was Hero High, a school for superheroes in training, teenagers with Super powers help the police capture the bad guys, and at other times they would end up in embarrassing situations like The Greatest American Hero (1981). It was a cartoon to watch. What was also fun was the live action show called The Kid Superpower Hour with Shazam. The actors who expressed the characters, also dressed, have their characters in the series. Rex Ruthless (John Berwick), Misty Magic (Jere Fields), WeatherMan (Jim Greenleaf), Captain California (Chris Hensel, who also sang the theme), Dirty Trixie (Maylo Mccaslin), Glorious Gal (Becky Pearl, who looks like the love child of Superman and Wonder Woman), and Punk Rock (Johnny Venocour). The entire cast was content with everything, with regards to the jokes. The caricature was a fun comedy superhero, I think it will come back in action as Fat Albert (2004)
