Coming from Oz, I probably should not say it, but I find that many local films lack this consistent flow with a weak scenario. This comedy lacks nothing. A beautiful story, not exaggerated, no melodrama, just a brilliant comedy as we know it, Oz can do it. Do yourself a favor and laugh until you fall.
