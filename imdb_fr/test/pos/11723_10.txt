Although he was excellent in Boogie Nights, I think it was Burt Reynolds' best performance. He is also an excellent director and made a hard and violent film that does not hold back (the death of a bitch by 12) and is an excellent crime novel with great actors (Brian Keith, Bernie Casey, etc.) and an exceptional film. jazz soundtrack. 10 of 10
