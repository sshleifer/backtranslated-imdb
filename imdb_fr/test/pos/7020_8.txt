Dirty Dancing - I think everyone has seen this movie at one time or another. I remember when I was a child, I liked this movie and I watched it again and again without getting tired. <br /> <br /> Now that I'm a little older, I bought the DVD recently and STILL was not disappointed with the performance. <br /> <br /> Swayze and Gray create the atmosphere of this film. Even if it is claimed that they do not get along, the chemistry of the film is incredible! As the film progresses, we are absorbed in their relationship and believe each of their actions. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is amazing, the music only adds to the romantic feel of the movie and the relationship between Baby and Patrick. <br /> <br /> The last scene makes this film, which can never forget the famous line "Noboby puts baby in the corner". The song is perfect and the dance is amazing! <br /> <br /> I would recommend this film to everyone, at any age. It's just a fun movie that everyone can enjoy 8/10.
