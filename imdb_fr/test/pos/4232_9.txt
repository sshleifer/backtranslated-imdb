I come from Germany, so please excuse my writing style. When I saw Chucky 4 for the first time, I was a little surprised, I knew Chucky as a usual horror movie of the 80s, but Bride of Chucky was very different from the old ones. First there is the work of the excellent director Ronny Yu, to whom we still think of A chinese ghost story. His visual style is a bit wired comparable to Francis Ford Coppola. The voices of Chucky an Tiff are also very impressive. I also really enjoyed the screenplay, especially the scene in which Tiff throws the bottle of champagne into the mirror. <br /> <br /> I give him a vote of 9.0 for a fun, gore and progressive entertainment. If you have comments on my opinion, send me an email. MFG Schawez
