It was another big episode of Season 11 of South Park. <br /> <br /> Cartman pretends to have Tourette Syndrome to be able to say what he wants without having problems. He is able to swear against other children at school. Kyle tells the director that Cartman is pretending. But she does not believe it. Chris Hansen plans to invite Cartman to visit Dateline to talk about Tourette's syndrome live and without any censorship. But later, Cartman begins to get so addicted to being able to say what he wants, that he later starts to say embarrassing things. It was a funny episode about Cartette Syndrome simulating Tourette Syndrome. I recommend it to all fans of South Park.
