I guess I like the good things in life as much as anyone, but until about five years ago, opera was not one of my entertainment choices. Oh, I tried a few times to learn what everyone was talking about; I watched several television productions - including parts of Wagner's Ring Cycle on public television - hoping to understand the fascination of others for art. And I knew that I could enjoy some parts of the various operas (I remember being surprised, as a child, to have liked the extracts of "Madame Butterfly" in "My Geisha, and I enjoyed the scenes of in "Moonstruck" and "Pretty Woman"), but unlike the characters in these films, I simply did not "understand". <br /> <br /> Then, in 1995, I attended to a live performance of "Rigoletto" presented by the New York City Opera Company, and night, I "understood" What a wonderful show of colors and music and raw emotion! And I speak of Emotion with a E capital, I think the key is that opera music allows the performers to play freely and presumably in a way that would seem silly if their lyrics were to be uttered.Everything depends on the music, of course, and when the music is magic, as in "Rigoletto", an opera can be a magnificent entertainment . <br /> <br /> A friendly member of my family gave me a laserdisc copy of the television production of the 1982 opera, and I noticed that since Rigoletto rances live, this video version is a good substitute. Luciano Pavarotti is perfect in the duke's part; Ingvar Wixell is excellent as his court jester to the mean naughty Rigoletto; and Rigoletto's beloved daughter, Gilda, is performed by Edita Gruberova, with simple features. The sets and costumes are sumptuous, and the shots on the river at the end of the film give the story a dramatic sense unparalleled on a stage. <br /> <br /> If you have never seen the event "Rigoletto", or if you think you do not like or do not understand opera, I urge you to find it on video and buy it or rent it. If you do not like that, if this production of "Rigoletto" does not make you appreciate the power of the artistic form of opera, well, give it up and move on. But I suspect that if you're new to opera, you'll be pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br /> Bill Anderson
