Jack Frost 2 is probably the craziest film I've ever seen in my life. The full title of the movie is Jack Frost 2: The Revenge of the Mutant Killer Snow Killer. Fans of horror movies who have a taste for camping stories will be delighted to watch this. This film was directly in video, and for good reasons. Here's why: The acting was so awful and so terrible that it could make someone cry. The main character had no personality and the misinterpretation of the actor aggravated the situation. The scenario was so atrocious. Each character always says a cheesy line, and adds cheesy lines to the wrong choreography, so you have something wrong. Secondly, the scenario is not really impressive, but since this film was directly in video, it is forgiven. The director and screenwriter could have turned the idea of ​​a killer snowman into a cool thing, but they did not do it. Their story has a lot of holes in the plot. At first, a cup of coffee is smashed into the aquarium with the fade-out Jack Frost. Scientists are trying to restore life, but they can not. Once the cup of coffee fell into the tank, Jack Frost was completely restored. Now he is immune to antifreeze. In the first part of Jack Frost, the main character's DNA mingled with the antifreeze used to kill Jack Frost. Since the main character is allergic to bananas, Jack Frost is too. Therefore, here is my point. They say that Sam's DNA combined with that of Jack Frost. But one of the scientists had saliva on the cup, so when she fell into the tank, her DNA would have been combined with Jack Frosts. Another thing, the special effects were not very good either. Here are the good points: Jack Frost 2 has a lot of blood, it seems pretty realistic. Even though this movie is flawed, it's still fun. Overall, Jack Frost 2 is a nice horror movie. The first was better though. 7 out of 10
