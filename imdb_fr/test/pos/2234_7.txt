It is a fairly intelligent and well-interpreted version of the "modern" women's fairy tale novel of the 1930s. In this case, she helps the man she loves to become a company leader while holding the position secretary and ends up winning his love of an intriguing social butterfly. Interestingly, her business acumen is presented as subtly parallel to her housewife prowess, and the ladies of the office are described as the "powers behind the throne". Raised well above average by Mrs. Astor's smart performance.
