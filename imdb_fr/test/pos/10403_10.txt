For my part, I absolutely loved this film. <br /> <br /> This is not a "typical Asian horror" where you would see a macabre ghost (usually a woman) scare people. You hardly see ghosts for the majority of the film, but the way this film allows you to stay interested in the plot and the characters is a genius. This film is not for you if you like gore (Saw, hostel, for example) or the "surprise freaks" (Hollywood horror movies, but this film has an underlying factor that scares you ). whole movie that I liked. Noroi is a progressive and somewhat experimental approach to horror among the ridiculous remakes and non-original bullshit published by Hollywood in today's society. <br /> <br /> Do not let the documentary style of the shoot discourage you (why it ?!). It's far superior to the Blair Witch project because, on the one hand, the acting in Noroi is brilliant and really makes you feel like you're watching something you're not supposed to see. <br /> <br /> Noroi is certainly one of the best horror movies I've ever seen. Only a few films have been part of my Top 5 horror; and this film occupies a solid place n Â° 1 on my list.
