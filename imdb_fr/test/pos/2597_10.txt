There is only one film I can think of that is as good or better than this one with regard to Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck - ALI BABA BUNNY. However, it is useless to determine which is the best. Watch them and enjoy them. <br /> <br /> I compared this to ALI BABA BUNNY because both present Daffy to his absolute worst - greedy, nasty and very funny the process. However, I think I prefer the rabbit seasoning just because Bugs is also pretty awful in this one - doing horrible things up to Daffy every time Daffy tries a dirty trick. <br /> <br /> The movie starts with Daffy letting the bunny follow up to the Bugs hole in the hope that a hunter (of course, Elmer) explodes the rabbit and leaves Daffy alone! Not to be outdone, Bugs constantly picks up all of Daffy's tricks and overturns them - and in most cases, Daffy gets shot in the face! All this is very very intelligent and fun and I do not care about your age, this caricature will make you laugh unless you're grumpy. I particularly like the great and unexpected end, but I will not say more, because I do not want to spoil the surprise.
