When I was younger, this movie was still airing on Friday night of the summer on Channel 40 (it was the years before Fox became a network and resumed programming). I'm always looking forward to it. I went shopping with my parents and sat down with my dinner on Swanson TV and a Lady Lee Cola (the only time of the week that I was allowed to drink cola and enjoy it Little Darlings), but it's a fun movie, and I liked Rudy and Tripper. Bill Murray is effortlessly involved in the film, but he is charming. I must love Spaz and those glued glasses (before Revenge of the Nerds). Chris Makepeace is pretty much the same character he played in "My Bodyguard" but he does it so well.
