Teen Deviyaan is an excellent movie. A very broken artist and a very modern film for his time in the 1960s. The music and the songs are fantastic although Majrooh's lyrics have no meaning in places. Dev Anand is an extraordinary star and, as usual, does justice to her role. Kalpana is sexy and Nanda is fine. Simi too is pretty much OK. The film has a wonderful dialogue of Vrajendra Gaur who wrote most of Dev Anand's films like Mahal, Duniya, Mandate, Jaali Note, Manzil, etc.etc. <br /> <br /> It's a story where Dev is attracted by three women - the mod Kalpana, Simi and the simple Nanda. He eventually opted for Nanda. The story is about OK but its narration is captivating and the dialogue, the songs and the big Dev Anand are the highlight of the film. A must-see movie for all fans of Dev Anand.
