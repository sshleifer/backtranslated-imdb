"Comanche Moon" had everything to please. For starters, the back of Simon Wincer, a man whose name is synonymous with top quality TV movies. Unfortunately, problems with "Moon" are something that even the most talented director could not solve: a mediocre storyline based on a dull romance. <br /> <br /> Forget historical precisions - as any reader of novels knows. you, the biggest parody of "Moon" is that it does not even match the information of the original "Lonesome Dove" masterpiece. So many wonderful and rich moments in the miniseries and, to an even greater degree, in the book, are completely absent from "Moon". Considering the fact that most "Moon" viewers probably come with at least some kind of "Dove" background, the lack of character-based and emotional background is downright painful. <br /> <br /> That said, "Moon" is an example where the adapted version could and should have been modified to make it more suitable for the screen. For example, the novel "Moon" focuses mainly on the Comanches themselves. The mini-series certainly has the merit of serving the Comanches, but in the end, it gives them just enough so that the viewer has the feeling that they miss a significant part of the story. Likewise, Val Kilmer's Scull loses here too - the role should have been expanded so that Kilmer (and Rachel Griffiths, for that matter) actually had something to do, or the roles should simply have been reduced to smaller support elements . Instead, Kilmer gets first place for a character who only lets you scratch his head after his appearance in the final act completely bizarre. <br /> <br /> There are strange moments in the film that make no sense to those who have not read the book (a killer parrot - what?) - moreover, no scene shows us Call and McCrae look a lot like the amazing Texan rangers they claim to be. Not one of their expeditions in Moon (or "Dead Man's Walk", for that matter) ends successfully, and Call and McCrae just seem to fight their way through a useless mission, one after the other . <br /> <br /> Frankly, Larry McMurtry should never have been in charge of writing the script, it's only because of the praise that surrounded this other cowboy film, Brokeback Mountain. McMurtry can write good novels (although the consistency of this statement raises some dissension), but he is never really established as a writer. This production would have benefited not only from the return of director Wincer, but also from original screenwriter Bill Wittcliff to adapt the novel to the screen. Witcliff does not exactly have a mountain of hardware to his credit for screenwriting, but no one can deny that he has done a fantastic job of reducing the original "Lonesome Dove". That said, "Comanche Moon" is almost a brilliant production, aided by an awesome cast that, unfortunately, is just not enough to do. The portrait of Gus McCrae by Steve Zahn - or rather, that of Robert Duvall in the role of Gus McCrae - is without appeal. And although some have criticized Karl Urban as Woodrow Call, claiming that his performance did not imitate the silence and stoic Woodrow of the original film, all I can say is: blame McMurtry, because McMurtry is the one who , both in the Moon "novel and now miniseries - turned Woodrow, who was an inept, clumsy but natural social leader into an emotionless character whose lines are simply dark and whose motives are clear only if you described them more faithfully in the following ". <br /> <br /> Yet it's the cast that sparkles in "Moon", to the point where I left the miniseries with the same feeling of melancholy that I felt watching the original "Lonesome Dove "- this time because I realized it was probably the last time these characters appeared on the screen for a very long time - and quite honestly, this cast could have done so well in a full network TV show and well Fed. <br /> <br /> In total, apart from the missed opportunities with casting, the bi Ggest travesty is that the original Lonesome Dove novel contained so many rich stories for characters that would have been fascinating, quite fascinating to see translated on the screen. Unfortunately, all this has been set aside in favor of McMurtry's previous, tedious, incoherent and ultimately irrelevant.
