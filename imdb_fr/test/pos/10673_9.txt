I have great memories of watching this visually dazzling film as a child, in the late '70s and early' 80s, on wor-tv (now nine years old) in New York. Although it is a product of the 1960s, this film has barely aged. The effects are as wonderful as those of 2001 and, in some ways, superior (the work model is flawless). With an appealing cast, beautiful color photographs and a scenography as well as an evocative score, JTTFSOTS is a winner!
