WARNING: playing this entry after watching the movie! Like "Easy Rider" published a year ago, "Joe" tries to illustrate what happens when the counter-culture and America (although right) meet: a violent end follows. While this film is largely a slow representation of traditional American "old-fashioned" morality versus the "do-it-yourself" lifestyle of the 1960s, it is also comment on the upper class against the lower middle class. class and their inability to meet in the middle, as illustrated when the Comptons meet the Currans. Boyle's Joe represents a generation stuck in the 1940s and 50s where "Killing a committee for Mom (or Jap or Hippie) is ok as long as it helps and saves the United States. Joe and his wife Mary Jo are clearly the archetypes of Archie Bunker and his wife, Dingbat, Edith. This film - which will be forever known for its violence (but not bloody - no blood is seen at all) ends however unevenly. Joe explodes (verbally) the hippie generation, then decides (literally) to infiltrate his population to locate the daughter of Compton - when he clearly should have been rejected by the idea but give up the idea separatist for the love of sex. When he is betrayed by theft (read: trust of the old generation to the new generation), he attacks a relentless chain of murders. It may be because of the Hollywood Tarantinos that the observer expects a bloody death in the final scene, but bloodless shootings crave any kind of impact or realism. 'Joe' is not a good movie, but it is an interesting demonstration of the alienation of class and culture and the extreme animals underlying the generation gap.
