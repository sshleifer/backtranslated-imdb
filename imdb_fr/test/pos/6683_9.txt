In KPAX, Softley paints the subtleties of Eastern religious mores of small archetypes integrated throughout the film at Prot's real purpose. Spacey (Prot) assumes an essentially didactic role throughout the film. It is as if his statements embodied general truths about a culture of peace promulgated in Buddhism and Hinduism. It can be said that Prot is the eye of the cyclone - the world is messy and "shining" and the false veil of reality is what everyone sees, but Prot sees the truth - he sees the minute - and the 'appreciate certain points fear him as he transcends his social construction of reality and becomes more human. <br /> <br /> The film is particularly detailed, so I recommend you watch it at least twice to see how Softley makes shades. Listen carefully to the stories at the beginning and end, as they address concepts that are not usually presented in Western philosophies. <br /> <br /> 9 out of 10 ratings - Great - with nominal improvement margin.
