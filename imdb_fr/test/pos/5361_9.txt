I saw it during a German press screening. Without saying too much: most critics really seemed to like him a lot. There was even applause afterwards, which is quite unusual for this species. From my point of view and so far, it was the funniest movie of the year. It retains the charm and spirit of the three short films W + G and is enlarged with many references to these and other films. Of course, there are obvious allusions to the movies about monsters and werewolves, especially at "American Werewolf in London", "Jaws", "King Kong" and even "Braindead" / "Dead" Alive "of Peter Jackson, but also to other genres. <br /> <br /> The characterization was better in "Chicken Run", but this film had a complete new "distribution" where an introduction was needed. Here, you are already able to know the two main characters. Thus, the new movie "Wallace and Gromit" is appreciated if you have ever watched (and loved) short films, but it also works by itself. "Chicken Run" had the plot more convenient, but also more "narration". Instead, this new Aardman masterpiece keeps this feeling crazier and somehow more "isolated" from the W + G shorts. Kids should also enjoy it a lot, especially because of the sweet bunnies (though you like beautiful bunnies, it's a must for you !!!) and because Gromit has a lot to do and really steals the show (kids love dogs too ... :-)). But many jokes are thought for a more adult audience (there is even sweet sexual allusions). The film succeeds, like "Shrek 1 + 2" and "The Incredibles", to offer a high-level entertainment to the whole family, adding a British touch and at least a little darker to the humor of animated films US. <Br /> <br /> The animation is ?? as expected ?? beautiful, and they stayed true to the Aardman style because they did not add too many digital effects - I realized some of them when it came to Wallace's inventions. <br /> <br /> Finally, the score works well in the film, although one of the main themes is definitely "borrowed" by the score of "Dragonheart" by Randy Edelman. <br /> <br /> The bad thing is: It will probably take another six years before we can see a new jewel animation from Nick Park & ​​Co.
