How often do we live our romantic life on the big screen, with hot affairs and passionate encounters? Almost never, if what I consider a normal life around me is difficult to judge. Romance, as previously mentioned, is hardly ever a terrible affair that leaves you at the top of the world or is bruised and bruised. <br /> <br /> Romance, in its everyday form, as lived millions of times around the world, is a slow, subtle and silent affair. Something that grows in you, very slowly, probably without even noticing it, slowly taking over your being. Nobody can tell me when I'm in love. Because if someone did it, I would not believe it anyway, because nobody but me could know it. And even then, it's just a feeling, a certain knowledge that you feel this exhilarating emotion. That you want only the best for someone, that you would never want to see him suffer a moment of sadness. That you are ready to endure a great pain for them. I would not go so far as to say that I want to die for your beloved, because we are all human and we do not know what we are capable of facing death until that moment has arrived. <br /> <br /> Is the love between the main characters of the film still as subtle and discreet, no less noble than the one between Romeo and Juliet? Undeclared emotions, unexpressed feelings, convey much more than repeated cries of "I love you". The restraint shown by the main actor, displayed so poignantly in the scene where he observes his love interest through the window of the cafe, without ever moving to make himself known, was simply heartbreaking to watch. Would most of us be so selfless as to stay hidden, knowing that his emotions and feelings could not possibly be reciprocated? <br /> <br /> In another order of ideas, how am I going to deal with my own certain death? Although I can say that I was seriously ill, I can not, in all honesty, say that I am already close to death. Will I be so calm, put my affairs in order, and leave instructions to others to take what I leave behind? I suspect that I will be calm, because I will have little choice. Can I be so selfless? Again, the answer will have to be negative. I can understand the anxiety, knowing that your life is lost, that fate has dealt you a fatal blow and that future events, even if there are few, are no longer under your control. <br /> <br /> Life is nothing more than a series of small events whose climax may seem great to some, in retrospect. But only very rarely.
