In one of the best movies of the year, Tom Hanks plays the role of Congressman Charlie Wilson in this funny and highly relevant historical comedy drama (given the current events) surrounding the Afghan fiasco / Soviet Union in the 1980s. The Soviets attacked Afghanistan, killing hundreds of people. Why should someone care? People are dying, right? No, the reason the US got involved through Charlie Wilson is that the Afghans, fearful of being hit by the wind, started illegally entering Pakistan, which forced the president Pakistani Mohammad Zia ul-Haq to leave his post. Charlie Wilson tried to remedy this situation by joining Joanne Herring (Julia Roberts), the sixth richest woman and fanatical Texas, and a fun American spy and robust for the CIA, Gust Avrakotos (Philip Seymour Hoffman), to help supply the Afghans. with high-tech weapons to destroy Soviet fighter jets that might attempt to attack their country. <br /> <br /> Although it's certainly not a serious Oscar nominee for Best Picture, "Charlie Wilson's War" is probably one of the best of many political movies of the year. Academy Award winner Mike Nichols provides an irreproachable staging, while Emmy Award winner Aaron Sorkin (Sport's Night, The West Wing) offers a remarkable scenario that perfectly balances comedy and drama. The acting game is great too. Tom Hanks delivers his best and most enjoyable performance since his 2000 Academy Award-nominated tour as a FedEx worker stuck on a tropical island in "Cast Away". Hanks takes a gooey character like Wilson and with his characteristic charm turns him into a nice guy. Amy Adams and Ned Beatty are reliable, as always, but the remarkable performance of the film is that of Philip Seymour Hoffman. Without a doubt the most talented actor in the film industry today, Hoffman plays a minor role and surprises everyone. Since his first scene where he screams on his boss before violently breaking his window, Hoffman sucks you. The only disappointing cast member is unsurprisingly Hollywood starlet Julia Roberts. After going through another film, Roberts' portrayal of a rich, oil-rich woman in Texas is excessive and annoying. At 97 minutes, the film is short and pleasant, and that does not mean that it does not drag at times, but when it trails, it takes very little time. <br /> <br /> In conclusion "Charlie Wilson's War" is certainly not a perfect film, but it is certainly worth seeing. Grade: B +
