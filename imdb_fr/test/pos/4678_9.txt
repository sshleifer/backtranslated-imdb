I wonder how many MINI Cooper cars have been sold with this film? That did not stop to increase the sales of this small car, which is presented in this film, with an attractive distribution. <br /> <br /> This is a very, very entertaining and very attractive movie. He presents a "cool" cast with Mark Wahlberg, Charlize Theron, Edward Norton, Seth Green and Jason Statham. <br /> <br /> The best chase scene is at the very beginning with a boat chase in Venice, Italy. The film does not exaggerate violence, has a pretty smart scenario (with a few exceptions). characteristics of interesting characters and is well firmed. The game of cat and mouse between the characters of Norton and Theron is captivating and fun to watch. <br /> <br /> Once again, however, we are manipulated to uproot criminals presented as "good". How many times has it happened since the time of "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" in the 1960s? It's twisted Hollywood, for you. Here, one of the criminals (Norton) stole and killed the gang leader and father figure (Donald Sutherland). He is the worst of the group and the villain of the film. The character of Theron is also part of the typical Hollywood and feminist fashion, in which women can do everything (including driving a car) better than a man. A third minor irritation is Seth Green's smug and smart attitude, which we are also supposed to adopt because she is cool and cool. <br /> <br /> Despite these obstacles, this is an extremely entertaining film that does not excite blasphemy or sex ... and, yes, these little cars are cool. Everyone I talked to who saw this film liked it.
