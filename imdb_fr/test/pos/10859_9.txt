It is amazing that a production like this is being done these days, especially for television. Given the violent sexual themes and explicit romantic relationships, not to mention lesbianism, treatment and direction are excellent. <br /> <br /> The sets and costumes are perfect, the elegant direction and the pleasant characters. There is a lot of humor, but his interludes are surprisingly dark. The protagonist is really a tragic figure, but not devoid of happiness. In addition, this production avoids the mistake that most movies / shows make in terms of homosexuality / lesbianism. The characters are very human. It seems that to allow people to watch gays and lesbians and movies on television, most programs fill it with clich√©s and make the characters obsessed with homosexuality. Not so with that. In Tipping the Velvet, the protagonist is hardly aware of what it means to be lesbian! <br /> <br /> The BBC has already made great productions, and this adventurous period piece only confirms their excellence.
