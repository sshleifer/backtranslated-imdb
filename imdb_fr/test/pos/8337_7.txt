... our grandfather time. <br /> <br /> More than gangsters, it's a detailed representation of an American family after the 1930s: the father, proud of his job, worries about his son who dropped out of high school , everyone would like to have mom, daughter who forgets dinner time in her arms, and absolutely adorable twins ("Do not fall asleep please!"). <br /> <br /> there is the grandfather who plays the Yankee scribble on his flute. You have noticed that this tune plays the same role as Doris Day's "Que Sera Sera" in "The Man Who Knew" (1956)? finally, the most courageous person in the family. If he is old, he does not even tell you his age, but he is proud of his country and resists the hateful blackmail of the gangster. <br /> <br /> A good Wellman movie.
