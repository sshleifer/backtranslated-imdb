* May contain spoilers * <br /> <br /> The first time I saw this movie, it was released on video at the age of 8 years. Now I'm 17 years old and I always look at it whenever I have the opportunity. "The Aristocats" is a film that warms my heart and I immediately fell in love with it. I loved the songs, especially the one that the kittens sing on the piano. In fact, I even sang in a talent show with my sister and a friend because I loved him so much. The three kittens are so cute and their mother is one of the most beautiful cartoon cats I have ever seen. The cat Ally had a good voice! <br /> <br /> My favorite part of the movie is where kittens play the piano. This part is adorable. I also like their return trip. It's incredible. It's one of the best Disney movies I've ever seen and one of my favorites. Everyone should see it. I give this film 10/10 stars.
