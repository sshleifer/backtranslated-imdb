'Ray' lives on <br /> <br /> Ray Dir- Taylor Hackford - Jamie Foxx, Kerry Washington, Regina King, Clifton Powell, Curtis Armstrong and Sharon Warren. Written by Taylor Hackford and James L. White. Note- *** <br /> <br /> "Take the road Jack and do not come back, more, no more, no more, no more!" Who would have thought that this immortal line, which has almost become a restorative mantra for broken relationships in popular culture, was designed instead of a lovers' fight! Ray Charles was a genius. And if he knew anything, breathed and lived for; it was music. So in a life that included extreme poverty, a desperate struggle with darkness, guilt, drugs and painful affairs; Ray always found moments where inspiration came from nowhere and where words and notes took shape to form an eternal classic! <br /> <br /> Some lives deserve to be transformed on the big screen. Ray Charles's life was one of them. It's almost a shock to learn that this project had no studio support until it was finished! And this support probably came after the initial screenings in which Jamie Foxx's performance was hailed and announced as a Oscar-winning Oscar winner in a low voice. Jamie Foxx as Ray pretty much convinces us that this is Ray Charles playing on the screen and not an imitating actor! From the omniscient shadowy smile to the bent gait of not a handicap, but a man dancing through his demons, Foxx captures every essence of Ray Charles's current character. Ray was a complicated man. He never asked for sympathy and very rarely showed it himself. A wise businessman, he has ensured his success at all costs, sometimes at the cost of losing his family. He never apologized for his sneaky ways and always maintained that he loved his family, which we are convinced. He loved sex; It was as simple as that! But behind all, there was also a ray that was afraid of darkness. Imagine the horrors of a blind man who is afraid of darkness! His fear was because of his guilt. Ray was convinced that he was the reason for his brother's death and all his life had been spent trying to redeem himself. Ray was a non-conformist who had merged gospel with jazz, a blasphemous practice unheard of in the 1950s. But his intentions were not to stir up. He was just practicing the only way he knew he was close to God! <br /> <br /> It's hard to capture a life as hectic as Ray's, and maybe that's where the movie fails. We are never really allowed to get closer to Ray as a person. We only know him as much as we see him. Her relationships, particularly with Margie Hendricks (Regina King), are not explored in detail. And the script barely passes on Della Bea (Kerry Washington), Ray's wife, whom everyone knows is a rock at his side. And the biggest mistake of all is the precipitous, almost abrupt climax. It's as if the director suddenly realized that he was out of stock and asked for a package! Nevertheless, "Ray" is definitely recommended for Jamie Foxx's flawless performance and a capable stellar ensemble. The songs and the age create a sense of nostalgia and we really feel that the film was shot with sincerity. <br /> <br /> - Abhishek Bandekar <br /> <br /> Note- "Ray" is nominated in six categories at this year's Oscars, including Best Picture, Best Director and Best Actor (Jamie Foxx).
