Judith Ivey as an old scammer whore is great. Emily Grace the girl. Is innocent and exciting as she learns what's going on. Excellent direction and camera. The story is dark and disturbing. Support the casting is good. Watch what happens and can happen with a series of bad luck. Large independent film. Small casting. The rhythm is slow at first, then moves well. A good movie to show your teenage daughter who aspires to leave the house early, for the road and adventure. This film, the film has a low budget, but it works because of the low life and the areas in which these people settle. I will never stop taking a break, without thinking about this movie and checking my tires before leaving.
