Jamie Foxx did an amazing job playing Ray Charles. I loved this movie because from time to time there was a flashback scene and then the current movie. When Ray Charles was little, he became blind and his mother did not deliver him. She was a strong woman who did not treat him differently because he was blind. She made him do things alone and that pushed him to become a great musician later in life. His mother also sent him to school. Then, when Ray Charles became a man, he was able to defend himself and take care of himself, but narcotics, sex and betrayal fell. When I'm discouraged by something, I can only think of this movie and it will inspire me.
