This film starts a little slowly, but quickly moves to comic speed. Each of the three "teenagers" offers her own credible, distinct, assertive and entertaining personalities. I particularly enjoyed the dialogue and interaction between Keith and Lisa. If one looked beyond the superficial "action" that was going on, Keith's character treated Lisa's "deflowering" with tenderness and consideration. The development of the cartoon that followed was also integrated in my opinion. David Boreanaz gives a wonderful performance as an adult male who clearly has more problems than he can handle. The dialogue was lively, fast and flowed well. The director and scriptwriter of this film has clearly shown that none of the main characters had managed to claim the moral rise after all the shenanigans they had provoked. Although the film looks light on the surface, it reflects all the gray areas of becoming an adult, emotions and human desires.
