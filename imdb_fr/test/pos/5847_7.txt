I liked this film. Unlike other thrillers, you get to know the killers. You also get to know the two detectives who hunt them. The killers are two high school students. They are very smart and want to prove that they are smarter than the police, so they plan the "perfect crime". We all know that this crime will not be perfect. What we do not know is if they will be caught or if they are just one of them, if any. In a way, I was hoping that they would both get by, although I do not know if that was the intent of the movie. <br /> <br /> The story is told in a pleasant way. You start to know the people involved. The character of Sandra Bullock is nice but has his own secret, which attacks him. Ben Chaplin is very good because Sam and the two kids are great. The scenes between them are the best scenes of the movie. <br /> <br /> I think you can say that the movie is pretty good and not as predictable as you think. For a nice evening with a movie, "Murder by Numbers" is a good choice.
