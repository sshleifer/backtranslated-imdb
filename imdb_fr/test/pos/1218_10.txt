My friends and I saw this at the San Diego Black Film Festival. It was great. Stormy is a strong black woman and Nana reminds me of my grandmother. <br /> <br /> René is FINE !!! To see him undress was certainly worth the price of entry. Can someone give me his contact information? <br /> <br /> My friend thinks Flex is the finest solution. She's been a fan of Flex for years, so she might be a bit biased. The cousins ​​were funny and as minimal as Nana had described them. LOL. <br /> <br /> I can not wait to see this movie again in cinemas.
