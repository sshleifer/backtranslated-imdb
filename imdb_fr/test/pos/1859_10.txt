I read reviews of this movie that found it "disappointing" and "confusing". I can not understand why this should be so. From the beginning, I found a remarkable experience and a total joy to watch. <br /> <br /> Spoiler: The first titles cover a magnificent visual of the evolutionary process, which introduces history with a serene and radical style. However, the film does not concern the process itself, it concerns Charles Darwin's struggle against his conscience, his love for his wife, his deceased daughter and his search for the truth. <br /> <br /> The appearances of his daughter are the manifestations of a tormented spirit who knows that he has "killed God". The girl is an adult who makes adult comments about her work and tortures Darwin with personal doubts. Was he somehow responsible for his death? Husband and wife in real life, Paul Bettany and Jennifer Connelly give really wonderful performances under the name of Charles and Emma Darwin, as Martha West and Annie. Bettany's size and clumsy gait give Darwin's character a real sense of reality, while Connelly seems very comfortable with his English accent and sometimes severe personality. <br /> <br /> It is easy to misunderstand the times in which this film resides. The stranglehold of religion on society and the inner struggles that a man like Darwin had to endure to seek the truth in what he witnessed. Science and religion have always been clumsy bedfellows and although it did not cost him his life, as has been the case for so many men and women, science has put a barrier between husband and wife , between facts and faith. This film describes this barrier extremely well. <br /> <br /> I give Creation a ten-star rating, because I think it's beautiful, deep, beautifully played, and an authentic and unadorned look at the world. true geniuses. <br /> <br /> What seems obvious to everyone today (well, almost everyone ... seeing the wonderful "Religious" Bill Maher) has been hidden for millennia. The truth, once discovered, was undoubtedly painful for many. Creation examines this pain and realizes that we are all that we possess. <br /> <br /> A wonderful cinematic experience.
