This film is one of my favorite movies of all time and that's what made me a fan of a lifetime, Nicolas Cage. Back in the mid-80s, I recorded this movie (when VCRs were impossible to do that with !!) and I watched it again and again. Nicolas Cage is just brilliant here. And, it looks wonderful and does not affect the "acts-isms" (see "Peggy Sue Got Married" to know what I mean by that !!). I measure all his performances against this one. He was so perfectly chosen as a cool punk with his angry friends. The music was great. The Plimsouls! The psychodelic furs! Modern English! Men at work! Whenever I hear "Melt With You", I am brought back to the end of this movie. <br /> <br /> What has happened to his pretty costar, Deborah Foreman? And his hysterical friend, Cameron Dye? Certainly, took a turn different from that of Nicolas! Interestingly, the slutty friend (Elizabeth Daily) ended up being the voice of Tommy Rugrats (she is billed as E.G. Daily for this horrible show)! Bizarre! <br /> <br /> If you want to have a good trip in the 80s, watch this movie. It's really a classic. I totally love!
