Like many big screen stars at the end of their careers, many turned to television where they probably earned their reputation for posterity. Donna Reed is a typical example. <br /> <br /> I do not think Donna Reed ever thought Donna Stone was a challenge, not for a woman who won an Oscar for playing a very different guy from From Here to Eternity. She was certainly better prepared to play with his wife, mother and housewife, Donna Stone, after playing Mary Bailey in It's A Wonderful Life. <br /> <br /> Donna has always been beautiful and wise and always helpful in dealing with the problems of her children and her husband. Carl Betz was not an idiot, he was a pediatrician who had his office attached to the house. Talk about the man always ready in case of crisis. <br /> <br /> Although it was the Donna Reed Show because her husband was at the time, Tony Owen produced it. Yet, it lasted as long as because of the popularity of the two children, Shelley Fabares and Paul Petersen. Fabares had this best-selling teen record, Johnny Angel, which she featured on the show. She has managed to become an adult star, best known for her coaching role as a wife of Craig T. Nelson. <br /> <br /> But Petersen was a teenage bubblegum idol at the time. The Donna Reed Show dares, I say, has attracted most of its viewers because of it. We forget about it now, but Petersen also had a hit record, My Dad. Did not do half as well as Johnny Angel. <br /> <br /> Now Paul Petersen is leading a support group for former kids like him. So many of them end so tragically that it's a good job he's doing. <br /> <br /> The Stone family was the quintessence of Central America. They lived in a suburb near Chicago, they led a healthy life. Mom and dad were always there for the kids. Of course, their usual problems were nothing more than the lifting of the curfew. <br /> <br /> This series, I believe, was the model of the city of Pleasantville, in which Tobey Maguire and Reese Witherspoon are aspired. <br /> <br /> I have good memories of the Donna Reed Show. Easy to take, but not too seriously.
