Well, I was expecting, despite all the media beats and Oscar nominations, an epic drama of civil war (and something with the "magnitude" of the "English Patient" given to the same director). This film does not have an epic stature, but it turned out I was relieved not to be. It is a love story in the midst of the horrors of war: young men are sent into battle, deserters are found and murdered, and women and children at home are left to fend for themselves while men are gone. <br /> Anyway, I thought Nicole Kidman and Rene Zelleweger were pretty decent and did not know much about Jude Law, he was fine too. It seems that Ren√© Z. had the most fun part of the 3 main roles and that he could play intelligently a woman perverse and energetic with a lot of confidence. For me too, it was good to see the actress, Kathy Baker ... someone whose talent needs to be better recognized / recognized. <br /> <br /> This movie is worth seeing - I can not say why really, but maybe because it's part of Americana. <br /> <br />
