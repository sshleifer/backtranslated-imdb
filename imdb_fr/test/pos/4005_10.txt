First, I want to say that Ang Lee did a very good job for this one! I watched it yesterday and I was surprised. The story is very good, but all ignorant people would say, "It sucks people can not fly!" I tell them it IS FICTION and that it is. This should not be taken as a movie about reality, you could say it's a "fairy tale". And a very nice to watch Asian fairy tale. The image can really make you lose your head. Because it is filmed artistically, Ang Lee has a great talent (we do not appreciate it, you say). The fight scenes are very cool and admirably presented to the viewer. But it's sad but this film did not have the appreciation it should have had. But Ang Lee has fortunately attracted the attention he deserved with his resounding success in the mountains. So, even for viewers who are not interested in the story, the images are fun enough!
