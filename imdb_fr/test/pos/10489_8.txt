"He Prezzo Del Potere" by Tonino Valerii alias. "The Price Of Power" is an excellent and fascinating western that reflects the assassination of Kennedy. An excellent performance by Giuliano Gemma and an excellent score by Luis Bacalof are just two of the many reasons to watch this film. <br /> <br /> In 1881, Texas is divided in two: those who appreciate the abolition of slavery and simply want to live in peace, and those who, after 16 years, still want to resettle the confederation. Despite warnings, President James Garfield, who wants to implement a new equality policy, decides to travel to Dallas, where corrupt law enforcement officials are preparing for his assassination. Bill Willer (Giuliano Gemma) and two of his friends, a black man named Jack Donovan (Ray Shaunders) and a cripple named Nick (Manuel Zarzo) are determined to prevent the murder of the president. <br /> <br /> Since James Garfield was not murdered by racists, who wanted to relocate the confederation in Texas, but in Washington DC by Charles Guiteau mentally unstable, the scenario of "Price Of Power" is, well sure, historical absurdity. Since the film, however, does not claim historical accuracy, but attempts to hint at Kennedy's 1963 assassination in Dallas, the fact that the story is fictional is legitimate. <br /> <br /> Giuliano Gemma delivers an excellent performance as the main character of Bill Willer, Benito Stefanelli is great as a naughty and corrupt Sheriff Jefferson. Some other good performances are Ray Shaunders as Jack's black friend, Warren Vanders as Arthur McDonald, advisor to the president, and Fernando Rey in Pinkerton, a rich and bad businessman. The score of Luis Enr√≠quez Bacalov is excellent, the cinematography and places are excellent and (as in the previous "Day of Anger" of Valerii) reminds a lot to Sergio Leone, for whom Valerii worked as assistant director for Dollars "and" for a few dollars more ". <br /> <br /> All told," Il Prezzo Del Potere "is, after" Day Of Anger ", another excellent spaghetti western showing the great talent of Giuliano Gemma as an actor and Tonino Valerii as a director. "The Price Of Power" is a must for Western Spaghetti fans, and I recommend it to everyone.
