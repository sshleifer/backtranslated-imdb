This film is based on the true story of Christopher Boyce and his friend Daunton Lee. This fascinating story unfolds during the Whitlam Dismissal era, during which Christopher was aware of the secret correspondence that revealed the CIA's involvement in Australian political and trade union circles. The film shows several scenes involving Gough Whitlam (broadcast on American television), where events are held that confirm the classified documents that Christopher had read before. The elimination of Gough Whitlam was a coup organized by the CIA. Elsewhere in the film, it was mentioned that most people had no idea of ​​the level of deception that existed to ensure that the United States was used as a means of promoting certain policies at the request of all. At the present time, nothing has changed. <br /> <br /> Christopher's life has been profoundly shaken by his knowledge of how the CIA shapes foreign democracies, including the democracies of allied nations in the United States. Christopher reacted, probably not in the best way at the time, selling top secret information to the Soviet Union with Daunton Lee as an exchange. Finally, Christopher and Daunton were captured and sentenced for treason. <br /> <br /> On May 23, 1982, while serving a prison term in an American prison, Christopher Boyce accepted a single interview with Ray Martin of 60 Minutes the Australian connection that deeply affected. This caused an uproar in the Australian media for about a week, then it calmed down. <br /> <br /> I liked the symbolism of the film on the hawk, in which Chris was called the hawk and Daunton the good guy connection), but in reality, the title "Falcon" was not used by Chris. <br /> <br /> Christopher Boyce: Criminal or conscience?
