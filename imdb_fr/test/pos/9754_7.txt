HUNTING FOR JUSTICE is a Canadian television series that has gone on DVD. This is a reason for gratitude for those who are thirsty for educational drama series that tell us about facts in contemporary history that are somehow buried in the media. The film is not a Hollywood production, it relies heavily on excerpts of court records, but it also presents to many of us the act of heroism Louise Arbor during the trial of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic. <br /> <br /> Louise Arbor (experienced Canadian actress Wendy Crewson) is a Canadian judge appointed by the Chief Prosecutor for War Crimes at the International Criminal Tribunal in The Hague. The film begins in 1996 when Arbor travels to The Hague to face political obstacles that prevent the Tribunal from bringing war criminals to justice in Yugoslavia's war in Serbia, Croatia and Bosnia. crimes against humanity in the form of genocide, extermination camps and other abominable abuses. Progress in bringing criminals to justice is thwarted by generals (including William Hurt) who fear a major world war if precautions against them are violated. Arbor, with the help of his translator Pasko Odsak (Stipe Erceg), his collaborators, including Keller (Heino Ferch), and the unexpected assistance of the British captain John Tanner (John Corbett), is moving forward, focusing on the impossible task of bringing all parties' leaders to justice over three specific events. Two of the three main suspects are captured but at their trials, each of them meets its end. This leaves only Slobodan Milosevic himself, and Arbor and his colleagues succeed in bringing the war criminal to justice in 1999. <br /> <br /> There are several touching subplots used to tell this well-documented story, stories that make the story point more personal. Some may find that the filmed footage of corpses and prisoners and death camps are too much to watch, but they are needed to convey the purpose of the film. Wendy Crewson has the power to get the message across - the message that war crimes must never go unpunished. This film has a lot to learn from current history: writers Ian Adams, Riley Adams and A. Lovretta have condensed the information and made it dramatic. Director Charles Binam√© strikes a balance between documentary and the progress of history, never forgetting that he also has a story to tell. HUNTING FOR JUSTICE is worth a look! Grady Harp
