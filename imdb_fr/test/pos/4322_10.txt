This episode is so far the best of the series. The story was told perfectly. I particularly liked how the writers made an episode of Desmond; it was his best performance to date and he certainly deserved the Emmy for his performance. <br /> <br /> We had some answers to our questions in this episode, but since the series is called Lost, we know there will be more questions. high too. First, the answer: Walt is finally reunited with his father Michael, second, Michael's treason is exposed to Jack, Sawyer, Kate and Hurly and because of this betrayal, Kate, Jack and Sawyer are all captured by The Others. It was a great way to end the show. <br /> <br /> On the other side of the island, we see Locke in a mental crisis with the button. This leads to another question about how the plane actually collapsed. However, there are still some unanswered questions: first, what did they become Locke, Eko and Desmond when Desmond turned the security key and what was the agreement with Arctic scientists looking for electromagnetic annamolies. I guess we'll know it next season, even if it's an excellent ending for the best TV show.
