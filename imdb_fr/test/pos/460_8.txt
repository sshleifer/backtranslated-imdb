Located in Hungary in November 1956, this film tells the story of a group of foreign nationals trying to leave the country at the time of the uprising. <br /> <br /> Once the airport is closed, the owner's adventure begins with a bus taking them to Austria. As it is obvious, they are stopped on their way and face the almost irreproachable Yul Brynner, whose military power as commander of the Red Army was marked by solitude, his internal struggle between good and evil, his search for the truth and his need to feel emotions for other human beings. He was saddened by the fact that his work took him away from his friends and enemies and aspired to social contact. <br /> <br /> Robert Morley is a lazy Englishman with a stiff upper lip who, no matter how serious the role, manages to maintain a logical view of the almost carefree life while Jason Robards has a startling film debut that highlights why he has had so many roles throughout his career. Deborah Kerr, as a senior woman, exposes the grace and femininity that we associate with her while bringing the strength and determination required for her character. <br /> <br /> The film tells a very eventful period. in European history but it never stops to remind us that there is something good in each of us and that you can never completely judge a book by the cover. A fabulous script writing ensures that, despite the seriousness of the subject, there can always be superb duplicates and comical examples that add to the quality of the film, instead of harming it. The chemistry in the game of cat and mouse between Kerr and Brynner makes you understand why they appeared in more than one movie together. <br /> <br /> All in all, a really captivating film that I would absolutely like to see again. 8/10
