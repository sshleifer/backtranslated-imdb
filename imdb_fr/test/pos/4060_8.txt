SHOWTIME is a mess, but it's an entertaining mess. The plot is forgotten, the satire is light and the action sequences, although well staged, are not so exciting. But I laughed. A lot. The merit goes to the inspired couple of De Niro and Murphy. They have a great chemistry. Murphy delivers the one-liners, De Niro surprises us with a look or a grimace. This film will receive a RUSH HOUR reception from critics. Do not listen to them. If you're a fan of De Niro or Murphy, you'll love this movie.
