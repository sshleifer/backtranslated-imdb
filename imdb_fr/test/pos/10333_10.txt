This movie was one of the best I have ever seen. The other day, something on television reminded me of this movie. It came back to me like a barrage overflowing. I have never been more touched by a film than by this one. After the movie, I really could not stop crying for about 2 hours. No movie had ever moved me that way before. I was 15 years old at the time of the film and I have not seen it since, but I hope to be able to find a copy to buy so you can watch it at any time. If someone suggests you to watch this movie with them, GO ... you will not be disappointed. <br /> <br /> Peggy Fries
