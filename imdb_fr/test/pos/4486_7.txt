I guess by the time I saw this episode, I had seen enough twilight zones to determine it in advance. There is this strange assemblage of characters who find themselves at the bottom of a cylinder. They're fine until an overzealous soldier shows up in the middle of them. It's his main directive to escape and he gathers the forces and puts them to work to reach the top of the cylinder. There is a lot of talk about purpose and reason and speculation about their past, but no one can remember anything. They represent different trades: a piper, a ballerina, a clown, a man with a tattered hat. Why are they here? This leads to an adventure and is resolved in the end, but I guess I had a pretty good idea before anything happened.
