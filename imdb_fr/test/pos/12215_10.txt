Someone asked why it had been canceled, but why? Because "reality" brings in money. the exhibition space was canceled so that it could be replaced by a "reality" show, it will haunt NBC, myself and about half of my high school, about 1,000 people in total committed to boycott NBC until that they come back to the show. in my area (I do not know other places) but they had a very good side with the Sci-Fi channel, where the Sci-Fi channel would show the episode of last week at 7:00, then NBC would show the new episode Of the week at 8 am it was great because it gave you a little reminder of what happened in the last episode. I was so angry when I learned that the show was canceled and they were going to leave them at the top of the church like that!
