I enjoyed this movie and once finished, it always makes you think of it. I think Jeremy Brett is brilliant in this role although his role as "death" was a bit exaggerated, but like Jeremy Brett, that does not matter. did not bother me. <br /> <br /> It's a good drama and it follows Oscar Wildes' novel very closely. If you like this film, I also recommend you to watch "An Ideal Husband" with Jeremy Brett as Lord Goring. <br /> <br /> This film gives a good overview of the way of thinking of Oscar Wildes.And looking at it, the viewer We remember how Dorian Gray is Lord Alfred 'Bosie' Douglas and Basil Halward is Oscar Wilde .
