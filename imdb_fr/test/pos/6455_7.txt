Clearly inspired by the first gangster movies Warner produced the same year, Little Caesar (1931) and The Public Enemy (1931), this gangster movie is one of the best efforts I've ever seen. Although it is not quite in the same category as the classics mentioned above, it has a powerful performance of the young Sylvia Sidney. She is beautiful and her lines are more natural than everyone else at the time. Gary Cooper is better than usual at this stage of his career and shows signs of what will follow over the next few years. Paul Lukas (who has never seen him so hateful) and Guy Kibbee (what a shock to see him play the hooligan in the movie) are fascinating films. The staging of Rouben Mamoulian is very inventive, probably the first voice off thoughts appear in this film. If you have the chance to see this little gangster movie, do not miss this chance.
