I saw this movie in the early 90's, when it was on VHS for a while. At the time, I found it interesting and I was particularly struck by the segment of Ken Russell, with the visions of the victim of the accident during the triage and the operation. <br /> <br /> Last night, during a screening in the second round of Indiana Jones' latest film, John Hurt's vision provoked an unexpected flashback on "Aria", which I had not thought of since years, and the sudden memory of Russell's play itself was enough to cause a little burst of tears. <br /> <br /> If I can make this observation, I note with interest the reaction of love-hate that people have expressed towards the Russell segment, and I found this interesting difference in other films that plunge into deep traumas and its aftermath. Some get it, some do not, interesting. <br /> <br /> From the comments and the evaluation, the work as a whole has touched people in different ways. That's how it touches me and touches me.
