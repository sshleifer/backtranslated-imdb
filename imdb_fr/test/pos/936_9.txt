This is the latest film by Krzysztof Kieslowski - one of the greatest directors in the history of cinema. He intended to retire after this film, so it's sort of his artistic testament. He died a few years after making the film, and although it is said he intended to return to directing, Destiny decided it was his last. And what a movie! <br /> <br /> 'Red', the last film of the tricolor French trilogy is actually a very Swiss film. Located in Geneva, one of the two main characters is a retired Swiss judge. We immediately think of Durenmatt. But there is more Switzerland in the freshness, in the lack of communication of the characters, in the politeness which envelops the cruelty of life. Several characters who start with few connections will end up in a moving final and human, only a great artist could have staged. time. Yes, the film starts slowly and fans of American action movies or melodramas will be discouraged first and lost as spectators. They deserve it. The film gains in quality as it moves forward, and one of the not-so-hidden messages is that real life and real humans are more interesting than Hollywood cartoon, plastic action and characters. The quality of the cinema is very original, the image being a "study in red", as the title shows. It is fabulous to play with Irene Jacob and Jean-Louis Trintignant - the last in what will probably remain the best role of his old age. <br /> <br /> A great movie. The review probably adds, and I'm happy to have recorded it on tape. 9/10 on my personal scale.
