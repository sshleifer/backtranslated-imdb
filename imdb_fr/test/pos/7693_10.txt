It was / is an incredible movie, with a cast, a music, a song, an incredible story, etc. It's a tragedy that some arrogant families (the Gerswhins or the Premingers) can prevent from being available generation after generation. I wanted to see him again all my life. I just found this site and read why it was not available. Shame on these families for their smallness. My wife is German and she has never seen the movie. Neither my stepchildren nor my grandchildren. It is very unfortunate that a film of this depth and quality is not accessible to them. Where do these families manage to make a decision as pretentious, selfish, condescending as to forbid generations to enjoy this film, these stars, these performances, this music! Release the video and let them judge and enjoy the world!
