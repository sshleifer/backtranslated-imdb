I did not plan to look lost when I saw the MTV preview, but since I had nothing better to do or watch on a Sunday night, I watched it. <br /> <br /> Wasted was not a Requiem for a dream, but it was a very good movie, since it was made by MTV. Summer Pheonix, the sister of the deceased and wonderful River Pheonix, attracted me. I guess the Pheonix family is talented because it was good and Jaquien as well as River is River. Nick Stahl also offers an excellent performance as a junky jock. There is not much to say about waste. It was a dark and depressing look at the lives of three small town junkies. I recommend it to those who like the subject. 8/10
