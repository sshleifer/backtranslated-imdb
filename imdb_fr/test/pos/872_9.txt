(Contains spoilers) <br /> <br /> People who put a Lonely Heart ad in the paper are often idealists. They try to describe in a few words everything they are and expect. The exchange of letters is hopeful ... Louis Mahe (Jean Paul Belmondo), owner of a cigarette company on the island of Reunion (East of Madagascar) is so touched by the letters of Julie Roussell that he proposes to her. But not the pretty brunette expected comes from the council of "Mississippi", but - Catherine Deneuve. And we know from the beginning that it is a marriage sham and that a crime has been committed. She shows no interest in the wardrobe of "Julie" (she does not even open her trunk) and neglects her canary until her death. But the most basic seduction techniques (an open zipper) are enough to turn Louis into a soft little dog. First: a common bank account. And then, when Julie's sister draws attention to herself, the theft. With 27,850 million out of Louis' 28 million, she would have needed her signature for the entire sum. <br /> <br /> The sister of Louis and Julie retains the services of a private detective (Michel Bouquet). Louis manages to find Marion (real name of Deneuve) in Antibes where she works as a taxi girl - her gangster lover left her without money, or rather without a centimeter. Louis is unable to kill her. She tells her story: orphan. Early. Lesbian experiences. Many sugardaddies. Jail - and soon she drives him again by the nose. The detective is sneaky as a fox and tenacious as a blood hound; Louis and Marion bury his body in the cellar. They flee to Paris, where Louis discovers that Marion has an expensive taste. She venerates money as a deity. He sells his business at a fraction of his value. But when the body of the detective is discovered (a flood), they must flee again - without money. Life in a mountain inn with a whiny loser - Marion can think of a happier life without this appendix ... <br /> <br /> A highlight in the careers of all concerned. The deception of Belmondo makes it almost endearing. Deneuve is lovely in her Yves St. Laurent wardrobe and her performance is lovely: at first, she simulates the fragile woman - too shy to ask for money from her husband, which is why a joint bank account is necessary - but after having like Katharine Hepburn in the prison scene of BRINGING UP BABY. The landscape is spectacular - the tropics, the riviera, Paris. Truffaut realizes with obvious aplomb: the sixties were the only decade in which European films far exceeded American productions. After this film, Truffaut was able to watch his idol, Alfred Hichcock, in the eye.
