First, before I start my review, I just read every review of 'The Muppet Movie' here and I can not believe anyone can give a negative review of a movie like this. (Fortunately, there was only one.) I mean, I can understand how someone can not like 'Star Wars' because of all kind of science fiction, but do not like a movie featuring some of the loveliest puppets in the history of mankind. is almost sad. <br /> <br /> Okay, I'll leave my gallery now and review this movie. <br /> <br /> "The Muppet movie" came out when I was seven years old. All my friends wanted to see this as their birthday film. So I think I saw him about four times the first month in theaters. <br /> <br /> Child, many things attracted me and more. Muppet movies and TV shows. Singing was probably the main thing. Most of The Muppet Movie's songs are classics. From "Rainbow Connection" to "I'm going back one day", they are entertaining and inspiring. <br /> <br /> As an adult, I see the movie "The Muppet" in an almost different way. light. Yes, the things that made me excited when I was a child are still there, but those are the little jokes and the ones that are just hilarious. <br /> <br /> I mean, when you think about it, Jim Henson is a sick man. <br /> <br /> Kermit is a frog in love with a pretty pig who wears purple gloves and who could cut you in two in karate. Fozzie is a comic bear. The gonzo is a "no matter" which is loving chickens. Then you have two old guys heckling, a dog playing the piano, a rock band with a manic drummer, a Swedish chef you can not understand and a number of characters just eccentric. <br /> <br /> Yet for all these reasons, Henson has entertained millions of children and adults, giving us all something special to watch and remember. <br /> <br /> "The Muppet movie" will always remain in my heart for many reasons, but I think the most important is that it is a movie, unlike many recent children's movies , with which I am comfortable. the children are watching. In addition, I do not get bored in my mind with crazy jokes about my children. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie that will be remembered forever.
