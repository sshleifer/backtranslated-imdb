Curiously, the Independent Film Channel showed this film a week after the show KARATE BEAR FIGHTER - even if the movie about bears was the second in the trilogy and this film was the first !!! What were they thinking ?! While these three films are supposedly based on the life of this great karate master Kyokushin, you can not help but think that they MUST have embellished the story a lot - especially in this first film. Of course, the guy apparently fought and killed a bull and later a bear (in fact, he fought and killed many bulls during his career), but in this film set in the early '50s, at the end of the movie, the hero fights about 60 men and kills many brutally. I just can not imagine that it really happened. So I checked and found that while many details are correct, some of these movies are just hogwash! Yes, he did kill a man in self-defense and YES he followed the widow and her son and spent a year working for them - trying to make them forgive. But the end of the film is nice to watch, but hogwash. See one of his opponents receive a stick in the head and all other bloody details could not have happened otherwise the Japanese government would have locked Oyama to protect society! The film is entertaining and the fights are excellent. There are no complaints about action or acting. The only minor complaint is the work of the camera - which is a bit sloppy during some fight scenes. Despite this minor complaint, it is a most enjoyable film. In many ways, the wandering karate master's theme is reminiscent of Zatoichi's movies - which are also very entertaining to watch, but most feats are really impossible. <br /> <br /> FYI - There is an English dubbed version of this movie called "Champion of Death" and I have just seen it too. This is not a bad dub and it was a mailbox (a big plus), but I still prefer the subtitled version.
