Or at least you feel good after this movie. This is the kind of movie you can really use the word "ricochet", although it is rocky in this totally casual, intelligent and open way that belongs to French. <br /> <br /> No, Catherine Deneuve does not go all the film up (sorry to disappoint the puritans who have an agenda) .. but the scene to which I refer concerns all the members of a wedding party - AND it's a musical number! Anyway, everything is going very well together and the unusual, bright and colorful family (Deneuve's mother is a lesbian, Deneuve, her very lively daughter) entertains us and annoys us like real families .. but as c is a film that she especially entertains. You do not want to say too much about the end, but Deneuve ends up marrying a man about twenty years old. This is quite credible when we see the relationship grow over time and the two are naturally close to each other. The end is happy. and, like the rest of the film, both original and perfect.
