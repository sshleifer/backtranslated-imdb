Contains Spoilers <br /> <br /> Luchino Visconti's film adaptation of Thomas Mann's novel is visually, if not philosophically, faithful to its source (Britten's opera offers a more faithful reading of the Apollonian / Dionysian struggles consume the old writer). It is certainly one of the most sumptuous films ever made. <br /> <br /> In the Visconti version, the focus is more on the physical aspects of the story. Venice has never been so beautiful and seductive, more decadent and more effaced. If you read the news, it's as if the descriptions of its pages come to life. Dirk Bogarde gives an outstanding performance as Gustav von Aschenbach. Although he has very little dialogue, he expresses bitterness, arouses passion and, finally, the terrible desire of Aschenbach, only by facial expressions. Bjorn Andresen, the young actor who plays Tadzio, Aschenbach's beautiful object of desire, was perfectly chosen. He too plays the role with facial expressions and gestures. The character of Tadzio plays a central role in the story, so any actor playing this role must be worthy to inspire passion and desire. Visconti, with his incredible eye for beauty, knew exactly what he was doing. And to change Ashenbach from writer to composer based on Gustav Mahler, then to use Mahler's music, especially the Adagietto of the Fifth Symphony, was another brilliant stroke. I had read Mann's story before the movie, but the music of Mahler and Death in Venice will always be inextricably linked in my mind. Like the haunted images that appear throughout the film, especially the last Ashenbach dying on the beach as Tadzio slowly heads towards the sea. <br /> <br /> One day, this film will be released in large format DVD screen and its visual splendors fully restored for us.
