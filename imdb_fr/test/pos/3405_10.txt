I was 13 years old when this mini-series (and its sequel North and South, Book II) was broadcast for the first time. I had already been captivated by the stories of personal interest of / around our Civil War, which interested me to watch this show made for television. <br /> <br /> I loved it. And now, I'm 29 and I do not like it anymore. It is filled with history, beautiful costumes and real characters woven into the life of fictional characters, which you all hold dear. There is intrigue, love, loyalty, betrayal, family, extended family, lust, battles, victory, defeat and rebuilding. Even though I had the entire series of episodes on tapes that I had originally recorded, I bought the entire N & S and N & S II series at Columbia House a few years ago, when they became available. Once every two or three years, I spend the entire weekend watching all the episodes - and I'm sad at the end of the last episode because I find myself wanting to continue to watch the life story of these characters. </ br> I can not recommend this mini-series anymore.
