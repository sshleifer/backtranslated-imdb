Good show, very good acting, and the director takes us in his scenario in an interesting and unpredictable way, especially since it is essentially two people in a room. Like many modern movies, it does not go as planned, but it does not drag either. Bohl is flippant enough to believe her in the "now" of her character, who is still involved and does not go back on her "career" choices. his soul ... Brundage has the delicate balance between weight, innocence, gentleness and class to succeed very well Buddy. A little grainy on the quality of the film, but it corresponds to the tone of the story. Could use some polishing on the hair and makeup, but it's definitely worth watching.
