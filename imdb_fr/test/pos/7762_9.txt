Okay, let me start by saying that, overall, I do not really like cartoons. I enjoyed some of the "classic" series often cited, but I consider the media as a whole the same way I do for American television: namely, 90% to 95% of it is totally tripe , with the rest falling anywhere from "observable" to "decent". This being the case, it is not surprising that I do not like parodies of self-deprecation. I do not understand most jokes, and the medium itself imposes a certain style of humor that I do not like at all - strong, hyperactive, weak and completely excessive. <br /> <br /> So when I started watching this show at the request of a friend, I was disappointed by the disappointment after the first two episodes. I thought that the characters were supposed to represent clich√© characters from store-torn storytelling, and that their actions should be just as satirical. I could somehow see where it came from, but I did not think it was so great: a lot of "wacky and fun maneuvers for high school kids", and only now, we're ironic about it. "Towards the third episode, my opinion has changed dramatically. <br /> <br /> It is from this moment that the strengths of this series have begun to appear." The quirks of the order of episodes not chronological, its zesty sense of self-awareness and, above all, its intelligent humor with (breathlessness) a hetero man well executed. <br /> <br /> In what I consider to be rarity on all media, this show presents thoughtful and spiritual interactions between characters that are diametrically opposed.The perpetual sense of Kyon protagonist's loosely resigned resignation is the perfect flagship for the actions of Haruhi's "anime-like" generic feats. and it works incredibly well. <br /> <br /> Based on this solid foundation, the series succeeds with a truly phenomenal level of attention. are broadcast out of chronological order. I considered this a gadget at first, but it works surprisingly well. The chronological sequence of events logically makes sense, but the sequence of episodes follows more closely the traditional structure of the Aristotelian drama. The chosen order leaves no narrative flaw that can not be filled by mere inference (but if it is possible to guess what happened in a previous "previous" episode, we still feel obliged to look at exactly how these events), and superb planning prevents any plots or contradictions. I watched this series a second time immediately after completing it for the first time, and I was amazed at how even seemingly inconsistent events were all related. <br /> <br /> The last point is indicative of the extreme attention to detail. in all areas of the series. While the character drawings "animate" stock rhyme a bit, the background art is exquisite, rendered realistically based on real photographic references. The quality of the animation is also excellent at important points. For example, there is a musical performance late in the series in which the characters play a song - this may seem trivial, but the subconscious effect of watching an animation (of cinematic quality) that actually corresponds to the soundtrack is incredible . <In short, I like this series for some reason. By its very nature, it's something I do not like at all, but its execution is so unique and well executed that I can not help it.
