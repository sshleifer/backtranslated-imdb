This episode of Charmed has changed everything! The series is about to end its third season and hell is unleashed in this episode. The charmed bring an innocent man named Dr. Griffiths to the manor to protect him from Shax, the killer of the springs. When Shax attacks, he turns into a tornado and then materializes in his demon skin. He blames Prue threw a wall that totally knocks him out and almost kills her. Then Piper threw what was left of the wall. Phoebe comes from the attic and says the fate of conquering before Shax comes to kill the doctor. But being the power of One, it hurts him simply. Leo comes to heal the other sisters and Prue wants to find Shax and destroy him for real. Phoebe is meanwhile in the underworld and is looking to find Cole. When Prue and Piper go out into the street to find the demon, the demon finds them. After their fight, the witches realize that a camera has captured everything! Back in Manor, they try to fight against the media and after defeating Shax, a kookoo become wizard pulls on Piper. Prue uses her telekinesis to keep people away so she can get to the hospital. But they arrive too late and Piper dies. And just as Prue is about to be shot, the time is up to where they take Dr. Griffiths to the Manor. Shax blows and blows on Prue and Piper. But Phoebe is still in the underworld so Shax kills the doctor and runs away from the mansion. When Leo finally arrives, he can not heal Prue. Prue is dead and the power of the three too. For the moment. Personally. this episode was sad. Prue was the strongest of all. I would like to have his power of telekinesis. I really do not think Phoebe should go to Hell because if she did not, Shax would not kill Prue. But Paige brings The Power of Three together again and I'm happy with the progress of the series
