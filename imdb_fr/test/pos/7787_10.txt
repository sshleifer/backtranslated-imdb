Andaz Apna Apna is my favorite comedy movie of all time. Both Aamir and Salman Khan acted brilliantly while Aamir's game was much better than salman's. Amir Khan is nicknamed 'MR. PERFECTIONIST in Bollywood and he proves it in each of his films. <br /> <br /> The story revolves around two young boys, Amar (Aamir Khan) and Prem (Salman Khan), both from poor and dreamy families. They want to become rich without suffering. So when they hear about Raveena Bajaj (Raveena Tandon), the daughter of Mr.Bajaj (Paresh Rawal) who comes to India to find her husband, they cheat on their father to marry Raveena Bajaj and the journey begins. There is also a twist in the film that makes the film even more funny.Paresh Rawal plays a dual role (Teja and Mr. Bajaj) and has brilliantly acted as he always does.Shakti kapoor (the crime master Gogo) also adds a great comedy . <br /> <br /> This film is a faceted comedy tickling from the first minute to the end and it's one of Bollywood's classic comedy films.
