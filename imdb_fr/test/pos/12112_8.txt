"Buffalo Bill, the hero of the Wild West", the film "The Beast" and "The Beast" director Mario Costa could have been produced in Europe. Hollywood would never have dared to make a western about a sexual predator on the lookout as a protagonist of a movie. It does not matter that Kinski fits perfectly in the role of "Crazy" Johnny. He plays a totally helpless character who is ironically dressed from head to toe in a white suit, trousers and hat. This budget plane is not appealing. The breathtaking Spanish landscape around Almeria is nowhere else. Instead, Costa and his director of photography, Luciano Trasatti, who shot another Kinski western, "And God told Cain", filmed this opera on horseback in a rather banal setting around Tor Caldara, Lazio, Italy and the Monte Gelato Falls, Treja River, Lazio, Italy. Nevertheless, "The Beast" is considered a continental western because it deals with unscrupulous characters and the action can be called a film noir because the hero and the heroine are trapped by intolerable circumstances that force them to resort to activities criminal. As might be expected, their well-crafted plans turn against them, largely because of Kinski's character. Indeed, the licentious character of Kinski looks like a character of the type Wily E. Coyote. He is still struggling to have sex with many beautiful women but either lawyers or outlaws thwart each of his efforts. In the end, "The Beast" equates to a tragic study overflowing with irony. The orchestral score of Stelvio Cipriani sounds as if it had been raised by Tony Anthony's western "The Stranger Returns". Mario Costa's screenplay takes place on the western border between San Diego and Mexico, terrorized by a notorious Mexican bandit called Machete (Giovanni Pallavicino of "We always kill the old way") and his gang. They attack the diligence and no one is safe from their depredations. The first time we see "Crazy" Johnny Laster, he pauses to cool off by a stream and sees a beautiful woman washing clothes. He slips behind her and attacks him, but a taller man, armed with a rifle, intervenes and must flee. He shows up in a nearby town and a snuff-sniffing officer recruits him to help him ambush a rich man, Mr. Powers, on the trail and rob him. They end up killing him and not having money. Mr. Snuff-sniffer accidentally leaves his snuffbox at the scene of the crime and the sheriff's arrests on suspicion of murder. "Crazy" takes his accomplice from his hotel room so he does not have to worry about being involved in the crime. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, a young couple in love is struggling to find their way around the world. . Riccardo (Steven Tedd of "Requiem for a Bounty Killer") lives a Mexican couple on their ranch and helps them raise their real son Juan. In the village, Riccardo's charming girlfriend, Juanita (Gabriella Giorgelli from "Stranger in Sacramento") sings and dances in the cantina. Riccardo and Juanita are planning to get married, but the last place Juanita wants to settle is in a dusty ranch. She dreams of living in the city, but her life requires more money than Riccardo or herself. They team up with Glen, a blond outlaw (Paolo Casella from "Shoot the Living and Pray for the Dead") and plan to kidnap Mr. Power's daughter, Nancy, when she picks up her inheritance. Glen makes the fatal mistake of recruiting Johnny 'Crazy' to help them because Glen knows Johnny needs money to find women. <br /> <br /> They kidnap Powers' daughter and keep her in an isolated cabin with Johnny, security guard on her. Meanwhile, Juanita poses as Powers 'daughter and goes to town to get money from Powers' lawyer, Gary Pinkerton (Giuliano Raffaelli of "Blood and Black Lace"), but he becomes suspicious because Juanita looks nothing like what he remembered Nancy. . Riccardo brandishes his six guns and warns Pinkerton that they have kidnapped Nancy. Unfortunately for Riccardo and Juanita, Pinkerton can not get his hands on $ 50,000, because Machete has sown fear in the hearts of all, so the total inheritance of the powers can not be shipped across the territory at the stagecoach . Returning to the cabin, Johnny, very excited, tries to rape Nancy, but she exceeds him, knows him with a chair, claiming to need to be alone while undressing. After knocking her out, she steals a stroller and brings her back to town. Johnny recovers, chases and kills him at about the same time Glen, Riccardo, Juanita and Pinkerton join him on the trail. They inform Johnny of the complications created by Machete's reign of terror and give him $ 12,000. Pinkerton is dismayed by Nancy's blood-stained corpse and threatens Johnny. Of course, Johnny knocks him cold on the spot. <br /> <br /> Things are really starting to get worse as the San Diego law tries to capture Machete. Glen, Riccardo and Juanita return to Mexico while Johnny attacks two women on a ranch and barely avoids being caught. He goes to Mexico, finds a fucking cantina and falls on her when a bonus stuffs a revolver in her face. Johnny admits he knows where they can find more money if they release him. Machete's men follow Johnny's advice and capture Juanita. The villagers join Riccardo to attack Machete and Johnny saves Juanita but it dies later after a big shooting. Riccardo remains alone now. Machete and his men fought back against his in-laws, not only killing them, but also little Juan. Everything Riccardo and Juanita have dreamed of creating ends in clouds of smoke for an unfortunate end. 'Crazy' Johnny dies and never manages to appease his lust. If you think of Costa's uncompromising sagebrusher, "The Beast" appears as an interesting character study and a black film exercise in a Western setting where everyone is punished.
