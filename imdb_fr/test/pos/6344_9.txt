This is a wonderful sequel to the award-winning Lonesome Dove mini-series in the 1980s. This sequel may be better than the original. It is certainly more family-friendly. The language is more moderate. There is a lot of violence and a particular scene with Cherokee Jack is particularly horrible. However, overall, it's a good movie. The acting is superb. William Peterson is fantastic. Such a dramatic actor with a quick sense of wit and comical timing. Jon Voight fills the shoes of Tommy Lee Jones in the role of Captain Call. Ricky Shroder is a young boy who grew up with no family to claim him. Highly recommended.
