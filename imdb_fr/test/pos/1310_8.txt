I had never heard of Mishima before watching this movie and, even though some parts are a little tedious, I'm still drawn to this movie when it's repeated on the box. At the beginning of the film, we hear about a famous Japanese writer who behaves like a madman and commits seppuku in public. As the movie progresses, you gently enter the twisted logic of Mishima's mind. The stages of his life are presented in four chapters. Each chapter itself is a mixture of two contrasting stories. The first continues the story with scenes from the life of Mishima and appears in black and white. The second story is an adaptation of scenes from a novel. These are staged as a play and filmed in bright colors. There is a different novel staged in each chapter. Between each chapter, the narrative returns to the present, as Mishima moves towards her eventual ritual suicide. This means that the drama and the tension are maintained until the end. <br /> <br /> I guess many people will find this film boring and pretentious and his art house. I respect that, it's not a movie for those who want action and a strong story. If, on the other hand, you are the kind of person who likes to be able to penetrate the mind of a strange man while watching his life told in a collage of beautiful images set to music by Philip Glass, you will love it . I liked it. <br /> <br />
