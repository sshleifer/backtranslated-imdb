The best part of the movie was when Alan took off his panties and put the razor on his cheeks and on his hole. It was also great to see Alan's buttocks go up and down like a fiddler's elbow later in the movie. <br /> <br /> Alan was hard as hell as when he got angry and pushed the wimp to four eyes on the sofa. <br /> <br /> I've been laughing for a bit of a razor's knife for days. A brilliant idea of ​​the writers. Alan must be brought back to Eastenders to be able to do the same with Peggy. <br /> <br /> Alan is back and this time he is armed with a razor. Be careful if you are a girl and he finds you and pulls your pants.
