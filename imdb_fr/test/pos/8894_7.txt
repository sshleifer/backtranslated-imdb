Owen loves his mom ... only he would like it better six feet underground in this dark and ridiculous comedy that the two stars direct and is directed by Danny DeVito, with admirable helpers Billy Crystal and Anne Ramsey in the leading role. <br /> <br /> "Throw Momma From The Train" is a fantastic comedy, even if it's not a good movie. It is too shallow in places, and the end seems less organic than on which it has been stuck. But Crystal and DeVito use excellent chemistry for the screen while working their own comics takes the essence of a struggling writer (DeVito is greedy but not talented, Crystal is stuck and bitter). Crystal's Professor Donner believes that his ex-wife has stolen his book (unfortunately called "Hot Fire") and can not write more than the first sentence of his next book, which is not easy. He teaches a creative writing class on nascent mediocrity, including a middle-aged woman who writes a Tom Clancy-type fiction but does not know what this story is told by the submarine captain; and a furniture seller who wants to write the story of his life. Mr. Pinsky is probably the funniest person to laugh at the minute on the screen, a lunatic wearing a suit of ascot that considers literature as an excuse to write his opus: "100 girls I would like pork. " <br /> <br /> Then there is DeVito's Owen Lift, who calls himself "the star pupil" of Professor Donner, even though the teacher will not read his work in class. Owen is a rather unusual character to play in a film, a man-child in his thirties who lives with his dominant mother, Anne Ramsey, who calls him "lardass" and other endearing feelings. In any other movie, we would be asked to feel sorry for Owen, but "Throw Momma From The Train" accumulates the cruelties of life on this sad bag for laughter and expects us to follow the process. This is one of the main reasons why this movie probably loses a lot of people. <br /> <br /> For those of us who appreciate the humor of this character, even identify with him, and who consider the rest of what we see here as an Alouette, it is not also complicated to go with the biggest game of this comedy, asking us to watch with amusement while Owen asks for help from Professor Donner to plan to kill his mother. In fact, he first goes to Hawaii to kill Donner's ex-hated, then tells the professor that it's her turn to kill Mrs. Lift, "swapping murders" as shown by Hitchcock's "Strangers on a Train". <br /> <br /> director, DeVito not only completes the performances of his actors with a staging that emphasizes dialogue, but he makes bold visual statements, adding elements of fun unreality to keep the public on guard (and avoid taking things too seriously.)) <br /> <br /> The writer Stu Silver, who continues to make others laugh with his notebook to quote, also helps to the case. "You have rats the size of Oldsmobiles here." "She's not a woman ... she's the Terminator." "A little murder and I'm Jack the Ripper." These are all Crystal's words, but some of the funniest lines, which only work in context but absolutely kill, are those of DeVito and Ramsey. Apparently, Silver never wrote another script after that, according to the IMDb, and that's a shame because he had a real talent for that. <br /> <br /> The best scene in this film, when Crystal meets Ramsey, was actually used in its entirety as a theatrical presentation of an "upcoming attraction", the only time I saw a movie promoted this way. Owen introduces the teacher to his mother as "Cousin Patty" and when Mom says he has no cousin Patty, panicked Owen loses him. "You lied to me," he shouts, slamming the professor's forehead with a saucepan. <br /> <br /> Of course, in reality, the teacher would not moan about a spiritual thought, but "Throw Mommy The Train" works effectively in those moments while playing Looney vibe Money. Of course, DeVito has not disappeared from the movies, but it's a mystery not to have really followed the film's promise of realization. Perhaps it is because, as Thrown Momma From The Train's mainstream lack of success shows, his kind of vision does not suit all tastes. It's a shame for those of us who can look at this over and over again and love it.
