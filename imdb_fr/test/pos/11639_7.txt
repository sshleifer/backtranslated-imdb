Although it may not be his most laugh-filled movie, MIGHTY LIKE A MOOSE is one of Charley Chase's most satisfying farce comedies. ) all based on a crazy and wildly improbable premise. We are told at the top that this is "a story of simple people - a woman with a face that would stop a clock - and her husband with a face that would make him start again". Soon we meet Charley Moose and his wife Vivien, who has a huge nose. But it is useless to discuss the plausibility when our plot rests on a series of coincidences so incredibly linked: that is to say that Charley would have corrected his overbite the same day that his wife had her nose fixed, that each spouse would keep their respective cosmetic surgeries are secret to each other, and third, when they cross in public afterwards, Charley and Vivien do not recognize each other. That sounds a bit exaggerated, does not it? Many sections are more like this. It is clear that we are in the world of farce here and that we simply have to deal with the stupid twists of the plot, as long as you can relax and forget the likelihood, you will probably appreciate this short film. <br /> <br /> MIGHTY LIKE A MOOSE quietly begins at the beginning of the various complications of the story, but things start again once Charley and Vivien have "met" and made an appointment to go together to an evening at Charley's dentist. Everyone comes home enthusiastically, enters separately and ignores the presence of the other. (Mr. and Mrs. Moose seem to be quite affluent, by the way, since they live in a mansion the size of a luxury hotel.) Follows a beautifully timed sequence that is a bit reminiscent of Buster Keaton's NAVIGATOR in which house without ever quite meeting face to face. And once at the party, the comedy goes into high gear while Charley is forced to dance with Gale Henry Gale. Henry, a full-fledged actress who has appeared in many short comedies dating back to 1914, is hilarious as a dance partner who brings great strength but little grace to her dance. There is also an elegant cinematic touch during this sequence, when the camera looks to show us only the shoes of the dance partner Charley, Gale, Vivien and Vivien, and that we are able to follow precisely this which happens between the principles by watching their feet. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately for Charley and Vivien, the party they attend is being raided, and from there, the complications multiply when they manage to escape the police and go back home. When Charley realizes that his newly delighted wife was trying to date another man, he decides to take a lesson for everyone. . . forgetting, of course, that he was trying to do the same thing. The last few minutes of this movie offer some of Chase's funniest physical comedies, crowned by a good visual gag for the punchline. MIGHTY LIKE A MOOSE leaves the viewer with a warm glow and is surely one of the most entertaining comedies produced by the underrated prolific Charley Chase.
