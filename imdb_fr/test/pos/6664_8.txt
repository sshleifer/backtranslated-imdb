"War Film" is a Hollywood genre that has been redone and redone many times. Cliché dialogues, redesigned intrigues and extravagant action sequences seem inevitable for any conflict involving large-scale fighting. From time to time, however, a film about the war happens that goes against the grain and gives a truly original and fascinating story to life on the big screen. The movie "Cold Mountain" by Jude Law, Nicole Kidman and Renée Zellweger is a film of this kind. <br /> <br /> It's true that calling Cold Mountain a war movie is not exactly right. The film begins with a fast, dirty (literally) battle sequence that shames the director of "Glory" Edward Zwick. However, "Cold Mountain" does not speak so much of the civil war as of the time and the people. The story centers on Confederate Confederate soldier Inman, portrayed by Jude Law, disgusted with the gruesome and nostalgic war of the beautiful hamlet of Cold Mountain, North Carolina, and the beautiful, beautiful southern woman he left behind. Ada Monroe, At first glance, this configuration seems to be a formula, because the romantic interest aroused in the viewer arouses the public enough sympathy to arouse the tribulations of the reluctant soldier on the battlefield. Indeed, the first segments of the film are relatively unimpressive and even "Cold Mountain" soon takes a radical turn, because the intrepid hero Inman turns out to be a deserter (also saving the audience from the potentially confusing scenario of wanting Confederates ) and begins a long odyssey. Meanwhile, on the farm, Ada's cultivated manners are of little use in the fields; Soon she is transformed into a kind of wilderbeast. Ruby Thewes is Renee Zellweger, who helps Ada rebuild her farm and, perhaps more importantly, deal with the loneliness and isolation that the war seems to have brought to Ada. <br /> <br /> Inside these two environments, a striking, captivating and sometimes very disturbing portrait of the war-torn South unfolds. The characters with whom Inman and Ada interact are surprisingly complex, underscored by Brendan Gleeson's wonderful interpretations as the father of Ruby's bad payer, Ray Winstone as unrepentant "Southern Jurist", and Natalie Portman. as a young mother deeply troubled and isolated. All were greatly affected and modified by "the Northern aggression war", mainly for the worse. The dark and ubiquitous message against war, accentuated by an effective and haunting partition and clichés of striking beauty, Virginia and North Carolina, is communicated to the public less by scenes of battle macabre than by the healed earth and traumatized people for whom the war was fought. Although the weapons and tactics of war have changed significantly in the last century, its infernal effect on the earth is still relevant. <br /> <br /> Director Anthony Minghella manages to maintain this dark atmosphere for most of the film, but the atmosphere is unfortunately denigrated by a rather warm climax that does little justice to the wonderfully trained characters. The love story between Inman and Ada is awkwardly inserted into the beginning and end of the film, although the intrinsically distant, abstract, and even absurd nature of their relationship somehow matches the lamentable nature of the rest of the plot. . <br /> <br /> Do not be fooled, "Cold Mountain" has neither the traits of a welfare novel nor an inspiring war drama. It is a unique vision of an era that will not fail to entertain but also to truly absorb the public into the lives of a war-torn people desperate to rid themselves of its terrible repercussions.
