"Female Convict Scorpion - Beast Stable", the third in the series, is a beautiful piece of pulp. Closer to the tone and subject to a pinker Nikkatsu than the other entries in Scorpion, it is amazingly photographed, made with a vertiginous enthusiasm and populated by a gallery of thugs and degenerates. Shinya Ito, the director of the first opus, returns for this surreal fable that begins with Scorpio (Meiko Kaji) who cuts the arm of a policeman to whom she is handcuffed and who fled to the Tokyo subway, the arm still swayed by wrist. She takes refuge in a red neighborhood where she befriends a prostitute, we see for the first time having incestuous relationships with his brother (which ends up impregnating). Scorpio's desire to protect this unfortunate woman finally reveals her identity and all hell is unleashed. She is beaten, sexually assaulted and locked in a strange birdcage in the villain's den. I loved everything about this hypnotic film, nihilistic and emotionally touching. It is the superior of the first three Scorpion films and presents one scene after another. I can not recommend it strongly enough.
