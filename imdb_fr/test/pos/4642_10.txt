For a movie that was PG, it's a funny movie. I grew up watching this movie again and again. It's really fun, I do not know how today's audience would react, but if you grew up on or loved the 80s, then it's a great movie. Stephen Furst is great like Harold, who I think is one of the best characters in the movie. Paul Ruebens also appears for about 10 minutes. I like nostalgia
