Mr. Bean shaped the face of the British television comedy. He has proven that you do not need perverse words or minds, a huge budget, a lot of intelligence or even intelligence to create something brilliant. And Mr. Bean is one of those characters you can not forget. Some of these episodes choked me - yes, they are not at all realistic and they are all stupid enough, but to be honest, realism is one of the obstacles that Bean has managed to overcome to achieve greatness. Rowan Atkinson and co. You always manage to concoct interesting new ideas - and new hilarious gags - as you remember when Mr. Bean drove his Green Mini while sitting on a sofa on the roof? Mr. Bean is one of those things that never falters - the film was not so good, but Bean has introduced a new sense of humor in the world, and kids and adults alike will marvel at its huge entertainment factor. "Extras" and "Little Britain" can be damned - it's British comedy at its best and most original. These getaways never get old! 10/10
