I just watched this again on BBC Channel 4. This is certainly not Jane Austen's best novel, but the movie is a reasonable rendition. I suspect that the Assembly Halls at Bath would have been a little more crowded than what was shown. maybe they could not afford the extras. Also, why does everyone keep quiet so that the dancing couple can have an audible conversation? I have never heard anything ever told to me when I was dancing and I suspect it would have been the same in the 18th / 19th century in Bath. <br /> <br /> I can not believe in the United States / Canada Reviews; they completely miss the ironic element that is in the movie all along. The "Gothic" scenes are quite cleverly presented but you have to read them correctly. I'm sure Jane A would be slightly amused by these critics. About anything, does anyone else think that Peter Firth looks more like Colin Baker (a former Doctor Who) or vice versa the older they get?
