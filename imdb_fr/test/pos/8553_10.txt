This film ... I saw it 15 years ago and in recent years I could not remember it, neither its name nor anything else. He was simply a Romanian peasant played superbly by Anthony Quinn. The impression I have of this drama will be eternal. Finally, I found the name of the film and I hope to buy it. And honestly, this movie is worth 10 Oscars. Ten times BRAVO. I was young enough when I saw the movie for the first time. I asked my friends if they had heard of this story, but no one would know that Anthony Quinn is playing the role of a Romanian peasant. I remember when a German officer came to see Anthony and told him that he was a good "race", but in reality, the German was cheating on him. For a few dollars, you will not get rich in case you buy the movie, but you will be rich if you have it.
