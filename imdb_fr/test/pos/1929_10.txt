I remember the events of this film, from Donald Crowhurst's unfortunate cruise in 1968, to the single-handed Golden Globe around the world. I was 13 years old and lived in England. The year before, Francis Chichester (later Sir Francis, who had been knighted for his exploits) had completed the first solo round the world. I remember it mainly because we had time to leave his school to watch his return (on a grainy black and white television!), Then his knight by the queen. This caused a huge outpouring of patriotic fervor in the UK. Everything seems so picturesque now. Chichester became a national hero, but stopped half way to Australia to refit his yacht. The next logical step for boaters was to try the journey without stopping. <br /> <br /> It's important to remember that it was a global pre-GPS, when onshore communications were still pretty erratic, not to mention the middle of the ocean. Now, with GPS receivers that fit on a bunch of keys and calculate a position within one meter of Earth, it's hard to remember a time when you could go to sea and literally disappear. As Donald Crowhurst did. <br /> <br /> A number of boaters registered (all at the time), including the mysterious Crowhurst. Crowhurst, which was essentially a weekend, had no spectacular success, including in the British Army, the Air Force and the electronics contractor who sold aids to navigation. . He wanted to do something great in his life and he saw the first prize of £ 5,000 (well over $ 100,000 in current money) and the resulting advertising to start his business. He signed an agreement with a sponsor who proved to be more watertight than his boat and which meant that a failure would bankrupt him. He quickly found himself a popular figure with reporters as he prepared for the race. Now, the British still love the idea of ​​a brave amateur taking the side of the "pros". (Think of Eddie the Eagle losing endless Olympic ski jumping competitions and amateur riders who regularly compete in the Grand National race.) The public lined up to see him leave, but his boat did not. was not really ready. (The last competitor to leave the UK) Crowhurst must have known he had no chance to do so. But too much was on him to quit. <br /> <br /> In the wonderful archive images, doubt is written on the face of his poor wife. Left behind with their 4 children, she is emotionally interviewed throughout the film, with one of Crowhurst's sons. She was in a hopeless situation. If she had tried to stop her, she would have been considered a spoiler, but she was then questioned whether she could have saved her life by interrupting her. Confronted with the certain truth that his boat was fleeing and would never cross the southern oceans, and unable to turn around and face ridicule, bankruptcy and ignominy, Crowhurst devised a plan to deceive. Without radio contact, off the Argentine and Brazilian coasts, he waited for the club's leaders to circle Cape Horn and go up the Atlantic, thinking he could sneak up the line and pretend he had goes around the world. . He meticulously faked his newspapers and made 16mm films and audio recordings to support his plan. But, one after the other, the other competitors gave up, he realized that he would come in 2nd position and that his newspapers would be examined. Unable to deal with a certain detection, his diary suggests he lost his grip on reality and eventually committed suicide. His yacht has been found. He never was. <br /> <br /> This superbly mounted film also follows the course of Bernard Moitessier, experienced and enigmatic French sailor, second and certain of the price of the fastest course, when he left the race abruptly, unable to manage with the clamor and publicity that he knew he would face, and sailed in the wide blue there, ending up arriving about 10 months later in Tahiti. Having myself spent about seven years at sea (although on very different ships from these), I understand very well the attraction of the ocean. Standing on the deck, seeing water in all directions to the horizon, knowing that there are a few kilometers of water below you, nothing between you and oblivion except a thin hull in metal, without easy access to television or radio (even nowadays on most active ships, you feel pretty isolated), it is possible to truly escape the responsibilities of everyday life for a while. There is a serious analysis of what drives people to try this kind of very long and solitary journey and its effects on the human mind. Most people think that trying to raise 4 children is quite adventurous, but there is a lot of talk about the need for self-discovery in the difficulties at sea, the search for oneself. <br /> <br /> I strongly suspect that Robin Knox Johnston, the former Navy pilot who won the race (and many others since) probably knew who he was before leaving, which is why he failed to win. the race but also keep his mental health along the way. Those who went looking for something deep in them may not have fully loved what they found. <br /> <br /> The wonderful archive footage of Britain in the late '60s is almost a reason to look at it (did it really look so bad? remember it was so sullen, but maybe we're wiping out the worst aspects of the past?) but overall, it's an extremely well done and captivating film. Highly recommended.
