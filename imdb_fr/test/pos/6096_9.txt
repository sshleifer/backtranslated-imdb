It must be one of the funniest Danish films ever made. Ulrich Thomsen and Thomas Bo Larsen are hilarious as they drive through Sweden. I do not know how Ulrich Thomsen does it, but he can still manage to play crazy in a very healthy way. BUT if you do not understand Danish (I'm not talking about your pastry here), do not waste your time on it ?? I do not think it would work with subtitles.
