Once again, seeing this kind of film is transforming me more and more into English humor, not often seen on screen since the days of Monty Python and Man About The House. Pity. <br /> <br /> Brenda Blethyn (The first person I saw in Saving Grace earlier this year is another to see, by the way.) Excels as Alfred Molina. The rest of the cast, although virtually unknown to me, also has excellent performance. The film starts slowly and gradually gains in rhythm and amusement - halfway, I had tears in the eyes of laughter. <br /> <br /> All in all, a fun English movie, a thousand times better than the so-called "funny" trash that comes from Hollywood. <br /> <br />
