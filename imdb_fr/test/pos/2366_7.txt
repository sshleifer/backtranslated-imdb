This movie is great! As a fan of "The Comic Strip Presents ...", I knew I would love this movie. And I like it. I was finally able to buy a copy of this movie at the beginning of this year. However, I was annoyed that he had been cut! So, I will continue to watch car boot sales for the original version. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the film is about Dennis Carter (Adrian Edmondson), who tries to impress his girlfriend (Dawn French) pretending to be a drug dealer. However, Dennis is surprised to brag a night at the pub and get stung! So, Dennis turns supergrass but the problem is that he knows nothing and starts to invent lies and to sink into an even deeper hole! The irony of all this is that there is drug trafficking going on in Devon. <br /> <br /> This movie is not as funny as expected, but it's still a great movie with good laughs and a great soundtrack. It's also the best scene in a British film (Robbie Coltrane's walk through Frankie Goes To Hollywood's "Two Tribes" pontoon. <br /> <br /> So, if you're a fan of "The Comic Strip Presents "...", members of the cast, or a fan of British comedy, see it as soon as possible !!!
