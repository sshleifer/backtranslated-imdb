Sharky's Machine is easily one of the best efforts of Burt Reynolds. It's also one of the best contemporary crime dramas. Erotic and violent, the film sets itself apart by setting the scene in Atlanta and delivering a chaotic detective affair to you (the viewer) on a silver platter. Dedicated and determined, Sharky must put an end to the murder of Dominoe, a charming lady of the night whose clientele is anything but ordinary. In a short time, Sharky's crime machine reveals a plot of utmost importance that threatens to corrupt the inner body of Atlanta. As a resident of the Atlanta metropolitan area, I remember the excitement of the city when producing the film. Sharky's Machine goes to great lengths to give a true portrait of Atlanta. Twenty years in prison and more than 2,000,000 people later, the film stands the test of time. Believe me, Atlanta has not changed. One of the highlights of the photo is Dar Robinson's bold waterfall (a classic and symbolic end). It has even been featured in the reality TV series of the period, It's Incredible. It's just too bad that Hollywood does not do enough movies like this one. Relax in your popcorn and watch the action of the sterling silver cinema.
