I come from Texas and my family went on vacation a few years ago to Sante Fe with my brother. He suggested going to see the church with the stairs. I was absolutely amazed by the miracles that took place there. The film is excellent - Barbara Hershey and William Petersen were great for the roles they played. It's incredible, absolutely incredible. If you have not seen the stairs in person, the trip is worth it. The wood is beautiful and the architecture amazing. The mere fact of being in the chapel gives me goosebumps! Read the history of the chapel, then its beauty is breathtaking. See the movie - it's great! Then see the stairs in person!
