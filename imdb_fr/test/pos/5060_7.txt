An American man of Arab origin is kidnapped at an American airport and taken to "somewhere in North Africa" ​​where he is tortured. The reason? His mobile phone has received a call from a known terrorist. The CIA decides to avoid the legal means to determine if the appeal is a guilty implication or just an error. After watching this film, we can only pray that a terrorist does not accidentally hit the wrong number! <br /> <br /> In addition to restitution, there are several parallel stories. One concerns the secret police chief's daughter who tortures the suspect and his involvement with his lover, who happens to be at night school for suicide bombers. This story is far too artificial, but nevertheless intriguing, especially when you see its result. The director uses a switcheroo neat time line to hook the audience. <br /> <br /> The second parallel story is the attempt of the suspect's wife to find out what happened to her missing husband. She asks for the help of an old lover. He (a deafened Saarsgard) is the aide-de-camp of a senator (Alda) and is quickly cold-blooded when he realizes that his work is not worth revealing the truth. Witherspoon is wasted in this role. All she has to do is look desperately and pregnant, with a brief attack of anger. Streep is good and cold and stereotyped as the government. (CIA? NSA? Homeland Sec?) Official who appears to be a clone of Cheney. <br /> <br /> Gylenhall is also lost as a minor analyst pushed into an area where he is above his head, even if he has to do the "right thing" at the end. <br /> <br /> I found the film captivating, although a bit languorous, however thought to add little to the subject. This is certainly not to be considered definitive, and it certainly has a goal to settle. Like "The Kingdom", he scratches the surface of a very complicated subject. <br /> <br /> The film tries to give us an idea of ​​the restitution, but can only be a "telling story" about a sloppy person. a. The purpose of restitution is not to "torture" but to ensure that "terrorism suspects" provide information by avoiding legal (and thus obstructive) barriers. There is no doubt that torture can be used, especially if restitution escapes us - although we are obviously not innocent in this matter - but it is essential to be able to count on the safeguarding process to save lives in this " fictional war ".
