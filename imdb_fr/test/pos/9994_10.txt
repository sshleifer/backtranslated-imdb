I'm not a fan of sports - but I love sports cops! So, why ... what is a great sports cop ... this one. And the narration style is fine. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for two hours of unbelievably fantastic entertainment, "Greatest Game" will qualify you perfectly. Here is a film that moves. Bill Paxton went to the same director school as Ron Howard - Richie Cunningham, "Happy Days". Not bad. Look at the huge body of work Ron has done after he's been behind the camera. <br /> <br /> Bill, like Ron, was a great actor, but he will be a superstar director if "Greatest Ever Game" is the hint to follow. <br /> <br /> A wonderful cinematography - a fantastic direction - a good acting, including Elias Koteas, Shia LeBeouf, Marnie McPhail, Josh Flitter, Stephen Marcus and Justin Ashforth. </ p> a film to see absolutely, neither like "to feel good" nor like "sporting film", it is a very good cinema.
