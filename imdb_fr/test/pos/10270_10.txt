This is a great comedy that highlights what it was like to live alongside the racist bigot. But also shows that the two main characters are as bad as each other. On the basis of the hit comedy ITV, it's very politically incorrect. And that's good, comedy after all. The only drawback of movies is that there is not much intrigue. However, the actors are as great as usual. Jack Smethurst and Rudolph Walker are a team of hell, playing each other, in an unusual spirit. I have not seen this movie for many years, and last week I was able to buy it on DVD. The fact that the film still contains real moments of laughter, means that I can recommend this film, just as I would do in the 1970s.
