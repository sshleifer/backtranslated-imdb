This film really proves that the world is too often an unfair place, especially that of moving pictures. "The Assignment" hardly caught his attention when it came out and did not surprise American billiards, but when the story is written, this film will surely receive long-lost praise. <br /> <br /> Thank God. I am surrounded by friends who know what is good for me. Being a movie buff like me, a friend highly recommended "The Assignment", a movie I had not even heard of. I decided to check what Leonard Maltin had given and, unsurprisingly, he did it ** 1/2. Knowing that he is the same rank, he gave classics such as "Alien", "The Suspect Suspects" and "The Matrix" (I misunderstood you). I knew that its meaning did not really mean ***. So without hesitation I went out and bought it on DVD. It was about 3 years ago and the film is still one of my proudest objects in my DVD collection, despite a jacket that reminds Casper Van Dien of a low-budget puzzle. <br /> <br /> "The Assignment" is an accomplished expert, delivering you very intense moments that will keep you at the edge of your seat throughout the film, on top of that, it presents a sometimes brilliant story that, you know, will be sown with unexpected twists. It stars Aidan Quinn in one of his best performances, and supports him a lot from Donald Sutherland and Ben Kingsley, both of whom are in great shape. <br /> <br /> Something like 40 out of 42 user comments like this movie, most of them do not seem to do enough. So what are you waiting for? If you call yourself an action thriller fan, you should have bought it, rented, seen yesterday!
