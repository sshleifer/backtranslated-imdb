It's good to see that I'm not the only person to remember this great movie. I have great memories of this movie - I seem to remember vaguely about my time, as I watched TV shows for kids after school (Broom Cupboard, do you mind?). It was the first and the last film to scare me - and the images of the boy surrounded by mist on a hill will stay with me forever! Like most movies of this era, the film ends well - it is aimed at children, but it is perfectly capable of capturing the attention of adults. The beautiful landscapes of Cornwall really prepare the film to feel isolated - and the "ghostly" scenes are simple but very effective! I would love to try to find this movie - see if it still hits home!
