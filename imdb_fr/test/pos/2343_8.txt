I must admit that this film and its talented director do not receive the praise they deserve. Hoping that the DVD will succeed very well and will draw the attention of both readers to a wider audience. The actors gave excellent performances and the plot is excellent. Overall, the film may be a little long, but May Miles Thomas seems to appreciate his actors when they give good performance and sometimes takes them closer than necessary. Good for the actors, I'm sure, but sometimes, as an audience, you're ready to move on to talk about the plot. That Miles Thomas deserves more recognition from the film industry as one of our leading directors of digital films,
