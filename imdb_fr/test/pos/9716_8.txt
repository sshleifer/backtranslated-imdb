it would be a shame if we do not have to watch the race in speed, whether doubled or under doubled (I prefer the dubbed version (which is rare) because it was funny ... in a good way ). What's great about Speed ​​Racer is that you're never too old to watch it. go red and yellow !! I saw this for the first time when I was about seven years old and enjoyed hearing this exciting opening. he disappeared for a while and then I saw him a few months ago (I'm 19). imagine the feeling of nostalgia coming up inside, singing "here it comes, the sprinter comes in! He's a demon on wheels ~~~" again and again. Be that as it may, the concept of mach 5 has spawned many "special ultra-multifunctional cars", but none has surpassed its engineering genius. the other cars seemed too much. and it was not just the races or the fight against different bosses that interested me. it was the mysterious character of racer-x and how the world of speed racing "passed" pretty well to revolve around that. they tweaked some manga stories, but everything went well. Although I do not remember if the show actually revealed what racer-x looked like, in the manga, they did it.
