This film is a refreshing change of pace compared to the foolish movies of the Hong Kong triad that I'm tired of. There are no spectacular gunfights. No pursuit by car. And practically minimal action strictly speaking. The public is largely unresolved, although some aspects of Andy Lau's so-called "stratagem" are quite obvious. <br /> <br /> The film was hailed as a break with the genre of violent triad films, and as a "smart" crime movie. To some extent, it is. But, to some extent, the "credibility" test still fails. It's hard to imagine that a member of the triad is stupid enough not to see through Andy Lau's feminine disguise in a second. Chinese movies seem to go all the time. He also seems to have fallen into the trap of "if someone were seriously ill, he will regularly spit a lot of blood". <br /> <br /> The subtle relationship between the two main characters is a refreshing change. <br /> <br /> In the end, it's a nice film, although the concept is not new and there are few surprises. >
