THE ASCENT is a valuable addition to the recent reissues of the Soviet Union. Director Larisa Shepitko's 1977 film examines the moral ramifications of allegiance and honor in occupied Russia by the Germans during the Second World War. On foot and in a snowstorm, two members of a group of Soviet partisans leave to fetch supplies and are captured by Nazi soldiers. The film focuses on how each man manages or internalizes his moral alternatives. One chooses dignity and integrity, while the other opts for collaboration with the enemy. However, in the end, he can not respect his selfish decision. The film uses a lot of slow-paced, wide-angle pans that turn into tight close-ups and highlight the spiritual dilemma that reigns in every man's soul. This is not a great film, but it does depict an intense moral dilemma effectively in the context of a harsh and icy Soviet desert.
