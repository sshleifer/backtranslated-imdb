Indeed, Cynthia Watros is in this movie while Elizabeth is talking to Desmond. Although I'm just wondering how she ended up as a "Rehabilitation Patient" (?) Where Hurley is also trying to reduce her weight (as in previous episodes). <br /> <br /> Anyway, this The last episode is really suspended. The end is not so understandable. I think the writer was expecting the public to announce the upcoming season 3. <br /> <br /> I only hope that the coming season will clear up the less clear / suspended events that have occurred. <br /> <br /> I can not wait for season 3 anymore.
