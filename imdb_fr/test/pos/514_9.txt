Blade is a fantastic action / thriller movie that allows you to be captured for the duration. Wesley Snipes delivers what I would call his best performance so far. <br /> <br /> This film contains everything you would ask in an action. / thriller, he has a lot of blood, guts and gore, a bad purchase twisted, troubled, moments of humor but especially a very good story with lots of twists. <br /> <br /> Their action is constant throughout the film. Film with stunts and stunning effects, the Wesley Snipes fight movement is fantastic. <br /> <br /> This film is in my opinion a must, Wesley Snipes is cool, its solid appearance makes this movie and I can not wait for the next 'BLADE 2' will be released next year. <br /> <br /> IMDB Rating - 9 out of 10
