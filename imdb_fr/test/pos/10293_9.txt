When I watched The Apartment with my girlfriend, she sighed, "How complicated!" And she's right, of course. The apartment is hard to follow when you are used to simple and linear intrigues, especially violent heroes / scammers. Some negative reviews have also missed one or more important points. Another moan about confusing flashbacks. Come on! This is not the kind of film from which you can go to visit the toilet, come back and be hooked again in a few seconds. It requires total concentration and a keen sense of detail. Then it's really not hard to know what's going on and when. The director has left enough clues in all the scenes. <br /> <br /> The first 3/4 of the film is centered on the question: why did Max and Lisa separate? As my friend noticed, the film begins as a romantic love affair, suggesting that two lost lovers find each other. Having experience with French films, I predicted that the story would soon become sick and I was right. At the end of the first part, it is clear, after many twists, that Max and Lisa were manipulated by Alice. Max did not know that Lisa was gone and why. Lisa did not know why Max had not contacted her in Rome and left her without a trace when she returned to Paris. The only one who did it was Alice and she had her own reasons not to talk. <br /> <br /> Once Max and Lisa have discovered the truth, the question that arises is of course: can Alice's manipulations be canceled? Of course not, time has passed and things have changed. <br /> <br /> Many European films use a narration technique that I fully appreciate. There is no exposure of the fundamental conflict at the beginning, after which two (or more) interested parties try to decide to their advantage. Instead, the viewer is gradually fed by fragments of the plot and knows little more than the main characters. The Apartment is a fine and subtle example of this technique. In the first half, Alice seems to be a secondary character; slowly, it becomes clear that she is a key figure. <br /> <br /> Playing is just great. Vincent Cassel is perfect as a naïve and impulsive character who risks a life of safety just to chase a dream of the past. Monica Belucci is very beautiful of course, but also competent. Jean Paul Ecoffey brings the necessary comic touch. Romane Bohringer is very convincing as a neurotic woman, plagued by feelings of guilt and regret. <br /> <br /> The only reason I did not give him a 10 is the somewhat unsatisfactory end. Of course, this was necessary because of the desired symmetry. After all the events, Max is exactly about to start the movie, only wiser and sadder. Alice paid for her sins. However, the little detours at the airport are a little artificial. Max swaps Lisa too easily against Alice; Alice decides too easily to reject Max, which is her dream for so long. Max returns too easily to his fiancée. But again, I do not know how we could do it without sacrificing elegant symmetry. I guess sometimes artists have to give up realism for beauty.
