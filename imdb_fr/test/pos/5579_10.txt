Well, how can I categorize Farscape without resorting to gushing superlatives? OK here we go! The scripts are fantastic, each episode offering so much entertainment, drama, humor and pure observability. The cast is perfect, especially that of Zhaan (the blue lady) played by Virginia Hey, each character has a depth that is simply not at the rendezvous of the Star Trek series. <br /> <br /> I think having an Australian spin the show allows me, Australia has produced quality movies for years and Farscape is no exception. <br /> <br /> I only saw the first four episodes in the British order and they have a quality that makes each 45 minute film (UK) look more like a movie than a weekly TV show . <br /> <br /> The episode that really does it for me is "I, ET", which transforms the extraterrestrial concept in which Moya (a living ship, even the spaceship has a great character) is forced to land on a planet that has not yet established the "first touch" and strangely resembles earth. Crichton meets a radio telescope operator and * he * is the 'little green man' for them. Tricks gripping. <br /> <br /> In short, the effects are excellent, the scripts are top quality and the main characters (none of them are really considered more important) are interesting, not always "good" and good just excellent. <br /> <br /> Roll on the second season!
