It's really a good movie, contrary to what others say. Peline and I have both seen the film 3x and the end is corny, but it's part of the package ... to experience death is like trying to challenge it, so the film is cool. For those wishing to see a classic Kevin Bacon movie, please see this. take care to greet you from Istanbul. we will write 10 lines if you really want us 2 but we think it's a waste of time, goodbye. The rest of this review should not be taken seriously, as we have just written it to meet the 10-line criteria (which is crazy), but we are nice and we will adapt to the rules that have been defined to us. . So people are watching this film not because we wrote 10 lines, but because it's good. and by the way we wrote 12 lines !!
