This is unfortunately a little known film ..... I say "unfortunately" because it is among the "classics" of the American mute screen! <br /> <br /> This is a legend of a "ghost chariot" that travels the world, picking up the souls of those who have died. Legend has it that the last person to die on December 31st is ordered to drive the tank for the next year. <br /> <br /> This is reminiscent of the "Phantom of the Future to Come" sequence of Dicken's famous "Christmas Carol". <br /> <br /> The double exposure effects of ghosts (especially when interacting with "living" ones) are EXCELLENT! <br /> <br /> If you like silent movies, you MUST see it; he will "carry you away"! <br /> <br /> Norm Vogel <br /> <br /> The paradise of Norm's old film http://www.nvogel.com/film/film.html
