Johnny Knoxville and the Jackass boys outdo themselves for "Jackass Number Two". At a press screening, the laugh was so loud and loud that it was difficult to hear the whole dialogue. The stunts are excessive and the pranks are more funny and more scandalous than ever. <br /> <br /> All the guys put their members on the line to make a good movie, and they did it. If you like that, you'll love this movie. Otherwise, do not bother. <br /> <br /> Some of the funniest stuff is the jokes that guys play against themselves, and they have no regard for what happens to them. They will do anything to make a waterfall. <br /> <br /> Many critics have criticized Johnny Knoxville for having played a less active role in the first film, but do not worry, he occupies a prominent place in the number two and they have enough sequences in the box to be halfway to Number Threee. <br /> <br /> This is a must for fans of this type of humor. <br /> <br /> Chris Sansone, Animation Editor, Fort Bend Herald
