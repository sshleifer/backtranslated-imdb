I hate to admit it, but I did not think it was one of Hitchcock's best climate thrillers, but nonetheless captivating. In a remake of the film of the same title published by Hitchock in 1934, Dr. Ben McKenna (James Stewart) ?? the man who knows too much - and his wife Jo McKenna (Doris Day) are on holiday in Morocco with their son Hank (Christopher Oslen) when there is a case of mistaken identity and caught in the web of a plot assassination. The conspirators do everything in their power to prevent them from interfering in their plot: the abduction of their beloved Hank. <br /> <br /> I found it amazing that Doris Day, which I usually associate with Rock Hudson comedies, was launched in a Hitchcock. movie. Looking at it, I soon realized that it was more of a family film than Hitchcock's other works (eg Psycho) and that she had the singing ability to make "What Will Be Will", what she did it beautifully. She was well chosen and James Stewart had chemistry, which made the couple credible. <br /> <br /> Compared to the other works of the great director, I think it's not as good, but it's still extremely excessive. family thriller / entertaining mystery. There is also the extra bonus of Que Sera Sera, which turned out to be a hit for Doris Day. Well directed, well played. A beautiful movie.
