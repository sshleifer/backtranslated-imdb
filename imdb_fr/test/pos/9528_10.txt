I try to watch this film every time it is shown on television, which is fortunately quite common. But I keep forgetting to film it. In the current state of things, I know the scenario by heart, but that does not stop me from having good tears, it's actually something to add because I'm crying, knowing what will follow. It's such a beautiful film - well done, well mounted, good photography. I like that. One of my top ten movies.
