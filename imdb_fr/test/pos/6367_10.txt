I saw The Couch Trip (1988) for the first time on television late at night a few years ago and I immediately fell in love with it. The funny thing is that I catch all the comedies but I've never heard of them before I see them. Dan Ackroyd is a simple and summary period. He did two great movies with Belushi and do not forget Saturday Night Live. But I think Couch Trip is probably his best and funniest. With a good cast of Charles Grodin, David Clennon and Walter Matthau, this piece of film shines with a golden comic. Ackroyd's wife, Donna Dixxon, is doing an excellent job here. My favorite moments of the movie are those of Lawrence Baird, character of Ackroyd and David Clennon. These two played well. So, if you have not seen a good comedy for a long time, come back in 1988 and rent or buy The Couch Trip. I just did it, Amazon 78 cents. Which case, pity I be hit by a shipping fee of 2.50. Oh, well, it's always worth it. All the guys will love this movie.
