Even the trailer of this movie makes me cry, like the first time I saw this movie. Not for people who are easily upset by intense matter! The best performances of Alan Rickman and Madelaine Stowe, without a doubt. This terrible story of a society that has the power to kidnap and torture its citizens for ANY reason, be they anarchists or writers of children's books will frighten you. I saw it when it came out in 1991 and I remember every picture. It still scares me today. It's happening now. <br /> <br /> Apparently, IMDb needs ten lines to meet their movie review criteria. IMDb might want to get a GRIP! Some of us are a little more concise about writing opinions.
