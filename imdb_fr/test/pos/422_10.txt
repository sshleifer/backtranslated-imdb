Ok, so this series takes the path of "it's gone again!" Week after week, David Morse's character is helping his ride to stay in trouble - but what's wrong with that !? David Morse is one of the greatest characters and certainly the coolest. Having it in a series created by David Koepp, a great writer, is a paradise !! <br /> <br /> love for this show by many, I can not see it go to a season series - but you never know? The amount of trash that has done more than that puzzles me - hope that something good can go beyond a first series!
