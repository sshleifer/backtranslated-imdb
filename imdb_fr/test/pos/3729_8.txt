I thought that Besson's film had managed to do without words what few films could do; Capture the real human emotions. The fights, triumphs, failures, hopes, and desires of the main character are all so honestly shown that you wonder whether he is acting or not. The film has a small budget and is obviously done without the glitz and glamor of most Hollywood productions, but this minimalism is what allows this film to transcend the stereotypical labeling Sci-Fi and become a real drama. However, to qualify this film solely as a drama would remove all the richness of the post-apocalyptic plot. It is true that this type of film has already been made, but I think it reflects the joys and sorrows of this type of world better than any other.
