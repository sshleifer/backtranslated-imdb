As a late protector of car drives (1970-1980s), there are many movies I've seen and forgotten. It's one that I could never forget. Despite his style of low-budget film production and exploitation, the movie STORY was very well done. Isolated therapy-asylum, where patients express their fantasies in order to cure their phsycosis, the accidental assassination of the chief doctor at the very moment when the new nurse arrives at the scene, the assistant (supposed) -permanent doctor, the different patients crazy, the revelation that the assistant doctor is actually a patient herself and, finally, the rescue of the young nurse by Sam, a simple mind, who killed all the other members of the house so that she could s' escape safe and sound, created a great HISTORY, which held the film together. I put the emphasis on the word STORY because that's what makes a good movie or a good movie. No matter how much blood, blood, nudity, sexual matter or outrageous behavior you put in a movie, if the movie is not good then the movie is not good. The credits of the movie show clips of all the actors, including the old witch with the final line asking you to go out and never come back, which is a great conclusion for this movie. If it's on video / DVD, watch it and enjoy it.
