Personally, I LOVE this movie in the middle of the Halloween series. After watching this movie with many friends, I discovered that you enjoy it completely or that you find it absolutely unbearable. Personally, I have watched it dozens of times and it never gets old. There is a beautiful story in the film itself, and many different things are finally explained. It's a short movie, barely 90 minutes, but it's definitely a thrill ride. <br /> <br /> The form seems to be quite brutal in this film, but the acting is still there. walks, stems and kills. There are a lot of neat little screenshots with Micheal appearing in the background, which adds even more of a spooky element to the movie.
