I like the Thackeray novel on which this movie is based. And while this modern version of Becky Sharp's story is a B-movie, Loy's casting in her first lead role is quite fascinating. <br /> <br /> Before Loy became MGM's good reigning daughter and comedic roles, she was an actress. VANITY FAIR was Loy's follow-up film in EMMA, in which she portrayed a snobbish and greedy girl who almost destroyed the loyal housekeeper (Marie Dressler). <br /> <br /> Loy's Becky is much more cruel than Miriam Hopkins' version 3 years later at BECKY SHARP. Loy's Becky is really a pre-code movie character with her plunging necklines and amoral ways. This is the type of character that Jean Harlow or Clara Bow could easily have played, but Becky is still supposed to be part of the board game. This is what makes his fallen character so tragic. <br /> <br /> In return for Loy's understanding, Becky is the brilliant Amelia (Barbara Kent) who is not an interesting character. Mary Forbes is as cold as Mrs. Sedley. Most of the other actors in this version are rather jaded: Conway Tearle as Rawdon; Walter Byron as Osborne; Anthony Bushell as Dobbin. Others are almost Dickensian is their quirk: Billy Bevan as Joseph; Lionel Belmore as Crawley; Montagu Love as the Marquis; Lilyan Irene as Polly the maid; Elspeth Dudgeon as a cleaning lady. <br /> <br /> Loy is in the foreground. Although the end is quite shocking, she has several excellent scenes, such as the game at the casino where she tries to steal the win bet of the roulette of another woman. The more Becky de Loy descends morally, the more beautiful she becomes until she is finally "caught". The bottom line is that this is a very strong performance of Loy in a film that must be seen.
