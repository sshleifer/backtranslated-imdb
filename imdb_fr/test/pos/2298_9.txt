After reading more than my share of the reviews for a lot of different movies, I noticed a certain tendency, people judge too hard what is expected to see. I guess if you go into an open-minded movie do not expect something certain, you'll have better feelings about it than if you're trying to watch but you have pre-created standards that you want to achieve . <br /> <br /> Since I try not to be hypocritical. I watched this movie with a very sharp slate and an open mind, and I was very happy. Since it's not a traditional title or an award-winning prize, I did not know what to expect, but in truth, I enjoyed it a lot more than Ninja Scroll. A beautiful animation, a deep story and the always happy ninja hack-n-slashing combine extremely well with one of my personal favorite anime ever made. <br /> <br /> I do not promise you will enjoy it, but just give it a chance and you can have a good surprise. <br /> <br /> - "Before speaking, be sure what you are going to say will be more beautiful than silence" - Chinese proverb
