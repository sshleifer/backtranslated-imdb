I liked this comedy so much. Will Smith does not do anything slow. He is always on top with the best scripts and comedies that make you laugh and participate in the plot. You watch a qualified comedian, who plays well all his roles. We fully believe that he is to whom he plays. I loved him and Tommy Lee Jones in Men in Black. This comedy is at the height of this film. The humor is fast and Will Smith is as sure of himself as in Men in Black. Quick-witted and very skilled in scoring each other every time, but with great taste and finesse. <br /> <br /> Will Smith seems to have mastered his comedy routine well. He was so funny. I loved the part where he had an allergic reaction to something he had eaten and where his face swelled, and he looked more like Cassius Clay after a fight he had made himself. Then, seeing him sipping the bottle of benadryl trying to bring his head back to the right size. I laughed so much. He knows how to make us all laugh.
