If you have seen the Telugu version of Gilli "Okkadu", you will notice that the story is very similar, but Gilli has different songs and takes place in Tamil Nadu and not in Andra Pradesh. Although this is a remake of "Okkadu", you will find that Vijay and Trisha make it a unique film. Vijay and Trisha make a good couple. Some negatives were when the character of Vijays slaps the character of Trishas for him to buy a gift. He never apologizes and she always stays with him at the end. A good action and good songs make this movie a very good movie, I recommend it. <br /> <br /> I give him a 10/10, one of the best I've seen.
