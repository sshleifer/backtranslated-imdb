We remember especially "More" for the excellent soundtrack composed by Pink Floyd - in 1969, they were not yet superstars. In fact, they made an album with movie music, no fan can miss it! <br /> <br /> But it is also the first film of Franco-German director Barbet Schroeder: it's a cult film. When it was released, censorship everywhere cut several scenes of sex and drugs. It is also one of the first films to explicitly deal with the drug issue. <br /> <br /> A German boy goes to Paris and meets an American girl: they fall in love. Together, they seek the sun and exoticism. But it is a price love too high: it introduces him to drugs. <br /> <br /> In the 60s, anti-drug campaigns were not like today, there was little information. On the contrary, in many circles, drug use was a kind of spiritual experience ... So it is quite surprising to see a film of this period describing a nightmare experience of heroin. <br /> <br /> The film is simple, not vulgar at all and shot in a "cinema-truth" style. The actors Mimsy Farmer and Klaus Gr√ºnberg are very convincing. "More" is a document from the late sixties - and a document of the end of the illusions of the hippies.
