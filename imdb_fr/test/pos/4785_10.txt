Steamboat Willy was not the first cartoon to feature Mickey Mouse. "Plane Crazy" is the first movie to feature the American friend. "Plane Crazy" was released on May 15, 1928 in Hollywood, California, in silent movie format. "Steamboat Willy" was released on November 18, 1928 as a SOUND film (it was also released on July 29, 1928 as a silent film). This is how "Steamboat .." is the first Mickey SOUND movie, but NOT the first movie of the little American mouse. While many TV games have used the question: "What was the first appearance of Mickey Mouse?" The real answer is "Crazy Plane" and not "Steamboat Willy". These dates can be set on IMDb under "Release Dates".
