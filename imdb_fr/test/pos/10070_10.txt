Do not listen to what critics have always said about this lovely little movie. Madonna is great in this smart comedy. I worked in a video store for several years and I suggested this film to many customers. Nobody ever brought it back and shouted at me to tell him to praise it. Everyone has always appreciated. It's a great movie for kids too.
