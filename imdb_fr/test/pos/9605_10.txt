Having obtained a copy of the Bostocks Cup, I must admit that it's not as funny as I thought at first! IT IS BETTER TO!!!!! Charlie Williams ... eat your heart. Fix match ???? Never! Sloping land at 45%? Ronnie and Reggie Kay? George Best? The driver who thinks Pontefract is in South Wales (it's Ponty all that and Ponty that) Bonnet luck Bertie Masson (Tim Healey)! (not that he likes gadgets) Sugar Plum Fairy ????? Confused???? Look again. The innovative use of real images with Bostock players has been brilliant and the producer should be proud to give us a MASTERPIECE. Come on, ITV is doing a favor to the viewers and show it again !!!
