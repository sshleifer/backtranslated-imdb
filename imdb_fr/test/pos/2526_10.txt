Pixote is run with barely a hint of sentimentality. And yet, I imagine more than Hector Babenco owes a part of his cinematographic achievements with this neorealist film by Vittorio De Sica, especially Shoeshine (this film, like with Pixote, takes place mainly in a prison for children). And yet, although I might prefer De Sica's film if it's a question of deciding between the two, it's so close, because it's a word game with no intention, like choosing between two children . These are both raw dramatic works, and with Pixote, Babenco has an added advantage and a poignant quality to handle, in that it's not filmed in harsh conditions after the war. That's what happened in Brazil - we would see it with a little more flair and fear in City of God, maybe even in some places - and these children were in the street before and after the shooting of movie. Some are no longer alive, more than 20 years later, and everyone knows it. <br /> <br /> The "star", Fernando Ramos da Silva, pre-adolescent street child, plays the main character, a youth without a father or really any family who will look for him, and placed among dozens of other street children and delinquents in a reeducation center for boys. The conditions could not be much worse and are made even more unbearable since two children are killed one after the other by a cause of custody. There is a riot and an escape, and halfway through the film, we find Pixote with a few other young people, including Lilica, a practical travesty who is not even 18, and they become pickpockets, drug traffickers. drugs, etc. I have to reiterate that none of this is shown with any fervor - we would not see in a million years see Ron Howard or Paul Haggis lead this kind of photo - and yet there is an emotional honesty for everything because nothing is trivialized. <br /> <br /> Almost all scenes show how fragile Pixote's life is, and how he could be killed or die at any time, and therefore without reaching puberty, but he must be at Those around him are a little older (though not at all) and become things that will haunt this person forever. Despite Babenco's use of a sad and sad musical score and one or two scenes with people crying a lot, nothing seems forced. As with De Sica, perhaps more, given the constant conditions of the street children of San Paolo and Rio, he is a natural director of children, and his father-in-law is inspired by Ramos da Silva and Jorge Juli√£o and others. "kinematic" drama (which is not so real that it becomes a documentary, which is not a bad thing in itself) and even subtlety in certain scenes. <br /> <br /> Pixote may not be as well known as 21st century Brazilian films that reflect on the horrors of Rio, even neorealist films, but that should be the case. Anyone who wants to get a good overview of the situation has to look for it in a library or other and soak up the best foreign film of 1981.
