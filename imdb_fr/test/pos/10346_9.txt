A touching film about a talented woman struggling with a society and a love that underestimates her structurally. The questions are treated in a subtle and timeless way, because many of the difficulties described between man and woman still exist in Dutch society. This film is a tribute to all modern women without insisting on feminism. Not only is the story well told, but the acting and the decor are also excellent.
