If the legendary leader of the Monte Hellman road movie "Two-Lane Blacktop" from the early 70's had been made rather like a piece of dark mood, stripped, fiercely tense and simple, adorned with that distinctly naughty and rough sense A raw and jagged Australian macho mentality crowned with a generous sprinkling of dubious, desperate, hopeless, end-of-course punk nihilism, it would certainly look a lot like this discordant and atmospheric knockout. <br /> <br /> A nice guy, Mike (a Terry Serio, very disconcerted) blames Fox, the champion of fascist car racing, sneering and tinged with nuances, Fox (a Richard quite hateful) Deborah Conway) away from him. Mike and Fox begin to participate in increasingly deadly races in which the stakes become more and more important with each successive fight, eventually leading to a particularly thrilling all-or-nothing race with only one real winner. Mike, assisted by Tony, his worried but loyal Italian mechanic (a beautifully sleek ride from Vangelis Mourikis) and led by a blind and extremely hip 50s-style revolt (wonderfully tried with maximum coldness by Max Cullen), willingly puts his life on the line for his reputation, his old lady's affection, the money and, more importantly, for the chance to overthrow the haughty Fox from his cast look. Directed with extreme gravity and intensity by John Clark, written with perfect perfection by Barry Tomblim, with a choppy and fleshy synthesizer score, by Peter Crosbie, and a thick, unadorned cinematography by David Gribble, presents the concept film of racing cars not only as an awesome alternative lifestyle, but also as an obsession and a reason to live (that's the only thing most of the film's characters are passionate about) with a remarkably astute and impassive eye. With a discouraging end and an unequivocal central message about the bitter price one pays to be the best dog, this fascinating description of a dead-end existence is considered an extraordinary cinematographic achievement.
