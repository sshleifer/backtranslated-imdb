Looking at this on Comcast On-Demand. <br /> <br /> Every time I see this musical, I am amazed by the songs ... one show after another. <br /> <br /> This interpretation is, for me, magical. The songs shine ... the songs, the orchestrations and the choreographies are extraordinary for a movie "made for television" ... better than many scenic versions that I saw. <br /> <br /> The debate over Bette just does not make sense. She is mother. Her voice is brilliant and yet full of the pathos of the stage mother living through her daughters. I still get tears in the end when she finally has her moment of glory, no matter how much this fame is faded. <br /> <br /> The Tulsa / Louise duo / dance is on. Fabulous. <br /> <br /> Stephen Sondheim is the king of musical theater. His lyrics are like silk ... Styne's music is perhaps the best ever written for stage / screen. <br /> <br /> God be praised, we captured this masterpiece from the American Musical Theater on DVD.
