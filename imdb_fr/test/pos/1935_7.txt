This is one of Barbara Stanwyck's first films and her theme is unconventional. She makes money dancing with men in a disco. She does not really like work, but it's a job. Her boyfriend seems to be a very nice guy, but she is also pursued by the wealthy Ricardo Cortez. Well, after her wedding, it turns out that her "nice boy" is a robber and seductive weasel and the rich Cortez turned out to be a good man. At the end of the film, Barbara was just fed up, no SANE woman would want to leave this horrible marriage. <br /> <br /> In the 1920s and early 30s, Hollywood was doing just about everything it wanted and some of their movies had themes or scenes that would surprise many today, such as nudity, adultery and foul language. Although TEN CENTS A DANCE is not a flagrant example of this morality, it has a theme that would never have been allowed after the creation and implementation of the 1934 enhanced production code. In a way, the code was great - after all, parents did not have to worry about what their kids saw in movies (like nudity in BEN HUR, 1925). However, he also tended to clean up too much of some movies - and it is impossible that this film was made and approved, as it tends to glorify the divorce - a serious no-no 1934 and thereafter. It's a shame, because I do not think DEN CENTS A DANCE had a hard time discussing it - especially since the star (Barbara Stanwyck) was married to a devious thief. Despite this, letting the film end in divorce and marrying a divorced man twice could not be. <br /> <br /> Overall, the film is interesting and inspiring. In addition, it was well paced and suitable for a relatively short execution time. Take a look at this one. <br /> <br /> FYI - Unfortunately, Ricardo Cortez was NOT Hispanic, but he changed his name because of possible prejudices because he was Jewish. He was an excellent leader of his time, but today he is almost forgotten.
