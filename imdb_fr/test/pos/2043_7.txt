I was happy to know that at least now this movie is getting the appreciation it deserves (just watch these votes). Not a leading action like "Die Hard" or "Lethal Weapon", but still something that looks like a solid 7 out of 10: good scenario, good actors with active chemistry and a director who knows what he wants (Unfortunately, this was the director Harlin's last good movie. "Deep Blue Sea" managed to achieve the OK status of "rollercoaster-ride", but "Cutthroat Island, and especially" Driven "are well-deserved flops!) Personally, I think the turning point The box office might have been the theme of the "woman of action." Well, give him a chance, because Davis delivers an unparalleled performance. movie does not focus so much on the "feminine" "-this side, but instead, buddyism (Jackson, as a teammate, has a lot of room here, plus his share of action - and about a thousand of murderous wisecracks!) and on the plot (of Shane Black, the writer of "Lethal Weapon" and "The Last Boy Scout". The film is on many levels and looks a lot like this one ... the theme, the clever plot, as well and also underestimated!) Overall: if you have not seen it yet, do not forget to rent it for the next Saturday night!
