This film was bombarded at the box office and during the vote, but I loved it. A measure of the value of a movie is how much you can still remember after 25 years. I will not bother you with a list but there are dozens of deeply comic scenes, also a good story and a good cast. Inane thieves are funny. See it and judge if it happens one day at the MTC.
