Maybe I'm biased because the F-16 is my favorite fighter plane - although the F-14 is probably second or third - but I liked that movie. The suites (Iron Eagle II and III) are not up to the acting and scenario, but the first - with Top Gun - offers excellent flight and music, as well as intrigue and reasonable roles. The II and III clearly have much less "flight budget", but their main disadvantage is intrigue and action. I suspect Iron Eagle's reputation and relative popularity over Top Gun is almost entirely a reflection of Jason Gedrick's fame and popularity over Tom Cruise. Another benefit (for me) is a brief appearance by Shawnee Smith. 7/10
