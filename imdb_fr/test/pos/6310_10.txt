Well, where do I start ... <br /> <br /> As one of the other commentators has said, you'll be thrilled with the real pleasure of seeing the foreground: minutes and minutes of a guy standing up on a treadmill. <br /> <br /> I will not repeat the excellent summary of Rubin's story. What I would like to say, however, is that this film has captured me more than any other film I can remember. I gaped and all the way to the edge of my seat. The work of the camera, the soundtrack and the fantastic performances * (especially that of Tony Servillo) draw you to the screen and do not allow you to look away. but it's not just a cool style exercise. It's a film about luck, loss and love. <br /> <br /> Go see him.
