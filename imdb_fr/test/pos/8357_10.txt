Hilarious movie, I had a good time watching it. The star (Cuneyt Arkin, sometimes nicknamed Steve Arkin) is a popular actor from Turkey. He has starred in many roles of tough guy, epic epic movies and novels. It was fun to see him with an international cast and a pair of ugly gloves. If I remember correctly, it was also dubbed in English, which made things even more fun. (a bit like seeing John Wayne speak Turkish).
