Scratch is a documentary about DJs and their art of scratching. From this line of description of the film, you would have no idea how much this little film is entertaining and educational. It is a joyous and vibrant celebration of a fresh and little-known sub-culture. It contains some excellent underground hip hop music and you can see some of the best DJs (for example, DJ Q-Bert, DJ Shadow and Mix Master Mike of the Beastie Boys) exhibiting their tracks. By entering the film, I was not sure that "scratching" could really be described as an art or that platinum could be considered an instrument in its own right. Scratch has completely changed his mind on these points. What these guys do with their decks is really amazing - it's really a kind of art - and platinum, if you know how to use it, can be turned into an instrument that you can "play" as much as drum or guitar. And you even have a Q-Bert DJ lesson on the basics of scratching (for example, how to use the fader to get different sound effects). All these DJs in their own way were inspired by the art of scratching after watching Herbie Hancock perform her song "Rock It" (you remember that song, do not you?) Live at the Grammys. What caught their attention was not Hancock himself, but his DJ and scratch. Not only does Scratch talk about scratching, but he "scratches" himself with the creative way in which this documentary is shot and edited. There are times when the clips are quickly "rewound" then "transferred" several times, which reflects (in the movie's support) what happens when a DJ quickly moves the disc to its deck while using its fader (wicka-wicka "sound) Whether you're a fan of hip hop or not, you can count on Scratch to offer you a very enjoyable evening at the cinema.After seeing it, I wanted to buy a hub and I mean that as a compliment.
