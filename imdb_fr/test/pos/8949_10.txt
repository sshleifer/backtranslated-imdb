This film is one of the funniest I've seen in years. A movie about death and funerals without being depressing or irreverent. Christopher Walken provides much of the comedy of this charming love story and I could barely breathe because I laughed so hard. <br /> <br /> I saw the film in preview and, once finished, the public not only applauded,. I tell all my friends to watch his arrival in the United States. I intend to see him again at the theater and buy it on DVD as soon as it is available.
