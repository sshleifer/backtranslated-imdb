Although it is hardly comparable to other science-fiction movie giants like 2001: a space odyssey or close encounters of the third type, LIFEFORCE works as a totally berserk element and a strange mix of elements science fiction and horror. Despite dialogues that are close to ridicule and actions that act in the same way, it manages to work through a few very different elements. Freely inspired by Colin Wilson's 1976 novel "The Space Vampires", this film by director Tobe Hooper (POLTERGEIST, THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE) focuses on a joint US-UK mission on the British space shuttle Churchill to study Halley's comet. Led by an American commander (Steve Railsback), they discover an extraterrestrial spaceship in the comet of the comet. And when they investigate inside the probe, they find extraterrestrial occupants who look like giant bats. Later, the Churchill will reach Earth's orbit, but no response will be given following radio calls from the base of the mission, the Space Research Center in London. Columbia is launched with Churchill, but the entire ship is ravaged by fire, with the exception of the aliens wrapped in glass, which, far from being spared by fire, look absolutely perfect. The extraterrestrials are brought back to Earth ... and this is where the incredible happens. <br /> <br /> These space vampires are escaping from the space research center and, instead of draining their blood victims through bites wounds, suck them 'Lifeforce totally out of them. One of them is the Space Girl, a completely naked vampire played by Mathilda May. Railsback, the only true survivor of Churchill, is bought by CBC chief (Frank Finlay) and a British special agent (Peter Firth) to follow May, who is in telepathic contact with him. Soon, however, the vampires turned London into a scene of pure holocaust; people are either drying out or turning into zombies, and the threat of NATO sterilizing the city with thermonuclear radiation is great. Railsback finally catches May and sacrifices himself by impaling him with a big metal sword. <br /> <br /> Without a doubt dislocated, undeniably unequal, but nevertheless to watch, LIFEFORCE, despite the frequent inconsistencies of its scenario and its game, enjoys excellent special effects of exception of John Dykstra (STAR WARS), among the best ever seen. The other piece of work, surprising, is the incredible orchestral score of Henry Mancini, almost Wagnerian in the same way as the score of John Williams for STAR WARS - and Mancini, like Williams before him, uses the London Symphony Orchestra. , to start! <br /> <br /> Widely forgotten nowadays, and after a critical disaster in 1985, LIFEFORCE should still interest anyone with a taste for the strange. There has never been such a film, and there will certainly be nothing like it.
