I love Ln Chaney's "Phantom" version and I appreciate the Webber version, if only for the growing interest in this book, but I'd rather find a mysterious horror of romantic aspects. I do not agree with the fact that Andrew Lloyd Webber made the relationship between Raoul and Christine less sober. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, this is a comedy short film with Erik and Christine only, this version should not even bother with other characters. <br /> <br /> I thought I would always wait for another version to match Lon's performance. I was completely wrong. Leslie Nielson is fabulous like Erik, of course, it's a travesty. It's always brilliant. <br /> <br /> I particularly appreciated the fact that Erik looks more like a corpse than a victim of an accident. I still have to see a ghost like this, other than Lon's. <br /> <br /> However, I do not recommend this short film if you do not like imitations. Because this is by no means meant to be taken seriously.
