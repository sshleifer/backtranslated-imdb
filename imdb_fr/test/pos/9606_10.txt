I saw it in '99 and I remember having loved it. Still to this day, I remember some parts of the movie in my head, such as the sloping height. Unfortunately, from the age of 99, I could not remember the name of this film before going through the filmography of a friend of my uncles and finding it (he was playing Clive Kennard). Right after reading the description, I knew what it was. After catching up, I was shocked to learn that not only was it not distributed on video or DVD, but that it still needed to be repeated. It's a huge shame, I beg you, ITV, repeat at least this great TV movie. Nick Hancock showed in this film that he could do more than just animate a show with his character Mike Tonker. It's a movie that most football fans would like, and even those who do not like the sport will appreciate the comic value. Yes, it's a short review, but there is not much to say except it's an underrated movie, which deserves to be repeated or published in video / DVD, so ITV, myself and other fans of this film beg you. PLEASE CONSIDER ONE OF THESE!
