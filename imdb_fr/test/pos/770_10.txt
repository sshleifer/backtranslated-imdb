After watching the Harry Potter films, I was a fan of Rupert Grint trio actors Daniel Radcliffe and Emma Watson; Still, we were waiting to see if they would do any other projects besides playing the same characters every year or every two years with J.K. Rowling Series. The articles on cameras and magazines focus mainly on Daniel and Emma, ​​as they are the main man and the only main woman in the saga to leave Rupert deadlocked. Anyway, each actor has time to shine and Rupert's light hits him once in this film. <br /> <br /> "Driving Lessons" is Harold and Maude of this generation, Rupert Grint playing the role of Ben Marshall, a young British boy who lives with his domineering mother (Laura Linney) and the dolphin of a vicar father (priest) for whom he is looking for a job in summer but can not find work while passing his driving tests (and fails) and writes poetry for a girl who has no interest in him. <br /> <br /> Ben looks for an advertisement in a church newspaper for which the job requires taking care of an elderly lady. He takes the job and realizes that he has a crush on surprises as Evie (Rupert's mother, Julie Walters) in the Harry Potter series, an unemployed actress who is also a poet who gives Ben the run for his money. They bond with each other and tell each other secrets, Evie behaving like a child and making a mistake when she takes Ben on a trip to the country. From home, Ben is not only driven from England to Scotland, as Evie has to recite in a local library, but an older woman falls in love with the young man in which Ben begins to become a man. <br /> There is a misfortune and at the same time, rejoice with Ben and Evie saying that I was very happy with the film when it came out in theaters and that I was impressed by the Rupert Grint game, especially if he showed the rest of the film that even if he brings a little Ron Weasley in Ben Marshall, nothing stops the actor on his brilliant performance.
