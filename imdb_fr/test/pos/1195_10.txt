HAIR, Milos Forman's original film, was the perfect film that actually revealed the evolution of life at that time, not only in the United States, but especially in this country. One of the plots of the film was to be used in other upcoming movies after Hair, for example in American Graffitti, etc. It was an original story with a touch of generational sadness. The characters in the movie were like solitary "cells" in a "body" changing. Overall, it's a very good movie, maybe a little underrated. Annie Golden's role was minor but she played very well. This is the film that virtually launched John Savage as an actor. One of the Chicago members did a good job, although it was a minor role.
