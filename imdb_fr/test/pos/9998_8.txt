I was extremely impressed by this movie. It's one of the best sports movies I've ever seen. The visuals of this film are exceptional. I like the sequences in which the camera follows the balloon when flying in the air or in the cup. The film goes well, offering both excitement and drama. Cinematography was fantastic. <br /> <br /> Actor performances are excellent. The young Shia LaBeouf surprised me. He is doing well in this role. Stephen Dillane is as good as Harry Vardon. Peter Firth, Justin Ashforth and Elias Koteas provide effective support. The film is captivating and entertaining and, for the first time in my life, made me want to watch a golf tournament.
