IN THE LINE OF FIRE is, in my opinion, an excellent action / drama / thriller! I thought agents Horrigan (Clint Eastwood) and Raines (Rene Russo) looked great in the outfit they had at the presidential dinner. As for Leary (John Malkovich), he was a sick man who liked to play with Frank by phone. He looked good in the tuxedo he wore towards the end of the film, though. One of the things that surprised me was the growing attraction between Agent Horrigan and Constable Raines. Before closing, I would like to say that the entire cast and crew did a great job, I loved the set and I could not get enough of it. In conclusion, for all fans of Clint Eastwood who have not seen this excellent action / suspense / suspense movie, I highly recommend it.
