The Muppet movie is an instant classic. I remember the opening scene with a bird's eye view of the swamp and Kermit beginning (in my opinion) the most beloved song in the history of songs. At this point, my mother was still singing with Kermit. <br /> <br /> Watching this title as a young adult makes me smile. I can always sing as I please. As in many Muppet movies, there are adult jokes that are (in my opinion) still as funny today. My favorite line of all time is actually this movie, it's the last line spoken by my green hero, Kermit eyes glued to the glasses, "Life is like a movie, write your own end". That's what I intend to do! Thanks Jim Henson.
