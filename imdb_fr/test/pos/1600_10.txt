<br /> <br /> Watch out for the Philistines, especially the Americans! This includes all the elements you will hate: a languorous approach to cinematographic language, a sense of pictorial composition, intense homoerotic concentration on its elegant narrative, a wonderful and unusual use of music and, even worse, it is based on a history. I would probably hate it too ... If, however, you believe that movies should not have a derivative plot, be full of action and crappy dialogues, you do not need the visual grammar of MTV / TV commercials, so look at this. . This is one of my favorite movies and is perhaps the most perfectly realized work of Visconti. It's sublime, just like Mahler's movement he uses emphatically throughout the film.
