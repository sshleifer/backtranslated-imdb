Good movie, all the elements of a good film were present: history, actors, scenario and realization. I stayed on the edge of my seat all the time. <br /> <br /> There is no doubt it is a low budget movie, but I liked more than many big budget movies. <br /> <br /> Andres Bagg plays Martin Sanders, who deals with his unfaithful wife. Then a voice in the phone and then just scared. <br /> <br /> Virginia Lustig is beautiful and brings a powerful performance. She is an excellent part of the movie. <br /> <br /> The increasing ambiguity towards the end pleased me, even though we know that the main character can be involved, we continued to see everything from his point of view and ask: Who is the killer?
