The first film directed by Christopher Nolan, a year before doing "Memento", is almost as brilliant as this classic. He uses time differences in the same way to tell his story, and is very intelligent. <br /> <br /> Bill is this young writer who starts following strangers to see where they live and what they live. everything on. One day, he follows this man, Cobb, who reverses the roles and confronts Bill, who collapses and confesses what he prepares. <br /> <br /> Cobb is a burglar and he takes Bill in a few jobs to teach him the ropes. Both men are voyeurs in a way and a link begins to be created between them. <br /> <br /> But Cobb feeds this relationship with a hidden motive, and all of this is very well integrated in the end. No, I will not spoil it, but it's a very cool film and I'm starting to think that Christopher Nolan is a genius. <br /> <br /> If you like suspense movies with surprise ending, this one is a must. see.
