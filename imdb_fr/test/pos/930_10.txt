Valentine, a model in France, is separated from her lover who is abroad, they plan to meet in England, but seem to move away more and more as the film advances. One night, after refusing a pass made by her colleague, she hits a dog named Rita. The dog survives and returns it to its owner, a hostile retired judge who lives as a hermit and an indiscreet spy and listens to the conversations of all his neighbors. She is intrigued by the nature of this man and visits him often, often becoming part of his spy games. A conversation that both people are listening to is of extreme importance, the conversation between a young man who will soon be a judge and his wife, whom we find parallel to the life of the man who spies on them. As we learn more about the couple, the man reveals more about his story, then continues his story and we check if the two men will continue to live in the same direction. Valentine does not know how his life, this meeting and the destiny of the young judge will be entangled. That day, hitting the dog seemed to be a destiny, a divine sacrifice of the dog for its owner, allowing Valentine to be the savior of the young judge, who follows the same path as his dear friend, to prevent him from to have such a dark future, filled with loneliness and loneliness. It would seem that the old man's dream becomes a reality after all, and he can sleep with a smile on his face for the rest of his life. <br /> <br /> An incredible finale for the best trilogy of all time! Kieslowski never ceases to amaze me. He is one of my favorite directors and one of the most talented directors in film history. His use of the colors of the French flag in the three films was nothing incredible, every shot, every scene was like a work of art. Three of the most attractive movies I have ever seen. And his subtle links between the three films are impressive. Usually signified by a subtle pause or a late focus in a scene, see if you can spot it. I must mention this and it's a huge SPOILER, I loved the end, as all the characters from the three movies were the survivors of the ferry disaster, with Valentine and the young judge together, and the old man watching her TV , consolidating his happiness in the face of the sufferings he has endured for so many years. I could not think of a better way to end the movie, but a smile on my face, a great way to wrap up an incredible movie and trilogy! I recommend it to EVERYONE who loves movies, movies, anything ... A work of art! 10 out of 10 for the movie and the trilogy.
