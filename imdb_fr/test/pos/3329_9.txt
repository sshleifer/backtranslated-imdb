Tex Avery's tenure as director of cartoons for MGM dates back to the 1940s and 1950s was one of the brightest moments in cartoon history. His drawings were exceptionally inventive and surreal with many strange touches that were later celebrated in THE MASK. Googly eyes when a boy sees a girl, the impossible stunts and the non-stop action were the hallmarks of these films. <br /> <br /> This is one of the many Droopy cartoons that Avery was one of the best. Droopy is a member of the RCMP and he is determined to look for his man ... but in this case he is a wolf who escaped from prison. Throughout the movie, despite many crazy stunts, Droopy continues to follow this rogue until the wolf finally gives up, because Droopy is apparently everywhere! Full of funny and laughing gags, it's a great cartoon.
