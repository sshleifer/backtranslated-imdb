Being a big fan of horror, especially Asian horror, I've seen tons of movies, but this one is exceptional. Why? He has a plot (which is unfortunately quite rare among horror movies). The actors did a good job. It looks like a real documentary film (even if it's not the case). It does not get boring for a moment. The director intelligently combines the plot with the acts of a certain Japanese magical cult (perhaps this cult never existed, but nevertheless, it is credible). It reminded me of the movie of the same quality, "Forbidden Siren". <br /> <br /> For me, the one and only trouble of the film was the character Hori, the psychic, but it's subjective. <br /> <I recommend this movie to all quality horror fans. <br /> <br /> 9 out of 10.
