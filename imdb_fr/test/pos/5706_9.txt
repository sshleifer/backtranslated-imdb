Last night when I connected to my local PBS station to watch "The War That Made America". I was expecting a dull documentary, but instead, I had a very good and credible reenactment of the main events of the time. I now see the reasons for the American Revolution and the role played by the Indian wars. Larry Nehring is George Washington, and he's perfect for this part. The story on camera, also works fantastic. I can not wait to see more next week. It's good to see PBS actually use the HD format to bring the 1700 into our living room. <br /> <br /> I hope Larry Nehring will be seen more in the future because he is such a talented actor.
