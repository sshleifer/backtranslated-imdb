I just saw it as the closing film of the Austin Film Festival. Upon entering, they had seen some excerpts from their number at Alamo Drafthouse and found the trailer entertaining, but I did not expect such an epic musical theme and the use of tarot cards is great in the title sequence. Watch for the cameos of Ben Stiller and Tim Robbins, as well as the dark lord himself (who has a fetish for KG). So much fun and the songs are so catchy. The car chase was by far my favorite scene. I know that it will immediately win cult status and conquer new Tenacious D fans just like me. I hope it's going well in the theaters. "Follow me, we are the shadows"
