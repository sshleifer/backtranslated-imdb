We saw La Spettatrice last night at the Chicago International Film Festival and we were immensely moved. It is a haunting narrative of loneliness and a failed connection in which the desire for intimacy contradicts our fear of revealing our identity to others too much. The three leaders (Barbora Bobulova as Valeria, Brigitte Catillon as Flavia, Andrea Renzi as Massimo) are all excellent and the dynamics that separates them is very surprising. <br /> <br /> After all the films that devalue older women, it is wonderful to see Flavia (who is a law professor at a university in Rome) as beautiful and sensual as she is seductive and powerful. We are conditioned to believe that when a young woman enters the mix, the older woman will become jealous of the youngest woman, the man will leave the oldest woman for the youngest woman, and so on. the emotional truth is considerably more complex. Highly recommended.
