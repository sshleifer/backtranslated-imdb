I loved the superb lighting and was warmed by this history of American working society and the port life of the first half of the twentieth century. I was attracted by the timeless visibility of this realistic performance. see and feel the power of the star. melancholy "Greek" comedy. Is someone in the mood for a drink with a beer back? ... or a little ginger? Hey, waterboy !!
