Den Brysomme Mannen is one of the best movies of all time and speaks of a man trapped in a world where there is no meaning, no feelings, no love, no truth and certainly no freedom. A world where people are afraid when someone speaks, expresses or shows affection, a world where no one is free and no one has any idea of ​​the meaning of that. Just like the world we live in, the world of Den Brysomme Mannen is a world of lost souls trying to flourish, but focusing on the opposite of what fills them: materialism, social acceptance and mediocre satisfactions. <br /> <br /> Den Brysomme Mannen deserves all the attention of every human soul, because we could all use a new wake-up call.
