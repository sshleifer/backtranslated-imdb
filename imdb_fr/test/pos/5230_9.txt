Best photograph I have ever seen ?? Considering the production year of the film, I was absolutely amazed and impressed by the amount of attention paid to the scenes and by what seems to be authenticity. Although I am not particularly a Western moviegoer, every detail gets the slightest detail and haunts it. There is a sincere connection with nature. Sometimes I'm overwhelmed by the amount of action happening in the scenes, but I'm never bored. I have the impression of really looking in a machine to go back in time and look in the old west. I recommend this film to anyone who studies scenography, geographic planning and even photography in general. It can be a humiliating film to experiment with visual elements considering this era of digital retouching that we are experiencing now.
