In fact, I went to see this movie with low expectations because it was the only one that fits my schedule. And surprisingly I found it really original. I have already commented on other Colombian films, and I agree that Colombian films tend to have a similar pattern and always try to refer to the vulgar medium, mostly trying to make jokes out of continual curses. But let's face it, the language used in this film is not particularly exaggerated. Unfortunately, this is how real people talk. The scenario and the pace are brilliant and could be extrapolated to any country in the world. The acting was fantastic and the scenario is for me one of the best ever produced on Colombian soil. I think that anyone in the world can get a good hour and a half of entertainment with a bluffing comedy of beautifully directed black humor. It kind of reminded me of films like ripped off and others like that. I highly recommend it and I hope it can be seen by more people, as Colombian films seem to have begun to focus more on the international scene since last year.
