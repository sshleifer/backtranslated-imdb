I saw this film when it was released in British cinemas about 50 years ago. and the memory remains of a great musical score and the tragedy of the script. I saw it recently on video. The soundtrack was mediocre and the image gritty; but it's one of two films I saw the next day, the other being Gladiator. The theme of music is intensely tragic and we know from the outset that it announces failure or death. Certainly one of the best performances of George Sanders; as a black market laborer to get a refund for what he lost during the war, but Nemesis is waiting; Patricia Roc plays a refugee from Eastern Europe eaten in despair. He is attracted to her, wants to help her selflessly, then falls in love with her, but she is too proud and hurt to accept help. Their love destroys him and inevitably the girl and the doctor (Herbert Marshall), who brought the nemesis. The screenplay is composed of interwoven complex destinies, where the secondary characters are not what they seem to be. It's like a movie, which named the critics and fought at the box office; but for the teenager who saw it, and the retired gentleman who saw it again, it's one of the greatest movies (given its age) whose story is more like an opera.
