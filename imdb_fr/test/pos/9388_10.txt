I watch a lot of movies. A lot of films. Getting a graduate degree in cinema requires watching 2-3 movies a day for years. Everything becomes very exhausting. Mainly because I feel that I have seen everything. It's so rare that I'm surprised by something. I especially hope to see something as good as I expect. <br /> <br /> The death bed is so different from anything I've ever experienced that I had to stop DVD in order to unleash its genius. <br /> <br /> The rhythm of the play is psychotic. It is structured in such a way as to force the viewer to stay out of the frame. It's not like Halloween with all the quick editing and POV shots; The death bed seems to be a kind of dream. The most pretentious way I can say: Samuel Beckett makes a haunted house movie. I mean it's a depressive manic bed that's eating people! And fried chicken! In the middle of nowhere! And there are hands in bone! I can hardly express my feelings about this film. And yes, not liking it will open you ridicule. But things become really the same after a while. It's hard to be a movie buff and stay constantly engaged. Honestly, I can say that this film is one of a kind. From what it is to the way it is set up. We need films like that, films that take us out of our complacency. Think of it as an existential camp. it's funny and stupid, but also brilliant in its strange little way. The worst evil horror of all time? Maybe, but at least he's not a guy with a mask.
