It's a wonderful family sitcom. Rowan Atkinson has appeared in other great sitcoms, The Thin Blue Line (Better Than That) and Blackadder (Not Better Than That). <br /> <br /> Mr. Bean is a human disaster that does not speak. He goes to places and gets into absolute chaos, which includes climbing to the highest diving board and being too scared to jump, taking about 20 minutes, until children reject him, ending up in a machine. washing and driving his car sitting on a roof. Bean drives a Mini and wears a stuffed toy. <br /> <br /> It looked a lot like The Baldy Man, a series featuring Gregor Fisher who says very little, but trains in heckling. Best episode: Do it yourself, Mr. Bean, Episode 9: Bean organizes an evening for New Year's Eve, then gets items for the decoration of his apartment, but has too many objects and must drive his car on the roof.
