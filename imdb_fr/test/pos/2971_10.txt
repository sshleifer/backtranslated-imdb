When I first heard about this film, I noticed it was one of the most controversial films of the 1970s. I noticed that the music was from Elton John, so I said I had nothing to lose, so I got it. What a surprise!!! The movie was great. It was true love is everything. The characters (Paul and Michelle) did not have luxury, no money and sometimes no food, but they were always happy. I recommended this film to all my friends, but they all criticized my tastes and even called me names, because the film featured two minors naked. I think that only made the film more realistic. The cinematography was excellent and it only comes to show the great abilities of the director Lewis Gilbert
