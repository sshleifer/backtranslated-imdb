Movie about government failure and adult egoism. The overwhelming impossibility of managing life and the means by which children go to try to make a living. Only live. Stay alive in a cruel world. A nightmare world, we are afraid to watch it because we see the truth and are afraid to see it. See a world of despair when we are all so comfortable in our own lives and even complain about what we have not had when it is so trivial compared to someone else. They, the children of the film, are insensitive. They are more than desensitized by what surrounds them. They see sex as an act, as if they were watching a TV show. When the boy is with the prostitute, Pixote sits on the bed and looks with a blank look, without any feeling. He wants to be a little boy and have a family, but the prostitute has no compassion either and pushes him away. A "human" film, with "human" relationships and moral judgment in an ugly, frightened and cruel world. It reminds us that life is not fair, but that you can still have a human connection.
