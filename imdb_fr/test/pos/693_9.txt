Any film about World War II made by a British production company during the Second World War has, in my opinion, no modern counterpart. At the dawn of our dive: As a descendant of Admiral Horatio Nelson and student of all aspects of the Second World War, and in particular naval warfare, I am in favor of submarine performances and action in the North. Atlantic and especially those that include the German side of things. For those who do not know the priorities of the targets, an attack on an enemy warship is the greatest event a submarine can hope to encounter and such a rare opportunity would develop surprisingly in the same way as what we see. right here. The rhythm is deliberate and typical works that come out of Ealing, Rank and British Gaumont at the time: I really prefer his approach more silent and cerebral for his humanity and his realism that commits much better than any Hollywood on-product movie never pu. It reminds me of the 49th parallel of Powell and Pressburger thanks to the powerful persuader Eric Portman, one of my favorites. John Mills receives a second bill and a smaller font in the titles. This is clearly the film of Mr. Portman, but the whole cast shines. Regarding the title sequence, am I the only one to be totally seduced by CGI's pretty Gainsborough Girl, pre CGI?
