I was disappointed by the recent American remake (2000) of this English mini-series. Although he followed the plot very closely, he seemed to leave the heart and soul of the original outside. Not to mention the addition of 'messages' preached superficial and little aggressive ... My advice is to avoid the modern remake and stay true to the original. It is much longer, but striking and totally well done. Interesting, complex and textured, without the so-called justice she preaches ... and she is also beautifully filmed. <br /> <br /> I find it annoying that these heartless remakes of great foreign films attract the Hollywood fanfare to the Oscars. (Although I loved Benicio Del Torro get deserved praise ...)
