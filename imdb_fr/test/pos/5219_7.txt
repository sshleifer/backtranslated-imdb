I do not like boxing, I do not understand the attraction. I liked this film. Positive representations of Latinos, no drugs, sex or street violence. The plot actually showed stable and loving families. The fight sequences are violent, just like boxing, but not as much as Rocky movies. Nothing wrong with trying familiar themes with a different angle and ethnicity. It's a good rent.
