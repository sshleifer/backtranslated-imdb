It's up there with Where's Poppa, The Groove Tube, Putney Swope. It commemorates the spirit of the city of New York at that time, a wonderfully strange man with a weird plan, hoisted of his own free will, and finally retiring to the bed of his adoptive parents. Totally absurd is the life that we see through the magic glasses, to see things as they are "really" ... I do not think this is ever shown again. If that were the case, Tivo would surely be responsible for the thing and publish it. A kidnapping turns into vinegar: mixed with a rainstorm, rushing into shops or in front of a shop, our hero throws a raincoat on its prey and throws it into its bicycle-powered ice cream car drives it into its sub-surface. village soil. He is amazed, surprised and incredibly disappointed when the veil is lifted: instead of a luscious lady, he has captured a housewife from a middle-aged suburb who speaks and speaks again and again. The film is full of vignettes about the life of commuters, suburban life, city officials and all the attitudes so dearly respected. He pushes the limits of comedy, such as magical reality could push a drama, just as Daffy Duck is able to tap into imaginative scenes to demonstrate his fate or desires, all on the verge of plausibility. Everything is humorous, no one is mean.
