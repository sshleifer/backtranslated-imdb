This film launched my theory about book-based movies: instead of following the clich√© "You've read the book, watch the movie now", if you're looking for a good book to read, try the one on which a movie was liked based, because it's going to be 10 times better. <br /> <br /> I saw this film during its initial release at the National Theater in downtown Eugene and I loved it so much that I stayed to see it again. It's a perfect fusion of the inspiring talents of one of my favorite actors, Jon Voight, with what has become my favorite book, "The Water is Wide" by Pat Conroy. <br /> <br /> I can not think of anything better. film about the nobility of education and the ironic challenges of life. Two small warnings: <br /> <br /> (1) The video suffers a lot of pan-and-scan and deserves a mailbox version. (2) The title should be restored to the name of the book, a reference to one of the most touching and enigmatic songs ever written
