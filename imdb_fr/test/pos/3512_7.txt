I was lucky to see the DVD version of "Horror Classics" of this movie before it was mysteriously removed from the DVD of 4 movies and replaced by something else. The quality of the image and sound of the film in this edition was a nightmare in itself. Yet this version is EVEN superior to that with the luxury DVD treatment. The reason has been exposed in excerpts from Brad Fiedel's interview on the DVD of the special edition. He had noticed what I found so striking about this film at first. This is the use of music in the moments of inactivity in the film, but leaving the moments of activity in silence, thus giving the horror scenes a stronger sensation. The problem with this reissue is that it contains the extra movie score used to fill these intentional gaps in the score. Fiedel complained about this and said that the filling music was not his. The music was very similar to Howard Shore's work for Videodrome. Sad for me that I am also a big fan of this film and that I have to combine the two. <br /> <br /> The film itself has managed to add some interesting realistic elements to genre horror film. A group of friends go up on a mountain which one of them has inherited. On the mountain, they are confronted with a family with a nightmare secret. The film is moving forward. In fact, every time I've seen it, I'm always shocked to see that it took 45 minutes before everything went really bad for the campers. The fact that there is no score accompanying the horror scenes is what makes this movie smarter and even superior to most slasher movies I've ever seen. Director Jeff Lieberman had already made unique horror films, making him both the biggest audience and the most different of the general public. It's a good fun movie with surprising acting performances. The new DVD enriched version is worth the rent, collector's item Horror Classics, now the OOP is worth it.
