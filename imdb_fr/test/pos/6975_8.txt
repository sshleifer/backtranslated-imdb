I have a letter from Mrs. Knight, who went to university with my older sister. In this document, she tells about the difficulties involved in making this film. She herself was pregnant - an interesting conjunction with the plot of the film - and the novice director was uncertain, fairly green and had great difficulty with all decisions, logistics, etc. They were constantly on the move, and it was a very difficult shoot. <br /> <br /> The film, with a solid start for James Caan, remains effective and touching. This is a great showcase for the talent that Mrs. Knight has shown throughout her career - on television, in the movies and on stage, where she won the Tony for "The Children of Kennedy". <br /> <br /> This film has aged well.
