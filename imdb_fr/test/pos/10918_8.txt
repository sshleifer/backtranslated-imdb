I saw this because my cousin is an extra in one of the wedding scenes. I read somewhere that Oz and Rudnick wanted to make fun of liberal-sounding movies, but the climax eventually came out of one of those movies. In addition, some of the humor is a bit disgusting, Joan Cusack was too exaggerated for me, and someone has a strange schedule regarding the Oscars. Yet there were enough funny moments, like the kiss scene, the wedding that is not, and the scene with the principal, to enjoy it. As always, Kline is good, but for me, the real surprise was Selleck, of which I'm not a big fan, but who makes fun of himself here.
