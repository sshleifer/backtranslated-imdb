After falling asleep by pure loneliness, Lestat woke up after 100 years of sleep to the sound of a new music he wants to be part of and the group "The Vampire Lestat" was born. His desire to end his loneliness and his "light" attitude, his music, the anger of his fellow vampires and the awakening of an evil that has been dormant for thousands of years. <br /> <br /> This film is not for those who are looking for a real book to film adaptation. Those who read the books and expect to see them on screen will be disappointed. This film will please those who really enjoyed the movie "Interview with the Vampire". <br /> <br /> There are a few plot holes and incongruities, but overall, this movie was satisfying. Stuart Townsend portrays Lestat with a sensuality and sensuality that was lacking in the previous film. The relationships described in the movie were very sexy and hot. <br /> <br /> As a film, history requires and attracts you. The casting is wonderful. I loved this story and this movie. If you like sensuality and sexual tension, you'll love this movie!
