Race Against Fear must be one of the most moving TV movies I've seen in a long time. All the performances of the main actors were superb, especially those of Ariana Richards (Mickey Carlyle), William Bullimer (Coach Kurt Ansom) and Susan Blakely (Margaret Carlyle). Ariana in particular, presented an extremely emotional performance, with assorted facial expressions. She portrayed Mickey's emotions, and it was easy to believe that she had really been raped, so realistic was her performance. <br /> <br /> The RAF is an incredibly realistic movie, due to the thrilling performances of throwing. Bullimer proved incredibly good as a rapist, and you hated him more and more as the movie progressed. Blakely also had an emotional performance as the mother of the raped girl (Mickey Carlyle), and you felt more and more sorry for the Carlyle family because no one believed them about rape. <br /> <br /> In the end, the RAF is an excellent film. It is moving and suspenseful, as you still do not know if Ansom would be prosecuted for the rape, due to the lack of witnesses, evidence and belief in the complaint. I highly recommend seeing this movie.
