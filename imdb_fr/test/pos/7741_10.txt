I like this film and all its aspects, well done as comedy and drama. The game is fantastic, played by a cast of stars who perfectly interpret the high society of New York. The landscape is incredible, totally breathtaking. I also love history: a successful New York architect who is in a midlife crisis leaves his wife unfaithful and fled to a Greek island to hide with his daughter who chooses to accompany her. <br /> <br /> I just can not express enough my love story about this movie. "Show me the magic".
