Refreshing interview with the legendary Italian film-maker-director who died in 1999, with nearly 200 feature films to his credit as a director. Much of it is spent on D'Amato's softcore sex movies, including her prominent EMANUELLE entries with Laura Gemser. They also cover briefly his career in porn, which has kept him afloat in his last decade. What's more interesting to me is the section that focuses on its horror and action efforts. D'Amato has a lot of great stories about the actors and his low-budget film production, including the story of an assistant accidentally collecting real bones among fakes, when shooting in an old catacomb. 2,000 years. Other interviewees include George Eastman and Al Cliver. I would have liked to have a little more conversation about his productions of Stateside Filmirage (not a single question about TROLL 2, certainly it was not a cult movie, but it was now).
