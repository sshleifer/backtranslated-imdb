The show starts with the boat. Desmond was it me? Then they went to try to save Walt. And lock things that push button is a big joke at the same time that Desmond discovered that it was the one that crashed into the plane. Eko tries to open the door that Jhon locked and Charlie helps him find the bomb. While Sayid and Jack expect it to be, Sasyid must first find the others and see who and what are the others. And find out if there are weapons and weapons. <br /> <br /> Micheal takes Jack, Swayer, Kate and Hugo in a trap. And they get caught. <br /> <br /> After the show, there were more questions than answers, but that's what makes the show great. And I can not wait until season 3
