The producer, Matt Mochary, stumbled onto the subject of the film, Anderson Sa (head of the AfroReggae music movement), on a trip from the Hewlett Foundation in Rio de Janeiro. Sa's story so moved Mochary that he called his friend, the New York director Jim Zimbalist, who left his post and joined Mochary in Brazil for a documentary about Sa, the favelas of Rio and the culture of violence. <br /> <br /> The first part of the film shows you the culture of violence in the favelas of Rio (slums where the poor live) through sequences of police raids and attacks on the inhabitants. The footage is graphic and shocking. <br /> <br /> The charismatic Anderson Sa, born of the negativity of favelas, overcame a possible career in drug trafficking to launch the AfroReggae movement, which combines elements of Afro-Brazilian culture. , Reggae, Ska and other elements to create a fast and punchy music style, which has since spread to other parts of the world. You can not help but be carried away by the music, especially when you see the kids from the area getting involved in Sa's school, which he founded to keep kids out of the gangs of Drugs. The rest of the film follows Sa's meteoric rise and her positivity changes the lives of many children to inspire them to seek a life that goes beyond drugs. THE SPOILER: Just when the filmmakers thought they had finished filming, there is an incredible life-changing event that needs to be resolved to believe it. The film then continues and you are caught in your seat until the end. <br /> <br /> This film is an answer to "City of God", which is worth it. The distressing situation described in this film is countered by a concrete example of how the inhabitants of the favelas can overcome the desperate situation in which they find themselves and use their resources for constructive purposes. You can not help but not love and encourage Anderson Anderson to succeed. <br /> <br /> This film is terribly filmed, rhythmic and very absorbing. Judging by the overwhelming audience response to the SilverDocs screening last night, the film is expected to be released on the US market in the United States and the resounding soundtrack should also be aired. Keep an eye on this exceptional documentary - it's excellent!
