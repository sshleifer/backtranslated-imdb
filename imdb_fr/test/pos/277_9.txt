So real and surreal, all in one. I remember feeling like Tessa. Heck, I remember being Tessa. It was a beautiful vignette of an end of relationship. I particularly liked the tangent of the protesters. It's nice to see the symbolism in a movie without getting hit. If you have the chance to see this, take it. This is well worth the 30 minutes.
