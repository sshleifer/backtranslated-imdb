... sings David Bovie in this film. BUT HE IS!!! It's ALL about America, so do not be ashamed to look at it. Just think, if you can, to avoid more damage ... You know, you're still the same ordinary guy next door, so be careful! One of the best critics of the "common" spirit and friendship. You do not care? Go for the music - it's worth trying, just close your eyes and Pat Metheny and David Bowie will touch you so deeply that you'll start screaming! And while you look, if you dare to open your eyes, please do not make popcorn and all that, you will miss a lot. You may think it's not worth it, but think about it twice - and do not look at your neighbors' lawns - you never know what to find ... Is it worth it? worth it? Try it! Just do not die or gloat over her ...
