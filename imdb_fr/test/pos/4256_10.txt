If you have a chance to get your hands on this lost jewel (for many years), I doubt that you are disappointed. PS has a curious mix of social satire and ultra-cool blaxploitation - even hints of burlesque, but it's so weird that not only was it ahead of its time, nothing has been seen since. <br /> <br /> I totally disagree with the people who say that the movie is dated, especially with "Bamboozaled" (SP?) From Spike Lee a few years ago, that was a failure of try to capture the same message. (Good realization, disconnected scenario.) <br /> <br /> The direction of Robert Downy is brilliant, allowing many of his actors to improvise, the film improves over time and the reproached jokes are also forgiven that those found in a Mel Brooks comedy, at the pure non-PC 'I can not believe they just said that' fun. <br /> <br /> Favorite pieces, commercials. The film switches between the black and white representations of the advertising agency and switches to the magnificent color (maybe 16 mm). <br /> <br /> I refuse to refer to spoilers, but if you're lucky enough to see the DVD version, be sure to watch the Downey interview (but leave it after the movie ends.) <br /> <br /> My vote 10 / 10-- most underrated movie of the late 60s, early 70s. Thank you Prince.
