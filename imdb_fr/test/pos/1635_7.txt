Tom Hanks returns in the role of Robert Langdon, Dan Brown's symbologist, in his first adventure, Angels & Demons, which Hollywood decided to do after The Da Vinci Code, as its more controversial topic strikes hard at faith herself. The Catholic Church rose up against the first film, but apparently nonchalant about it. And it is not difficult to understand why, considering that Ron Howard had chosen to make a piece of action that is an excellent tourist video of Rome and Vatican City, and that would probably have the effect of increasing the number visitors because of the many beautiful scenes taking place on site. for St. Peter's Square and the basilica, which was a used model. <br /> <br /> So, I guess with the bulk of the budget allocated to sets, the distribution of the set had to be reduced accordingly. Ayelet Zurer tried to penetrate the female void left by Audrey Tautou, but since the character of Tautou had more weight in the film, the scientist Zurer, Vittoria, had much less to do than wait in the backstage to change his tin batteries filled with anti-matter. In the book, of course, she is the means by which Langdon discusses her vast knowledge of the Vatican, the Illuminati and the great quarrel that pits them against her, but here she has no amorous interest, nor her intellectual equal. <br /> <br /> Ewan McGregor, for his part, recounts every scene in which he finds himself as Camerlengo Patrick McKenna, who temporarily takes care of the papal office while the other cardinals in sight are in the Sistine Chapel to elect a new pope. And he plays Patrick with that gleam in his eyes, with enough nuances to let you know that there is more than just what you see. There are no surprises here for the readers of the novel, but McGregor's performance is one of the highlights of the film. Hanks plays well, Tom Hanks. <br /> <br /> The book itself is rich with arguably accurate content, as always, and has had many more plot points on science versus religion, and a wealth of information than Dan Brown searched for and related to each other in an engaging fictional work. Reading the book a few years ago, I thought that if a movie was made, it would be easy to waste time and focus on the action scenes. Unfortunately, that's what Ron Howard did with a pace that does not allow a temporary respite. Unlike the first movie where the characters sat for a "discussion" over a cup of tea, it made things happen so quickly, it's like re-reading the book again, page after page being skipped just to go to the thick of the action. <br /> <br /> Catholic critics have called angels and demons harmless, because I suppose they did not insist on his many controversies, unlike The Da Vinci Code, which struck a raw nerve in the center of the Faith. And if so, this film was an excellent tourist promotional video with a beautiful showcase of the many important tourist sites that would encourage many visitors from around the world to visit. Naturally, certain areas, such as the catacombs under St. Peter's Basilica and the Vatican Archives, are still prohibited, but the walk along the Path of Enlightenment is now almost free. <br /> <br /> Nothing new for those who have read the book other than to see it come alive, but for those who have not yet done so, this film might require you to read Dan's novel Brown, to know a little more about the significance of the landmarks and characters such as Galileo, Michelangelo and Bernini who are closely related to the plot, but many left unsaid. Satisfactory popcorn entertainment leaving you nothing spectacular.
