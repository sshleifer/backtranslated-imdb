This film was released at the same time as Pretty Woman. While the general theme is the same: a rich man meets and learns to love a poor woman of the working class, but the characters of Romuald and Juliet are much more adorable and worthy of our time. I have never forgotten them and consider the film as superior to Pretty woman in many ways. Juliette is a remarkable woman and the intelligent ways she helps her boss overcome her problems will encourage you. The final scenes contain some of the most memorable lines of romantic comedy. Romuald's efforts to win Juliet's love exceed a hundred times the classy climbing of Pretty Woman. See this movie, it'll warm your heart.
