Interesting comic, included in the DVD of "The lost skeleton of Cadavra". I particularly like the way color was used in the background art - very artistic for Columbia, whose cartoon department usually had a very small budget (and the results looked like it!) <br /> <br /> I wonder, however, how a certain ... uh ... a finger gesture ... has he ever passed the censors? Admittedly, the gesture in question was seen much less often in 1937 than it is today. One would think that someone other than the animators would have noticed it, especially since it is seen three times in the scene in question! And based on the context, I suspect that his inclusion was intentional, what the facilitators slipped just to see if the censors would notice it!
