2005 was one of the best years for cinema. We had so many wonderful movies, like Batman Begins, Sin City, Corpse Bride, A History of Violence ..... Coming, we also Brokeback Mountain, King Kong .... But if this year, the only big one film that was out was illuminated, so we would not miss everything this year has brought. The first film as director of the talented Liev Schreiber is a moving drama, comforting and moving, which also brings one of the best roles of Elijah Wood. He is perfect as Jonathan, a curious man who travels to Ukraine to find the woman who saved his grandfather during the Second World War. Liev Schreiber, who also writes the film, directs a masterpiece, with memorable scenes and (many) amusing quotes. This is a true mix of comedy with drama, bringing a film that will be commented on for years to come. A serious Oscar nominee, Everything is Illuminated is a powerful, original film and, why not, illuminated. But there is one thing you must remember when you enter the movie: leave the normal behind you. It's special .------ 9/10
