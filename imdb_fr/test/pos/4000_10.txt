Fire gives everyone ... <br /> <br /> This is one of the most magisterial meditations of the film on art. Housed in the nineteenth century in Korea, it tells the story of the famous painter Ohwon. Rather than sticking to delusional anecdotes, melodrama or psychological hunt for the egg, he describes a series of episodes throughout his life, all of which are magnificent works of art in themselves. . This gives no interpretation of these episodes, but gives the viewer time to think about Ohwon's paintings himself. In this way, the viewer enters the same kind of contemplation as Ohwon, and less his talent can "feel" in the inspiration of his paintings. <br /> <br /> Part of the reason why this is so effective is the utterly masterful evocation of nineteenth-century Korea and the musical / artistic world in which Ohwon settled. There are so many beautiful pictures of the world apart from the paintings that we get a mirror effect where we see the beautiful world that inspires Ohwon, who lives and looks inside this world, and the works of art that he creates, reproducing each other. <br /> <br /> The story is told with an extreme economy. A sensation evoked is rarely explained, it just appears and then disappears for the next to appear. By analogy, it is a kind of work of Mozart (endless succession and fast of big ideas) rather than Beethovinian (obsessional which lingers on a good idea). He has a classic constraint, much like Ohwon's paintings. There is not really any music suggesting how to feel except some classic Korean pieces used with great efficiency in several scenes (and mostly played by characters from the movie). If I remember correctly, one of the most haunted images is that of a flock of birds hovering over the blue mountains as a singer sings. <br /> <br /> "This life is like a dream and only death will wake us up "One of the most telling tips of the film, written by one of Ohwon's teachers, is that" the painting is between traits ". The film follows this attitude because there is so much material between what is spoken and described in the film. I saw it twice and it was very enriching at the second viewing. A very laconic film, with few obscure explanations, one could see how much it's Im's 96th film. It is an artistic masterpiece. As a great friend and Ohwon's mentor says in describing one of his paintings, "One does not lose a single shot." <br /> <br /> I compare it to Andrei Rubylev by his quality, although his style is very different. It is much easier and more directly entertaining to watch, but in a classic form where Andrei is gothic. <br /> <br /> All in all, it is highly recommended to anyone except the appetite addicts. The two times I left the film, I felt a wonderful spiritual renewal. <br /> <br /> One of the aspects of Ohwon's life that intrigued me was that his craziness started drinking after visiting a noble who told him that "Good art can come that the great knowledge and learning. "The next short scene, Ohwon, was very angry and the next was completely drunk because it often stayed until the end of the film. I am curious to know why the words of the nobility have affected him so much and made him drink that dominated the rest of his life. Or was it just a coincidence?
