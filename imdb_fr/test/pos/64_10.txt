Darling Lili is a mix of perfection and magic! The stars; Julie Andrews and Rock Hudson could not have done better if they had tried. It's full of all the magic that a young woman wants and it gives the impression that anything can really happen to you. The brilliance of the director; Blake Edwards has been shown to be at its best. He really captured the woman he loved on the screen! <br /> <br /> The mix of each song matched perfectly with the moment of the film. The film started with Julie Andrews singing Whistling Away in the dark and finished with the same Andrews song. <br /> <br /> For a film of this excellence, having been such a failure when it was released is a total shock ... <br /> <br /> As is: "Inspired ... Pure .. Inspired! " ~ One of Andrews most memorable lines in this movie!
