This is one of the most successful films of 1999 with Kate Capshaw leading a cast of stars on a small town and a love letter. First of all, the scenery is beautiful and anyone who sees this movie and does not want to move to this place is crazy! For casting, Capshaw is beautiful as a leading actress who captivates the emotional role of the roller coaster. Tom Everett Scott is charming as the "author" of the note throughout the film, and the always charming Ellen Degeneres is hilarious! Blythe Danner and the actress who plays the role of saleswoman in bookstores are also great. Although this did not succeed, the film is excellent because it is at once short, sweet and very romantic. 10/10
