I am so happy to have recorded this film during its broadcast on the BBC last month! It cut my mind, so heartbreaking and real. David Tennant is absolutely fabulous in this respect, although his character is not always easy to like or to identify. The final scene where he plays the song just broke my heart, those eyes .... <br /> <br /> I guess he made this movie between Dr. Who series, which makes him more than one achievement for me. I love Dr. Who, and yet I absolutely did not see it in Mr. Tennants' description of this man who knows he has changed and is striving to create a new identity and a new life. <br /> <br /> intense drama!
