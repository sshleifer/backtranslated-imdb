I love that movie. This is the first movie Master P has ever made. It is based on the story of his life. It's a small budget, but it's fine. This shows how Master p has grown into projects in New Orleans. <br /> <br /> Not only did Master P start in this film, he was also a screenwriter and director with Moon Jones. The DVD also contains some of the No Limit ice cream. This film shows how Master P is doing too badly and how he has to deal with the things around him. He also has a lot of record No Limit Records in this movie. You should buy or rent this movie. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie to watch if you like rap or if you are a fan of Master P. I will not spoil this movie for you. Go see this movie as fast as you can and watch it. You will like it.
