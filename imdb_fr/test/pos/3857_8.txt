I must say that one of the main reasons I found the AristoCats as great is that I love cats !!! I love cats, which probably gave this movie an important score, It's one of my favorite animal movies, although it's lively, and I really like the fact that the actors / actresses not seemed so unprofessional behind the voices of animals. For me, this film seems to be a classic, but I think for IMDb it's not because it has, yes, I feel too low for the ranking. AristoCats is one of the best animated movies and I could enjoy it again and again !!
