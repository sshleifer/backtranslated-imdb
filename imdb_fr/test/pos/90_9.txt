I really enjoyed this short film, even as a fan of the Toronto Maple Leafs. <br /> <br /> Director Sheldon Cohen and narrator Roch Carrier captured the boy's emotions perfectly. From his feelings for his hero, Maurice "Rocket" Richard, to the excitement, anticipation and hope of soon getting a new Montreal Canadiens jersey, with a horror look on his face when he pulls his sweater from his mother; A Toronto Maple Leafs jersey was priceless and the shame of having to wear that awful Toronto Maple Leaf blue and white jersey; Not the red, blue and white of the Montreal Canadiens with Richard's number nine, like his old sweater. And even worse, his mother made him wear this Maple Leafs jersey at home. You can imagine and anticipate the ridicule that his friends would get by hitting the ice with this sweater before his arrival. <br /> <br /> I laugh all the time and this is one of the best animated shorts we've seen. <br /> <br />
