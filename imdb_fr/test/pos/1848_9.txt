Yesterday, I watched this film with a trainee from my 20-year-old office (OK - it was the calm day after Thanksgiving) and we both loved it. I love the unique plot, David Duchovny, David Allen Greer, and the way the dog continues to wait at the door. Is not a part of each of us like this dog after the death of someone we love? <br /> <br /> I also like the seniors in the restaurant - they remind me of some old people in southern New England, where your ethnic group is a very important topic of discussion. And I love marriage in the end. <br /> <br /> Minnie Driver is excellent in this movie - and Bonnie Hunt should have won a prize for everything. <br /> <br /> Bonnie - Make more movies!
