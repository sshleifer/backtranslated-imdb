How are these guys going? They are each about 50 years old and act as if they were only 30 years old. They play 3 hours of music at each concert and hardly sweat. This DVD is their first concert in Rio, Brazil. Although people do not speak English, they try to memorize the lyrics of Rush's most famous songs and sing a foreign language at the concert with their best friends. <br /> <br /> From Tom Sawyer to The Spirit of Radio, this concert DVD will keep you in the chair, you will not want to stop or discard the classics you listened to when you were young. This is their 30th meeting tour (started in 1974). I went to their concert at Scranton PA, and it was just as good, although in PA they did not play Freewill, so I was upset. <br /> <br /> They have Freewill, they have The Trees, they have YYZ, The Pass, Driven, Dreamline, Red A Sector, Limelight, Roll the Bones, 2112 and so much more. 10 out of 10, because nothing else compares. If you're never going to a Rush concert, buy at least this DVD.
