River's Edge is more than just a murder story. This is an indictment of the wave of apathy that has hit pockets of young people for decades. Our main characters are a group of what my high school would have called "stoners". One of them just decided to strangle his girlfriend because she apparently had the nerve to "talk to her about grace". This dangerous young man played by Daniel Roebuck has an intensity that will amaze you. He takes the other kids out of the group to show them the body of his girlfriend and, strangely enough, nobody really seems to panic about it. The balance of the film punctuates the desperate circumstances in which these people live and shows how guilt manages to infiltrate even within these apathetic children. <br /> <br /> River's Edge does not tolerate or defend the behavior of its characters. We see clearly the dangers presented by such uncontrolled apathy and have only the desire to get drunk or drunk. We are shown the dysfunctional family life that these children experienced, and that may explain their horrible behavior. But could it be only unstable foci leading to this type of destructive life? Crispin Glover is his usual style. He leads the city into a state of complete paranoia after the murder. He tries to understand why his friend had to commit the crime, but he obviously does not understand what could have caused the young man to commit it. Dennis Hopper plays an older man whose children draw their dope. Although he is certainly a rebellious character, he can not understand the apathy and rage of the younger generation. Witness his confused reaction as Roebuck describes what the murder of his girlfriend made him feel. As crazy as the character of Hopper, even if he knows that this young man should not walk on the surface of the earth. <br /> <br /> What will you think of these children? Well, there is really no way to love their characters. Some are less despicable than others, but you can not help but hate or complain about them. Twenty years later, apathy is still alive in many young people. When are these children lost? What drives so many of them to be anti-social? This film and the questions it asks about teenagers will stay with you for a while. It is a fact. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10 stars. <br /> <br /> The hunting dog.
