It was a good movie for only 67 minutes. This film had a dark film aspect and I am glad that Nolan chose to film it in black and white. The plot is simple but entertaining that keeps you engaged. Even the dialogue was good with the acting game. It reminded me of what would happen to Memento by not being in chronological order. I liked how the main character tried to use what Cobb had taught him, for example saying "everyone has a box" in which he put his personal belongings. In addition, on the writer's door, Batman's logo sounded ironic, as Christopher Nolan would later lead Batman Begins and The Dark Knight, two other great movies. There is a big difference in the end that I will not spoil for those who have not seen it, although I somehow imagined what would happen when Cobb gave the credit card D Lloyds to the young man . I also liked the fact that the author had a copy of The Republic by Plato, one of my favorite philosophical books. This is definitely a movie you have to watch more than once to get the full look, plus it only lasts an hour. There is also a circular aspect ending with the beginning, which I thought was very brilliant.
