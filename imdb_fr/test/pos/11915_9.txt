I recently rented this film as part of a nostalgic phase that I go through. I was born in 1980 and the film of the mid-80s in the mid-90s has an important place in my childhood. <br /> <br /> This movie was one of my favorite movies. he became available in the UK. It did not get worse over time, it's still a very entertaining movie, very exciting in its own way. Of course, it pales in the shadow of bigger and bigger budget movies, but do not let that stop you from enjoying that. <br /> <br /> Worth the rental, or even a discounted purchase that you will find for.
