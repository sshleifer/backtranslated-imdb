After long disdaining TV shows on the networks, I remember the first time I came across an episode of "Police Squad!". It was totally by accident. It was during the initial network of the show broadcast on ABC in early 1982. I am a chronic channel surfer and I was flip-flopping a dial one evening when the opening credit sequence of "Police Squad! I immediately recognized it as a shipment of the opening credits of "M-Squad" starring Lee Marvin, one of my favorite cop shows. I stopped surfing. Then, of course, the headquarters is shot, followed by the immortal Rex Hamilton in the role of Abraham Lincoln. Now, I thought, "What is that?" Then, Georg Stanford Brown, "special guest", is crushed by a vault safe. I became addicted from that moment. The episode was "Ring of Fear / A Dangerous Assignment", with his comic references to "On The Waterfront", and "Muhammed Ali". Leslie Nielsen and Alan North in their informal parody of Lee Marvin and Paul Newlan of "M Squad" were an absolute riot. "Finally," I said to myself, "A network television program that is definitely worth watching !!!" Would not you know it would be canceled a few weeks later. Leave that to the networks - I should have known. Anyway, I just bought the six-episode DVD collection and they're just as fun today as they were 27 years ago. The "Naked Gun" films were also excellent, but Alan North (he was so good like Ed Hocken), Peter Lupus in the role of Nordberg (what did they think about OJ in this part?), And especially "Johnny" the shoeshine. Great thing.
