I know little or nothing about astronomy, but nevertheless; At first, I was a little skeptical about the plot of this movie. It follows three children who are all born during a solar eclipse and therefore have no emotion and therefore become (naturally) ruthless serial killers. The plot looks ridiculous at first, but once you realize that a solar eclipse is blocking Saturn and, as you know, Saturn is the planet of emotion, it is set up; makes sense and that's when you know you're not looking at another 1980s slasher with a cerebral conspiracy. Thank you god for that! Seriously, Bloody Birthday is based on a ridiculous premise, but it largely offsets that by its originality. It may not be the most ingenious stratagem ever seen in the cinema for taking a bunch of kids to the massacre, but when given the choice between that and another dull Friday 13th clone, I know what I would choose. <br /> <br /> The fact that this movie is extremely entertaining also helps the film out of the hole that some people might think to be a silly plot. Many slashers become formulas much too quickly and the audience ends up simply watching to see gore. This movie, however, continues to work with terrific chilling performances from kids (reminiscent of scary classics like Village of the Damned), a steady stream of sick humor, and a small but impressive dose-type movie. suspense and tension. One of the things I really liked in this movie was the vast array of weapons. There is nothing worse than a killer where the killer uses the same weapon again and again (Halloween coughing cough), but this is not the case here, Bloody Birthday leaves room for everything, from strings to jump to the bow through the arrows. There was no room for a chain saw, which is a huge shame, but I guess not all movies can contain a chainsaw.
