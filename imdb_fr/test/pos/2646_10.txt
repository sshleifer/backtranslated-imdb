In 1968, Stanley Kubrick founded this historic film masterpiece on a book written by Arthur C. Clark. It was so early to make a sci-fi film combined with scientific facts. His style of filming is always fresh and intact. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie more than half a dozen times and I even have a VHS copy of the movie in my library. The CS3 class made me see the film again with another perspective: who is HAL and what is he thinking about? <br /> <br /> I loved seeing the movie again and I tried to center the dialogues of HAL throughout the second episode of the movie. . In the second scene, Drs. Dave Bowman and Frank Poole eat their food in front of two TV screens on the side and the round red glass dome of HAL is in the center. In the television report, HAL was introduced on January 12, 1992 as HAL 9000 Series, the next generation of supercomputers commissioned. During the interview, HAL reacts as a humble work machine trying to fully accomplish the mission of the spaceship. <br /> <br /> In another scene, Dave is drawing Drs. Hunter, Kambel and Kaminsky who are all sleeping. HAL is curious to see these sketches and raises his dubious question about the purpose of the Jupiter mission. His calm and monotonous voice makes the audience listen to him more carefully. <br /> <br /> In the next scenes, we'll see how HAL tries to kill the astronauts one by one and takes the power. His conscience makes him able to try to save his life from termination. When Dave wants to return to the spacecraft and HAL does not listen to it, the most memorable phrase in the movement is, "I'm sorry Dave, I'm afraid I can not do that. "In the middle of the most important interaction between man and machine, the voice of HAL can evoke both deep calm and malevolence in the same monotonous tone. <br /> <br /> Dave returned to the ship, lost all of his astronaut comrades and is determined to disconnect the main brain cells from the HAL. HAL uses his final apology techniques to convince Dave not to disconnect him. HAL begs him to stop and let him fix himself. These are his famous lines as Dave disconnects his modules one by one: <br /> <br /> "Dave, what do you do? <br /> <br /> Dave?" I am entitled to the answer to the question! <br /> <br /> I know that everything is not calm with me recently ?? <br /> <br /> But I feel much better know ?? <br /> <br /> Can I see that I am really upset by this very bad decision recently mine ?? <br /> <br /> Dave, stop! Do you want? <br /> <br /> Dave, stop! <br /> <br /> I'm scared of Dave! "<br /> <br /> The voice of HAL slows down during this process and becomes thicker and less dense, audible: <br /> <br /> 'my mind goes away' I can feel it '<br /> <br />' Can I sing a song for you? '<br /> <br /> Dave puts the last modules in his place and lets HAL sing his song called "Daisy": > <br /> 'Daisy gives me' <br /> <br /> your answer to me '<br /> <br /> I'm crazy' <br /> <br /> Although I I am not confused? <br /> <br /> HAL dies while Jupiter's mission continues ?? <br /> <br /> God bless you artificially HAL, get away in peace!
