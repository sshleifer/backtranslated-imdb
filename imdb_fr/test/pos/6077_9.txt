There have already been several comments on the site that focus on the "prestige" of the film - and there are plenty of heavy talents on display: from Fiennes to Scott-Thomas to the beautifully rendered design and scores, to the magisterial direction. No wonder Andrew Lloyd Webber's acceptance speech for "Evita" at this year's Oscars started "Well, thank goodness, that" The English Patient "does not contain any songs." The writing of the Oscar winners brings me to Juliette Binoche, who, in an exceptional cast, gives a great performance. It is heartening to note that the dynamics that seem to influence the price of the best actor (which often goes to the pyrotechnic show) is not at work in the female categories. Just as Emma Thompson's well-deserved Oscar for her portrayal of Margaret Schlegel in "Howard's End" has proven that one of the hardest things for an actor to do is to portray the "good" implies, that - and seriously sexy. His performance in this fantastic film is magnificent.
