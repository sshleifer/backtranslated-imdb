Dr. Stephens (Michael Harvey), director of an institute for people with severe imbalances and understaffing, takes a "step-by-step" approach to treating his patients, leaving his freedom of building, day and night free. night; he pays, however, the price of his avant-garde spirit when he rather stupidly prescribed to cut the wood with an ax as a therapy for one of his patients, and consequently his neck is confused with a trunk (it serves him well not to suggest the weaving of baskets). <br /> <br /> Shortly after this tragic incident, nurse Charlotte Beale (Rosie Holotik) arrives at the hospital to assume the position of Physician Assistant and discovers that the facility is now managed by the very uncompromising Dr. Geraldine Masters (Annabelle Weenick). While ignoring her late predecessor's decision to employ Ms. Beale and not wanting to hire new employees, Dr. Masters agrees to let the handsome nurse start working, but after several trying experiences at the hospital, Charlotte begins to ask if it could have been better if she had been repressed. <br /> <br /> It does not take a genius to understand what's really going on in the hospital, the lunatics have taken control of the asylum 'schtick being a premise this should be familiar to most fans Horrors, but SF Do not look in the basement of Brownrigg turns out to be a fun piece of entertainment in the car thanks to its well-defined collection of crazy: Sam lobotomized and creamy ice cream (Bill McGhee); Judge Oliver W. Cameron (Gene Ross), who continually mumbles sentences pronounced in court; old Mrs. Callingham (Rhea MacAdams), who recites William Allingham's frightening poem The Fairies, and warns Charlotte of her imminent destiny; the little snitch, Danny (Jessie Kirby), who likes to tease other patients; Harriet (Camilla Carr), who thinks her doll is a real baby; Sergeant Jaffee (Hugh Feagin); and best of all, Allyson King (Betty Chandler), whose rejection by a series of men left her with a thirst for love (that is, she tries to jump from any man approaching her). <br /> <br /> This incredibly crazy set of characters, plus some gore and nudity, a reasonable direction from Brownrigg (who also gave us the awesome horror of the white Scum of the Earth basket), and a solid tour of the Holotik covergirl playboy, everything will turn rather predictable and low-budget operation, turned into a very observable psycho-shock.
