Although the plot of this film is a little far-fetched, it deserves to be seen solely for the performances of Michaels Caine and Gambon. The latter offers a truly magnificent focus on Dublin. Caine gets involved ... which is exactly what the character he plays should do. Entertaining and fun, it's an hour and a half of easy observation.
