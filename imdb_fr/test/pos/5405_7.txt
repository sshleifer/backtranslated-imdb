"Imaginary Heroes" is a 2004 film starring Sigourney Weaver, Jeff Daniels, Emile Hirsch, Michelle Williams and Kip Pardue. <br /> <br /> The story is about a dysfunctional family that becomes even more so when the oldest child (Pardue) commits suicide. <br /> <br /> "Ordinary people" was often mentioned in this film; it's a kind of "ordinary people" with a role reversal. In this case, the mother, Sandy Travis (Weaver), is more accessible than her father, Ben (Daniels), clearly devastated and unable to cope. Like "Ordinary People", Tim (Hirsch), the youngest son, is at the center of the film. <br /> <br /> For me, the film has been absorbing enough to keep watching, but it has a curious detachment. There have been wonderful interactions - mother and son, mother and neighbor, brother and sister (Williams) and some unexpected good times. What never clicked was that Ben was part of this family or had some chemistry with Sandy. This seems to have been the goal of director / writer Dan Harris. In a scene in a grocery store, the child at the checkout assumes that Sandy is "about 30 years old" and gives him his phone number. In almost the next scene, Daniels asks Sandy if she wants plastic surgery for her birthday. Weaver was 55 when this movie was shot, probably 54, and looks phenomenal. So, what is Ben watching? However, Ben's complete detachment is not in his favor, as the viewer does not really see how Daniels was ever attached to this family. <br /> <br /> The end presents some twists and some very touching scenes. Everyone is very good, with Weaver and Hirsch in the spotlight. <br /> <br /> There is not much dialogue in this film and many looks. The script could have been sharper. But "Imaginary Heroes" is a good effort.
