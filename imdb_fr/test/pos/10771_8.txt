Sonny Chiba, as everyone knows, is the man. In this film, he portrays Mas Oyama (1923-1994), a true martial artist who fought over 50 bulls with his bare hands - and won (an interesting guy - who looks at him). Anyway, Chiba only kills a bull in the movie, but it's a memorable scene and, as the liner note says, in the zombie-shark scene in Zombi! The film also offers tons of melee combat and a decent plot, but I do not think everything is true. This film is the first of Chiba's Oyama trilogy. It is recommended to martial arts lovers. Finally, three little neat things; Part of the opening theme was used in Kill Bill Volume 1, Oyama himself appears in the opening sequences and that's because he has trained Chiba in real life for five years!
