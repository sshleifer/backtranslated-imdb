It must be my guilty pleasure. I am a huge fan of 80s movies designed to entertain and they do not care to offend anyone. This movement has no meat, no substance, no deep scenes provoking thought. Just the old schoolboys having fun and if some breasts must be shown, then too bad! This film is for when you just want to relax and not think. Viva nudity!
