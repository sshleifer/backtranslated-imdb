The viewer who said he was disappointed seems to have failed miserably here. This is a superb film, an excellent and realistic portrayal of a middle-class Jewish family in Brighton Beach, Brooklyn, long ago. The shades are perfect and I felt everyone's casting was superior. Judith Ivey found that acting was a perfection - especially the talk she has with her daughter when she comes home late at night. This scene was worthy of an Oscar. But, really, the whole game was good. I recommend this movie. It's a fun and enjoyable family film to see how a beautiful middle-class family lived in Brooklyn so long ago. See it and you'll be glad to have done it. A very funny lines and the character of Eugene is a real comedian - very funny.
