"Head" is one of those movies that you will find difficult to convince your friends to see, but once they do, they will fall in love with it. I do not know how many times this has happened to me. This movie is so funny and weird, really a deconstruction of everything the Monkees had done so far in their careers. Much of the credit goes to Bob Rafelson, who virtually ended Monkee's career with this film. I imagine he wanted to stop directing the TV series and get into feature films, which he did significantly after this one. Micky Dolenz is absolutely hilarious. I can not believe he did not have a second life as a comic actor after this movie. This movie has a lot of great cameos and a lot of wonderful psychedelic nonsense. I feel as if the reputation of this film continues to build and it would not surprise me if it finally became a cult classic
