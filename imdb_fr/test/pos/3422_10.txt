I have not seen a film for a long time that moves me and captures me in this way; that I could not leave the screen of the eyes. I burst for the toilet; and I did not even want to take a break because I was sucked up. Emotive; powerful; very moving; horrible and heartbreaking. This gives you an incredible insight into South Africa; their struggles and their lives. The acting was breathtaking and the scenario was incredible. Despite the terrible events unfolding in this film and the horror of the story, I was captivated. I do not even want to try to explain the story. it's way too complex and I would not do it justice. Please see this; you will understand why when you do it. Cheers, Hol
