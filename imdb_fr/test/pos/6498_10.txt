Excellent performance. There are still good actors around! Also great staging and photography. Very loyal to Shakespear and a must for all Shakespear fans. Macbeth (Jason Connery) moved me to tears with his final monologue (a brief candle, a brooch) He gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face, which makes it all the more interesting . Helen Baxendale is a very credible Macbeth lady who can sometimes be very cheerful. Sometimes she looks like a naughty girl, but her taste for blood and evil is deadly. If you love death and decadence and the words of Shakespears ... that's it.
