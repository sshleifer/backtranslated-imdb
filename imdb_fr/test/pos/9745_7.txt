Flash Gordon is, without a doubt, the best of all American soap operas. At a date as old as 1936, Universal was able to create such an entertainment story. Twenty years later, when I watched her for the first time, as a child, I found myself in a great adventure and intense emotion. Buster Crabbe was the hero we had always wanted to be in our childhood and Jean Rogers the beautiful girl we had always dreamed of being in love with. Dragons, octopuses, monsters, gorillas were also the attraction. Charles Middleton was a great presence as Ming, the ruthless. A true predecessor of George Lucas's Starwars.
