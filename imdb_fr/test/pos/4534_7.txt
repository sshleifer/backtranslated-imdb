I guess I do not have too much to add. I found comedy always funny after more than ten years of existence. <br /> <br /> The only thing I noticed was that the music during the dialogue distracted and often made the movie very catchy. it should have been. The use of songs is acceptable during the film, but the orchestral background is too loaded, too artificial, and if the film were to be edited for a DVD, I would seriously recommend that the background music be toned down to an almost inaudible level . This has depreciated the overall feel of the movie as a whole and I can see subconsciously why many people have let it pass. <br /> <br /> The film worked on several levels for the screenplay, the plot and the comedy. level. It's a shame that the producer and the director felt that they needed the musical schlock to improve the mood. Knowing this now, I find it difficult to watch and I discretely curse anyone who has been involved in the musical editing of the film. He had all the subtlety of a jackhammer.
