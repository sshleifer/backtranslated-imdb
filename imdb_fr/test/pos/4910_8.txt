Story of a widowed father (Claude Rains) raising his four daughters. Emma (Gale Page) is loved by the great mischievous Ernest (Dick Foran). Thea (Lola Lane) is romanced by an old but rich man. Kay (Rosemary Lane) wants to become a singer. Ann (Priscilla Lane) is a romantic. Drop handsome Felix Deitz (Jeffrey Lynn), a partner of their father, comes to live with them. All the sisters fall in love with him. Mickey (John Garfield), cynical and tough, makes his debut in the film ... <br /> <br /> A very entertaining film was a great success and was nominated for five Oscars. It is beautifully made by Michael Curitz. He has a very good (though predictable) scenario and a VERY attractive cast (especially Lynn). It was also John Garfield's first film and made him a star. It was so popular that there were three or four suites (which I have never seen). It's an exciting, entertaining, high budget drama - worth the trip.
