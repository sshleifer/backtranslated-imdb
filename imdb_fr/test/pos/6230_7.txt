"Tourist Trap" is one of my favorite horror movies of the late '70s and early' 80s. A group of young people are heading somewhere, a pair in the car ahead of us, and this car has a flat . Our film begins with the young man, Woody, who pushes the tire looking for a gas station. He finds a place apparently abandoned, yet hears voices and investigation, and ends up having a pipe in his stomach to thank his efforts. Then come the rest of the young people (in a VW Thing) who are looking for Woody's girlfriend and find the same place, Slausen's Oasis, or something like that ... and Mr. Slausen arrives while the girls enjoy a dive in the stream. Of course, the VW Thing mysteriously died at that time, so Mr. Slausen (Chuck Connors) offers his help. Mr. Slausen has a museum, with many wax figures, and he lives in the museum but behind is a big house, where he says that Davey lives. And who is Davey? Why, Davey Crockett, he said ... but if it was Davey Crockett, they would probably all be safer. The girls are left alone while Slausen is helping to repair the car, but of course, curiosity prevails and she goes to investigate and finds the house full of scary mannequins and a rather animated character named ... Davey. What follows is a rather scary night of terror, one by one. They are taken prisoner by Davey, who says he is Slausen's brother. A girl (kidnapped earlier) is treated with a plaster facial mask, which causes her death when she covers her air supply. Anyway, there's a certain twist to that and nice (but weird) Mr. Slausen is not exactly what he seems to be. A good scary horror movie of the late '70s and many mannequins create a very scary atmosphere. 7 out of 10
