I saw this in the movie Accent Underground with the shorts. At first, I found the movie boring and old-fashioned. I turned it off after an hour. I was a little drunk and tired. <br /> <br /> I went to bed and, no kidding, I had a nightmare about this movie. in the half hour to fall asleep. I could not help but think of the reason, so I got up, turned on the TV, loaded the DVD and saw the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> Well done, Mr. Alex Frayne, sir, you've managed to get your film into this old cynical head of moviegoers, and it's taking action. So 10 out of 10. <br /> <br /> I can not say that I "like" your movie, but it has had a lasting impact, despite its flaws and low budget, etc.
