Absolutely corrosive! Director Arthur Hiller and writer Paddy Chayefsky dismantle the American hospital system with this bad comedy / drama / whodunit. The hospital here is fraught with pitfalls ... protests from neighbors to angry patients, a potential serial killer on the run. George C. Scott is the greatest doctor who, on the brink of his own nervous breakdown, engages with Diana Rigg, a free-spirited woman, and her goofy father, Barnard Hughes. Alternately depressing and tumultuous, THE HOSPITAL presents some of the most tame dialogues imaginable (note how Scott describes his session of creating love with Rigg). It also contains many interesting vignettes: Nancy Marchand, the head nurse reprimanding after one of her subordinates accidentally killed a doctor; Frances Sternhagen, director of the daffy, is desperately trying to collect information about insurance in a waiting room full of sick people; Scott is advised by the psychiatrist of the hospital after he told him about his sad family life. All actors are first class. Scott and Rigg are dynamite and Hughes is a real surprise. The film is a masterpiece of Chayefsky's screenplay that earned him a well-deserved Oscar (facing such a fierce competition as KLUTE & Sunday, BLOODY Sunday). The opening narrative is priceless.
