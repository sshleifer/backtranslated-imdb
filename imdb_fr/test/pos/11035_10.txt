If it were possible to award a prize of 10+ ... that would be the movie I would choose. <br /> <br /> I remember seeing this movie on TV many, many years ago - and thankfully I was prepared enough for the video Now that my video is getting old, the video technology is obsolete and I am beginning to fear that I will not be able to enjoy the pleasures of this movie any longer. <br /> <br /> As an animal movie, it's a great movie. As a film about the relationship between man and nature, it transcends anything that has been projected before or since. How can the film industry allow such a classic to go unnoticed and forgotten? If a pressure group or pressure group exists to lobby for the re-release of this film, count on me and send me the details without waiting. <br /> <br /> I imagine it's a currency to be made by anyone who can re-publish it on the current market.
