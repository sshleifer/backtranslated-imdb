In The Line Of Fire, an In-Line Of Fire assassination thriller from Day Of The Jackal, adds that Eastwood's old-fashioned bodyguard, Frank Horrigan, is troubled by past failures. The prosecution becomes personal while Leary, the reptilian murderer of John Malkovich, the mock of this neurosis - with the rather awkward exception of the love of a good woman (Lilly Raines of Russo), nothing will reassure him that of Take Leary personally> <br /> Malkovich is a volatile presence - not just combustible on screen but often also a changing actor. It's one of his good movies, centered and playing the game of director Petersen. Eastwood is too old, but a) the audience does not care, because it is him and b) his age is written in the script, not only in the story, but also as a recurring joke. Pretty much as you can imagine, but well managed. 7/10
