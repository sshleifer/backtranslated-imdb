The sweet and awesome film seems to have been neglected as a triviality ... and to be fair, the story is a little thin and light like drama ... but I feel the simple wonder and joy of the scenes describing the first impact A new art on an extraterrestrial and skeptical society has a brilliance and a naturalness that capture better than any film over the years the romance between cinema and public. The immensely nice performance of Jared Harriss (who seems to have inherited all the charisma of his father ... fortunately without the inclination of Richards for hell and haminess) ... and the charming sweetness of the shifted Yu Xia combine to make a real comfort. Radiant shots (including scenes of dazzling beauty on the Great Wall) and the delicate direction of Ann Hu give the film an extra impact. In short, a must for all those who have always been enchanted by a shadow that turned into life ... and that was magic in the dark.
