I saw this film at the viewer and it's the best movie I've seen for a long time. I liked it!!!! James Franco is so exciting and he and Sienna Miller are the perfect couple. I do not want to reveal what's going on, but they play a pair of honeymooners who go on honeymoon in Niagara Falls and things go pretty wild along the way ... The movie is really funny, sad and original. I can not even say what it reminded me, but go see it! I cried so much but I really loved it and want to see it again as soon as it comes out! My friends cried too. I hope it will be released soon - does anyone know when? I would really go see him if I were you
