Dashing Errol Flynn brings his usual talent for drama into this historically imperfect but entertaining film of the life of George Armstrong Custer. The dashing and jolly Flynn describes Custer from his stint at West Point as a reckless and reckless cadet, throughout the Civil War, in an extraordinarily generous and partisan story interpretation, and finally as an unpopular Indian fighter excused as a sacrifice by Custer of his command as a means of denouncing the corruption of government agents and post-merchants as well as protesting the unfair treatment of the Plains Indians. Olivia de Havilland, the co-star of Flynn in several other films, marks for Libby Bacon, adorable and devoted, and Anthony Quinn for the role of the formidable Sioux chef Crazy Horse. The battle scenes of the film are excellent. The battles of the civil war are brief and presented in the form of several vignettes in which Custer, apparently supported by a handful of soldiers, hammers the Confederate army. The last fight of Custer against the Indians is a grandiose spectacle, a wild confrontation between red and white men, without any quarter given in a wild mixture of military power between determined combatants. The good direction, cinematography, casting and wonderful music of Max Steiner make this film a Hollywood classic.
