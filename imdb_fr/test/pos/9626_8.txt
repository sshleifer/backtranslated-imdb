I saw Five Fingers at the Drive-In in ... what, 1973, 1974? It was the first Kung Fu movie I have ever seen and I was greatly entertained. I recently bought it on DVD and watched it again. I also had a lot of fun the second time. I think it's probably the one on which most Kung Fu movies are modeled. Rival schools, different styles, revenge, "white hat", good guys and "black hat". They even added the Japanese styles (VERY bad guys) of karate and judo. I remember being amused by the dubbing dialogue, in the sense of "Hey you! You are a very bad guy!" and "They should not get away with it! I'll try this bad crowd!" This time it was not so entertaining, I guess I'm used to it. If you have the slightest appreciation of this kind, you should see it.
