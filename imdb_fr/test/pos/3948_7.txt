One of the most intriguing aspects of this historical drama is the way in which "conservatives" or Anglo-American loyalists are portrayed, and the kind of luster that bears witness to their ardent support for King George III. In many ways, the American Revolution was definitely a family affair, in the sense that some of the richest colonial families were divided. If there is a strong criticism to make of this film, it is because maybe the characters of this story are designed to be a little nicer than they were in real life. <br /> <br /> In some respects, the actions of Major Boulton's character, played by Cornel Wilde, make him the least sympathetic member of the cast and the flaw in the screenplay. He seems to be going from a piquant patriot type to a type of "all for the cause". This film focuses mainly on the notions of personal honor and personal prestige that were a major social "norm" at that time. <br /> <br /> In its subtext, the fact that about 25% of the colonial population was decidedly pro-British is also ignored. But the strength of the Tory element is not obviously decried, even if the good character of doctor is about eighty-five percent of the upper classes (to steal a beautiful phrase from the film Flying Circus Monty Python). Anne Francis does a lot with some of the film pretty fine, and she stands out. She was a good choice for the woman with divided loyalties, a "girl" a little more modern than today's social conventions would have allowed - if there had not been a struggle for life or the death. <br /> <br /> One of the positive aspects of the film is how the rivalries of American revolutionary leaders degenerated into veritable jealousies and the way in which these personal conflicts almost sabotaged the revolutionary effort as a whole. Overall, the main characters are very well drawn, the minor characters are not just human "props" and the fight scenes are credible enough to carry the dramatic action. <br /> <br /> It's a great spy movie. It's not really a historical drama, but it's enough to satisfy it. He attributes a score of seven in large part to the fact that Cornel Wilde is so deeply immersed in his role and does it so well, and that Anne Francis makes the most of his support. <br /> <br /> The color printing used in Turner Classic Movies was very clear too, so it's a nice presentation in this respect. <br /> <br /> Hope this will happen again soon.
