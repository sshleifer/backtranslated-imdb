Sherlock Holmes (Basil Rathbone) and Professor Moriarty (Lionel Atwill) embark on a battle of wits to take control of the latest bomb of the Swiss inventor. Holmes wants to protect him for the British, while Moriarty does not intend to sell to the Nazis. <br /> <br /> Even though many fans will no doubt be disappointed to see Holmes updated to the 1940s war scenario, this particular movie is proving to be a light-hearted pleasure that will not wallow in war propaganda as he could have done. Dennis Hoey's inspector, Lestrade, and Dr. Watson by Nigel Bruce, tend to steal the show, as their disturbing character routinely offers delightful comedic relief. The fight between Holmes and Moriraty is colorful and well thought out. Atwill does quite well as Moriarty although he is not as memorable as some of the others who played the role. <br /> <br /> Although it does not bring anything particularly new and exciting to the fans of the series, it's a wonderful escape from reality, a bit appropriate for 1942 in my opinion, which reflects many adventures of film series in the 1930s and 1940s, but claims a more compact, less repetitive plot. And all of this is done while staying true to the fundamental spirit of Sherlock Holmes.
