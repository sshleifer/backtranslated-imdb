So begins "One Crazy Summer", the evil twin of "Better off dead ..". How can a film be bad when the first lines are sung by David Lee Roth? <br /> <br /> This film is a total explosion. Pair John Cusack with Curtis Armstrong again, but this time, adding Bobcat Goldwaith to this mix gives fantastic and fun results. Hyperactive Bobcat kills everyone's nerves, Curtis "Ak Ak" is the son of a military man disturbed by pacifist tendencies, and Demi Moore (with natural breasts ... wow!) As Cusack's love interest, once again depressed chronically. . <br /> <br /> The story is pretty simple. The laughs are there, but Savage Steve Holland's two films have some quality ... they're funny, but they're also nice. The scene where Curtis finds an inflated doll on the target beach and begins to meditate that a little girl will not be able to sleep is stupid, funny and touching. The animation used is pretty surreal. "The Boat" is hysterical (with Watsamatta U. sail and the stuffed doll Odie). Overall, a fun movie, but not as good as "Better to die ..."
