A beautiful woman, a woodsman, a monster inbred, a super-sweet monster truck, a zombie brother who kills the road and 2 friends ... a retentive anal anal and too sensitive and the other a slob in adolescence messy. Throw them all together with a pinch of Jeepers Creepers, Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Road Trip, and you have Monster Man. A hilarious comedy of horror / comedy that is never meant to "say anything". It's a simple and direct laughter festival. Unpretentious and well done, this horror / comedy is at the heart, a movie boyfriend. This film was hilarious and disgusting. I highly recommend this to scare away fans looking to be entertained.
