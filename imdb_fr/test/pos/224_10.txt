I still count "Police Squad!" like the absolute funniest television show of the 1980s. Somehow, on BetaMax no less, I have all six episodes. I knew that such a good show would not last and that I had to keep it myself. How was ABC silly? They reportedly said that viewers did not know that "the police squad!" It was a comedy because there was no way to laugh! Right! When Drebin has a phrase like, "You take risks, but you get up in the morning, go to work or you trust in your face.", How can this be a comedy!?!? I have seen each episode at least ten times and I always see something new that I had missed before. Even the deepest circles always have gags. Do not miss it if you're lucky enough to see an episode, but if you're reading this, you probably already have copies like me.
