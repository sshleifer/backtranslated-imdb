My first meeting with Japanese animation director Hayao Miyazaki and his production company Studio Ghibli goes back to the release of an English dubbed version of Spirited Away, released about 7 years ago. What a wonderfully creative and unique cinematic experience! So, on that note, I managed to get my friend employed in the movie theater to see this new Miyazaki movie with me, especially since he loves all that is Disney (the American distributor of this movie ). Again, all I can say is "Wow!" What impressive visuals of how water is described as an ocean ... and what about the transformation of the main character of a goldfish into ... and seeing how the behavior of certain characters changes? ... and, well, watch this movie if you want to know what I'm talking about. Oh, and the voices used for this American dubbed version: Tina Fey, Betty White, Liam Neeson, Cloris Leachman and Lily Tomlin. Good choice to all. Does everything make sense? No, but it's part of the childish charm that permeates everyone. There are many fun scenes about Ponyo and the boy and many other people they meet. Oh, I think I wrote too much, so I highly recommend Hayao Miyazaki's Ponyo.
