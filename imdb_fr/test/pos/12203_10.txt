An innovative new show with excellent distribution that keeps you on the edge of your seat. Bell Lake is wonderful..it is a pity that its other show "Miss Match" has been canceled. I'm just glad she came back on "Surface". I am looking forward to the return of "Surface". This show is really something unique to watch. With a mysterious underwater world that resembles Jurassic Park, this show makes you wonder what's next. Nim is adorable even if he will turn into something bigger and more threatening. There are so many generic series that seem to return to the same topics. When something like "Surface" happens, just say "THANK YOU!"
