Just to clarify, Matthew Poncelet was not a real person, but a combination of 2 killers who were sentenced and sentenced to death for the murder of two teenagers. <br /> <br /> I read the user's comments and they react as if Matthew was real. The character is based on a mix of two assassins, Elmo Patrick Sonnier and Robert Lee Willie (who murdered separate people) and the murder itself was based on the one Willie had committed. Willie's conflict with someone else's presence and with both parties swearing down the murder is also taken into account in the story. <br /> <br /> Prejean's approach is unique in that it not only serves convicts awaiting their death and helps them to take responsibility for their actions, it also reaches out to families of victims to help them know that the convict really felt remorse for what they actually helped both parties. <br /> <br /> Everyone writing here seems to have strong beliefs about the death penalty. It is not for me to say that it is good or bad in theory: to punish the death of a death has a karmic meaning, even though it deprives a person of his freedom for the rest of his life, although expensive, makes more sense for me to be stuck in a small room 23/7 (with one hour of exercise) for the rest of their days to remind the cruel thing that they seemed to be a more appropriate punishment: they are technically alive, but they deny living. Suppose someone kills someone so that he can avoid the responsibility (like Susan Smith, killing his poor children by pushing his car into a lake). I find it quite ironic not to get that "freedom" they want and to spend the rest of their lives in jail. <br /> <br /> Prejean's point sums up the story very well. She has all my respect - she manages to find that balance - she does not support a killer, she guides them to accept what they did. If they did not feel any kind of remorse, they would not ask for spiritual guidance. <br /> <br /> On final note, when Poncelet apologizes to Delacroix's parent for killing his son, the parents of the girl who was also murdered mumbles something about why he did not is not excused for his death. I think the fact was that throughout the movie, Poncelet denied killing both children. There are doubts in Prejean's mind, he committed both murders - a friend was sentenced but not to death - I think Poncelet killed the boy Delacroix and the other man murdered the girl - c That's why Poncelet assumed responsibility for what he had done. If he had been responsible for the girl's death, he would probably have apologized.
