As a teenager, I watched this movie every time he was on TV (and it was MUCH YET) because of his witty and attractive humor for teens. This may not be what critics consider a 4-star hotel, but I love what it is: a fun comedy designed to please the public. Teen actors represent my generation (probably why I love the movie so much) and looked like a fantastic cast of everyone's favorite shows in the early 90's - Full House, Family Matters, Fresh Prince - all shows were represented. and the result was probably the best teen movie of the 90s. Although this may not include the high doses of nudity and violence that many teen film writers deem essential to youth success (or perhaps because of its absence), I highly recommend it to pre-teens and teens around the world.
