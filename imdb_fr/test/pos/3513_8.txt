It's been almost 25 years since I waited for this horror thriller hard to find, which I finally did since its rebirth on DVD. Of course, it did not have the same impact on me as if I had seen the 80's, but director Lieberman (his film "Squirm" is excellent) makes good use of the beautiful Oregon region and take the time to develop the characters, not just to send them creatively. On a positive note, Brad Fiedel's whistling music is really scary and adds to the sorry procedure, which makes this moment very entertaining for genre fans. To see if you like underrated horror movies. Describe it would be an "intelligent Friday 13th" dotted with delicious pieces of "Deliverance". Other than that, there are really cool and original moments like my favorite when a couple is swimming in a lake and the guy disappears underwater to play a trick on his daughter. and ... honestly, I can not spoil it - just look for yourself. In addition, the end is just one of those you just have to see to believe ?? he's out of nowhere and it's weird and wild! The DVD includes comments from Lieberman.
