As already noted, the short film "Every Sunday" (1936) could be considered as the first video clip. It was a happy accident resulting from MGM's need to produce a series of short films for an exhibition with its feature film. They had two young singing talents (Judy Garland and Deanna Durbin) at their disposal and basically blended a mix of music styles into a kind of Norman Rockwell concert in a park. <br /> <br /> Who would have dreamed of capturing the best collection of images from the sequence "Odessa Steps" of Eisenstein. <br /> <br /> It's Sunday with unaware people sitting around a wooden seashell in the park, while Strauss plays with a tired set. The events take place and the following Sunday, Judy and Deanna save the day. The opera Deanna sings "Il Bacio" (The kiss) and Garland follows with the contrast "Waltz with a swing". The highlight nicely mixes the two styles in a duet of "Americana". <br /> <br /> To see absolutely. <br /> <br /> And then, what do I know? I am only a child.
