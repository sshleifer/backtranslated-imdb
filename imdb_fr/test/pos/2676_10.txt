this show is the best it is full of laughs and Kevin James is the best so if you want a good show I recommend the King of Queens and his disappointment that they canceled so that in the end this show will make you forget your worries and problems because if you have a cast with Kevin James and Jerry Stiller, you can not go wrong. so I do not know why canceling the show if anyone knows please tell me now. Today, you will not find many programs that meet your needs as an audience. pause and if it stops I do not know what to do. in the end, if I had to recommend a show, it would be the king of queens.
