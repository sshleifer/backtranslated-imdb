The songs are fantastic and the story is good. Like many other acting schools, mine has also produced HAIR. For most hair, it's a golden opportunity to do the nude, but my production was fully dressed ... I do not think that frontal nudity in a film or a play guarantees an artistic quality ... And the creators of the film too. The version of the film is great, classic successes succeeding while leaving the plot to develop until its peak. A large cast of actors, dancers and singers.
