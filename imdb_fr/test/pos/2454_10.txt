I have never heard of this film and I only have it because I am a fan of Martin Sheen. Now, I am stunned by the reason why he has not received the praise and recognition that he really deserves. The four characters do everything for you to feel their emotions, the father trying to assert his authority, the mother still clinging to traditional family values ​​and both trying to preserve appearances despite the total fragmentation of their family, the girl wanting his own life and the son. haunted by his experiences in Vietnam. One of them said it was a scenario that should have been played out in thousands of "ordinary" families after Vietnam. Emilio Estevez as Jeremy was superb - totally disturbed by his wartime experience that no family member could relate to. The chemistry of the screen between him and his father, Martin Sheen, was incredible. And there were times when Emilio's anxious face looked so much like Martin's in "Apocalypse Now". I'm sure that just as Martin considered Apocalype one of his best films, Emilio will count it as one of his best. The scene with the rifle was totally hallucinating, all the emotions were present on the face of the family. Bright acting by Estevez, Sheen and Kathy Bates. I watched the film for the first time last night - and today, the main story in the news was about a gulf war veteran who shot several members of his family. How many young men will see their lives destroyed by war?
