In 1957, Edge of the City, directed by Martin Ritt, starring John Cassavetes, Sidney Poitier, Jack Warden and Ruby Dee. This is the story of a troubled man, Axel, with a mysterious past that unfolds little by little during the film. He has a relationship that allows him to find a job on a loading dock for Charlie (Jack Warden), a real villain who takes bribes from his workers and drives them hard. Charlie has an intense dislike for a black man, T.T. (Poitier) who occupies the same position. T.T. invites Axel to join his team. Axel challenges Charlie and does it. Axel finds housing and socializes with T. T., his wife (Dee) and the white teacher of their son (Kathleen McGuire). When the tragedy strikes, none of the men on the loading dock will speak to the police. Axel must understand his values, his values ​​and his sense of friendship. <br /> <br /> That's all. a really good black and white film that is curiously not really about being black or white! It's really about the limits you have and who you are. Charlie is a bigot and hates that a black man has a good position on the platform. T.T. teases Charlie and gives his best. There is no question that T.T. and Axel spend time together or that the son of T.T. has a white teacher with whom the family also has social relations. What Axel, a loner, finds difficult is to accept any friendship or to confide in anyone - that's what he learns through TT <br /> <br /> Poitier shines absolutely in "Edge of the City" - he is warm, energetic, affectionate and intelligent, a man with real enthusiasm for life, not afraid of anything. Cassavetes is excellent and plays a totally opposite character - hiding in the shadows, chronically depressed and always nervous. <br /> <br /> The film leaves open what happens to Axel. Anyway, he is now a different man. <br /> <br /> Strangely underrated and unknown film, perhaps in the shadow of many angry young men's movies that came out at that time.
