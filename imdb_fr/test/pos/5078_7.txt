In this day and age, when almost every story involves waterboarding, images of Abu Ghraib or stories of forced detention at Guantanamo Bay, Gavin Hood's "Rendition" is both timely and timely. go out of traditional Hollywood entertainment plants. It is certainly not a perfect film, but it does not deserve the opprobrium of cataract that it has received from the hands of critics from all ideological and political horizons. <br /> <br /> The term "rendition" refers to the ability of the CIA to arrest anyone suspected of having participated in terrorist activities and then to secretly transport them to a foreign country for questioning. and torturing her for an indefinite period, all without legal process Anwar El-Ibrahimi is an Egyptian living for twenty years in the US He has an American wife, a young son and a new baby en route. very unlikely candidate for a terrorist, but one day, without warning or explanation, Anwar is arrested and taken to an undisclosed location where he is subjected to brutal torture until he recognizes his involvement in a terrorist organization that He claims to know nothing, by the way. <br /> <br /> On the negative side, "Rendition" sometimes wobbles in its narrative abilities, often biting a bit more than it can chew at once in terms of in trigue and character Douglas Freeman, a CIA recruit agent, is called to witness Anwar's "interrogation" by the Egyptian authorities. The problem is that, as conceived by writer Kelley Sane and played by Jake Gyllenhaal, Freeman seems too much of a naive "scout" to make himself a very plausible agent, and he does not have the screen time he needs to develop fully as a character. We know little about him at the beginning and even less, it seems, at the end. He "goes through the motions", but we learn little precious things about the inner man. Thus, without a powerful center of gravity, the film sometimes has the impression of crumbling, the elements of history flying in all directions. A similar problem occurs with Anwar's anxious wife, portrayed by Reese Witherspoon, a woman we never know much about, except what we can see on the surface. Gyllenhaal and Witherspoon have shown themselves to be excellent actors in other circumstances, but here they are surrounded by a restrictive scenario that rarely allows them to go beyond a single recurring note in their performances. <br /> <br /> What makes "Rendition" is an ultimately powerful film, but it is about the extreme gravity of the subject treated and how two intrigues at the same time mingle with elegance in the last part of the movie. It could make a story a bit more artificial than we might have liked about it, but hey, it's Hollywood after all, and the film must do some deference to mass audience expectations if it wants to to be seen in the green, let alone see the light of day as a completed project. <br /> <br /> Two of the secondary performances are particularly convincing in the film: Omar Metwally makes palpable the terror of a man caught in a Kafkaesque nightmare that he can not wake up, and Yigal Naor who makes interrogator / chief torturer a character of surprising complexity. Meryl Streep, Alan Arkin and Peter Sarsgaard also stand out in smaller roles. A special mention must also be made to the warm cinematography and rich colors of Dion Beebe. <br /> <br /> Does the film simplify the problems to the extreme? Probably. Does this worsen in favor of the victim of torture and against the evil government forces? Certainly. (One wonders how the film would have played if Anwar was really a terrorist). Yet the film has the courage to walk on controversial ground. He is not afraid to ask foolish questions or risk the disapproval of some for the political positions he adopts. He is openly questioning how a nation sticks to its hard-won principle of "civil liberties for all" in the face of terrorism and fear. And how brave is it that people of good will finally stand up and say "enough is enough", even at the risk of being considered as soothing and unpatriotic by power? (The film does not in any way deny the reality of extreme Islamic terrorism.) Thus, rejecting "Rendition" by right would let the perfect be the enemy of good. The "rendering" may not be perfect, but it is good, and it has something important to say about the world we live in now. And that alone makes it very interesting to see.
