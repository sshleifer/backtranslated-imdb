I saw Two Hands in Sydney a few years ago and this film immediately became one of my favorite movies. There is action, adventure, comedy and romance at the same time (and a little zen for good measure). Like many Australian films, the plot is easy to follow and wonderfully engaging. Jordan should be proud of his work. <br /> <br /> The favorite comedy scenes not only from this movie, but from any other movie were cut out! So, if you watch this movie, make sure it's the original version.
