I must say that I know the documentaries of Mister Ã–rnek and I knew that I would receive a film documentary very well done. I was not deceived. As a history story, I've seen hundreds of documentaries and enjoyed the different approach of this work. <br /> <br /> The director and his 17 consultants (historians, veterans' families) tried to access the reality of the Gallipoli through weld letters on both sides. So, the story is followed by British, Australian and Turkish soldiers. <br /> <br /> This documentary by Jeremy Irons and Sam Neill is told. They both reinforce the intensity and emotionality of this documentary by their great voices. <Br/> <br /> I saw this movie in an Italian cinema in Dolby Surround. I bought the DVD last year and I will wait another 3-7 years for the next work of this talented director and his very good documentaries. <br /> <br /> Summary: Well done. Intense. Story with emotions - wrapped in a war documentary with great narrators
