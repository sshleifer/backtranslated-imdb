The eighth, and therefore the penultimate shorts of Animatrix, is the only one of its kind. This takes two of the main types of filmed entertainment inspirations from The Matrix, and combines them incredibly well. It is immensely faithful to the trilogy in this aspect, the tone. The animation is a magnificent animated breathtaking. The style, omnipresent in this respect, is Black. The plot is appropriate, and the story, as well as the music, is perfect. The sound in general is fantastic and really helps to consolidate atmosphere and atmosphere, as well as drawings and drawings. The dubbing is impeccable. It is one of only two where the characters of the film take back their roles, and Anne-Moss, which is the only one to appear there. This is one of the best of the nine, and also one of my personal favorites. It's about ten minutes. The rhythm is perfect. It never slows down too much, but it's not overwhelming either. The end could not have been more appropriate for that. This film tells a story of nine and a half minutes with Kid's Story. It is well made and informative. I highly recommend it to all fans of the universe and the two genres that compose it. 8/10
