It is not only difficult to comment separately on the three parts of Kieslowski's trilogy, it seems obvious that the filmmaker wants us to do exactly the opposite: look at them in order, Blue, White and Red, and consider together as a complete work. . It is true that they are distinct stories with distinct themes: freedom, equality, fraternity, and each of them is developed with unique applications of intrigue and art. They are all worth seeing independently, but I think they are best seen as one and the same. Collectively, I would call the trilogy 9; separately, I put them in my top 10 for the years 1993 and 1994. <br /> <br /> The red color is most memorable in the third film as a backdrop in an advertisement whose streamlined model is one of the three main characters of the film. The other two characters achieve double recognition with varying degrees of recognition when they first arrive on the ad. They are larger than life at the intersection of intersections. This advertisement is not a major part of the plot of this film, but its image becomes striking and this is one of the reasons why I called Red a "hallucinating" film. This is the third of Kieslowski's Three Colors trilogy, based on the blue-white-red French flag and the three parts of its motto, "Freedom, Equality, Fraternity". The films remain mainly focused on these themes, respecting the basic levels of one, two or three main characters. However, the complexity of the plot gets worse as the three principles evolve from fundamentally personal (Liberty, Blue) to relational (Equality). , White) to social (fraternity, red). Red is my favorite of these movies, and I give it a 9. It looks like a great movie, but you have to see Blue and White first for maximum effect.
