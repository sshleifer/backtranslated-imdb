I loved the movie "Eddie Monroe". The movie had all the components that kept me interested while watching. I particularly liked the twists of the plot and its surprising end. Craig Morris has Brad Pitt's potential in both appearance and talent. His blue eyes reminded me of Paul Newman's. Fred Carpenter took this film to another level. I loved the casting. The score, the cinematography, the talent, the places and the scenario were great. I loved seeing some of my favorite actors in Eddie Monroe. Fred Carpenter is an incredibly talented and talented director. He gives his work to 200%. The film has a great texture. I hope there will be an Eddie Monroe 2. I would like to see how Nicolette will behave after having had his manna of money. Fred Carpenter's Eddie Monroe is Hollywood level.
