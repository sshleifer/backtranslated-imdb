I watched this on HBO because he won the Oscar a week earlier. It compares favorably with fictional dramas. <br /> <br /> The story is that of a 15-year-old black child who is being tried for the murder of an elderly white woman based in Jacksonville, Florida, almost solely on the husband of the victim and on an admission that the defense claims to have been forced. <br /> <br /> About half of the film is devoted to the trial; it is complemented by images of defense lawyers (two public defenders) explaining their case, interviewing witnesses and visiting key locations. This is edited with a minimum of unnecessary repetition and placed in a logical order. The camera work is pretty solid. And there is a slightly surprising epilogue.
