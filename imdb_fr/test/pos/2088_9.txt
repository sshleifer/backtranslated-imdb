I watched "9 souls" at the 12th Athens International Film Festival (September 2006), where director Toshiaki Toyoda was also present and answered many questions from the audience. This road movie is about 9 fugitives, all very different from each other. They decide to stay together while traveling with their red van across Japan. Every time the van stops, we see these 9 fugitives trying to escape their past to rebuild a life or make a dream come true. However, regardless of their efforts, this seems impossible and their violent past pursues them and leads them to their final destruction. <br /> <br /> Although it is very pessimistic, it is not a dark movie. On the contrary, it is full of beautiful images, surreal elements and elegant humor. Toyoda's heroes can not escape their "prison" and are punishable by divine punishment (?) For their "crimes". These are small pieces of a beautiful painting where the tower of Tokyo is represented by a huge inverted knife!
