<br /> <br /> This film presents some really impressive action scenes. The humor and the action are well melted, although the intensity of the film does not stay until the end. The last scene is a slight anti-climax in terms of quality of action and a surprising explosiveness of the scenes that precede it. Humor does not seem to be as ridiculously awkward as in many other Hong Kong films, and this film is of a totally different class from most American action comedies in recent years. Lau Ching-Wan is a typical intuitive police hero who makes fun of the invalid orders of incompetent superiors of the police. The dialectic of the film is built on the superhuman freshness and cruelty of the drug gang, humiliating police forces while providing a serious dose of lead poisoning with various machine guns. Leaving a lot of corpses in his wake. Yu Rong-Guang is particularly impressive as an ultra cool and ruthless gangster in this action resembling that of Woo, where the tough guys are really hard and fast.
