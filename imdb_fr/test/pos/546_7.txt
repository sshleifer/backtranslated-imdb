This film is about a happy single mother who is happy, to the point that she is almost irresponsible, and her sensible teenage daughter with teenage troubles. <br /> <br /> "Anywhere But Here" is an engaging movie from start to finish. Ann and Adele are well described from the beginning. So we know how different their personality is. Clashes inevitably ensue and are presented in an engaging manner. I find myself so attracted by their state of mind and their circumstances. it's like living their life, feeling what they felt. <br /> <br /> Susan Sarandon gives another great performance in "Anywhere But Here". She is charismatic, happy, lucky, hedonist, warm and loving at the same time. I have always loved Susan Sarandon and I think she is greatly underrated. <br /> <br /> "Anywhere But Here" is a captivating and emotional journey.
