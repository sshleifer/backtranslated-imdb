I can only agree with many observers that Traffik is one of the most memorable dramas ever made for television. I saw Traffik on TV and I just watched him again. I am particularly touched by Tim Souster's haunting original music, and in particular by the painful accents of Dmitri Chostakovich's Symphony of Cello in C minor (the music accompanying the credits and parts of the film). The music intensifies the desperation of the characters as they pursue their sad destiny. The music is powerfully emotional. This arrangement combines two of the movements of the symphony, but I recommend listening to the symphony itself.
