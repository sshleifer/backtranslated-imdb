Brown returned to his role from the previous year (in "Slaughter") for this rough tracking movie. In the original, he had avenged the murder of his parents by eliminating a huge organization from the crowd in Mexico. Here, it is he who is pursued (retaliation) by a money launderer described by McMahon. When the first assassination attempt fails, Brown is back in action, kicking gangsters to try to protect his new girlfriend, Hendry. While the original film was generally better and more consistent, it presents all aspects of the exploitation at much higher doses, which makes it more enjoyable for fans of the genre. Apart from a rather sad opening on horseback and a deadly car at night, a street in the city, this film is filmed at a very fast pace. Every few minutes, one or more of the following problems appear: drug use, sex, nudity, pistol shooting, murder or other. Brown is his usual reliable and lovable man, helped by his amazing physical presence that masks all rigidity in his acting. McMahon is a riot! With his tinted glasses and his hair cut in two (!), He shows orders to his band of thugs and hears surprise his love for his fur bimbo. Seeing Johnny Carson's boyfriend in a role like this is a perverse sensation. Stroud gives the impression of being an intense, racist hit-hit, while Peters just adds a hint of class as an honest police detective who asks Brown for help. Unfortunately, no mention is made of the original acolytes of Brown, Don Gordon and Stella Stevens. Suddenly, Brown now has a girlfriend (Hendry) who is kind enough, but lacks the voluptuousness and personality that Stevens had before. Williams takes a scandalous turn as a pimp who can apparently search any girl in a bar and make her an instant member of her harem. Cinematography and general direction are less neat than in the first film, but it has a motivation and a sense of danger that exceed the sensations of the original. The film spends a lot of time in the wastewater of organized crime, drugs, prostitution and other vices, but it keeps the interest thanks to the creativity of its action scenes and the now blatant lack of politically correct. A strange remark: a key actor in the first film was shown being shot, but appears here in a different role.
