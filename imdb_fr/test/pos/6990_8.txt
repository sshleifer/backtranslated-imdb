It was a good movie and the rest should know our socks !!! The action will be ongoing and I just bought the special DVD edition with animated background story similar to that of Animatrix. This will put Vin Diesel back in the limelight and give it the coveted role in Spider Man 3 as Venom. It would be the most logical choice for the role. Back in PB, this movie, even though it's an independent thriller, has a great story and characters with backgrounds that make you want to know more. If they made books or comic books, that would be a good read. There was one thing I felt a little below. The end needs some work, but not all films will have the best end.
