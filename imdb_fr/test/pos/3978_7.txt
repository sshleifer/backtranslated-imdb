A good film. The movie was even better than the commercials. And believe it or not, it was very inspiring. I really think that everyone who comes out of the movie at the end will be inspired in one way or another. <br /> <br /> It was a bit cheesy at the beginning, but resumed quickly. I laughed. I laughed hard on some parts. The acting is fundamentally above average, nothing special, but better than average. I can say without fear that this is the second funniest film to be released this summer (the first funny being CLERKS II). So after all that, I give it a 7/10 (a high seven, but not quite an eight).
