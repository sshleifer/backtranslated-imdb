Maybe not Miyazaki's best work, but I could not help but love him to death. A five-year-old boy finds what he thinks is a goldfish stuck in a bottle. He saves his life and keeps it in a bucket as a pet, but it's really a magical being, the daughter of a human sorcerer and a goddess of the sea. Ponyo, as the boy calls him, is brought back to the sea by her father, who tries to dissuade her from returning to the mainland and becoming human, but she enters her magic elixirs and does what she wants. The story is simple and cute. But the film really comes to life, it's in his great work of art. The drawings are more childish than in any of Miyazaki's other works, but there is beauty in its simplicity. As in all his films, Miyazaki creates this world of imagination that I was so impressed. Seeing her at the theater reminded me of memories of what it was when the opening notes of Jo Hisaishi's score for Princess Mononoke overwhelmed me and gave me goosebumps there was barely a decade (the score is just as wonderful). I wanted to live in this world and never leave it.
