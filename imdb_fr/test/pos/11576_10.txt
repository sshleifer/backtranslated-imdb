Once again, Almenábar provided us with a film of superior quality. This director is incredible, and he proved that he was equally talented and effective when he crossed the genre. <br /> <br /> The excellent development of the character in the film, through dialogues and personality quirks, but also with more subtle details (the look of Ramon's father), allows the audience to to identify very closely with the protagonists, the emotional impact of the events that take place all the more deeply. The visuals are sometimes simple, sometimes breathtaking (the dream of the beach), and I think that the films of Almenábar really benefit from the fact that he also composes the music: it perfectly matches the different atmospheres of the film. <br /> <br /> More than a film about euthanasia, which is in itself an important question, this film deals with the duality of a man who sometimes seems to really appreciate life (even if only to a limited extent), and yet who will stop at nothing. his desire to die. The overwhelming sadness of this film is punctuated with well chosen humor, which seems all the more amusing because they offer a welcome respite from the melancholy that you will certainly feel. <br /> Although you are clearly in favor of euthanasia, this film does a great job and represents the myriad of points of view of Ramon's friends and family. The most moving was Ramon's father, when he said, shot down: "There is only one thing worse than losing a child, let the child want to die." <br /> <br /> Excellent writing, performance, direction, direction, cinematography, music - 10/10.
