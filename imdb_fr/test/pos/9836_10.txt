This show is an ideal show for adults and children who wish to sit together and watch. The stories are a little slow for adults but they are always good. There are many children in my family, boys and girls, and it's hard to get them to agree on what to look at, but they always agree when they want to watch the Mystic Knights. It's a beautiful show and I hope they will continue to do it. All the kids in my family and I think Vincent Walsh is the best of all. We have seen that he has done a lot of other work and thinks he is doing a great job. We wish the best of luck to all actors, actresses, writers, directors and producers. We just want to say: keep up the good work.
