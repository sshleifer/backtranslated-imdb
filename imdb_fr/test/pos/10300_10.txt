On the outside, this film is better because of Vincent D'Onofrio (Law & Order: Criminal Intent), but this film is as good as the 1982 version. In some respects, the 1999 version is better because it is more modern (a decade compared to 27 years). The actors in this movie were great, like Terry Kinney (McManus of "Oz" of HBO), James Daly and Tony Shalhoub. (US Monk) and Gary Sinise (CSI: NY). Obviously, the dialogue has been modified for the contemporary public, but most of the writing has remained unchanged. Some versions of the 1982 version did not stimulate it. and the comedy, but in the end, this film was just as great as that of 1982. As for the character: Vincent D'onofrio in Phil Romano was excellent, better than Paul Sorvino. It's a match-up between Stacy Keach and Terry Kinney. from James. As for George, I would like to rent Shalhoub. And between Martin Sheen & Sinsise in the role of Tom, I would say that Sinise wins.
