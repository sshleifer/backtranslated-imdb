Whoever plays J. Douglas Williamson in the strip poker scene does a great job. He apparently did not receive any credit. Pity. <br /> <br /> All Dead End Kids are doing their job perfectly in this 1939 entry. It's strange to look at them in a Western setting with their Brooklyn accents (I guess it should be Bowery). They even show some swimmer abilities. <br /> <br /> I think there are many special scenes that can stay with the viewer of this boxing / love / crime story. My favorite right now is in the fight scene towards the end of the movie. Busby Berkeley shows his dance-film expertise when John Garfield shifts his feet and when we look at this movement, the camera rises to the height of his face. I will not give why or when, but the look he was wearing at that time probably led the audience of 1939 to stand in the theaters. <br /> <br /> Some people will think that John Garfield looks a lot like Frank Sinatra in a lot of scenes. Just his face. In fact, Frank was not filming yet, so Frank might have looked like John. The boxer named Smith in the movie looks like a clone of Ed Begley, Jr. <br /> <br /> Now, I have to tell you something that is not a spoiler, but if you watch the movie, look Grandma's hands. May Robson does a good job. She seems to have hands that wander a little. In a scene where she and a crowd go into the boxer's box (John Garfield), watch where she touches the John Garfield tilt while carrying only her trunks. <br /> <br /> A beautiful ending. Many wonderful characters. <br /> <br /> The best line could be at the gas station, "... eight gallons, that's a dollar twenty-eight ..." Tom Willett
