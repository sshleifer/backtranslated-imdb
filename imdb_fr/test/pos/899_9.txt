I think this movie has it all. It's really cool music that I can never get out of my head. He has cool characters. IT'S REALLY funny (you know, the kind of people who will crack on the floor and keep on repeating the fun passages every day for three weeks). Despite the bad acting, the bad cgi and the bad story after a robot), it's really cool. It's one of those movies that you and your whole family can watch, get together, eat pizza, laugh like crazy and watch it twice more. <br /> <br /> There are so many fun things, like when Kurt was trying to catch Edison's attention and give him the finger, then threw him a paint gun to play the paint . On this part, I continued to say, "Remember, remember?" To my cousins ​​who saw them and showed them what had happened. There was also a really fun part when Edision came into the room and Kurt was there (just before they quarreled) and Kurt was talking about his "strange dream" and how he was "Superman". I loved this part, even though I have not seen it for a long time, so I do not remember it. All the actors said was funny, like how Kurt said, "I adore you, like a GOD!" to the robot. <br /> <br /> Although there were some negatives, it was a great movie. Dude, I can not help but laugh. I would like to have this movie. )
