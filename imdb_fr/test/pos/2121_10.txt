We went to the first Grand Champion session today (Dallas / Fort Worth, Austin, Snyder and some other Texas cities). There are so few kid-friendly movies ... but this one is, and it's great. Although the plot is a little "Hokey" (also the name of the direction in the film), it's a wonderful story for kids. And I liked it too. <br /> <br /> The movie is a good representation of the family life of the West Texas ranch, although it is a little exaggerated. Director / writer Barry Tubb should do it right since he grew up in this environment. He called the movie his "love letter to Texas". <br /> <br /> Joey Lauren Adams plays the single mother of Buddy (Jacob Fisher) and sister "Blow" (Emma Roberts). Watch Emma Roberts (niece of Julia Roberts); she is very good and I think she will be in more movies. Julia Roberts, Bruce Willis, musicians George Strait, Charlie Robison, Robert Earl Keen, Joe Ely and rodeo legends Larry Mahan and Tuff Hedeman are also on view. <br /> <br /> If you have young children or if you simply want to see a movie that feels good, check out "Grand Champion" when it comes to your city (supposedly later this month- this). You will enjoy it and you will feel good. <br /> <br /> As I come from West Texas, I may be a bit biased ... no, I'm impartial. The film is excellent!
