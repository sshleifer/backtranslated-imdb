a very good episode, but not as final as the end of season 1. The idea of ​​doing a Desmond flashback worked very well, and Henry Ian Cusick was fantastic, perhaps achieving the best performance of this series, but The only complaint I would make is that Michael's plot is very similar to a secondary plot and after three minutes, the previous episode, I thought he would have more. But the strength of Cusicks' character and performances won out. As always, the developments in the plot left more questions than answers, for example, who are the others, something we still do not know and where will they take Jack, Sawyer and Kate? What was the white light, what impact did it have? Locke, Eko and Desmond are dead? as the hatch destroyed around them. If they are, it would be a serious mistake, because these three characters are the most interesting and the series would suffer without them. Terry O'Quinn has been fantastic throughout both series like Locke. A final appropriate to a better series than the first.
