I saw this short film on HBO the other day and I loved it. Eight different characters, eight different perspectives. At first, I was confused by the way the story unfolded, but I realized that it was just a scene shown again and again, just to show us the different perspectives of the characters. <br /> <br /> At first, you think employees shout to the teen for stealing. They speak in their own language, which me (and Chris the teenager, played convincingly by Eleonore Hendricks) can not understand. The perspective of the clerks dissipates this view. I did not realize how wonderful the short film was before the last two scenes. <br /> <br /> Excellent short film. Let's hope that director James Cox will be able to transform short films into feature films with the same cast, or convince us with a brand new movie. <br /> <br />
