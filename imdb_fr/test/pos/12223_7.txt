I like the show, but do you come, writers, get moved! Stop dragging it again and again. You have a very good concept and it could be a lot more. Miles (Jenkins) is great and plays like a child of this age who should act in the situation he is in. Hey, be creative with creatures, they can have telepathic abilities or other extravagant powers. The young actors in the series are very good and convincing. Miles' parents seem to be a little too foolish about what's going on, but expand on this, come on! you have a great seed here and there may be a whole new twist for next season with a lot of new characters and creatures and all kinds of interesting science fiction stuff. If they can create a series on a witch, you should be able to create one on these creatures and these kids.
