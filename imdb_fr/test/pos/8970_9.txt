Here is a film that works almost well, with good performances from everyone, and three strong performances of Hanks, Seymour Hoffman, and a very good result of Julia Roberts who let me spell from the first seconds, this are performances that elevate the production to the stars and preserve it for the whole duration <br /> <br /> Apart from one or two very minor factual problems related to the scenario, the only thing that drops this film is the technical direction, there are far too many bad cuts (rigged continuity) and many the "cheat" camera that just does not work. It's surprising for a movie of this magnitude and a little annoying to watch, but it does not destroy a film otherwise beautifully designed.
