I would strongly disagree with the previous lame comment. I watched him do not expect too much. The fact is that the actors were superb, especially The Teen Female. The dark sides of them all went through, all were spoiled in a not-obvious way. There was an undercurrent that went through the film of teenage anxiety and sexuality. The role of a serial killer has been well played too, because you can feel that he has lived what they experienced in their childhood. What this movie is, is a strong drama / thriller. Yes, I agree that they do not make the obvious, but you can relate to the heads of disordered teenagers who did what they did and who is credible. Also a decent dark end, instead of what could have so easily been a happy opt out. The attention to detail in the film was also fantastic. I'm very good 7 out of 10. A little slow sometimes, but allows a person who thinks to see where the characters come from.
