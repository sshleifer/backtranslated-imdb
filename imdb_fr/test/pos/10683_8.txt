Fans of Gerry Anderson's productions will recognize several UFO actors and vehicles (after Doppelg채nger), as well as sound effects from various Anderson series. The excellent music of Barry Gray (mostly peculiar to this film) adds to the feeling of familiarity. For these reasons alone, I think all fans of Gerry Anderson would find that Doppelg채nger was worth it. <br /> <br /> Judged simply as a film, it must be said that Doppelg채nger is imperfect. We know that there were major problems during the production, and I suppose that's why there is a conspiracy thread taking a lot of time that ends abruptly and that seems to have no relevance for the rest of the story. Presumably, time and budget constraints have prevented the relevance from manifesting themselves! <br /> <br /> Disturbingly, the special effects range from excellent - better than any 60s movie I know - to a disappointing disappointment. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, even with these flaws, the main story of Doppelg채nger is well told and keeps the viewer (or at least, this viewer) engaged. The end may not be what one would expect from Anderson, but at the same time, it's typical of Anderson and it's quite appropriate. To know what I mean, you will have to look at it yourself. :)
