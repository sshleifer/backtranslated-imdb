It took me some time to find this movie because they do not have it on DVD yet (and my video recorder is not worth it anymore). I guess all SEO to drug use is too much for some people. But I found a decent bootleg on Ebay and I must say that anyone who takes this movie too seriously is just delayed. It's a parody of stick in the vein of "Plane". I must say that when I watched it grow in the '80s on Showtime or Spotlight, I enjoyed the humor a lot more than at the time. But it's really worth watching to see what they (ie the filmmakers) were able to understand before the hypocrites "Just Say No" unleash their propaganda. singing ... "We all use drugs" hahaha It's a silly movie worth the $ 10 I paid on Ebay to get it on DVD, but do not even think about comparing it to the original - it's just stupid. What are you raising?
