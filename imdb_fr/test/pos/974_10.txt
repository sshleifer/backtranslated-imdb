I could watch this movie all day! I like that. Probably my favorite movies of all time. But by the way, "badger1970", there are some parts with bad language, not too bad, but it's not exactly G rated. Super movie !!!!! I recommend it to everyone. Anyway, it makes me type 10 lines of text, so I'll continue typing until it allows me to post this comment. Okay ... Tapping again ... It gets annoying. Ugh. I still have four to go. Anyway, WATCH THIS FILM! Even if you have already seen it. I do not care! Is it 10 lines? Nope. There are only 2 lines left. I do not even know why he wants me to do that. I think I'm done. Wait a minute, I'm not finished, sorry, people. I know it's a torture that listens to me. I guess you do not have to read this comment ... But you should do it because I wrote it. I'm probably finished now. Finally, goodbye.
