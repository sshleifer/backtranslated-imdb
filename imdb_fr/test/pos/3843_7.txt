After seeing The Aristocats: Special Edition in a pack of two with The Fox in the Hound, I decided to buy it because both of these films were favorite childhood movies. <br /> <br /> The Aristocats is definitely a classic. It may not be a five-star classic, but it's a fun movie and a good night out. It's a light refresh of Disney's darker and more serious classics. The Aristocats are trying to be a light musical, and I think it's a success. <br /> <br /> The story does not really make sense and I do not think the plot is particularly strong, but it's certainly not weak. The animation and backgrounds are a little irritating in places, typical of Disney movies of the 70s, but it has a rustic charm and old-fashioned. <br /> <br /> The strong points of the Aristocats are the characters, the music and the humor. The music is very memorable - try to hurry up and say, "Everyone wants to be a cat"! The songs are written by the Sherman Brothers, who also composed the music of The Jungle Book. There was a song called "She never felt alone" that would be featured in the film, but unfortunately it was not selected for the last feature film. It's a shame, because I think it would have been very well integrated. <br /> <br /> The characters are unforgettable. Thomas O'Malley is voiced by Phil Harris and is basically Baloo in a feline form. Eva Gabor confers on the Duchess this warm and maternal feeling, and the kitten's voices actually look like children and not an actor imitating a child's voice. The secondary characters are here by the dozens and yet you always end up understanding their personality. Edgar, the "mean" butler plays a role similar to that of Cruella De Vil, but he is more comical than frightening, often ending up in funny situations. Even if he is the bad guy, he is still adorable. <br /> <br /> The two British geese - Abigail and Amelia really made me crack, as well as their crazy (and drunk) uncle. I also like dogs, who tend to argue over who the "leader" is. I could go on, but I will not spoil it. But I can tell you that The Aristocats is funny and will entertain everyone without having to resort to rudimentary toilet humor. <br /> <br /> Bottom line - The Aristocats might not be the crowning glory of Disney, or even their most powerful film of the 70s (this award is a link between the rescuers and the many adventures of Whinnie the Pooh). But it's a pleasant and entertaining whirlwind. If you are looking for a dazzling work of art, better watch Bambi. But if you want to spend a good evening, The Aristocats is the solution. It's a lovely and loveable movie and it's impossible not to like it. Enjoy! (And, it's good to have a movie where cats are not seen as bad guys).
