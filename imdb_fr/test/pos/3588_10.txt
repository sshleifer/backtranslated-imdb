This series has a lot to offer with beautiful images of some of the most impressive underwater environments on this planet. Since five years have passed, it would be difficult to wait less. I had the impression that certain scenes of the first episode were repeated in the last, which is naturally only a minor reproach. <br /> <br /> David Attenborough is an excellent narrator and the comments are informative, leaving enough room. for his imagination, and well spaced, so that viewers have enough time to reflect on breathtaking images. If you have the opportunity, try not to watch a translated version of this series. <br /> <br /> A must see for all those interested in the complexity of our blue continents and easily the best documentary on this topic that I have already seen.
