I used this film in my college ethics classes for over 10 years (as well as "Crimes and Misdemeanors" by Woody Allen - another fantastic multi-level ethical study). <br /> <br /> It's a fiction. I do not focus too much on the unrealistic characteristics of "Strangers" because all fiction films are obviously wrong on many levels. I like the film as a three-handed comedy, with lots of twists and ironic visual pleasures, even if it's "amazing". The story is so well told that I do not even think of criticizing its plausibility (although I must admit that the tennis match seems to me the weakest part: too much Hollywood fluff and not enough real competition of tennis). <br /> <br /> Some problems presented in the film that promise a realistic moral education and ethical debate: <br /> <br /> 1. Ethical passivity: some of the weaknesses of Guy's character are provided by Hitchcock. A fundamental ethical idea of ​​the film is the risk of not being able to express one's moral positions. Guy is unable to effectively block Bruno's crazy proposals in the beginning. An interesting question is why and how does Guy behave so passively, so effectively? One possible answer is his depression because of his intense and complicated divorce process. <br /> <br /> 2. Bad communication: Guy commits another failure at the start: in the train, to escape quickly, it is appropriate that the ideas of Bruno are all good. But Guy's literal meaning is opposed to his sarcastic and inflected sense. Bruno takes literal meaning as an agreement for cross-murders. Guy takes the sarcastic sense as an escape from any murder deal. To a certain extent, to the beginning, Bruno could partially claim that an agreement was reached to further train Guy in a fabric of complicity. Bruno manipulates Guy; Guy's linguistic ambiguity in the train gives Bruno a chance to put an ethical "stranglehold" on Guy. Bruno manipulating Guy can also take other meanings. . . . <br /> <br /> 3. Secret: Some have speculated about a sexual relationship between Guy and Bruno. At first glance it seems ridiculous, especially since Guy appears clearly heterosexual in his relations with Miriam and Anne. However, remember that Guy is also ineffective with both women. Guy appears (stereotyped - we remember 1951) effeminate, especially compared to Bruno. Guy, the strong athlete, is weak inside. Bruno is also in conflict (plays "against himself"), appearing physically and physically strong at first, then displays "effeminate" traits (Bruno's fashion and footwork, Guy's emotional outpouring in different situations; his manicure of his passionate mother, Bruno kisses and caresses his mother's hand desperately, other more subtle gay stereotypes that have a cryptic significance from Hitchcock's point of view). I would like to hear Hitchcock clarify here the meaning of his intention. <br /> <br /> 4. Dishonesty and suspicion: Guy makes colossal gaffes hiding the truths about Bruno to the family and the police. Guy can not fully understand that recognizing a fault quickly may be better than hiding or delaying the confession. Again, Guy is motivated by passivity, insecurity, fear - and perhaps self-hatred closer to Bruno's self-denial than we care to see or admit. Guy and Bruno each play their own parable about impotence. <br /> <br /> 5. Lack of Evidence: Guy struggles to gather evidence to fulfill his obligations. While going quickly to the police would solve a huge problem, Guy traps himself with his own doubts and insecurities: the lack of desired alibis; the inability of the alcoholic teacher to testify on behalf of Guy; the obsessive need to appear politically virgin; and other personality factors that make Guy feel helpless. It is as dysfunctional as Bruno - but not so dangerous (however, one could partially blame Guy for the murder of Miriam). <br /> <br /> 6. Sickness and mental disorders: an interesting question is to what extent Bruno is responsible for the murders committed legally. More Bruno is ethically incompetent as a sick sociopath, plus Guy can be guilty as a healthy person who fails to stand up and act morally to prevent crimes. Guy's failure is similar to a man who does not call the police when a sick friend threatens to commit suicide and death ensues. It could be argued that more than one crime is committed and that Guy is an accomplice with emotional difficulties. <br /> <br /> This, along with many other elements of the film, makes "Strangers on a Train" a jewel of morality, a diamond for philosophical and cinematic reflections.
