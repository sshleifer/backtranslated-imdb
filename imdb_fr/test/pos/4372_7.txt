For those of you who love comedians, you must have heard of George Carlin. He is truly one of the best living comedians, so you must know him. <br /> <br /> But he's already dead, God rest in peace. Or hell. He did not believe in religion so much, so he could have chosen hell for eternity. HAHA, I laugh, do not take it seriously! <br /> <br /> It's bad for you! This is one of the last works of George Carlin, before his death-- <br /> <br /> Believe me, one of his best works , a must for all fans and one of George Carlin's best jokes. It's not a best-of ... but it's really fun. <br /> <br /> He has fewer political and religious jokes. It's only to have a good time! <br /> <br /> The edition is very good. This is not a concert, so there should not be a quick change of shots ... the slow transition to another shot was well done. Discoloration is the best option in terms of mounting!
