This much-anticipated DVD souvenir of Rush's visit to South America in 2002 is perhaps the best rock video ever recorded on record. The image and sound production values ​​are amazing, especially since they have constantly struggled against the elements to obtain this production. All the pieces you expect from the RUSH catalog are here, from Tom Sawyer to The Pass, gloriously reproduced for a frankly proud Brazilian audience. the disc is the concert and the second disc contains 3 pieces of multi-angle set - Villa Strangiato, YYZ and the impressive drums solo, as well as a 30-minute documentary on the band's visit to Brazil. Overall, it's a triumph and all serious classic rock fans should own a copy.
