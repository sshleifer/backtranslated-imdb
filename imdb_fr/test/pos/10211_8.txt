I doubt that the true story of Western Union's development has ever conquered a real audience. Instead of talking about the construction of the telegraph system in the west, it is the story of meeting rooms, dominated by one of the most interesting (and hated) of the great "Robber Barons": Jay Gould. Gould took over the troubled business and turned it into a communications giant - part of his attempt to create a national railway system to compete with Vanderbilt. But this, although interesting, is not as exciting as the story of the laying of the telegraph lines themselves. At least, that's how the public would see Jay Gould died in 1892. If he had lived in the modern era and invested in Hollywood, he probably would have also accepted that assessment. <br /> <br /> The film explains how the installation of the telegraph system is endangered. by the Indians, under the leadership of a Jack Slade (Barton MacLane). Slade, a desperado, is not satisfied with the development of a communication system that will certainly prevent him from escaping the police in the territories. Creighton partner Edward Creighton (Dean Jagger), Richard Blake (Robert Young) and Slade's brother-in-law Vance Shaw (Randolph Scott) are confronted by the person responsible for laying telegraph cables. Blake, an Oriental who understands the West, is courting Creveon's sister Sue (Virginia Gilmore), but is struggling to get used to his new environment. But he becomes a close friend of Shaw, especially to try to confront Slade. <br /> <br /> Slade was a true Western criminal, by the way, and was the subject of a ROUGH section by Mark Twain. He was hanged in the 1870s. But he did not participate in raising the Indians against the railway or telegraph companies. However, MacLane makes him a terribly perverse and totally vicious guy. His assassination of one of the main characters is done suddenly and from behind - and he sees the corpse as if he had just got rid of a boredom. But Lang is responsible for that, as well as other factors. Watch the sequence with Chill Wills, where he is on a telegraph pole to fix it. He spits tobacco juice several times while talking to Young, who gets splashed a bit. Then there is an Indian attack that we observe from the ground. At the conclusion, Young is splashed again, but it is not the brown but the red that covers it. He looks up at the top of the pole and Wills is adorned with an Indian arrow. <br /> <br /> This is an exciting movie to watch that deserves to be captured.
