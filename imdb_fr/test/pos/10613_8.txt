It's a unique film because it gives us our only chance to see young Noel Coward in all his ironic glory. Because he seems so reserved and detached, he is perfect for the role of an unloved boy who uses all those around him. However, in the last extremely serious act (no pun intended), when Coward must do as the Flying Dutchman, he is much less comfortable. <br /> <br /> But his path with the epigram is unparalleled, and Hecht & Macarthur gave him some jewels (Macarthur, really - he was the spirit of the couple). <br /> <br /> The film is superbly enlightened by the great Lee Garmes, but has little camera movement outside of a storm sequence. Hecht and Macarthutr cared about one thing: getting their dialogue on the screen. (NOTE: H & M itself has flashing and blond cameos as fools in the scene.) The most notable support player is the one and only Alexander Woolcott, notorious Broadway. the columnist and close friend of Macarthur and Coward, one of the boring writers still waiting in Coward's reception room. <br /> <br /> Curious that Woolcott agrees to make a film that clearly illuminates the legendary Algonquin round table, of which he was one of the founders, and Macarthur, somehow an auxiliary member. <br /> <br /> The Scoundrel won an Oscar for Best Story, though this victory was probably due more to Coward's awesome presence in the plot. It's Coward, Woolcott, and the dialogue you remember ...
