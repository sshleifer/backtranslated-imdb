I watched this movie almost every night on HBO. I think it could have been a success in the theater, provided the advertising that preceded it was of the highest quality. I was deeply impressed by the actress who played Nanny. She is an exceptional actress. Of course, my favorite actor is Terrance Howard. He is a very discreet actor and he deserves much more credit than he has received. Ebony magazine made a good article about him, giving him some of his rights. Lakawanna Blue made me understand the stories my parents tell us. They came from a similar city "Philadelphia, PA" where they had to have fun in junta joints and the like. I also like to say that Mos Def is an incredible actor. He found his call. I saw him in several movies where he played various roles, from thug to doctor and he has all that! Overall, please put Lakawanna Blues on video for rental.
