The original story and the captivating and fun characters worked well for a girls' night movie (twice now). I loved it, it was fun and fast, without boring scenes. He is violent and speaks a little of the language (even if most of it is hidden). It's a good movie. David Strickland was a great actor. Ron Eldard gave a magnificent performance. I watch it with the girls every time.
