This film is very similar to Death Stop with Jean-Claude Van Damme and also has some similarities with Island of Fire with Jackie Chan and I also heard that there are other very similar action movies, but this movie has a much better action than Death Warrant or even Island of Fire (that's right, Jackie Chan's movie). Rarely do American action films have such a beautiful action sequence, although there have been many negative reviews on this film, it easily beats most of the action movies of this era that have been more successful . There were a lot of martial art scenes, David Bradley was fast like Bruce Lee in this movie and what was good, the fight scenes were much longer than in most American martial arts movies. The shooting scenes were similar to John Woo's movies, maybe not so good, but still very exciting. There were also a lot of awesome explosions and a big hunting scene. I have seen other David Bradley films, but this one is the best in terms of action. OK, this movie has hard times, but what movie does not have? The acting was decent, Charles Napier was amazing and his character was really hard. Adam Clark who played Squid and Yuji Okumoto who played the main villain were also very good. Other actors played very well, although the role of actor is not important in this type of film. If you are a fan of action movies (I mean the real action movie fans, who can really appreciate the good action), then you have to watch this movie.
