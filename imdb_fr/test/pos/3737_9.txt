I think this show was just about the money for me. I watched it above the plane, but parts of the film made me control myself and not tear myself apart. <br /> <br /> The chemistry between Richard Gere and Diane Lane was very credible (fantastic game on both sides)! I loved how Diane Lane's daughter played in the show. She was mature and her way of transforming throughout the show was easy to believe. <br /> <br /> I loved this show from start to finish. Highly recommended for romantics!
