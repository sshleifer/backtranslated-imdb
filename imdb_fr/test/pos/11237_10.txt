I do not know what the last comment is about but this show is pure entertainment. Basically, 2 guys are competing in a club to pick up girls in 3 different scenarios. They mix scenarios for each show, so it's not the same each time. The 4-judge jury is not afraid to call back or admit people when they recognize the game. They will explain what the guy did wrong and what they did well. Some competitors are weak, some are strong but what happens is always fun. If you are a guy who goes out, you can tell. I saw a weak game, I saw a strong game, and this show is real. Without a doubt.
