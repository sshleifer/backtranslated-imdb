I have never read the book, but I have always heard good things about it. So when the film came out, I thought of going to see it, but I never did it. Now it's out on DVD and I thought about renting for a few weeks now. Last night, I finally picked up. I am very happy to have done so. <br /> <br /> Cinematography was incredible in this movie. The landscape, etc., made you feel as if you were in Kabul. The acting was very good, although I'm sure some emotions were lost in the translation. And the story itself was good and pure and uplifting. Yes, the story was very sad, but at the same time uplifting. <br /> <br /> And I'll be honest, as a white American, ... showed me side of Kabul and Afghanistan that I never imagine in my mind when I think about it. Showed me an Afghanistan before the Taliban. Show me a place that was beautiful. Show me a place with people with good heart. It was a community that looked like a family, except for a few brutes. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I recommend this movie to everyone. This is one of the best I have ever seen.
