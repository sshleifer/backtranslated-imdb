Earth Final Conflict began as a new world, a new vision of the creator of Star Trek, something new and particular, filled with quality elements. A very good cast with an extremely credible Kevin Kilner in the role of William Boone, a former police officer begins to play the role of guardian of some kind of ambassador of a mysterious alien race (Talons), after the death of his woman in strange circumstances. But soon, the character of Kilner joins a group whose mission is to discover what are the true intentions of the extraterrestrials, why they seem so kind and care about the human race. Soon, this resistance group begins to discover the sinister plans of the Talons using humans in their own problems to survive and destroy themselves. As I said before, the show started well, everything was almost perfect, including characters like Da'an, the original Da'an was a big mystery, because he seemed like a beautiful creature, but he also had his own evil projects. to manipulate people on the earth. Soon came Zo'or who was not bad but ... marks the beginning of the fall of this show because he became the first great enemy of humans, the incarnation of evil, killing what could be greater than Da 'year. The first season ends well with the death of Boone and the second shows a new main character (Liam), a human hybrid being and Kimera (another extraterrestrial race) with very interesting powers. It replaces well the character of Kilner, which makes it better, including the conflicts with the jaridiens and the atavus. But as I said, the lines that precede the evilness of Zo'or are starting to take on more importance, so the new conflicts are less realistic than the same Talons. Over time, the whole big story of Liam's extraterrestrial roots has almost completely disappeared with the other things of the previous seasons. So, when the last season started, the final conflict of Earth Final was a dream almost forgotten, it only needed the magic to leave some vain intentions to keep alive the series, including the return of Kilner and Liam for some episodes. The last episode was just the proof of the seriousness of the series with so many changes (to think that the authors of certain episodes ignored all the first stories), it was one of the worst moments that I have ever seen in an episode of TV. It's really a shame because Earth Final Conflict started as if something unique, fresh, the stories of the cast, after watching so many shows from the United States, something from Canada's spirit of Star Trek creator, it was wonderful, but eventually everything got worse. I hope someday someone will redo this show, using of course nothing of the fourth and fifth seasons (except for the cast, everyone was perfect in his work). I can still dream in better things.
