If you are looking for a movie where an uncontrollable nympho is chained to a radiator by an extremely religious southern man, look no further than Black Snake Moan, the latest Paramount Vantage movie. You are not looking for exactly what I just described, do you say? In this case, you would do well to familiarize yourself with your local theater and always see it as Lazarus, the character of Samuel L. Jackson, would say. As long as you are open-minded and do not take everything seriously, nothing prevents you from leaving the theater. We are happy to have seen it. <br /> <br /> In director Craig Brewer's third offer, we are caught in the depths of the south where, as the film's slogan says, everything is warmer. While there we are introduced to the pious bluesman, Lazarus as previously told by Jackson, and the Rae almost always half-naked; a role assumed with courage by Christina Ricci. In the film, this unlikely pair meets each other long enough for their characters to learn from each other. Both lessons end up telling the public that, in any case, we are all human. Nobody is perfect and if everyone realized it, we would be much better off. The question of whether this will be understood or accepted by all who will see the film is another story. <br /> <br /> There is no need to debate the high quality of Jackson and Ricci. You would think that with the role of a crazy sex woman, overactivating would be a given, but no, not here. Ricci is making a breakthrough and showing real talent with a raw performance that also doubles its best so far. Then we have Jackson who disappears completely and who, for the first time in a long time, makes us forget who he is. Unfortunately, the third star of the movie, Justin Timberlake, who plays Rae's boyfriend, is not that good. At first, he fails miserably because he seems to try too hard. Later, he climbs a little, but he is still far from the level he had reached with "Alpha Dog" in January. <br /> <br /> The other thing that boasts "Black Snake Moan" is a beautiful soundtrack. Containing pieces of the Black Keys, John Doe, pieces from Scott Bomar's score, and of course four, counts them, four pieces of Jackson himself. It is actually one of his songs, the main representation of the film, "Stackolee", which feeds on fire this superb collection. This alone is worth the price of the ticket. Other notable musical pleasures include Bomar's "Chain", "When the Lights Go Out" from the Black Keys, and the title track, which is also one of the most memorable scenes in the film where Lazarus sings in front of Rae on a stormy night. <br /> <br /> However, Craig Brewer's efforts can not be ignored. His latest film 'Hustle & Flow', which exceeded the lowest expectations and achieved critical acclaim, propelled it onto the map. What he did with "Black Snake Moan" will be what sets him apart from other beginners in the industry. He not only directed "Moan", but also wrote his screenplay. The end result is a surprising and intelligent story. Looking, you feel that you know exactly where you are going, despite his coolness. Just as you think you've predicted the next move, Brewer is moving up a gear and taking a totally different path. There are, however, some spots in the scenario. The background characters are dull and flat while the end is a little disappointing. It made me want something more exciting. After so many highs, I guess the final scenes were a little weak compared to the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> I guess the majority of people who see "Black Snake Moan" will not like it because they can not help but think how improbable it is. The depressing part about this is that there are many other films with equally unlikely and even more outrageous scenarios that are widely welcomed. It is the issues of race, religious motivation and sexuality that the film exposes that will have more impact on opinion than anything. The idea that a black man connects a white woman to his home is enough to prevent most people from considering seeing him. In simple terms, it's not for everyone. As I said, to take full advantage, you have to be open-minded, otherwise you're wasting all your money. For those of you who can do it, I highly recommend it.
