I was really surprised to find that unlike most documentaries, this one was written, directed and produced by a film critic, Richard Schickel. Most of the time I know where movie critics have played a major role in movies, the movies turn out to be bombs (Rex Reed in "Myra Breckenridge" and Roger Ebert writing in "Beyond the Doll Valley" "are examples of this. However, in this case, the powers of criticism are used for good and not for evil - and the results are better (even if it does not say much, because the films I just mentioned are among the worst films never made). <Br/> <br /> As for the documentary, it is told by Clint Eastwood (a very good choice) and manages to take stock of his long career - from his silent days until his death in the early 1960s. The only negatives, and they are minimal, are that the film is terribly short (like most documentaries) and that there is very little about Gary Cooper as a human being - you do not really learn not much about his life. However, as a good overview of his films, it works very well.
