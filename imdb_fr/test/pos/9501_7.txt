No more corned beef and cabbage for her! <br /> <br /> This little romantic comedy unfolds from stage to stage with some exotic twists (some imaginary scenes and a disguised evening). All this is centered around the wife of the husband who seeks to get out of the doldrums, played by Gloria Swanson (she is twenty years old here!). The two main men have a natural look that is convincing and of course, Swanson is perfect in all kinds of moods, from the most frivolous to the most worried to the most optimistic. <br /> <br /> Behind all the games and apparent lightness lies the old serious problem of staying in love and not getting lost in love. There is a little cheerfulness, but director DeMille is about to keep him alive and credible. As in many films of this period, subtitles do not just say what they say (or think), but often give a sort of philosophical insight, as if to justify tragedy (or nervousness). And there's that higher goal here, probably better without the instructional text, but it's part of the narrative style, and it's a little outdated. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a visual or formal wonder, you will not find it here. But as a story well interpreted and filmed with precision and economy, it's really a good example. The events may not be a complete surprise, but it is a modern love affair that took place nearly a hundred years ago and is a gas. And did I see that Swanson was perfect?
