Joshua Miller (aka Tim), a pre-teen looking for a pot, throws his sister's doll into the river while Daniel Roebuck (under the name of Samson) screams and smokes a cigarette after killing Danyi Deats ( under the name of Jamie). The doll is carried away, but the naked young woman stays at the edge of the river, at the sight of all the passers-by. Looking at the corpse, we see a group of teenagers in their twenties, mostly classmates of the naked corpse. Stoners Keanu Reeves (as Matt) and Crispin Glover (as Layne) are the most deserving of being photographed. Friends are wondering what to do about their guilty and thirsty beer friend. <br /> <br /> Former veteran Dennis Hopper (as a Feck) feeds the younger ones' heads. Mr. Hopper once killed a woman. He lives with one of these life-sized sex dolls, his mouth seemingly ready for action. Ione Skye Leitch (as Clarissa) is a more lively doll and she is waiting for Reeves to kiss her. Their copulation is intersected with a return to the opening throttle. A teenage girl in her first role, Ms. Leitch is the daughter of Donovan, singer of the sixties. Make other unusual connections yourself. <br /> <br /> You can read a lot of things in the movie, or not, depending on your mood. Some backgrounds of the characters can be a bit too subtle. Obviously, the killer teenager was teased; note his weight, his attitude and his nickname "toilets". Some of the relationships and motivations of the characters are defined too vaguely, but the distribution keeps the content interesting; and director Tim Hunter, photographer Frederick Elmes and writer Neal Jimenez are clearly talented. <br /> <br /> ******* River's Edge (27/08/86) Tim Hunter ~ Keanu Reeves, Crispin Glover, Dennis Hopper, Joshua Miller
