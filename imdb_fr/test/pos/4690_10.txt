Used to watch this when I was very small, then used to watch my videos. Now, I'm watching DVDs, I love it. Ray Winston is 'The Dude', the rest of the cast is all good and even with Robin Hood's change everything works. The good stories, the twists and the way the film was shot - to the untrained eye (it's not mine being trained) can be misinterpreted as rubbish, but that adds to the audience absorption by the film. With the green hills and the contrast of lush and sunny lush forest with dark corridors and castles dungeons - it's great. Personally, the final interpretation of the legend Robin Hood. I can not emphasize how much I think you should look at this, if you have the opportunity, you have to look at it.
