I had never heard of Silverwing before, then I saw it on Toon Disney and loved it right away! I also think it's not just for children, and that people of all ages will benefit. He has a great plot, great effect, and nice characters. I will always love the series and I hear that it will be released soon on DVD all over the world, and I will have it! I have not read any of the books, but I intend to do so. The series deserves a 10 out of 10, and I hope the books are just as good. Well, that's all I have to say. But I still have 2 lines to fill, so ... who do you think is the coolest character? Mine is Shade and my second favorite is Marina.
