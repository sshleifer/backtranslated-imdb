I can not say that this show is perfect. All previous commentators may remember the old time slot of Tuesday at 10:30 resumed by the childish humor of Butch Elvira Curt ("There is a space shuttle that rubs a 747!"). Oh the glory of fighting to press any button on the remote to make it change. <br /> <br /> Opposite, the comedy can not create a showcase and create the comic genius of the real Canadiens Trailer Park Boys. But hey, they try. <br /> <br /> This show is by far one of the best original shows. However, none of the following players will find themselves laughing at the apparent "players" who demonstrate their stupidity at picking up girls: <br /> <br /> a) "Dumb" Girls - Obviously, they can not surrender they are just like the girls in the series. Unconscious. Jump on the man's meat, you can call yourself a whore tomorrow and have his name. He looks good, he must be popular and kind. HAHAHAHA !!! Oh, but you would never do that! Nobody would do it ... if they knew it was happening <br /> <br /> b) Some little social guys who think women like guys fine - Obviously, see these guys succeed at that you fail or not even experience, it's going to boil your primary rages. Look closer, they are shot down most of the time. They say stupid bullshit. <br /> <br /> c) Girls who respect each other - It is obvious that seeing one's different species of women caught in real life situations is bad. Nobody is playing. Women are not objects, they can not be played, because they are very faithful angels who go to clubs to converse politely between them without fear that some guys will try to pick them up. <br /> <br /> Oh, wait! ... hmmmmmmmm <br /> <br /> As much as EVERYONE will say that this show is not funny, and that it does not teach you anything, I must take the opposite side. The show is very good for detailing how relationships work for men AND women. The way they think, and the way they think about each other, and the social hierarchy. It's funny to see and hear guys making absolutely silly comments about women ("My grandfather died recently" "Oh ... well, have fun tonight?"). <br /> <br /> a club. The place where people will have fun and get laid up. No matter who you are, you go to a club to draw attention to someone. Guys go there to test their game and pick up the girls. The girls go there to flirt with the guys and find the one that trains them the best. Lighten up! <br /> <br /> If you are a guy, learn something about the different approaches and their effects. If you are a girl, discover the opinion of these "studly" whores and learn to differentiate them from authentic guys. The next time you're separated by one of these castaways, realize that it's not because of him, but because you're stupid and think he was the best guy of all time, whereas 'He was clearly a dick for you all the time.
