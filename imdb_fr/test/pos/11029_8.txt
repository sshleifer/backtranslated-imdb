It's one of my favorite movies, going back to my childhood. Located in the remote nature of Siberia at the end of the century, a small community is moved when an extremely cold winter forces two tigers down the mountains in search of food and looking for outlying farms. In this atmosphere, we discover Avakum, a hermit fur trapper, who lives in the wild, while he comes to the village to sell his annual catch to Boris, his close friend and rather unique to the village, who runs a village. store. At Boris' request, Avakum accompanies the arrogant son of his friend, Ivan, in search of the menacing tigers. Personalities are smashed and fired as Avakum, older and more experienced, criticizes Ivan's amateur methods, a meeting also noticed by other members of the hunt. On the second day, the hunters see their prey and pursue it. In a thick wood, Ivan hurts one of the tigers, who then attacks the unfortunate. Avakum, seeing Ivan get tangled in the mad beast, fires, but accidentally hits Ivan. He kills the tiger while he runs away. The other hunters arrive on the scene, suspicious. <br /> <br /> Back in the village, the doctor works to save the wounded Ivan. Avakum tries to leave the village, but is confronted with Ivan's friends. The trapper removes them however and leaves with his sled pulled by a dog. The young villagers swore after him that they would come for him if Ivan died, which he would do later, but before he died, tell his father that it was an accident. The old Boris, having learned that his close friend had been driven out of the village, withdrew from the gathering of the "lynch mob" and left after Avakum to find him and redress the situation. And so begins the main story. <br /> <br /> A simple film, it raises the conflict of man and civilization against nature, mainly Avakum's struggle to survive alone in the desert. The winter landscape is very well filmed. The strongest element of the film is perhaps the soundtrack of Jimmie Haskell. Very sentimental and evocative, the main theme is that of Adagio d'Albinoni. Other movements reflect Russian styles, as well as some tunes of folk music. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this film is not available for sale, to my knowledge, which is rather unfortunate. The copy I own, recorded on television almost twenty years ago, is slowly deteriorating. This film is a must for those who can appreciate it, if they can find it. 8/10
