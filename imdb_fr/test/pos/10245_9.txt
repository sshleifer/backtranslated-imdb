Leading actress Yuko Tanaka accomplishes so much in the meditative film "The Milkwoman", a quiet reflection on missed opportunities in the life of a woman 50 years and over, tracing her routine with genuinely poignant motives. Filmed in the peaceful, picturesque town of Nagasaki, Akira Ogata's unconventional romantic film is less of a mere melodrama than a deliberate introspection of the surrender of his characters to their present lives as a result of a tragic past. br /> <br /> Perfectly embodying the fatigue of the required world subjected to a routine without spirit, Tanaka interprets Minako Oba, a middle-aged woman who, before her shift in a supermarket, takes the responsibility of delivering bottles of milk to the inhabitants of Nagasaki Hill. Kaita Takanashi (Ittoku Kishibe), a local government worker who cares for her terminally ill wife (Akiko Nishina), is one of her homes. Minako and Kaita were high school lovers, who, by courtesy of an ignominious event concerning their parents, have since separated. <br /> <br /> By opening his film with the disturbing narration of a young Minako swearing never to leave Nagasaki, Ogata does it as such, patiently accompanied by Minako, helped by the performance both discreet and very effective of Tanako, follows her - she talks with her aunt (Misako Watanabe) because she is single or walks countless steps from their hilly town to distribute milk - while she and Kaita gradually overcome the barriers that separated them for years. Such unhurried development may not be suitable for weaners on fast paced narratives, but for the rest it is a sincere introspection that affects powerfully and energetically.
