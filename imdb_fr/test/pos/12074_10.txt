Ann-Margret has done the best job she has ever done in her filmmaking history. I felt like she was Mrs. Frey. There may be one or two Ann-Margret films I have not seen since her debut in "Pocket full of Miracles" with Betty Davis in 1961. I think she was totally underestimated in industry. Although she was nominated for an Emmy Award for this role in "Who Will Love My Children," she has been neglected. As if she had been nominated for an Academy Award for her roles in "Carnal Knowledge" and "Tommy", she was snubbed. Overall, I think everyone did a great job as an actor, including all the children of "Who Will Love My Children". Yes, it's a sad movie (as true stories can be), but it's worth it. Thank you.
