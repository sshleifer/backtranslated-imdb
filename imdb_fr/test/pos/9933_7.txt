An opera-diva has an accident, which leaves the door open to its lining. Betty (Marsillach) is now Mac Beth's star, but someone hiding in the trenches has her own planned opera. He keeps his time attaching Betty, putting needles under her eyes (so that she can not close them) and murdering members of the opera troupe right in front of her eyes. <br /> <br /> "Opera" is certainly one of the creations of Argento For the more ambitious films, like the mix with Macbeth of Shakesphere, there is of course the fact that the opera interpreted in the film is Macbeth's version of Giuseppe Verdi but also Argento, just as Shakespeare uses crows as an omen of death and misfortune. And like the crows surrounding Castle Dunsinane announcing the disappearance of the intriguing Macbeth, the crows of OPERA play a key role in the murderer's downfall. In addition, as in the old room, the murderer acts on the exhortation of his lover. But I do not want to go as far as to say that OPERA is supposed to be a remake of the ghost of opera or Macbeth, the similarities are far too subtle. It's just a typical Argento master stroke, and with it, it gives this fairly basic thriller a lively nuance of Gothic mysticism. <br /> <br /> Although this film has drawbacks, as the heavy metal soundtrack simply does not fit. with this movie and the final scenes of this movie are a bit strange. <br /> <br /> Overall, "Opera" is in a way an imperfect masterpiece, but still good.
