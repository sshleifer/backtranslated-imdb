I saw (unfortunately) the dubbed version on Encore. <br /> <br /> Serious medical student Paula Henning (Franka Potente, also a member of Run Lola Run) plays the role of a serious medical student who enters a prestigious graduate school. Germany. But she quickly discovers that some students are disappearing and that the bodies they work on in the anatomy lab are incredibly cool ... <br /> <br /> I was stuck seeing the dubbed version in Encore. It hurt a lot (the words not matching the lips became annoying) but I still liked what I saw. The acting was good, it was beautifully photographed, it was not too horrible and I was never bored. Even more refreshing was a friendly heroine who defended herself when the bad guys pursued her. Nudity (sweet) was, in a refreshing twist, a man! A previous poster mentions Benno Furmann (who is excellent) showed his buttocks but I do not remember seeing him. Anyway, it's a thriller well done, scary and excellent. From all that I have read, the original German version is the best (I do not doubt it for a second), but the dubbed version is visible. I give him a 7.
