I loved this movie, Independent cinema at its best. The cinematography, the stimulation, the rhythm and the play of the actors were perfectly synchronized. Fred Carpenters best work so far! The film is well written with many twists that will lead you to a fantastic end. It moves well and keeps you involved. As a photographer, I was very impressed by the cinematography. the lighting creates an atmosphere and a beauty that one generally finds in a film with a much larger budget. This gave the actors an excellent starting canvas to work their magic. And that's what they did! Great performances from all actors and everyone has been well interpreted in their roles. As I said at the beginning, it's a wonderful movie, and one of Fred Carpenters' best movies. You will love it.
