This simple and eloquent film makes a remarkably clear statement about a teenager and his father. Although released in the theater, it has a quality "made for television". We can attribute this to the director, John Frankenheimer, who learned his craft from the beginnings of live television in New York. Indeed, he directed the television series on which the film "Deal a Blow" from the drama series CBS "Climax" is based. "Young Stranger" represents his Hollywood debut. After a four-year hiatus in which he spends more time on television, he returns to the director "The Young Savages" with Burt Lancaster and, one year later, "All Fall Down" with Warren Beatty and Angela Lansbury. <br /> <br /> The cast is competent: James Daly and Kim Hunter (particularly gifted) playing the parents of the main character played by James MacArthur (his first theatrical movie), who played the same role in the television version, his first appearance in the small screen. Search James Gregory and Whit Bissell for support roles.
