I saw the film at its North American premiere (July 14, 2004) at the Fantasia Festival. I was a little disappointed because I was expecting a more epic movie and ensemble cast, in the style of Musa the Warrior. Instead, the movie only focused on a much smaller number of characters. Despite everything, the film was solid, thoughtful and visually intriguing. The dominant, thoughtful and realistic tone of confused loyalties, intrigues and mixed blood was slightly discordant compared to lighter and more flamboyant martial arts sequences. It almost seemed like the filmmakers were unable to decide if the film was supposed to be a martial arts movie or a historical epic. History deals with the question of the need for loyalty to the need to adapt to new situations. Is your life and that of your friends really worthy of being faithful to your master, or does it take a moment to submit to the winds of change? Is there perhaps more courage to leave old methods for new ones? How do we decide? These issues are raised in this film and, ironically, it is suggested that the answer given may actually be the wrong one!
