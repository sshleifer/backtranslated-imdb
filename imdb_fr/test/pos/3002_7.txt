Teams of doctors Carole and Nelson Niles Nelson are doing modestly well in their careers, but Niles has a gambling problem. His luck changes when he (unknowingly) saves the life of a gangster from Joe Gurney's crowd and gets a big bonus from the leader of the gang himself. Loving his change of fortune (and his flamboyant new apartment), Niles continues to receive rewards for repairing other injured gang members. Unfortunately, his wacky business is unveiled during a police raid that casts a shadow over his wife's career. <br /> <br /> The conspiracy is gaining momentum as Carole Nelson must save her career before her license is suspended. This involves bringing the gang to justice more or less on its own. <br /> <br /> This is not a gangster picture with difficult contours, but a scenario that could have been comfortable on a show like MATLOCK or MURDER SHE WROTE. There are some tensions, but the atmosphere is clear when Bogart plays with stupor in the role of a stupid gangster who imagines himself to be the "Napoleon of crime". His other gang members also work more like gangsters than thugs. And there is a fierce dialogue between Bogart and Francis, especially when she is healing her wounds in her hiding place. Of course, as in all gangster movies, there is a big end to the shootout, but with a touch of humor. This is a good short film showing Bogart on his rise to stardom.
