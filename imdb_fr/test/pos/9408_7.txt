In 1974, teenager Martha Moxley (Maggie Grace) moved to the posh Belle Haven district of Greenwich, Connecticut. The night of the mischief on the eve of Halloween, she was murdered in the yard of her house and her murder was not solved. Twenty-two years later, writer Mark Fuhrman (Christopher Meloni), a former Los Angeles detective who fell out of favor for perjury at OJ Simpson's trial and moved to Idaho, decides to investigate the case with his partner Stephen Weeks (Andrew Mitchell) for the purpose of writing a book. The locals squirm and do not greet them, but with the support of retired detective Steve Carroll (Robert Forster) in charge of the investigation in the 1970s, they discover the criminal and a net of power and money for cover the murder. <br /> <br /> "Murder in Greenwich" is a good TV movie that tells the true story of the murder of a 15-year-old girl who was committed by a wealthy teenager whose mother was a Kennedy. The powerful and wealthy family used its influence to cover the murder for over twenty years. However, a snoopy detective and a perjury convicted in shame were able to reveal how the hideous crime had been committed. The scenario shows the Mark inquiry and Martha's last days in parallel, but the emotion is lacking in the dramatization. My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): Not available
