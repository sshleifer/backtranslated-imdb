I just finished an evening of An American Werewolf in London and Paris. Let me begin by saying that "London" still stands after all these years and that the transformation sequence is quite impressive. The film was funny and scary, but also a little gore ... Now let's go to "Paris" sound nice, some scars, a lot of gore not as exciting or weird as original, but it has some laughs in what is has become quite fashionable these days in movies so maybe in this sense was ahead of its time, the transformations "A CGI, while good for the technology of its time, is not nearly as impressive as the 'original. I gave a 7 to this movie because I have to admit it was nice, I laughed a lot and I found Tom Everett Scott so stupid that at first I wanted to hate his performance before enjoying it ... go figure ... .Julie Delpy was competent as well as the direction, it is the scenario which lacked a little brilliance and delicacy. I read here that John Landis was supposed to be shooting badly he was not doing it, I'm quite sure it would have been a completely different movie. I also noticed a discussion about a sequel "And if" and no one noticed the obvious, it should be in American and here is my title "An American werewolf comes home" or DC that would be fun all these political dogs need a good scare. You just have to see the original in its new DVD transfer with its dolby 5.1 and see them both on a HDTV with upscaling enabled ... nice !!!!
