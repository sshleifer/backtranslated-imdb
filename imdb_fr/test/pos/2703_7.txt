Yes, this is one of the best-made TV movies and I would expect less from Joe Sargent. One thing for this criticism is that I was also a big fan of The Carpenters, that I was able to sing all their material at the elementary school choir and the colleges and that I had to do a lot of the solo material that Karen had directed. I thought she was one of the most wonderful pop singers of the 70s - and being a kid / teenager singing those songs and learning music - the only thing that was waiting for me was to meet this woman. I never did, she died three weeks before that happened. And yes, it affected me, because I knew nothing about anorexia and I did not quite understand what had happened. <br /> <br /> When this TV movie was produced, I really understood. Karen and Richard may not all be open to the televised audience, but by opening the parts that were shown, I learned a lot from the music industry of that time. What annoys me is that I write "of this time" and that I see "now". Nobody learned anything, even though it was a very informative and sincere look at the problems of a family in the music industry. <br /> <br /> These films are not made for pleasure, but for the opening. a door and show us something. Here is a wonderful woman who let herself be carried away by the idea that her talent was based on weight. She was fine I did not know it. She received conflicting messages about her weight from the brother she loved, the parents she loved, and the music industry who cared more about her appearance / weight than her talents . With the advent of MTV, the situation got worse. With American Idol, it's like a spitting cat in an English accent. <br /> <br /> A wonderful TV movie, I'm sure later, we'll be able to give her an HBO treatment, but in both cases, many lessons to learn and the absence of another wonderful talent.
