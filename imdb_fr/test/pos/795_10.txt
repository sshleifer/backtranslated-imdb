With Cops, The Goat is one of Keaton's two funniest shorts. Which makes it one of the best shorts ever made. This has a decent "plot" for a short film, and this forms a perfect line for hanging big gags. Keaton is confused with an escaped convict (the mistake is classic) and must then escape the authorities. Best gags - the bread line and the "elevator".
