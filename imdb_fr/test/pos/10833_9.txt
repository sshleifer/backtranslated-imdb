Giant Robot is the most popular Japanese television series ever seen on Indian television. It was meant for kids and we saw a robot for the first time in our life. <br /> <br /> Many Indian children must even have seen a machine for the first time outside textbooks. <br /> <br /> The series also showed a child in an organization of adults fighting evil. There is no doubt that many of us who have seen Giant Robot in their childhood long for our own robots and, as an alternative, consider our computers the same. <br /> <br /> This show also featured ideal adults (in reference to Jerry, Johnny's boyfriend friend and Azuma's Unicorn leader). We have learned to respect Japan's progress and we still see Japan as the ideal Asian nation. <br /> <br /> By the way, at that time, there was no satellite TV channel in India and the government-owned broadcaster did not broadcast a lot of Disney cartoons. . I guess that's how children's series like Giant Robot were appreciated. Nowadays, there are Pokemon, etc., but they are not as fascinating and attractive as the Giant robot.
