I saw the movie last night without knowing anything about it (nothing else seemed interesting and I had a connection with Buffalo with this movie - UB grad). It was a very nice film. I liked the rhythm (it resumes after a slow start) and the story. Intrigue well written and good character development and relationships. Highly recommend it to anyone who likes to see movies that have interesting stories. I ended up talking about this movie after a few beers - most of the discussions do not last more than a few minutes.
