Amazingly effective British drama about two very different people who find common ground, and especially about the "blooming" of one of them. A young (McAvoy) "Spike" and bitter with Deuchennes MD is placed in a home for the disabled and quickly binds with a young (Robertson) cerebral palsy. Robertson has never known anything outside the home, but McAvoy has it and is determined to return to the real world. Together, they manage to do just that in this fun, comforting and often heartbreaking story of inner strength overcoming physical flaws. Both leaders are great, especially Robertson, who surely spent time studying the disabled to succeed in this difficult role. It appears in almost every scene and acts as an absolute storm. For those who do not know it, they might think that it really has CB. Highly recommended.
