Biographical account of the life of Charles Lindbergh, the first man to fly nonstop across the Atlantic in 1927 aboard his plane the Spirit of St. Louis. <br /> <br /> Without appearing among the best films of director Billy Wilder, it has very impressive production values, especially for a film made 50 years ago. The story is well told and the performances are good but not exceptional. <br /> <br /> One of the defining factors of the story is that Lindbergh flew alone and without radio, which means he has no one to talk to. This required different storytelling techniques, such as internal monologues, talking with a house fly and some occasional bouts of conversation with himself, especially once exhaustion has arrived. In addition, to avoid a long sequence of the famous flight, it is interspersed with Flashbacks of his life and the methodical preparations for the flight. <br /> <br /> Charles Lindbergh was a huge hero of his time but his controversial beliefs would have altered him somewhat. In spite of this, he will continue to contribute to the aviation field and will participate as a civilian consultant in the United States efforts in the Second World War. <br /> <br /> Jimmy Stewart certainly had the antecedents of a thief to support his portrait of Lindbergh. He became a colonel in the US Air Force during the Second World War and on reserves after the war, he reached the rank of Brigadier General.
