The ability of Eric Bogosian to move from one character to another in this "one man show" shows his true range of character actor. Each character has their own message to convey about truth, society, social class, drugs, etc. This is an absolute must for anyone who is a big fan of actors! His performance contains some of the most hilarious and real moments I have ever seen as an audience.
