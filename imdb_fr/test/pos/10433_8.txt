Many teen sex comedy movies come and go without much fanfare, however, from time to time, a movie can happen, it's honest, funny, entertaining AND memorable. The Last American Virgin is a special film that has found its place and has stood the test of time by mixing the four ingredients. This film follows three friends (Gary, Rick and David "The Big Apple") in the world of first sex and true love. Along the way, they learn hard lessons and the value of true friendship. We follow Gary (the main character), a hopeless romantic, on his quest to conquer the girl of his dreams, which leads him on an uncertain road with a surprise touch at the end. If you have not had the chance to see this movie, take a look ... dotted with many memorable songs from the 80s throughout the film to make things move at an equal pace. L.A.V. is really an original film, a rarity among the films of its kind.
