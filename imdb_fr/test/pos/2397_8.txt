I was very impressed by Eddie Monroe's accomplishments regarding his overall impact on me. I say this because I know that this independent film had a limited budget / resources, but despite that, it seems to be a convincing and well-crafted work. <br /> <br /> Enjoying end to end with several relatively unknown works. Actors I can not help but believe are going to make a lot of noise in the industry in the years to come, Eddie Monroe did not fail to keep my interest engaged and my emotional meter dancing. It's a well scripted story with a surprising ending despite my efforts not to be caught off guard. <br /> <br /> Most of the actors of the distribution listed for this film are names to watch in the future. Someone told me that Paul Regina had just passed, and if that's true, it's a tragedy, because his stoic performance at Eddie Monroe is remarkable. <br /> <br /> Congratulations to Fred Carpenter who truly won first prize!
