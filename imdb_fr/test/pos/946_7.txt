Tumbling Doll of Flesh (aka Niku Daruma and Psycho: The Snuff Reels) It's been a long time since I wanted to, and I finally scored a copy on Ebay some time ago. It has never been on DVD, and Ebay has given me a DVD-R of very good quality, which I am quite satisfied. I think the movie is the most extreme example of porn torture, with a focus on porn. A woman responds to an advertisement for a porn movie and goes with the producer to a place where she is filmed. Porn is really real, with annoying Japanese pixelation trying to hide hardcore shots, with little success most of the time. After the shooting of the porn movie and the moment the actress is ready to leave, she is mated with a baseball bat and is brought back to the room where she is savagely dismembered in slow shots and in one of the most disgusting scenes , porn A guy fucks her in an open wound in the chest. It's after both legs have been severed, his arm and some other kindnesses. This film far surpasses the series of guinea pigs. In fact, they are not even close to realism, although the cheap gore effects presented in this film. This is indeed one of the best fake tobacco movies I have ever seen, if not the best. Now, I must warn you that if you are not in this kind of thing, you should stay very far away. This film is very strong, and with the real sex, it is very sick, erotic to a certain extent. And I mean, in a very sick way. But whatever topic you cover, this movie brings the goods home and I urge you to look for it. After reading something about the movie, I was expecting something very strong, but it went well beyond that.
