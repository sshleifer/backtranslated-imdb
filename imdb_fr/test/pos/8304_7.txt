I have good memories of watching this when he came out. It's one of those movies that you know as garbage, even when you're a child, but at this age you forget the play of ridiculous actors, the special effects and the plot (so there is a race of nymphets busty live underground, huh?) and just enjoy the camping monsters for all they are worth.
