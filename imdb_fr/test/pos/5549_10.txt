This movie was really true to life. I liked the end that seemed to resolve naturally without much time, but with many little moments to come. You could say it's an honest love story. Whatever the sexual orientation of the main characters, it is always a story of love and understanding. <br /> <br /> Many scenes concern the family. The setting is during that for some people is a very stressful time. To know "the holidays". Christmas to be precise. <br /> <br /> Like most good movies, this one addresses issues of love, integration, expectations and prejudices that can not be overcome. In the end, Alexandra and Casey make a choice, knowing that love is difficult and giving. Good game.
