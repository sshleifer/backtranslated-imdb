"One True Thing" is the kind of film in which the audience is inspired by highly inspired performances. I do not necessarily say that the film is edifying, because it is not. In fact, the movie is depressing. I'm trying to say that it takes a lot for a film to generate tears of emotion in a public audience. <br /> <br /> I cried in "One True Thing", enough to conclude that this is one of the most emotional. powerful movies of 1998. The characters were perfectly molded. The performances are all guaranteed to Oscar nominees, especially Meryl Streep, who describes Kate very dying extremely well. Her game alone was enough to make the film excels at the point of recommendation and gives you a new perspective on it. I also thought that Renée Zellweger represented a free and realistic single woman who must take care of her own mother. The other cast members, including William Hurt and Tom Everett Scott, were also superb. The scenario of this movie was really fantastic. It's pretty funny to see how the concept of the film has to do with the controversial events in my area. You see, I live near Lansing, Michigan, and right now, one of the major problems is the assistant of the suicide specialist, Jack Kavorkian (sorry for my misspelling if), has just been proscribed. The public will vote on this subject according to his convictions in November. After watching "One True Thing", my perspective on this subject has really changed, even though I've always believed it. Without revealing the end of the film, I will simply say that suicide is a distant theme in this film and I think it fits perfectly with the beautiful story. Overall, this movie actually has more emotional impact than "Titanic", "Saving Private Ryan" or any other larcorer released in recent years. I think it's because the main idea of ​​this movie is that this kind of thing happens every day, so it's more about the audience. And indeed, it could happen to you.
