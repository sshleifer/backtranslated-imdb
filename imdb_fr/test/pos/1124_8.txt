As a member of a pan-Hellenic sorority, I did not know what to expect when I watched this show. After seeing so many dramas in "made for TV" movies and the madness of reality TV shows, I was curious to see if the Greek would be able to show the true experience of academic and Greek life. <br /> <br /> I was very pleasantly surprised by how the series gave the viewer the satisfaction of identifying the ever-familiar characters of this genre, but he was also able to add some depth to the characters. Greek life is not limited to parties and minor conflicts. Although these things happen in Greek life, they also occur in any other social or professional circle throughout a person's life. It would be wrong to characterize it as an exclusive experience for those of a Greek organization. Most of the stories and situations that take place in Greek can unfold and unfold everywhere, in all circles of friends, in sports teams, in real life. But I watched both episodes and my "little sister" with whom I'm still very close and I spent both episodes laughing and remembering how much they really captured the spirit of our years and our academic experiences. <BR /> <br /> I liked how the second episode showed how the characters struggled with the other facets of their lives; school, relationships, goals, etc. Cappie telling Rusty that the school was coming first and asking your brothers for help, that was very true. You can not stay in an organization if you have bad grades. The way Rusty got his assignment with his teacher was a lot of fun, but it was fun. Even the dynamic between Casey and Rusty; It happens, you grow and whatever your relationship with your siblings, it changes and you have to adapt. <br /> <br /> The end result: Greek is a great show, an excellent entertainment value and enough "real life" to be credible and certainly deserves the time of viewers.
