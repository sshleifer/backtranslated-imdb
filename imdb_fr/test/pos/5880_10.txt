I was blown away when I saw "The best years of our lives". The screenplay, screenplay and direction of Master William Wyler (winner of the Best Director Award in 1946) are brilliant. <br /> <br /> This film is about three veterans of the Second World War who are returning from the war and are reunited with their loved ones but must face the difficulties of returning from the war. <br /> <br /> The first man Al Stephenson (played by Fredric March in his Oscar-winning role) returns home to meet his wife Millie (played by Myrna Loy) and children Peggy and Rob (played by Teresa Wright and Michael Hall) are larger and different than before he left for the war. <br /> <br /> The second man, Fred Derry (played by Dana Andrews), must find a good job and go home with a wife with whom he was married only 20 days before he left for the war . He begins to discover that it is not the same thing. <br /> <br /> Homer Parish (portrayed by Harold Russell in his Oscar-winning role) lost his hand in the war and has to contend with that of his family and fianc√© 'Wilma (played by Cathy O 'Donnell) reactions to the hooks he has instead of his hands. <br /> <br /> All these men and their families are gathered in the film in different scenes. The stories of these men are intimately intertwined. <br /> <br /> This film truly defines the meaning of "classical". This unforgettable drama (winner of the best film in 1946) is a film that everyone should see. <br /> <br /> If you were asked to choose a favorite movie, that would be the case! <br /> <br /> Out I would give "The best years of our life" a 10. <br /> <br /> So the next time you go to your local video store, rent this movie, you do not you will not regret it! <br /> <br /> NO questionable material from a good family film.
