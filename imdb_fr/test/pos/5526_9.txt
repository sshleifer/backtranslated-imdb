The gimmick, so to speak, of this 1934 comedy Paramount is made up of six comedy performers, gathered in three teams of men and women, all appearing together. W. C. Fields and his frequent screen partner, Alsion Skipworth, appear in the second part of the film and shine in their sheriff and innkeeper roles in a small town. Fields seems to have had the opportunity to inject a lot of his own unique series of misanthropic and surreal comedies into his game, and it works wonders, especially when he's allowed to do his famous billiard routine, a welcome digression because hilarious. <br /> <br /> Originally, one would have thought that it would have seemed inappropriate to design a film that would be carried by the subtle domestic comedy of Charlie Ruggles and Mary Boland next to the A wide jokey vaudeville of the great cast of comedians George Burns and Gracie Allen, but here it works perfectly because of the roles given to George and Gracie in the screenplay. There are freelancers who go up to California on a honeymoon between Ruggles and Boland and systematically find a way to annoy them at every step, including, brilliantly, while they stand each at the edge of a cliff to stay desire. <BR/> <br /> Creating comic boredom between Burns and Allen for two likeable characters turns out to be a great way to incorporate their larger, larger-than-life comedy characters into a real-life comedy - the comedy of those who react in a credible way, they turn out to be as much a gold mine as the famous naive delivery of Gracie. <br /> <br /> Charlie Ruggles deserves special mention for his performance as a fussy banker "Pinky" Whinney. He is wonderfully subtle and understated, and bursts of laughter that, in the hands of another actor, may not even have been heard. <br /> <br /> The script is wonderfully witty, and most of the time, it's a comedy to perfection of The frustration of our sympathies with the poor Whinneys who can not stand alone, and the added benefit is that what frustrates them is just more top-notch comedy material from Burns and Allen. <br /> <br /> For pre-code observers, there are some rather suggestive elements in some of the most fun scenes, while Whinney tries to make George understand why he and his wife want to be alone A little of time. <br /> <br /> There are some signs of a hasty production here - the occasional jump, one of the most obvious scenery you'll ever see in a movie (right up there with WC Field's own "The Golf Specialist") and the knot of Field's Tie is constantly changing shape. These do not bother me, however, and they should not bother anyone who appreciates the movie. <br /> <br /> "Six of a Kind" is a little known gem and one of the funniest movies I've seen in a while. If you plan to watch or not, the answer should be yes.
