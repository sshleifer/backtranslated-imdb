I did not know anything about this movie until I saw it ... my brother actually suggested I take a look. Normally, his suggestions are not a lot of cops though, but as I was not looking for something to watch, I watched it. <br /> <br /> Well, to sum it up, I give it 10/10. <Br/> <br /> The film is centered on two people who meet by living in the same place. One is at first dependent on the institution around him, the other is a rebel. One does what he likes, the other, as he says. <br /> <br /> From the first moments of the film, we quickly see the friendship between the two buildings and see how they rub a little. It is a remarkable job, which manages to tell a good story without shame, people jumping out of the bath or superheroes coming to save the situation. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of courage and reality. inside, everything can not go right - all the chasms can never be covered - and this film is a perfect example of the lot. <br /> <br /> If you watch this movie and you are not impressed ..... I suggest you do not look at anything anymore.
