I have not managed to completely block this film from memory, even though I have not seen it for two years. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, I've long forgotten the main story - The relationship between Kidman and Law did not impress me, but it's the movie's torture scenes that really made me hit. I cried for about two hours right after that. <br /> <br /> I never imagined how people in war could take advantage of something as pure as a mother's love. We see several examples here - in scenes with Natalie Portman and with the mother with her fingers in the fence to keep her son hidden at home. I was shocked by these scenes and I will probably never watch the film again because the scenes, even now, are perfectly clear in my mind. However, I am happy to have watched the film simply because it made me aware of the horrors of war and the cruel cruelty humanity can inflict on itself. <br /> <br /> The blond albino character is at the top of my list of the meanest villains since I saw the movie. His horrible sneer and lack of any human feeling towards the people he tortured really touched a nerve with me. At one point, I wanted to go to the movies and kill him myself (see the film pushed me beyond reason, it later appeared to me that I would only one big screen - this shows the intensity at least). <br /> <br /> I recommend the film for its pure experience, not for its love affair, but for the way it describes the war without the need for a battlefield.
