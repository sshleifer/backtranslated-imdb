Batman Returns should be considered a quality when talking about superhero movies. In my opinion, his predecessor, Batman, is by far the largest and most well-thought-out comic genre. For Batman Returns to be disappointing, he did not completely watch the movie and considered Danny Devito's game as the Penguin. Devito and Walken offer memorable moments. The story of Batman is supposed to be dark and Tim Burton perfectly understood how the comic describes Batman. Batman Returns provides comic relief, action, suspense and fantasy; and this should not be considered a "shit", although we are all entitled to our own opinions.
