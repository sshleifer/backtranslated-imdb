Eisenstein's first sound film tells the story of the 1242 ice battle, during which Alexander Nevsky's Russians defeated the Livonian knights, anxious to subject Russia to Roman Catholicism. Made in 1938, Nevsky can be considered as an element of propaganda: the Germanic knights, with their sinister (and somewhat awkward) helmets, are obvious replacements for the Nazis. The butchery of the knights when they enter a Russian city seems to be a prophetic warning of the massacres of the Second World War. The film ends with a warning: those who came to Russia with the sword will die by the sword. Made in delicate black and white (reminiscent of the daguerreotype), it also marks the official return of Eisenstein. Towards the end of the 1920s, Stalin asked Soviet filmmakers to stop their experiments and make more populist and enjoyable films for the Russian public. This stopped Eisenstein's career in Russia for a decade, and at Nevsky he returned with his film more accessible. The strong point of Nevsky is in its second half, which stages the battle itself. It is rightly considered a milestone in the film's history: never before (and probably never after) a battle would have been so vivid on the screen. Another highlight is Prokofiev's beautiful soundtrack (using a composer to score a movie was quite unusual at the time). One of his weak points: the comic relief (in the form of two simple Russian warriors trying to woo a handsome Russian peasant) is really shocking.
