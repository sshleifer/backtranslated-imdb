As an English teacher, I appreciate movies that do more than tell a story. Good films, like good literature, make you think, think and predict. This film made me do all three. Mr. Jansen takes risks and uses prefiguration, symbolism and interesting turns for many of his characters. I also like the fact that, despite the choices the characters make in the movie, their choices do not seem as teen or criminal as the ones I've seen before. The acting is pretty good and the actors seem to share good chemistry with each other. Excellent soundtrack, with songs you do not hear on the radio. It is a reconciling film with life and spontaneous travels that deserves more than a second look.
