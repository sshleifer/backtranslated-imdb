This film is basically a very well done production and gives a good impression of a war situation and its effects on the people involved. It's always interesting to see the story on the other side for a change. This film focuses on a group of German soldiers who, after fighting in the North African campaign, are sent to Stalingrad, Russia, where one of the most notorious and bloody battles of the Second World War is taking place World War. <br /> <br /> It's interesting. to see the other side of the battle, since we mainly consider the Germans as mere "villains". In this film, these "bad guys" have a human face and voice, which allows you to realize that the only real enemy of the war is the war itself and not necessarily the ones you are fighting against. At first, it's a bit difficult to focus on the film because you always have in mind that the Germans are the bad guys. But of course, you get used to it quickly and quickly adapt the Germans to the main characters of the film. You even start worrying about everything and getting interested in them. <br /> <br /> The story of this story is not how But not the best. It's hard to keep track of the story from time to time because it goes from one sequence to another. The film is not always logical in its story and has a few too vague sequences. It is also usually difficult to separate the characters and see who is who. It does not always make it easy to watch, but again, there are enough footage and moments in this film to make it interesting and interesting, but not the most coherent. In this respect, Hollywood films are always better than European films. <br /> <br /> The production values ​​are high and present beautiful scenery and places, even if the film was not even shot in Russia. This helps to create a good wartime atmosphere. <br /> <br /> The characters are mostly interesting, although it may be a slightly light formula. But I do not know, for some reason, stereotyped characters always work well in war movies and reinforce drama and realism. It also helps the fact that they are played by well-cast actors. Not all actors are the best-known actors (Thomas Kretschmann was also an unknown actor at the time), but each one fits well with his role and gives his characters a unique face and personality. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is not the best or most consistent drama of the Second World War, but it is definitely worth the detour, because of its original approach to the German side of the Battle of Stalingrad and its good production values. <br /> <br /> 7 / ten
