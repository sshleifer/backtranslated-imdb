I loved this film! Markie Post is really great. I've seen it all my life, and it's part of the same entertaining group as movies such as "The Betty Broderick Story," "Locked Up: A Mother's Fury," and so on. ... {which, by the way, are also very good, fun movies!} It's an extreme drama, about a single mom trying to break with her predictable middle-class personality. This movie is just pure entertainment! Heroin addiction is not necessarily realistic. But, this shows how an "ordinary" middle class person can (and they do!) Become addicted to heroin. Junkies are not just homeless people without street education. {By the way, if you look at him, look at how the kid is running his mother! Spoiled!} 8 out of 10 stars.
