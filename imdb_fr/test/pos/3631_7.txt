Let's be fair: there are no rules for scriptwriting, so I will not say that the film SHOULD be anything other than what it is. I will just express my opinion. Okay, I really liked the script, the way things are said and the characters introduced. However, I think that when a piece is adapted to the big screen, it could perhaps try to adapt to this other medium. As this film was directed by João Falcão, the same man who directed the play, it is not very surprising that the film was a bit too theatrical. This is the first film of the man, to cry aloud! What I'm saying is that the film contains parts - like the city of Nordestina, which slightly resembles the décor of "Maria's Hoje é Dia" - that give the impression that we are not in the cinema. We are at the theater! The lines are pronounced too formally, the characters move in a choreographic way and the enlightenment is clearly intended for a scene. Of course, that might have been the intention, but it was done. On the scene. Wonderful things have been done when adapting a play to a movie - the magnificent "Closer", for example. When I went to see this one, however, I did not feel like watching a movie. But overall, it was a good project to watch. It's a beautiful love story, sometimes funny and sad for others. My vote is a 7.
