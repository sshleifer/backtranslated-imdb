I grew up in New York and every afternoon ABC showed the 4:30 movie - Saratoga Trunk was one of the first movies I remember watching when I was a child. I loved this movie and he stayed with me for years. I recently watched it again and I still thought it was great - maybe I'm just a romantic - but I thought it was well done. I do not mean that this film was good only because of the main actors - I really did not know who they were when I first saw this movie - I guess I just knew the quality of the game. actor. Bergman and Cooper were excellent. I especially enjoyed seeing old New Orleans at the time of this movie. If you have the chance to visit New Orleans - you should watch movies showing the city at that time - when you come across old houses in the French Quarter (not just Bourbon Street) or upscale neighborhoods, Imagine Life as it was 100 years ago. <br /> <br /> I like old movies - this one is a good movie !!
