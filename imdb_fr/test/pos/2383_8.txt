Scooby Doo and the monster of Mexico were without a doubt the weakest modern animated characters of Scooby Doo. The monster of Loch Ness represents a considerable improvement. <br /> <br /> This time, the gang goes to Scotland to attend the Highland Games and visit Blake Castle, Daphne's ancestral home. And do not you know that the castle is in the picturesque fishing village of Drumnadrochit, on the shores of Loch Ness. <br /> <br /> During their stay, they meet some interesting people. First there is Fiona Pembrooke, a scientist who has spent all her money researching the Loch Ness monster. <br /> <br /> Sir Ian Locksley, the patron of the National Heritage Museum of Scotland, is an outspoken believer. from Nessie. <br /> <br /> The Haggarts, the clean a cozy inn on the banks of the loch. The sons are a couple of local jokers, still in the wrong. <br /> <br /> Del Chilman, a wild and paranoid hippie guy who is convinced that the monster is out there and will stop at nothing to find her. <Br /> <br /> And finally, Duncan MacGubbin, the quay captain who saw Nessie too often to count. <br /> <br /> Most of these characters are stereotypes, which is a bit awkward to teach to a younger audience. a load of shit and giving the wrong impression. However, if you are immune, everything will be fine. Being from Scotland, I can not help but wince at the Scottish accents that look terribly like imitations. Fact: we do not sound like that. <br /> <br /> Soon, Nessie, who looks more demonic than usual, shows up and wreaks havoc. It looks like the band has another mystery on his hands. Shaggy's usual pursuit scenes, clues and goofy disguises follow. There are a lot of laughs. The animation is splendid, with some scenes and atmospheric places. And the plot is much better than Monster of Mexico. <br /> <br /> The only bad thing this time is the music. The notation of Louis Febre I miss and the songs here are pretty rotten too. Where are the Hex Girls when you need them? <br /> <br /> Region 2 DVD is crystal clear 1.78: 1 crystal clear (Region 1 is not) with Dolby 5.0 sound. Some extras are included. It's really worth it.
