No real plot, no character development, no Scorcese level leadership, but seriously, did you really expect that? The only thing that matters is that this movie is absolutely hilarious, almost the same level as Borat. Of course, the end hangs a bit, but if Borat's cameo does not scare you, you must be the worst boy in boys' history. Sacha Baron Cohen is perhaps the greatest VIVANT comedian, and here he laughs more than Jude Law on a nudist beach. I challenge you not to laugh. <br /> <br /> If you can remove the pole more than 10 feet from your behind for an hour and a half and settle for some well-synchronized and extremely stupid stupid character jokes, see this stupid movie. You will be glad to have done it. Keep your feet on the ground!
