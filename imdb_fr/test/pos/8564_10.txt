I gave a 10 because it's the best movie of its kind ... a good old movie T & A in the shadow and spirit of "Animal House". I saw this with a similar movie called "Swap Meet" and the two were good ... a great way to spend a Saturday afternoon. Let's be honest ... there are more breasts in this movie than you could imagine for a R-rated movie. From start to finish, they just seem to continue to appear on the screen (tanning scenes, scenes bedroom and, of course, the decisive football match). Also, a memorable kissing booth (Kiss me, Clutz!) Everyone seems to have fun in his roles (several Playboy Playmates, Danny Bonaduce, several known TV and movie actors, etc.). The only complaint I have to make is that Lisa London's character is called by her family name "O'Hara" and not by a good name from the 1970s as "Olivia" (or even by Ora or Ona or O. .. ?? !!). I saw him again at the end of the 1980s with my ex-wife (who is getting on his own) and she could not believe I really enjoyed the movie! She was probably jealous !! Again, this movie is a great way to spend a Saturday afternoon ... but do not think too much!
