I had not planned to leave a criticism, but seeing other appalling critics for this film, I had to say something. <br /> <br /> I will not give the end or anything, but I give some important points of the plot in this review, so you should be aware of it. The short version (non-spoiler) of my review - Samuel L. Jackson and Geena Davis are both very fierce in this film, and it's very entertaining. Look at the. <br /> <br /> This movie is one of my favorites of all time. Geena Davis is perfect as an action heroine, torn between her housewife life and her mother, and the memories that resurface from her former life as a CIA assassin. Her performance is superb because she perfectly interprets the two facets of this relatively complex character. <br /> <br /> The performance of Samuel L. Jackson is, as always, excellent too, as is the private detective that Geena Davis's character has hired to examine his forgotten past. He does a great job playing the involuntary sidekick of Geena Davis' tough character. Some of the lines he sets out in this film are the best he has ever used in all the movies he has visited. <br /> <br /> Seriously, if you have not seen it, do it. It's a fantastic story with lots of unexpected twists, and it's extremely well directed and played.
