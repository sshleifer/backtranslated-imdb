Do not let any criticism (critics, users of IMDb or mine) influence you to see this movie. I only read the premise of the plot and became intrigued. After watching, this movie, in my opinion, is definitely worth seeing. This gives a perspective of life that many have probably not considered. This is not, however, as Leland himself says, a film that "can be packed in a neat package with a bow and all the rest". Other user reviews on this website claim to have a psychological background and imply that the story is not achievable. Obviously, they missed the entire movie, which is disappointing. the least we can say. <br /> <br /> In short, this is a well-played and well-made film. The story is not a good idea, but I have the feeling that if you do not survive, you may have missed something. To call it a "house of art" is unfair, in my opinion, but because our society loves labels, it's probably the right one. If you know that you know everything about the world ... I would suggest you skip this one. If you think that movies should be a form of "world escape" ... you will not find them here. But if you look at it, you may find something in you.
