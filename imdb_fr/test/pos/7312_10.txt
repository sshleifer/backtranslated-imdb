A rich old lady is appealing to a flirtatious divorcee to seduce a Lothario away from her silly little girl who will soon be getting married. <br /> <br /> LET US BE GAY is an interesting little domestic comedy with a tangy dialogue (courtesy of the famous screenwriter Frances Marion) & good performances. Although this may seem a bit gloomy at times, it can probably be attributed to the difficulties encountered with the first sound technologies that tended to limit action and movement. <br /> <br /> Norma Shearer can be attributed the opportunity to appear in this minor film rather than using her undisputed weight as Irving Thalberg's spouse to insist only on high quality images. She is particularly effective in her early scenes, where a lean and flat makeup makes her almost unrecognizable. Its extreme metamorphosis from goose to swan has only happened in Hollywood, but it is not profitable to spend a lot of time worrying about it. <br /> <br /> Rod LaRocque does not behave very well as an adulterous husband of Shearer. Very popular during silent days, the talks were not particularly nice with him and his career would suffer. Here, his role is not the least sympathetic and we must ask what masochistic impulse encourages women to desire the boy. <br /> <br /> The magnificent Marie Dressler is at her disposal as an eccentric dowager on Long Island. As a great friend of Frances Marion, one can easily imagine that the part was written expressly for her. Full of cranks and blacks, she is very humorous. However, the extraordinary warmth and essential goodness that would soon make her biggest Hollywood star are largely missing. <br /> <br /> Among the supporting actors, Hedda Hopper presents herself as a snake of society, Wilfred Noy playing a comical butler. Moviegoers will spot little Dickie Moore, the young son of Shearer and the old Mary Gordon, his governess, both uncredited.
