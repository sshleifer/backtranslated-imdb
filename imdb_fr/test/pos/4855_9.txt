I just saw him at the Toronto International Film Festival. Neal Slavin's lead actors include William Macy (seen in The Contender at TIFF last year), Meat Loaf (Alias ​​Meat Loaf Aday, Alias ​​Michael Lee Aday), David Paymer and Laura Dern (also in Novocaine, also Festival). <br /> <br /> Based on Arthur Miller's novel of the same name, Focus follows Christian Newman (Macy), a Jewish-looking Christian, who fights hatred and anti-Semitism in his neighborhood. Between the owner of the Jewish shop on the street (Paymer) and his antisemitic neighbor Card Holder (Meat Loaf) Newman faces difficulties in dealing with internal conflicts and conflicts around him. The guilt of knowing what is right but to do nothing is to want to blend in peace and maintain peace with one's neighbors. Things get complicated when he meets Gertrude (Dern), whom everyone believes is Jewish. Gertrude teaches her husband some things about judging books on blankets. <br /> <br /> Will Newman end up taking the defense of the Jewish man or will he flee? Go see him to find out. <br /> <br /> The acting game was fabulous. The writing was amazing. The cinematography was excellent. The sound was well done. Technically incredible, the film was disturbing. Chilling. Emotionally intense. I found myself several times to put my knees in the fetal position. I have great admiration for all those who worked on it. I have not seen a film that good for a long time. It touched me. <br /> <br /> Wow.
