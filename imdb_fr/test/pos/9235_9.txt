This film proves that you do not need a Hollywood budget to create something fun to watch. What keeps me in mind is the way the crew from different places was able to associate with no promise of wealth and do something just because he believed it. I think anyone who makes low-budget films can understand certain scenes, such as actors who just can not understand a single line, who are embarrassed by the police and most of whom disappear after the first week. No one has been paid for this, which speaks volumes for people who have had to travel around the country and for the long hours spent editing. After seeing Stuie sell his personal property, use his own money and destroy his house to make the film, I'm a little curious to know how much his wife is about to leave. Good work everyone.
