In general, Alan Alda plays characters too "sweet" and too verbal - that's probably how he lives. This time, it corresponds to the character. Although he exaggerates when the verdict is pronounced. <br /> <br /> For many of us, the reaction of the Attica prison in 1971 and the reaction of the State of New York is a terrifying event. Only a few journalists told the true story. This film offers a quick look at the horrors and excesses associated with the Attica riot / revolt. Attica had a major impact on this country. Maybe the movie will encourage someone to research the story. <br /> <br /> I do not remember a feature shot from the prisoners' point of view - although there is an excellent PBS movie with Attica survivors / participants. The perspective of the guards held hostage is explored in "Against the Wall" with Kyle MacLachlan, Samuel L. Jackson, Clarence Williams III and Frederic Forrest. <br /> <br /> During the day, we shouted: "Attica, Attica!" It was nice to hear it in the movie. Memories. <br /> <br /> The worst parts of the film are the natural wigs that Morris Chestnut and other African Americans have to wear. It would have been easy for these people to cultivate a Fro.
