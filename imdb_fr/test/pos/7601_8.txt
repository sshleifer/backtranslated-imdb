Drew Barrymore has a second chance at high school, on a sting job as a journalist. In flashbacks, we see that the first time was, to say the least, a major disaster. David Arquette plays a modest role in the role of Drew's brother, who also registers to help a sister. Many secondary intrigues endanger, but never overwhelm the simple charm of the film. Drew continues to make a name for herself as an innocent and sexy major light actress.
