Instead of looking at the recycled history of "Pearl Harbor" with nothing new to reveal except for a few real events involving a few individuals, so that filmmakers can say they have contributed to the broadcast of the history, with nothing but CGI explosions replacing for a sanded romantic triangle. You have to go see Dark Blue World. <br /> <br /> This film takes place during the historic period of the Second World War, during which Czech pilots left their country and fought for the RAF instead of laying down their arms and giving in to the Nazis. It was a part of the story that had to be told at least once to the outside world. A love triangle is formed between the main characters, but one of them does not die as in Pearl Harbor, but by sacrifice for a true friendship. The film is tragic after tragedy, without even a bittersweet end, with our hero not taking advantage of the glory of taking back his country, the return of the love of his current lover, the return of the love of his lover reunited , or even the return of the unconditional love by his pet all his life. He is heartbroken and does not feel worse in the Russian labor camp. Hollywood would probably change that kind of end if it was their scenario. <br /> <br /> The film sometimes plays on the sentimental, but it also shows the humanity of people. All in all, an interesting movie.
