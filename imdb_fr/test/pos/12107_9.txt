This film offers a fascinating journey into one of today's most fascinating cities - Istanbul - and its musicians. Do not expect a compilation of Turkish folklore or anything like that. Alexander Hacke, a German musician and member of the cult band "Einst√ºrzende Neubauten" goes to Istanbul to get acquainted with the music scene. His sparse voice about what he lives is a guideline in the film. However, German-Turkish director Faith Akin lets different Istanbul artists express themselves - and of course their music. <br /> <br /> You will meet a variety of personalities, big stars and street musicians, young and old, playing many musical styles. But this film does not only show you the sound of Istanbul. It also provides a compelling picture of Istanbul today and how Turkey has progressed over the past decade. The film characterizes its protagonists with subtle humor, but never without respect. All share a passion for music and the conviction of its power. <br /> <br /> Akin once again shows his talent for representing diversity in a fun way when he brings you closer to completely different musical scenes. After her award-winning feature film "Gegen die Wand", Faith Akin proves with "Crossing the Bridge" that he is quite capable of touching, entertaining and guiding his audience in a documentary. If you have never been to Istanbul, you will want to go after seeing the movie.
