Go see this movie. The group offers great songs (Classico, Pick of Destiny, Master Exploder, etc.). All this with the humor of Teancous D makes it the best movie of all time. <br /> <br /> The cameos are great at the back, with Meat Loaf and Dio singing for JB. Ben Stiller and Tim Robbins are great, I really like the character of Tim Robbins. You also find out who is really Satan! Musical and musical references are hilarious and great. The songs of Playin are excellent songs of The Who, Dio and others just to complete it. Personally, I did not think that the band could surpass the great D songs, but they did it with songs like Classico and Master Exploder. Seriously great music. <br /> <br /> Go see it, it's a must for anyone who loves rock!
