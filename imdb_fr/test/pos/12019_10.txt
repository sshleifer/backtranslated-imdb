Richard Norton really illuminates the screen of this masterpiece of martial arts based in Portland, Oregon. Norton, an Australian idol, plays the role of the devilish Mr. Milverstead, who successfully leads an import / export business that negotiates weapons and trades in women's flesh. Usually, women are removed from their favorite dance club with the help of a band of the most famous morons, Bolo Yeung, who plays the role of Ice. The trouble comes for Milverstead when a new city cop, John Kim (Britton Lee), wants to avenge the assassination of his deceased partner, murdered by the Milverstead organization. If you have time to see a single martial arts movie this year, do not miss this classic.
