Belonging to the sub-genre of future post-apocalyptic films, this is a very very intimate stylistic episode. The most noticeable element of the film is its silence. no one is speaking. I do not think Besson, despite what is evident in most of her subsequent work, has referred to it as a kind of cool gadget. I think what makes it so smart and effective is the fact that, without any other means of communication, everyone has to read on the basis of intuition and the transmission of emotion, as slight as it is. Although I am not stuck on the screen, thinking, I see it as a very touching and sensitive point of view on human nature. His vehicle is the stylized science fiction film. Part of his thinking about the nature of the human world is that each of his humans is not necessarily played like a perfect human being: the hero, a wanderer in the new sorry world, is cared for by an old preserve his share an exchange of food between him and a hoarse and brutal character played by Jean Reno. Reno tries everything he can, mainly using brute force, to get what he wants. So, the antagonist is right, although it is not a good person, and the protagonist and his friendly foil are both wrong, although they are both good people. edited and captured in a discrete but fast and small-scale approach, and its actors are very real. How can they not be? Like their characters, they have only the bare necessities to communicate. This is one of the few really good films written by Luc Besson. His previous work is almost always better than the down he now makes.
