I thought the scenario was very well put in place. I really enjoyed this film. If you want to get rid of a Bridget Fonda movie, you can just rot. I thought moaning about movie stars was a bad idea. Apparently, someone does not think so. I rather enjoyed the movie. I even think of buying it. I want it to be my very first DVD for my room. That's how I like it. I would prefer not to start an online quarrel with someone I do not know and be it for a movie. If anyone could gently retract what he said about the script, I would be more than happy to take my insult. However, if they feel that I am not worthy of a retraction, I could simply think that they are not worth it either. But I can not control their actions, I can only encourage them in the right direction. Hey, they do not have to make a retraction, but I would appreciate it greatly.
