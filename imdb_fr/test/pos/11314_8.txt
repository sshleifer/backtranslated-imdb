Before seeing this picture, I was rather skeptical, I do not like movies with a calendar or the fear of having to think like the writer. I was also scared that it looks like the 2-part "10.4" mini-series that had a wacky concept, little connection to the real world and a very bad performance. At first it says: "This film is a fiction, but the events described and information on emergency planning in the UK are based on extensive research"; and the general feeling is that you are not sold for an idea, but that you are taught a lesson in civil conscience. The message that is transmitted is obvious from the beginning: it arrives and we are not prepared. The use of real locations and a scenario that could not only happen (there are plans to do this) all contribute to the disruptive effect that the film will have, even on the most cynical viewers. The perspective of the film is that of society and it stays away from heartbreaking personal moments, which will not convey the message, so that no drama of Romeo-Juliet is accustomed to us.
