I was in my early twenties and had just graduated from university when this movie appeared. Seeing this event had a significant impact, not only because of the high quality of the film (as evidenced by its many awards), but also because of its place in the historical context of 1959. Due to the social progress achieved since then, it is almost impossible to understand that my university was only beginning to admit black students (carefully selected) in 1953. A classic, high-budget extravagance with an almost entirely black cast was a distinct novelty in 1959. <br /> <br /> The film featured a deluxe roadshow presentation in the best theaters, with a souvenir program detailing lighting and color care, multi-track stereo sound, and more. Almost all the black artists that we, Whites, had the knowledge of were in the movie. Gershwin's music, superbly interpreted, and the universal humanity of the story were extremely moving. <br /> <br /> I recently managed to get a faded copy of a two-hour film break, and repeated viewing confirmed my opinion. With time, the sex scenes that seemed hot in 1959 seemed pretty tame, but the musical quality has not diminished. Sammy Davis and Pearl Bailey are masterful in their performances. What a crime that today's young black artists can not see these artists at the top of their careers!
