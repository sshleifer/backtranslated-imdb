I saw this movie when it came out. I thought what average movie. I just realized that this director was ahead of his time. It's an excellent movie and an excellent soundtrack. I saw my share of rock movies but although it is far from being in the center of the spine (which I did not like)> This film plunges us into the life of a rocker of the 80s who do not want anything else. It's nothing more than our inner child who wants to grow up and become a * ROCK STAR * Yeah I said it. Everyone wants to grow up and be in the spotlight (Weather says or not). This film immerses you in the heart of emotions and you can almost feel the excitement of Izzy. I must admit that the acting was less up to par, but the music and the story were enough to hold you back, until the credits arrived. It's worth it, especially if you're a fan of powerful Ole hair groups.
