This is without a doubt the most amazing and amazing documentary I have ever seen! The images presented are breathtaking and breathtaking. On top of that, it's a wonderful learning experience. I'm not one to make educational documentaries, but this one grabs you and does not let you go all the way. You'll be so hooked and fascinated by what you're watching that you'll forget about it at home while watching TV! This series is available for purchase on DVD and I highly recommend choosing this one! With all the evil and death in this world, this documentary series gives us the proof that life is beautiful and that it deserves to be saved and preserved.
