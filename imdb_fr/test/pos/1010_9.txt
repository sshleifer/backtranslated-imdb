Hehehe. It was one of the best fun road movies of all time! I laughed so I fell off the chair. With many Norwegian and foreign celebrities are playing. Harald Zwart is the producer, known for such films as Agent Cody Banks and of course One Night at McCool's. <br /> <br /> There is talk of crazy Norwegian fans heading to the 2006 World Cup in Germany 2006. crazy fun that comes with it. It was hilarious. I could not help laughing. I have not had so much fun for ages. Rumors say there will come a number two, but I do not know. It will be hard to beat this one. <br /> <br /> recommended to all! It's a must-see movie. I was supposed to see him at the movies, but I was working at the time he was shown. And try to rent it for a month, but all the time rented. I have it today on DVD. It's really worth it.
