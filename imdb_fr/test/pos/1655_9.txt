Rififi is a great film that is neglected. It's a criminal drama where a man gets out of prison and plans another job. It is an overused story but this one is different from the others. They gather the usual suspects for the job. This film shows how the family is torn with time. The burglary scene is one of the best I've ever seen. Instead of a soundtrack suspense, the director decided to leave in silence, about thirty minutes of silence. This fits perfectly with the mood and is often copied nowadays. Of course, things get out of control and people die, which ends with a great ending that creates suspensions. <br /> <br /> So, if you are looking for a great movie noir that few people talk about it is a good pickup.
