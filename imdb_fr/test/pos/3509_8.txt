The cover of the VHS says it all: "Without a doubt the most powerful film of its kind since the Texas Chainsaw Massacre". I am a big fan of the slashers of the 70s and 80s and I must say that I agree 100%. The characters are credible, the actors have an excellent charm (especially George Kennedy as a ranger). There is the twisted atmosphere, only TCM has, an amazing soundtrack that reflects the emotions and filming locations that are the most beautiful in the history of horror. This film must be one of the most beautiful horror movies of all time! As director of this low-budget 1981 film, Jeff Lieberman has done an excellent job and, with his other works (Blue Sunshine, Wrong Turn), he must be one of the most underrated directors of the film. film industry.
