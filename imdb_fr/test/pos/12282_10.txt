loved the story of a guy trying to get his daughter back ... been there, done, so I can tell ... anyway, I like the camera work, how sometimes the camera is "left on, "and they're just sitting there talking about the scene, or other things ... or the way the camera follows it to find the cast and what's not ... I've looked at this on IFC last year and loved it, so I told a few of my friends about it, and some of them looked at it, and they also liked it. .. check it if you can, a little girly, but it's still a good movie ... I gave it a 10/10 because of two reasons ... one: I can tell .. but all those who have fallen in love and made a mistake can tell ... two: it's a very creative way to make a film, it's like you're still there, right in the middle of a shoot ... as I said, great movie
