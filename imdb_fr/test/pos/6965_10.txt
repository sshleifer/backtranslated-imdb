Sixth (and last) film of the box. Well, it looks like I kept the best for last. Ghoulies IV. Originally, I made a criticism for the month of February, but I decided to make a new one. The Ghoulies series is really great. I know some people do not like them, and that's good. This happens to be my favorite in the series. Yes, I know that the Ghoulies do not appear and are replaced by two men in costumes, including Tony Cox of Bad Santa. Now in the movie. <br /> <br /> The film is centered on Jonathan Graves, the main character of the first film, played again by Peter Liapis, who is now a cop for the LAPD and has spent the occult behind him. During the first part of the film, we meet Alexandra (interpreted by the hot Stacie Randall) communicating with a demon of the other name, Faust, which is the dark side of Jonathan. Faust asks Alexandra a red jewel and something goes wrong, freeing the Ghoulies of the afterlife. <br /> <br /> I think Jim Wynorski did a good job with the staging. And Chuck Cirino's music is funny too. (SPOILER AHEAD) At the end of this film, the Ghoulies say that there will be a Ghoulies IV, Part 2, or Ghoulies V. I still hope that this sequel will be made and I especially hope that Jim Wynorski will return to the scene. I agree with GimboTheGhoulies about it.
