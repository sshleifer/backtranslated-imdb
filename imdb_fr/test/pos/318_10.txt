I first saw APOCALYPSE NOW for the first time in 1985, when it aired for the first time on British television. After seeing this masterpiece, I was upset and, despite fierce competition from FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING, this film remains my favorite of all time, almost 20 years after I saw it for the first time time. <br /> <br /> This poses the problem of how I can even start commenting on the film. I could praise the technical aspects, especially the sound, editing and cinematography, but everyone seems to have praised (and rightly so) these feats to heaven, while the performances in general and Robert Duvall in particular have also been noted, and all the others mentioned the dark images of the Dou Long Bridge and the assembly of the boat going up after the border <br /> <br /> What about the scenario? Francis Ford Coppola is best known as a director, but he is still a genius as a screenwriter, as I have already been as a director. I said "it" was a thing of the past because making this movie seems to have burned all the cells of the creative brain in his head, but his sacrifice was worth it. In John Milius' original solo draft, we have a scenario as crazy and disturbing as the one on the screen, but Coppola's involvement in the script gave him a story that exactly matches the story of the war. See how the screenplay begins in a jingoistic and macho way with a Bill Kilgore star who would not have seemed angry in THE GREEN BERETS, but as the story progresses, everything becomes shocking and foolish, to the point that Kurtz's time is running out. before the audience watches another movie in the same way that the characters have navigated to another dimension. When Coppola declares "This film does not concern Vietnam, it is Vietnam", he is right. What began as a patriotic war to defeat the communist aggression of the mid-1960s (the Manson trial suggests it dates from 1970) had changed the American view of the world and of oneself and of the vision that the world in America <br /> This is the crazy beauty of APOCALYPSE NOW that makes it a masterpiece of cinema and that says more about the brutality of conflict and hypocrisy Politicians (What did you do in the Vietnam War, Mr. President?) that Michael Moore could hope to say in a lifetime. I have not seen the REDUX version yet, but looking at the original text, I did not think there was anything missing in the story that, like all really cool movies, is very basic. In fact, the premise can lend itself to many other genres, such as a western where an army officer must find and kill a renegade colonel who runs an unjust war party, or a sci-fi film in which an assassin UN eliminates one of his colleagues. soldier who leads a resistance movement on Mars, although this is probably due to Joseph Conrad's original novel <br /> <br /> My favorite movie of all time and so it is quite judicious that I chose this film to be my thousandth criticism at the IMDb
