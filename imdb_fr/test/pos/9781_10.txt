My family and I enjoy this show and find a fair overview of what people have been through. <br /> <br /> My own father spent some time in Changi before boarding the Thailand-Burma "F" railway. Obligate. Although much has been said about the treatment of prisoners of war, I will simply say that my father weighed 6 feet 1 inch and 196 pounds when Singapore fell. At the end of the war, he was 5 feet 11 inches tall and weighed 91 pounds. <BR /> <br /> No show can really tell what prisoners of war have been through, but it is close to many others. <br /> <br /> As the former prisoner of war says, "If you did not have a partner, you did not survive." This show managed to get that message across.
