The Merchant of Venice 8/10 <br /> <br /> (This article assumes a basic knowledge of history and can therefore be considered to contain information that interferes with the plot.) <br /> <br As a film version of the famous Shakespeare play, Merchant of Venice does what few adaptations have been made since Polanski's rather brutal Macbeth: he takes the spirit of the piece and brings it out as well as but better than the room alone reach. <br /> <br /> Peter Jackson, director of The Lord of the Rings, explained that it was possible to adapt a book or a play to three options: try to reproduce as faithfully as possible the original, use the original idea complete license for the change of cinema, or (the one he has confessed preferred), stay faithful to the original as much as possible in the cinema, but make the necessary modifications to the film and while remaining faithful to the intent or the spirit of the original. <br /> <br /> In Macbeth, Polanski used the rain-soaked beaches and the realistic rapes and murders to explain the bloody and horrible period in which the play was taking place, recalling the horrible context in which the characters are going. that bad. wise decisions. It differs from (for example) Branagh's Hamlet, which has reached new heights in terms of faithful reproduction, but also offered little novelty. Macbeth, on the other hand, perhaps allowed new audiences to enjoy some of the drama without a thorough study; similarly, more familiar audiences might find greater depth than unaided performance could accomplish. Such an interpretation plays a vital role in enabling the public to participate fully, not only intellectually but also emotionally, in the arguments that Shakespeare wanted to make. <br /> <br /> Radford's adaptation of Mercford of Venice does just that. This involves crucial moral dilemmas involving religious bigotry or keeping the promises and, with a minimum of damage in the sacred Bard tome, faithfully transmits them in the spirit of the original story. <br /> <br /> The first of these, religious bigotry, gives meaning to Shylock's otherwise bizarre behavior. We see the Jews of the day relegated to a walled ghetto, being allowed to go out only if they wore a red cap. Not being allowed to own property, one of the few ways to make a living is to lend money. This makes them both useful to their Christian oppressors and at the same time the object of their denigration. The idea behind (the old and the new testament) biblical bans against usury probably comes from the fact that we are not making a profit by helping our friends. This is extended by fanatical Christians to curse those on whom they spit (we see Shylock not only spit on, but also other Jews thrown into the waterways for sport - in an atmosphere that can only be described as threatening). <br /> <br /> The news of the film is curious, because the fanaticism of right-wing Christianity (embodied by the Americans who follow Bush) has turned in circles, now that they are the main supporters of Zionism and the Jewish political leaders bite at their Palestinian people. his neighbors as much as Shylock tries to bite Antonio (once he thinks the law gives him the power to do it). The psychology is obvious - hit a dog several times and it will become vicious. The circle continues easily as victims of oppression easily lose their sense of moral values ​​and become oppressors. <br /> <br /> The strict sleight of hand that the disguised Portia uses to save Antonio has some merit, both clever and skilful interpretation of the unsophisticated law that the Venetians of the play thus play at the street and also as a moral pointer. Shylock can "have his pound of flesh" according to his contract, but not have blood. An easy analogy could be made about war and terrorism - it is much easier to justify fights between fighters or attacks against criminals if the soldiers or the criminals are the only victims - when collateral damage is important, such as when innocent citizens, including women and children, are killed by hundreds, the arguments of warmongers (whether Israeli, Palestinian or American) have much less popular support. <br /> <br /> For a long time, one wonders if Shakespeare was anti-Semitic in this story. One wonders if he had to adapt the ending to a largely Christian audience that had little to do with the Jewish people. Far from teaching him greater good, the end imposes Christianity and humiliation on Shylock - a course likely to simply perpetuate repressed resentment. Both sides look just as bad - one holds more power than the other. The slight improvement of the judgment simply gives the Christian judges a better public image, or as Bassanio does it with such acuteness (observed when choosing the coffins and solving the riddles to win the hand of Portia): <br /> <br /> In religion, what a damned mistake, but some sober eyebrows will bless and approve it with a text, Hide the grossness with a beautiful ornament? There is no vice so simple, but supposes a certain mark of virtue on its outer parts. <br /> <br /> Of course, fanaticism applies to organized religion (rather than spirituality), especially when it is organized for political ends. easily encourages God-fearing people who are not used to splitting hairs. Kindness, mercy ("Chesed" in Judaism), which is so fundamental in true Christianity, is also practiced to a wonderful degree in Judaism as in most beliefs. The Jewish faith distinguishes kindness and charity, ways of practicing both effectively and ways of integrating them into one's being rather than just showing oneself outside. Shylock and Antonio are fanatics and use their respective beliefs to abuse those of another faith. While Shakespeare may have pointed out the gap between the goodness prescribed by different religions and its practical absence, the film version largely reduces the margin of interpretation of antisemitism and brings greater realism to psychological causes. <br /> <br /> Keeping promises (from men to their wives) is less well treated, as well as the comic elements inherent in cross-dressing subplots. Bassanio, how strong is his love for Antonio (are there homosexual elements?) Can not make a just moral judgment when he shows his gratitude to the "judge", and breaks his promise (for which Portia forgive by displaying a triumphant character for women, not only as supremely intelligent and spiritual but also as truly merciful and respectful of others than her male fanatical counterparts, including her husband.) <br /> <br /> Some of the actors are a bit overheated, and there are too many regional (English) accents, but overall, Merchant of Venice offers a fresh and enriching reworking of Shakespeare. I enjoyed the acting, as well as the beautiful soundtrack of Hayley Westenra and others, singing ballads written by both Shakespeare and Edgar Allen Poe. Overall, Merchant of Venice is a significant achievement in the British film tradition (as any film may be considered to have a particular nationality).
