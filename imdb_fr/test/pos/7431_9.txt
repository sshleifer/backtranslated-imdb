This film is based on the series of Final Fantasy games. This one particularly concerns FF7 or Final Fantasy VII. I loved the game and I was very happy to see it turn into a movie. I loved the CG, it was great. Many scenes of combat, action and great characters to make the film memorable. If you are a hardcore fan of the game, you will love this movie. Personally, I'm not a hardcore fan of games, but I'm starting to become one. <br /> <br /> My favorite character out of Final Fantasy VII, aside from Cloud, should be Cid. I like Cid, I think he's cute. I was surprised to see how the computer graphics were real. It was amazing, it's the game in 3D. I had a good time watching the movie and, besides, I love the aeons, especially Bahamut, he's great! Overall, I gave a 9 to this movie, because yes, I loved it. I thought it was really a very good movie, and yes it's on my list of movies to get. The characters were incredible, loved the pictures, the story was wonderful, with lots of action and fighting scenes. In short, it's the best movie I've seen so far, based on a video game.
