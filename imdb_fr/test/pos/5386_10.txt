I saw "Heaven-Ship" ("Himmelskibet") at the 2006 Cinema Muto festival in Sacile, Italy. What a beautiful movie! This Danish steampunk saga is the moving story of the first voyage to Mars, at a time when wireless telegraphy was not perfected yet. The spacecraft has no radio, and the heroes are brought back from the airfield via a horse cart. Even the subtitles are delicious ... some of them are written in rhymed couplets in original Danish. <br /> <br /> The representations of the actors are laughable, they are largely histrionic. But the sets are amazing, easily surpassing all that George Melies did a decade earlier (or in "Die Frau im Mond" a decade later). Of course, the plot is simplistic. The crew of the spaceship is composed of seven lean types and a big slob. Guess which one is cracking. Interestingly, everyone in this film (with the exception of dubious Professor Dubius) is a strong believer in God. Even the Martians. <br /> <br /> Impressive, the writers have the feeling to recognize that a trip to Mars is not an easy task: the title cards establish that it takes two years for scientists to build their spaceship ( who a) and six months to reach Mars. During the construction sequence, there is an extremely impressive installation that had to be choreographed: dozens of workers travel the site in different directions, without hesitation or collision. Danish scientists baptize their ship "Excelsior" ("packing material"?) And head for Mars, even though the Moon and Venus are closer. When the ship (which flies horizontally and not vertically) lands on Mars, it is greeted by "Marsboerne" - Martians - who turn out to be Nordic blondes, all pacifists and vegetarians very developed. (As a highly developed meat-eater, I felt resentment for this part.) <br /> <br /> Pretty conveniently, Mars turns out to have an Earth-like atmosphere, as well as a equal gravity. In an outer plane of the Martian landscape, the apparent magnitude of the Sun seen from Mars is identical to that observed from Earth. I could not help but notice that all the wisest old martians were men. In fact, older women are thin on the ground: the hero born of the Earth and the Martian girl have no mother. Martians speak a universal language, wear ankhs on their robes and welcome visitors to the Earth with a terrestrial globe ... which of course they hold with its North Pole up. <br /> <br /> This Martian girl is Marya, played by a Danish actress with aerial beauty. (Waiter, I'll have a little danish!) We see a Martian chastity dance that might have been ridiculous or ridiculous, but actually very touching and beautiful. In addition, the scene of the Martian funeral has a plan that reminds me of a sequence of "The Seventh Seal". I wonder if Ingmar Bergman saw this movie. <br /> <br /> "Himmelskibet" has some flaws, but its conception of production and its other merits far outweigh its disadvantages. The Ole Olsen featured in the credits (and appears in a brief prologue) is not related to Chic Johnson's vaudeville partner of "Hellzapoppin". I would give a "12" to "Himmelskibet", but the scale peaks at 10 ... so a total of 10 out of 10 for this lovely trip to Mars, the blonde planet!
