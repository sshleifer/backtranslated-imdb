Let's leave aside for a moment the cultural aspects of this film, even if it is a very important aspect of it, and let's look at the simple fact that it is a very beautiful love story. Two people find themselves in a difficult situation, caused by two selfish husbands. They must live their sad days without any glimmer of hope. If each of these two women had been alone, imagine what kind of life each one should have accepted. They found each other and fell in love. That this love is against all social, religious and cultural laws of their environment is almost irrelevant. They loved each other, were relieved each other, that was enough. The reaction of the people around them is only a small fact that they have to accept, even to suffer, then to continue their lives, their lives. Very pleasant.
