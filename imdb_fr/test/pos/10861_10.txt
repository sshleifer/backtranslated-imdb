I'm happy to have read Sarah Waters' novel first, because at the time I had my own images of the characters. The actors in this production, however, were not at all disappointing - in fact, after getting used to Rachael Stirling as Nan, I think Nina Gold did a lot of work in the casting department. (Can Keeley Hawes be more delicious ?!) <br /> <br /> The BBC did it again: it's a wonderful production of a great book, and it did it in style . If you can get your hands on it (VHS, DVD), make sure to get the 181-minute version (uncensored version). It is a wonderful trip, although sometimes a little difficult, that you will not regret taking.
