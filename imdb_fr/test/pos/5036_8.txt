This is one of my favorite comedies "Capra-esque". This film is just meant to be appreciated, not deconstructed, analyzed under the microscope. This is not a religious commentary. It's funny. It's fantasy. The surprisingly negative comments (IMHO) reflect a level of expectation that professional film critics have led us to think must be part of every film. <br /> <br /> Others have described the role of Travolta (that's why you watch the movie again and again) and the excellent support cast (including Sparky!). <br /> <br /> Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar; Sometimes a movie is just fun. <br /> <br /> Enjoy it!
