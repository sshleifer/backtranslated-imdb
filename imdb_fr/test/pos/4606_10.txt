It's the ultimate, and I mean the ULTIMATE, ADVENTURE CLASSIC! The plot is good against evil. There has always been an abundance of films that describe gray areas and not enough on the fundamental good versus the bad to account for real cases of good versus evil in the real world. It's only recently that filmmakers have tried to balance their chances. In real life, more than half of the situations are in black and white, but only a fraction of the films give the impression. This film is the best example of white look and back. We see it better in black and white. The hero is in the worst situation. He is on the territory of a man who wants to murder him and among various enemies. The film gives the impression that he is desperately outnumbered and can not count on any help. His enemy (the count) has many resources. The count's wife was forced to marry him, and she knows from his past that he kills her sooner or later like all his wives. She and the hero become allies and fall in love with what might appeal to anyone who looks (unless that person only wants to become an opposite kid). Whoever helps them is killed. They have no way out. The situation is hopeless. So will they survive in the end? You will not guess unless you have read notes. The film also has a lot of atmosphere, adventures and intrigues, with Lon Chaney as villain and Boris Karloff in his best role of all time, as an honest guy. Usually portrayed as a villain, Karloff was at his best when he was introduced to him with more complex roles like this one. Chaney has rarely had a complex role, although he has appeared in several films such as "Of Mice and Men". It's a little more than a cameo for him. Yet the tension never stops. There is suspense and danger everywhere. Perfectly written, perfectly cast and perfectly directed. That's what a movie should be: a pure escape, a pure adventure.
