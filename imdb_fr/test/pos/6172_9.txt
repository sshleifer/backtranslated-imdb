I am a dedicated visitor of the BDIM for a few years. It's the film that finally forced me to write in a review. <br /> <br /> I caught this film by chance (the opening credits ran to me when I turned on my television one morning). I really enjoyed the film for many reasons, all of which were well covered by the other critics: the changing mood, the forgotten history of the Czech pilots, the subtle charm of the secondary characters, the fatalism of the main characters and the first view of the person during the fight scenes. <br /> <br /> But the element of the "dark blue world" that really stands out is the lack of dramatic effects, especially during the fighting (and that's a good thing!). While the pilots flew in the battle, no musical score accompanied them, no manipulative clich√© of worried husbands / friends was nested, each little aerial maneuver did not arouse strong patriotic cheers, and the viewers were not invited to swallow the incredible James Bond driver -. Instead, the public is allowed to feel the melancholy, fear and isolation of these unique pilot fighters as they try to stay in the air during the fighting. When our comrades are shot down, we avoid the tearful shouting and the typical (but pleasing to the public) heroics based on revenge. Instead, the other pilots sadly and silently observe the fate of their fellow pilots - in fact, they must remain extremely focused on their own safety and their goals at this point in time. We only briefly experience the pilot's breathing and the background noise of the engines as we, the audience, witness a friend's silent spiral until his death. And immediately, we must immediately return to combat mode and focus on survival. <br /> <br /> Too often in Hollywood, we are spoon-fed emotions that we are supposed to feel and there is no room for the viewer's imagination. "Dark Blue World" maintains a lightness that captivates and involves the viewer, allowing us to invest in the film and fill gaps and spaces using our own thoughts and feelings. <br /> <br /> Excellent movie, which is worth seeing. .
