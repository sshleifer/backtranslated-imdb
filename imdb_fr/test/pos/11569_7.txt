OK, the show was a bit uneven, but I still loved it. I found the two main bunnies boring, but Hamton & Plucky were always fun. <br /> <br /> I really want episodes of Baby Plucky on DVD (or even VHS). Please, free them! <br /> <br /> In particular, the episode "The Potash Years" was broadcast on 11/22/91; the episode "Going up" broadcast on 17/09/92 and the episode "Minister golf" in 11/92. <br /> <br /> These are the funniest pieces of the series and even more than ten years later Refer those bits! <br /> <br /> (I have nothing more to say, please reduce the minimum to 5 lines and reward us for our brevity!)
