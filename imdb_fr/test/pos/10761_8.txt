To the eight people who found the previous comments of FIERCE PEOPLE of "Psycolicious Me" and "Topdany" "useful", as well as to all visitors of the site who will see them before their authors erase them: these negative reviews are only not only shorter than the site's mandate, but they are entirely false, non-factual, incorrect and misinformative. For example, Blythe's father is in a coma, NOT dead - Maya and Finn even visited him at the hospital. In addition, it's the poacher real estate doe, Dwayne - NOT Blythe - who put Jilly the good, etc., etc. pretending to be Siskel or Ebert. Otherwise, include a disclaimer with your comments!
