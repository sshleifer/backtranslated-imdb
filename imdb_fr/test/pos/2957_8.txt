Clayton Moore made his last official appearance on the screen as Masked Man in the epic adventure of director Lesley Selander, "The Lone Ranger and The Lost City of Gold", with Jay Silverheels in the role of his faithful Indian scout Tonto. Selander was a regular at the bar of westerns during his 40 years in film and television, with more than 100 Westerns to his credit as a director. This fast-paced horse opera adopts a revisionist perspective depicting Native Americans, increasingly accepted since 1950 in Hollywood, after director Delmar Daves led the way with the Western film James Stewart "Broken Arrow". Racial intolerance is the main theme of the screenplay by Robert Schaefer and Eric Freiwald. After writing 13 episodes of the television series "The Lone Ranger", Schaefer and Freiwald were familiar with the formula, but they raised the stakes of this theatrical release. Our vigilante heroes come to the rescue of the Indians who are murdered by hooded white men for no apparent reason. The mystery about the identity of these killers and the reason for their homicidal behavior is revealed early enough so that you do not have to guess what is happening. <br /> <br /> Although the violence in this saga of Selander seems tamed The contemporary norms, the fact that the Lone Ranger kills a villain to kill him in a scene rather than to wound her and that an ignoble lady kills an accomplice of the double cross by throwing a tomahawk that sank in the back between his shoulder blades was quite daring. The television series was never that bad, and when the Lone Ranger brandished his six-gun pistol, he fired the bad guy's gun instead of removing it. The other difference is that the Indians lynch one of the looters and torture him for information, but they are never accused of kidnapping this henchman. Douglas Kennedy did not have the wicked statue of Lyle Bettger threatening the masked man in "The Lone Ranger" of director Stuart Heisler, but he does pretty well his role of cowardly outlaw who kills the one of his unscrupulous henchmen when the perpetrator threatens to divulge his name and the identity of his friends to a group of vengeful Indians. <br /> <br /> "The Lone Ranger and the Lost City of Gold" opens with a reminder of the masked protagonist's origins during an ambush at Texas Ranger and his transformation into a Lone Ranger with Tonto as his acolyte. This two-minute refresh is a great way to start a series character so everyone, including non-Lone Ranger fans, is on an equal footing. The main story about a gang of ruthless whites wearing hoods bears the name "no wonder" that Hooded Raiders first kill Indians and steal medallions around their necks. The Lone Rangers and Tonto arrive too late to intervene, but they find a baby hidden nearby. Taking the baby and the dead Indian, they go to a nearby Spanish mission supervised by Father Vincente Esteban (Ralph Moody of "The Outsider") and give him the baby and the body. Initially, the Padre must assure an Indian girl, Paviva (Lisa Montell of "Gaby"), that the masked man does not want them any harm and is their friend. Padre sends Tonto to the city to find the doctor, Dr. James Rolfe (Dean Fredericks of "Gun Fever"), and Tonto quickly runs into trouble in the form of the city's law-cutter, Sheriff Oscar Matthison (Charles Watts of "Giant"), which hates Indians. Tonto tries to see the doctor who is treating the prisoners in the sheriff's jail and Matthison's men start to annoy him when Rolfe intervenes and returns to the mission. <br /> <br /> Finally, the Lone Ranger and Tonto are able to capture one of the looters, but an Indian Redbird (Maurice Jara of "Drum Beat") and his brave companions remove the henchmen and the bring back to their village. They harass him and shoot him with arrows to loosen his tongue. Naughty leader Ross Brady (Douglas Kennedy of "Hell's Crossroads") and his cohort William (Lane Bradford of "Devil's Canyon") go to the village and Brady uses his Winchester to kill his captured henchman. Brady does not know that his henchman has spoken. The Lone Ranger and Tonto arrive shortly after and reprimand Redbird for his treachery. Redbird tells them what the man said before he dies and the Lone Ranger decides to adopt a disguise so he can learn more. He pretends to be a bounty hunter gentleman with a mustache and a false Southern accent. <br /> <br /> Despite its short 83 minutes, "The Lone Ranger and the Lost City of Gold" is full of excitement and surprises. Selander continues the action at a gallop. The dialogue is largely revealing rather than memorable, while Schaefer and Freiwald plot the plot more often than the spring surprises, but there is a major surprise that joins the good Indian theme. There is also a scene where the Lone Ranger puts forward his own credo on justice accessible to all under the law, at a time when Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, Earl Warren, had committed himself to historical decisions of the High Court that recognized and mitigated the conditions surrounding racial segregation, civil rights, separation of Church and State and police arrest procedure in the United States. One thing that differentiates "The Lone Ranger and the Lost City of Gold" from its predecessor is its epic scale with flashbacks at the time of the Spanish conquistadors with a bit of science fiction involved in the form of a destructive meteor . In general, the stories of Lone Ranger were limited to the 19th century without lingering in European history. No, the Lone Ranger was not the first film to deal with the Spanish conquistadors. "The Seven Golden Cities" by Robert D. Webb (1955) was about Spaniards looking for eponymous places in the southwest, but west of Selander was beating the screen "The Gold of the Seven Saints" from Gordon Douglas.
