Watch out for the Scottish game! In his fascinating and heart-wrenching opera, Dario Argento returns to the classical form, recovering the calm that he lost during the filming of convulsive psycho-shocking such as Tenebre and Phenomena. Indeed, based on a simple story that is compensated by sumptuous sets, imaginatively brutal murder sequences and a refined photography, the film resembles the Argento we once knew. The only real breach of the opera is the absence of Goblin's score, which has provided an unusual, iconic and timeless music to many of Argento's great films (the opera selections used here are, however, wonderful). <br /> <br /> The production is filled by several competent actors. Although she is not Jessica Harper, Annabella Sciorra, who looks like Cristina Marsillach, manages enough courage and compassion to take on the role of the tortured heroine. Ian Charleson is interesting as a Marco opera director. And Daria Nicolodi is fantastic as always, even in her relatively brief role (watch the featurette shoot on the DVD for a hilarious interview with Nicolodi about her role - obviously unleashed and resentful about the end of her relationship with Argento !) Stage Fright (another excellent giallo from 1987, directed by Michele Soavi, who served as the second director at the opera) will barely recognize the last girl of this film, Barbara Cupisti, as director here (I think it's the glasses that do it). <br /> <br /> At home, it's often the little things that matter and Argento's fascination / obsession with solitary and nightmarish images make him the ideal filmmaker. The opera is full of little details that left me smiling. For example, I like the fact that we never see the face of "The great" Mara Czekova. I also like the scene where the killer scratches the tip of his deadly dagger on a television screen showing the role played by Betty in the role of Lady Macbeth. Finally, I challenge even the most assertive slasher veterans not to back down when the "pin grids" are placed on Betty's eyes. <br /> <br /> In short, Opera is a net thriller, tense and tense. With his solid performances, lucid vision and literary cinematography, he needs to be in the same category as Deep Red and The Bird With the Crystal Plumage. Is Opera the last great giallo?
