This film was very different from previous films and I had to ask myself, "Where is Ralph Macchio?" he might have been involved in the plot somewhere as Myiagi's old friend who teaches Julie what he already knows, so Myiagi can come in and add some more! Macchio could have been Julie's love interest in this movie! Do not pay attention! <br /> <br /> On a serious level, I enjoyed this film because it was to teach karate to a teenager and his feelings are very different from those of Daniel. Julie is much wilder than Daniel and needs to be tamed, which Myiagi finds very difficult; she is a rather troubled girl and a rude and odious kid! <br /> <br /> It was very satisfying to see the transformation into Julie as she warms up with Myiagi and understands Karate better and her life in general. We can all learn one or two of Myiagi's words of mind!
