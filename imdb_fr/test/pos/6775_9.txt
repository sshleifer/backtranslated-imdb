The art of the absurd is alive and well in Danish cinema today! Well, at least it's in this movie. Nobody in this movie is amused. They are all annoyed or shocked, and if they are not yet, they will be soon! It's a story of mistakes, murder, embarrassment, dignity, and ultimately love and redemption. The chilling and awkwardly humorous style is idiomatic and will not please everyone, but personally, I found it to be the fascinating mix of bizarre and absurd. You pity remote characters, even if you do not like them closely and personally. But their story is so tragic that you find in yourself forgive them and be happy for them, even when they commit murder. <br /> <br /> It is, in my opinion, the best Danish film of last years. <br /> <br /> 9 out of 10.
