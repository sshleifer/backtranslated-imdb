A fun but amusing little diversion. You have to kind of see it from the beginning to follow what's going on, but every report on Earth has its own little joke. Pretty good special effects for a very low sci-fi budget. show. It's fun to watch. Somehow in the vein of Red Dwarf, but even smaller budget. For someone who has just arrived in the midst of one of the episodes, it must be realized that these guys are all incompetent because they were promoted to a higher rank at the command, because the other officers have died. In addition, the main members belong to the laundry body, which is why they have all the laundry. If you like red dwarf, you will probably like this. Slightly different t.v. concept, in that everything you see is the commander's report every day. <br /> <br /> It would be better if this was explained more, not just at the very beginning of the first episode, but it was quite difficult to find out what happened in Red Dwarf too, if we did not had not said.
