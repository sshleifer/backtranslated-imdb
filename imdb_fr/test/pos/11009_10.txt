It is interesting to note that the metaphysics of Plato and Aristoteles, formal logic and abstract ontology refer to those sciences that do not interest most people. Humans who refused to think about the issues of being other than biological, physical, and chemical suddenly felt paralyzed as they could not cope with the impact these computers would have on their nightlife. R.W. Fassbinder's "Welt Am Draht", with Tarkovsky's "Solaris" and Godard's "Alphaville", is probably the first film to take the philosophical questions of emerging informatics as the basis of a story to tell in a film. Confused questions about identities and realities are intelligently embedded in different nested criminal histories that the public really tries to follow because they are interested in solving the cases. Fassbinder was an expert in selling highly abstract content to his audience by incorporating theoretical knowledge into practical and appetizing forms. The fundamental problem to understand is that an identity defines a reality, but a reality also requires an identity to be perceived. The idea of ​​a person with multiple identities is only known to us from the point of view of psychiatry. However, logically, the only reason we only have one identity is the fact that our logic has only two values ​​(right and wrong). Now, let's take a logic with just one more value, that is, three: So, as you can easily see, you already have three identities. What's going on now, when, say, Dr. Stiller is killed? Then, it is quite possible that only one of the three identities is abolished and the other two remain and are able to save the individual from death. Another question is, if a person with multiple identities actually feels these identities at once. The idea, however, of displaying such sets of identities in an ascending or descending way, as shown by the scene with the elevator in the hotel, is misleading because identities and therefore realities are not structured hierarchical manner, heterarchic manner. Strictly speaking, there is also no "artificial identity", each identity being defined on two objects sharing all their characteristics. Therefore, the idea of ​​assuming that each individual has only one identity is a consequence of the old two-valued logic (a second identity would imply that one person, at a time, exists and does not exist ). But now, look around and see that one and the same object (which is by definition identical to itself) is perceived by each subject in his own way. So if each subject sees an object differently, why could not an individual open the boundaries of his two-valued individuality corset, so that different people can exchange their different individualities? Five years later, Fassbinder would take up this topic in his masterpiece "Desperation: A Journey into the Light".
