Fast Times it is not. But watch this movie, he has a heart. Serve a drink and enjoy. It is loaded with a multitude of stars that are just starting. Sherilyn Fenn has her first cameo credited on screen. Chris Penn, Lea Thompson, Eric Stotz, Jenny Wright, Rick Moranis, etc., they all look so young. Oh, and if you look good, the policeman's wife is Nancy Wilson from the rock band Heart.
