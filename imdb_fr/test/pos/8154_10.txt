I watched this movie on TV LOGO today. The powerful messages and intrigues of this film captivated me. I do not want to ruin it. I will say this, I linked to Aaron's inner struggle and his education. As a gay man who grew up in a small town, I explained the "big secret" and the choices I made so well. This film had a huge impact on me and I plan to buy a copy in the very near future for my personal library. I have not finished finishing the film and I called my friends to recommend it. It had such a profound effect on me. To those who read this comment. Look at this. Try to have as few distractions as possible. Also, keep an open mind. This is not a movie that can be seen as a Disney movie or the movie of the week. Instead, take the time to actively watch and listen to the dialogue, read between the lines and get involved in the graph. You can find yourself in tears. It's not since "Steel Magnolias" that I was moved by a film. This one did that. Thanks to the actors, the writer and the film crew for producing an emotional romantic film about homosexuality and religion. It's been a long time since it's long overdue.
