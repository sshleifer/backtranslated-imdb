This is a good film that has many defects with low production. Martha Coolidge herself said she had only $ 350,000. It's a movie I loved growing up in the Midwest. I remember friends and myself on the nostalgic journey of this film 10 years ago. Good things about this movie .... Super casting with hungry actors and a hungry director. Negative points of this film .... For a small budget that requires too much improvisation. If we gave more money and time to Martha Coolidge for this film, the results would be even better. They should have taken the history of the early 20s and not from a high school point of view aged 15 to 17 years. Most of the actors were between the ages of 20 and 20 and were trying to play between the ages of 15 and 17. The best scenes of this film take place in clubs ill-famed Hollywood with the character of Nicolas Cage. I gave this film a high score of 9/10 for five reasons. The improvisation on stage of Nicholas Cage; The work of the camera and the angles of view are excellent given the budget they had and can only have one shot of each scene; Styles, music and jargon are captured perfectly and forever; Once again, the music is incredible and transports the story from one scene to another; And finally ... Martha Coolidge could turn a weak scenario, unknown actors and a very very low budget. 20 days of shooting the entire movie into such a good and memorable movie is amazing!
