I saw this film purely by chance. It was shown very late, or rather very early one morning on television. I woke up and could not fall asleep and the movie started. <br /> <br /> It deals with a subject repeatedly discussed elsewhere (it is certainly not as good as educating Rita, despite some extra turns) and has a very predictable end. <br /> <br /> Despite its obvious flaws, I enjoyed the film and it is thanks to the play of some of its actors rather than the story or the play as a whole. . <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of Sam Neil and have seen him in many movies, including: Dead Calm; The piano; Mermaids; Children of the revolution; Horizon of the event; The bicentennial man and the omnipresent Jurassic Park. He was very good but he could have played that role with his eyes closed. <br /> <br /> Some of the roles were, in my opinion, the dreadful Rose Byrne, for example, and some of the escapades were rather heavy (all the plateau woman in empty lives dressed in white, for example) . <br /> <br /> However, two actors (whom I did not have or do not remember having seen before) really impressed me, Sin√©ad Cusackn Frances (Frank) Kennedy, and especially Matthew Newton like his son David . He, in particular, was very convincing and I would like to see him a lot more.
