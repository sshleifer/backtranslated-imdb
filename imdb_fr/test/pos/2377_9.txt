OK, it does not compare to the explosive tempo of the opening sequence of the first part; neither its visual shock value; nor, moreover, to the melancholy suspense of the second installment. No, it's surprisingly and refreshing (apart, of course, from the two main actors). The futuristic ironic scenario pushes the characters towards each other across genres and languages ​​with an almost gravitational force. The moment of conclusion of impact is your choice of: a) Shakespearian metaphor of life and humanity in a cartoon costume; (b) sublimation of homoerotic violence; c) humorous detonation of an impossible accumulation. Until then, everything is even less unequivocal. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended for blind moviegoers who do not hesitate to follow a foie gras with a hot dog; caution to more refined palates.
