I have not seen Cold Mountain for a long time, but I knew I liked it a lot. Although this is happening during the last days of the American Civil War, it is not really a war movie. .and it works everywhere because of performance. Usually, I do not like Nicole Kidman, but I like it here. Jude Law is doing very well, as usual. The main actors in the film are some of his big roles, too numerous to mention. There are also breathtaking landscapes in the film. the story is sad and tinged with tragedy, but it's a wonderfully well done and well-told story. For me, Cold Mountain is an 8/10
