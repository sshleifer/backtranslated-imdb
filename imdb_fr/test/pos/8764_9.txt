Traffik, despite its title, is not really about drugs. Traffik analyzes and moralizes his apparent subject, which is not a mythical plague, but a matrix or process with identifiable social, economic and historical roots and causes and effects. There is something almost scientific in the way the film takes up four sets of characters from spectacular global and classroom contexts - a poppy farmer forced to enter the Pakistani world through poverty and cynical government; the English wife, former Olympic swimmer, of a drug lord on trial for trafficking; two troublesome German policemen whose determination to condemn the latter comes as much from the anger of the class as from any faith in the law; and a young Conservative minister whose daughter, a Cambridge student, has become an addict. <br /> <br /> "Traffik" is a flawless didactic. Since the first scenes of Jack Lithgow in Pakistan, he investigates the success of the government in the elimination of drugs before sanctioning more British aid, we are bombarded with facts about the problem. But these "facts" come from a variety of sources - government representatives who are not alike; left-wing lawyers with a vested interest (ideological and national) in corruption; poor farmers who need to grow poppies to survive. <br /> <br /> The facts, usually reassuring landmarks on a map, are clearly not enough - the more facts we receive, the less controllable the situation seems. It's not until Jack, the moral center of the film, the man who connects all the threads of narration, actually gets to the heart of the darkness of drugs, learns to get rid of his historical hypocrisy (deploring drug use, but refusing to spend serious money). It is a question of fighting against the problem of drugs and of creating the right conditions, thanks to various initiatives of the free market, to the flourishing of drug trafficking. Just as the anti-heroes of the old gangster movies of the Warners were model American capitalists, so the traffickers are the ideal of Thatcher and Reagan), we can at least recognize the reality of the problem. <br /> <br /> As I say, "Traffik" is not really about drugs. As Jack finally acknowledges, after being sacked as a Conservative minister, drugs are not really the problem. It's a society dismantled by a woman who said there was nothing like it (as evidenced by Jack's non-existent family life), systematically depriving the vast majority of people of hope and happiness, more and more of whom are turning to drugs. <br /> <br /> The most frightening thing about 'Traffik' is not the graphic and distressing depictions of drug addiction (whose technical detail ironically reflects the presentation of more "legitimate" verbal factual information) but the dystopia vision of a Britain devoid of joy, beauty or community, a waste ground of dilapidated land and soulless modernity, a society of defeatists ready to transit their traffickers and barons. <br /> <br /> Contemporary British history is not left out. It records the decline of an empire built on reduced trade to drug trafficking. It is certainly significant that the other sites of the program are Germany and Pakistan, essential agents of the decline of the Empire. It is here that the old imperial amoral returns to the country, the formerly enslaved victims, the bodies mistreated by the power of their masters, and returning to the imperial center, London, the seeds of its decline literally carried in their bodies, embodying the fears of all Gothic novels of the nineteenth century. <br /> <br /> "Traffik" is one of the big hits of British television and is, in many respects, superior to the recent Hollywood remake. The political attention is obviously clearer - Jack's decline is much more effective than Wakefield's, because as a public policy agent, he is also a bad father, while the American's only political fault is complacency. In almost all cases, the characterization is stricter and much more plausible (compare Steely Helen Lindsay Duncan, already bitten by experience and failures, and its risky and superficial counterpart). <br /> <br /> Contrary to the dubious racial undercurrent of 'Traffic' (darkening Mexico and others, the ultimate horror of WASP being sex with a black man), the portrait of Pakistan is richly, tragically drawn, with disconcerting arguments a protection against drugs punctuated by scenes of abominable violence. The inextricable link between public and private is expert. Visually, the film is remarkably inventive, without ever being flashy or "cinematic" - especially in the last episode, where buildings and scenery seem to move when the system closes. If Traffik, like his remake, feels the need for shoreline fragments, the overwhelming sense of waste and loss is far more damning, Jack's desperately desperate speech.
