Just after moving into his new cottage in England, Hercule Poirot receives an invitation to dinner from Sir Henry and Lady Angkatell, owners of a large mansion nearby. But the next day, one of the guests is found shot dead by the pool and his clumsy wife holds a revolver a few steps away .... <br /> <br /> This mystery of Agatha Christie is a little thin, although the killer's plan is still very smart. Exquisite filming and cinematography take history to the next level. This episode retains mainly the serious tone of "Five Little Pigs" and "Sad Cypress", but contains more black humor than them. The cast includes perhaps the two most famous actors of the series, Edward Fox (the butler) and Sarah Miles (in the role of Lady Angkatell), although the exceptional performance is given by the splendid and magnificent Megan Dodds. Henrietta, of her time: her face-to-face confrontations with Suchet sparkle and are the highlights of the film. Oh, and since an English police inspector is involved in the case, I think they could have brought back Philip Jackson for this one. (***)
