A team of rogue cops led by Buddy Manucci (superbly interpreted by the excellent Roy Scheider) and led by the hard guy, Buddy Manucci blames a group of nasty gangsters involved in a kidnapping network after one of between them get killed. Filmmaker Philip D'Antoni, producer of "Bullet" and "The French Connection", skillfully creates a powerful, sandy, extremely amoral tone, maintains a steady pace and stages the action scenes with considerable vigor. Don Ellis' catchy score exacerbates the raw intensity, while Big Apple's heart-rending scenery and Urs Furrer's rough and grainy cinematography greatly enhance gluey realism. In addition, the distinction between cops and criminals is unclear: the members of the titular team use brutal, brutal and morally dubious tactics as a means of enforcing the law and there is no code of honor among thugs . and the thieves who populate the shabby urban belly that is vividly portrayed in this film. Vito Lucia the Undertaker, Richard Lynch as a vicious psychotic thug, Bill Hickman as Bo's partner, Jerry Leon as a vicious psychotic psychopath, and Joe Spinell as a garage attendant. An extremely wild and exciting car chase around the world destructo is considered a highlight. The shooting also culminates. A real little winner.
