Whether considered a gallant plainsman or a glamor-seeking fancier, the debate over George Armstrong Custer's life and military career continues to this day. They died with their boots presenting some facts from Custer's story and took the liberty with others. <br /> <br /> He actually graduated from the bottom of his class at West Point and got this promotion overnight on the battlefield. to the brigadier general. His record at the Michigan Regiment under his command was a brilliant one. <br /> <br /> It was also true that her marriage to Libby Bacon was one of the big love matches of the 19th century. Libby and George had been married for 12 years to The Little Big Horn. What today's audience ignores is that Libby survived until 1933. At that time, she was the guardian of legend Custer. Due to her iron will and personality, her late husband became a hero because she would not allow him to remember him in any other way. <br /> <br /> I think Raoul Walsh and Warner Brothers missed a good opportunity. to have Custer's career told in flashback. Olivia DeHavilland should have been invented like Jeanette MacDonald in Maytime and tell the story of her husband and his marriage from the angle of nostalgia and memory. Even then, the legend of Custer was emerging, but if that was done from Libby's point of view, it could be understood and forgiven. <br /> <br /> Sydney Greenstreet gave a great performance as General Winfield Scott. The only problem was that Scott had nothing to do with Custer, he had been retired and replaced by George B. McClellan at the end of 1861, while Custer was still at West Point. I'm not sure they've ever met. But Greenstreet characterizes well the heavy and powerful Winfield Scott. A beautiful Mexican war story should have been what they gave to Greenstreet for his very accurate portrait of the old Fuss and Feathers. <br /> <br /> The film is however worn by one of the great romantic film crews, Errol Flynn and Olivia DeHavilland. It was the last of the eight films they did together. The last scene they made for the cameras was Libby's farewell to George, who is going to join his regiment for what will prove to be his last campaign. Their performances, notably Olivia's, were a highlight in their career at Warner Brothers. We know throughout history that Custer is sentenced to death, and that this is their latest on-screen collaboration that makes this scene so poignant. If your eyes do not get wet, you're in marble. <br /> <br /> Like the story, they died with their boots, leaves a lot to be desired. As a Western adventure mixing romance and action, you can not beat this movie at all.
