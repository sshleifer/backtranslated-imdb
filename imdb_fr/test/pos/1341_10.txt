When I was five, it was my favorite TV show. I remembered it was on channel 11 at 2 pm every day. The premise of the show was simple, Carole and Janis being the hostesses of this television show for children. They sang songs and read stories of children. This was done in a studio with only 54 episodes that have been rebroadcast several times. I remember Sherlock, the puppet, in the tree. The show taught us to count, add, subtract and the alphabet. For thirty minutes a day, I learned something new with Paula and Janis. I remember these days as good memories and I now hope that today's children will learn to love simpler things like hearing stories, getting inexpensive props, riding a swing or talking to people. puppets. The set was ideal and simple, but Carole and Janis were worth it. I miss my childhood and those days when the most important thing was to watch the Magic Garden. Life seemed so much simpler and better. Now, I hope that today's children will enjoy the show.
