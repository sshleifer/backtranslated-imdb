Logan Lerman and Dean Collins III of Jack & Bobby Fame bring a touch of familiarity to their friends, although they may not be as close as they are to Jack & Bobby, but the expressions of young students defending a fair cause Although expressed in this film.Logan Lerman may be apparently interpreted in roles to be "different", as seen from here, as seen in this film, as well as in Jack and Bobby. movie also opens with a very beautiful melody lost 45 "And I wonder where are the lions?" A song that I had always heard on the speaker @ my old ChristmasTreeShops job and that she had played on Barry Scott's local radio program The Lost45s, but the last one I suggested with this film because it's a dedication, but the dedication has been left out. The environmental demonstration is well expressed in this film also for the protection of owls as seen in this film too. Hoot, Sogive a hoot in the tradition of the Wo Odsey Owl Commercials of the 1970s too. Really, Stephen "Steve" G. Baer a.k.a. "Ste".
