I must have seen a different version of the first person's version in the user's comments section. <br /> <br /> It's really good ... Steve Zahn and Karl Urban are very good together. The character of Val Kilmer is very similar to that of the novel, although the emphasis is on Gus and Call and the Comanches. We also see what happened with the mother of Call and Newt. I will not spoil it, but it gives a lot of information about Call's character. <br /> <br /> All the actors did a really convincing job. Steve Zahn had the biggest challenge, in my opinion, to follow Robert Duvall! There is a lot of action, humor, tragedy. There is something for every taste. I can not wait for it to be broadcast, my whole family is jealous to have seen it early!
