I saw some movies in my time, but this one is exceptional. You will have to watch it more than once to really appreciate it, its emotion is very complex, it explores love and passion in the extreme and its cinematography is breathtaking. The character of the count is intensely passionate and tragic, without having to raise his voice or even to get out of bed, the film is perfectly shot and played. The film has a kind of mathematical precision and perfection that is rare nowadays. It combines action, love, tragedy, drama and politics at the same time. This film is unavoidable, all the hype surrounding it and all the rewards can not begin to do it justice. Hat Michael Ondaatje for writing the incredible book on which he is based.
