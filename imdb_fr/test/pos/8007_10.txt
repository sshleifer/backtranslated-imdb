And a perfect movie to watch during the holiday season, because Burton's winter / Christmas vibe for Gotham City is really great. It's odd that Warner decided to release it as a summer movie. This is not suitable. <br /> <br /> But what is even stranger, when you consider the content of this film, is that it was intended for families. A family of the upper class throws its mutant baby into the sewers, a sociophobic billionaire dressed in leather like a flying rodent, a solitary secretary dressed in leather like a cat and a monster who is running for political office. And S & M and bondage are presented in a very perverse way. But Burton got away. His visual style in this film is at its best. <br /> <br /> This and Batman: Dead End are the only real incarnations of this cartoon character. Admittedly, the animated series was the closest to the source material, but compared to Batman Forever and the one that was not named later, Batman Returns is the best of the four. <br /> <br /> Darker and more violent than the first film, the Gothic pathos reaches a new height. I really enjoyed Michael Keaton as Bruce Wayne (do not even start me with George Clooney!), He posted the right balance between weird loner and cool crime fighter. Michelle Pfieffer is great as a Catwoman (much sexier and more realistic than cats), she wears this leather suit better than Halle Berry. And Danny DeVito was so convincing as a Penguin that his scenes had become disturbing to watch. And Christopher Walken is as brilliant as the spooky Max Shreck (if you think you recognize Chip Shrek, there is nothing less than a very young Leatherface / Butterfinger). <br /> <br /> Danny Elfman's score is also better than his first appearance. round. His powerful and appealing themes are far better than the slags that followed in Schumacher's last two films. This film is the Batman phenomenon at its zenith. Forget the following sequels and stick to the animated series. Let's hope that Christopher Nolan and Christian Bale will be able to restore some integrity to Batman's real action with their film next year. <br /> <br /> This DVD is one of the very first DVDs released by Warner (almost 7 years ago!). !!) and therefore, there is NO functionality and the case is a snapper. Pick it up as cheap as I did and hope for an SE in the future.
