I can not describe how I felt when I had this shitty VHS rental cassette in my hands about 20 years ago. One way or another, I asked my father to praise it for me and I watched it twice with my little brother. Yes, we had nightmares. This film was originally rated PG in the United States and in many other countries, including Finland, it was banned under 18 or 16 years. It was aimed at teenagers, but this film must be the biggest classified film ever recorded by PG. There is no bad language or nudity in everything you want. Originally created in 1981, it remained on the market for a few years before its release. <br /> <br /> This is a class B movie, a real horror movie of the 80s done well. A group of schoolgirls decide to spend a night in a mausoleum without knowing that a supernatural evil awaits them ... <br /> <br /> You can almost smell the decomposing flesh and feel the atmosphere of this film. It's campy, completely stupid, but they can not do these movies anymore. There is certainly a certain sensation to this kind of horror of the 80s. This one is still really scary and amusing after all these years. <br /> <br /> The effects are only of overwhelming quality by Ellis Burman Jr and Thomas R. Burman. The effects of makeup play a big role in this movie, otherwise it would have been a boring teenager. <br /> <br /> It's finally available on DVD and it's a special edition DVD with some extras. The commentary track is interesting. <br /> <br /> (Actually, this version is not so special ... a sub-par on a DVD, some problems and scratches here and there) In the beginning, it was going to be published by the Blue Underground but unfortunately it was canceled, so Shriek Show published it without restoring the footprint. Too bad!) <br /> <br /> Excellent date movie! <br /> <br /> Recommended !!! <br /> <br /> Note! I gave only 8 out of 10 because of "nostalgic values", otherwise 6 out of 10
