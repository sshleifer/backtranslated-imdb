Kevin Tenney's "Night of the Demons" is a nice horror movie that reminds me a bit of "The Evil Dead". In Hallowen's night, a group of teenagers organize a party at Hull House, an abandoned funeral home on the outskirts of the city. Directed by Angela, they perform a ceremony similar to a session and accidentally awaken the evil spirits that inhabit the place. One by one, the uninvited perverse force possesses the teenagers, turning them into bloodthirsty demons. It's a scary movie, bloody and full of atmosphere. The characters are well developed and the gore of Steve Johnson is pretty good. There is a macabre macabre, a bitten tongue, fingers sunk in the orbits, etc. The scene, where Suzanne (Linnea Quigley) passes a tube of lipstick across her nipple is a hoot. Give this one a look. Two suites follow.
