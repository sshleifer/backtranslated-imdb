Warning: If the brothers Coen or David Lynch define your tastes in a movie, ignore this criticism and move on. <br /> <br /> Yes, I borrowed the "one-line summary" from the book about President Ronald Reagan, but, among other virtues, this film highlights the character's role in life honest human beings. This film is full of honest and honest people, and they have integrity to spare. In a word, they have "character". <br /> <br /> A little nitpick: unless you know the story of the Second World War, you probably do not know, since the arrival of Captain Correlli on the island until the fall Mussolini, 3 years and a half have passed. The average viewer might think that the romance was of the "whirlwind" type. This is not the case. Romance develops slowly, giving it dignity and meaning. The deliberate rhythm of the film may well be the way the director marks time. <br /> <br /> Some critics have criticized Cage's Italian accent. The Italian members of my family assure me that his accent is good enough. <br /> <br /> The story was right on the mark. Yes, the Germans turned against their Italian allies, who for the most part were reluctant allies from the beginning. If you find this shocking, know that the French fleet of the Mediterranean was blown up by the British in 1940, just after the capitulation of France, for fear of falling into the hands of the Vichy government or, worse, the Nazis. <br /> <The description of the educated and educated Italians was a compliment for an educated and cultivated civilization. <br /> <br /> This film has been beautifully photographed and its story has been lyrical. The scenario did not provoke reflection or intelligence, but it was a situation in which confusion and intelligence were unnecessary, and they would not have been appropriate either. <br /> <br /> The story is tender and the message is edifying. The characters are honest, brave, sincere, friendly and friendly. It's a nice little movie. 8/10. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
