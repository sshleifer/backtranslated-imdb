It's a little gem. As a Film Four production, the expected quality has been provided. Filmed with a remarkable style that reminded me of Errol Morris movies, well arranged and striking. It's long but horrifying to the point that it's atrocious. We know that something serious has happened (we can guess by the lack of participation of a person in the interviews) but we are obliged to see it, a bit like a car accident in slow motion. The story covers the most imaginable aspects and unlike some documentaries, she did not try to show the most sinister sides of the story, but also the guilt of people left behind by Don, wondering why they do not had not stopped him in time. It took me a few hours to get out of the melancholy that took me after seeing this documentary very well done.
