At a time of bad, if not terrible, comedies, King of Queens is more than just a breath of fresh air, it's a complete oxygen tank! This is in my opinion one of the 5 best comedy shows of all time. Nothing has been so good since Married with children. Kevin James and Jerry Stiller are comic geniuses! And believe me, it takes a lot for me to call someone a genius of comedy. These guys really understand what's funny. I could watch ten episodes of Seinfeld and did not risk half the laughter of seeing KOQ once. Carrie, Janet Heffernan, Spence and Doug Pruzan (Carrie's boss) are also fun. I am so happy that they have managed to shoot so many seasons of this gem. The show was a hilarious winner at a time of mostly comical losers. Go see if you have not done it !!
