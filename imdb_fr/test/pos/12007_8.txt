Fun movie! The scenario is awful but the quality of the actors saves the day. John Hurt is perfect, as is Jane Alexander. Beau Bridges is fair and the actress who plays his wife is very weak. The story is the real star. Based on a true story, the pace is progressing well and the whole concept of escaping from East Germany sucks you up and holds you back. The happy ending provides enough excitement to make up for the script. Do not expect the quality of an Academy Award, but it's a great race for the whole family.
