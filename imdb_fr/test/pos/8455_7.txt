All the good things seemed to conspire here to make this thriller memorable for years to come. You have stellar cast - Michael Douglas in an unusual role of "free spirit" who started his career at the movies, Fonda playing his typical female role while doing his part for the women's bookstore, and Jack Lemmon also assured that never to show us a man a crisis of confidence. Give them a hot topic about the duplicity of big business, which is encouraging for a kickoff, but a marketing man's dream is to emulate the art of living so soon after. <br /> <br /> The scenario is incredibly tense and intelligent. but fortunately, we keep the jargon to a minimum, and the director really feels a sustained tension as our three protagonists run to beat the clock. If you like "hissing" drama, then it's not as good as "The Insider", but it's all over the place.
