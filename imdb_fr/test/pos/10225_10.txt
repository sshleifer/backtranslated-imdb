This film is a perfect example of Barkers' cinematographic gifts to the monster / horror genre. I thought this movie did a great job of keeping the feel and look of new comics and comic books (or indeed, comics may be second, I forget). This movie was made for Barker fans. It is helpful to have read the book in advance, but it does not matter if you can follow a movie. I saw this movie with everyone on the fence, I read the book, and then watched the movie again. You could find a new respect for the film. I already came to this movie as a big fan of Barker and, after reading the book before, I loved the movie instantly. There are excellent cameos, makeup, writing, making, etc. in this film. This movie does something that most monster / horror movies fail miserably, show to monsters. They are there in color, are not hidden in the shadows and take most of the time on the screen. Unlike other movies that use quick cuts or artificial lighting to hide the creature, this film celebrates the grotesque and places them in the foreground as a good guy. Clive, bravo. We are waiting for the thief forever :)
