Recovery is a well-judged and balanced drama of a sensitive subject that does not sentimentalize the main characters. David Tennant and Sarah Parish highlight the complex and conflicting emotions of a deeply loving couple struggling to cope with the personality changes they face and must do to survive a tragic accident. <br /> <br /> Tennant, as Alan, brings both humor and dangerous lubricity as an engineer recovering from a memory loss caused by a road accident. Alan is not described simply as a victim, but as a human being whose feelings do his best to make sense of his new life. Sarah Parish's Tricia is not a housewife who stands near her man and will do anything to support her husband. She has a hard time falling in love with Alan, because the man she once had and loved was now a completely different person - a stranger to her. <br /> <br /> Unlike some reviews, this - in my opinion - is perfect Sunday night. Too often, we are shown family dramas or police series, like Heartbeat, that rot and rot the brain. The curators of the program seem to think that the traditional day of rest is also a day when our mind falls asleep. A more stimulating and challenging drama, such as Recovery, would seriously change the situation.
