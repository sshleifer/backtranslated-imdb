As I often go to the movies, I must say that this is one of the most impressive films I've seen this year. Ed Harris and Cuba Gooding Jr. have given exceptional performances allowing viewers to get lost in different emotions and to feel the feelings of the characters. It's nice to see a film that does not only depend on special effects, but allows the characters in the story to touch the human psyche on many levels. I would like Hollywood to produce more movies of this caliber.
