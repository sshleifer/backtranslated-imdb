The subject of terminally ill children is difficult and sad, but "The Cure" is a good illustration of the idea that everything must not be dark and that children need hope and joy in their lives. 'they are. find peace before the end. It is also a film of remarkable friendship and innocence of childhood. <br /> <br /> The film sees Erik, a dysfunctional teenager with a distant mother, settling in a new area where his neighbor next door is. Dexter, 11, who has contracted AIDS through blood transfusion. After dispelling his initial fears and his ignorance of AIDS, Erik befriends Dexter and their almost fraternal friendship leads them on a trip to Mississippi where they heard about a New Orleans doctor who claims to have found a cure for the disease. br /> <br /> The talent of Brad Renfro and Joseph Mazzello's two young leaders, who play respectively Erik and Dexter, is exceptional. Brad was able to portray Erik's hardest edge without understanding the subtle innocence inherent in the character, while Joseph describes Dexter's sense of vulnerability, but infuses the good amount of enthusiasm and childlike zeal to emphasize that his illness does not mean he's a kid who wants to run and play like any other eleven year old boy. The interactions of the pair create a feeling in the audience that it is two boys who are really close and who carry the film well. Annabella Sciorra also delivers a touching performance as Dexter's mother, Linda, who loves her son and looks forward to seeing him flourish with this new friendship for Erik and eventually become a surrogate mother figure for the other boy. <br /> <br /> Together Against an excellent soundtrack, "The Cure" is a very bittersweet film that manages to weave perfectly the story of childhood friendship that survives unabashedly in the midst of prejudices and terminal illnesses without resorting to sausage scenes or unnecessary sweet scenes. A very interesting reflection in the film is that it is the adults who have the problem of the AIDS status of Dexter while the children, even the "tyrants", accept it as they would with others. What is also very touching is how despite Erik's abrupt nature, he is the most naive in his determination to cure Dexter while the boy has this obsessing feeling of knowing his fate but is swept away by the enthusiasm from his best friend for a cure. . <br /> <br /> I highly recommend 'The Cure' because it is rare to find a movie that is both sad and uplifting.
