first real movie of this year. astonishing long shots, sometimes with a fixed camera, so specific to Nordic cinema (leave Dogma aside). A true auteur film, I find it. Athmospheric :-) This simply delighted all my senses and kept in mind how the image becomes violent and painful during the scenes where he tries to commit suicide. This is the point I do not think he stands in any plot. Why, if it was an ideal world, could not you die but did you keep your conscience? Either the real world was governed by "adapted" rules, or a "fantastic" world, but in this case, no accident similar to the one that can be remembered before can happen. <br /> <br /> It reminded me of Kafka and maybe more. Brave New World from Huxley, especially in the area where sex was really available to everyone because it was perceived as a right to pleasure. It was missing a plot, but I think it was better like that, since you understood and felt all the strange behavior of each, the absurdity and the lack of real sensations in this "happy" world. <br /> <br /> I also think that the end was brilliant. The real world is indeed a homo homini lupus, you are eaten if you are not strong enough.
