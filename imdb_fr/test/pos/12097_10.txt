I listen to Istanbul, intent, eyes closed: At first, there is a light breeze And the leaves on the trees sway gently; Over there, in the distance, the bells of the water-carriers sound incessantly; I'm listening to Istanbul intentionally, with my eyes closed. <br /> <br /> I am listening to Istanbul intentionally with my eyes closed; Then, suddenly, birds fly over, Flocks of birds, very high in tears, cry, While the nets are pulled in the fishing grounds, And the feet of a woman begin to dabble in the water. I listen to Istanbul, I am attentive, eyes closed. <br /> <br /> I listen to Istanbul, I am attentive, my eyes are closed. The Grand Bazaar is serene and cool. A tumult at the center of the market. The mosque courts are full of pigeons. While the hammers slam on the docks, the winds of the spring carry a smell of sweat; I'm listening to Istanbul intentionally, with my eyes closed. <br /> <br /> I am listening to Istanbul intentionally with my eyes closed; Still stunned by the festivities of the past, a mansion by the sea with dark boathouses falls asleep quickly. In the midst of the din and the drone of the south winds rested, I listen to Istanbul, intentionally, eyes closed. <br /> <br /> I listen to Istanbul, intentionally, eyes closed. A pretty girl walks on the sidewalk: four-letter words, whistles and songs, rough remarks; Something falls from his hand It's a rose, I suppose. I'm listening to Istanbul intentionally, with my eyes closed. <br /> <br /> I am listening to Istanbul, intentionally, with my eyes closed. A bird floats around your skirt; Is there sweat on your forehead? Or not? I know. Are your lips wet? Or not? I know. A silver moon is rising beyond the pines: I can feel everything in the beating of your heart. I'm listening to Istanbul intentionally, with my eyes closed. <br /> <br /> FOR YOU <br /> <br /> For you, humans, everything is for you, the nights are for you, the days are for you; The day is for you, the moonlight is for you; Leaves in the moonlight; Marvel and wisdom in the leaves, myriad of greens in broad daylight, yellow is for you and pink. The sensation of the skin on the palm, its warmth, its softness, the comfort of lying down; For you are all greetings And the hoisted flagpoles in the harbor; Names of the days, Names of the months, The fresh paint on the rowboats is for you The feet of Mailman, the hands of Potter The sweat on the forehead, the bullets drawn on the battlefields; The graves are for you and the gravestones, the prisons and the handcuffs and the death sentences Are for you Everything is for you. <br /> <br /> NOSTALGIA OF THE SEA <br /> <br /> The ships sail in my dreams, On the roofs, the ships in a feast of colors, And poor me, yearning for the sea year after year , I look and cry. I remember my first vision of the world through a mussel shell that I dug: the greenest water and the blue sky and the most bouncing fish ... My blood always flows salty Where oysters split my skin. What crazy speed was ours on the high seas with the whitest foam! Moss does not have any malice, like lips Whose adultery with men is not a shame. <br /> <br /> The ships sail in our dreams Above the roofs, boats in color, And me poor, Want to sea year after year out. <br /> <br /> - Orhan Veli <br /> <br /> I would have said nothing better than what Orhal Veli Kanik said about Istanbul. About this movie, all I have is praise. A very nice and balanced introduction to a city and its music that connected Asia, Europe and Africa at some point.
