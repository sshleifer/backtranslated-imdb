I watched this series on television in 1990 and I loved it (I was nine). I bought the first box DVD about six months ago and the second a few days ago (thanks to my dear husband). Gosh ... It was hard to sleep with all the thoughts in my head ... what would happen to Madeline and George, etc. The questions of slaves and the civil war have always fascinated me (a 25-year-old Finn). read Edward Ball's Slaves in the family for those who want to take a look in the past and try to understand what really happened. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure I want to see paradise and hell after so many people have said here that it was not really good.
