This film is completely underestimated. <br /> <br /> This is a film similar to Wait Keenan and Patrick Hasson, as well as Adrien Brody's restaurant and the classic movie Breaking Away, all of which talk about stuck young adults and connoisseurs. they are stuck, with little or no chance to break free. <br /> <br /> Death By Pizza (Delivered) speaks of a smart, thoughtful and artistic young adult (Will, played by David Strictland) who is stuck and waiting, bitter of the hypocrisy of the world and bitter of his own lack of direction and desire. Will meets his sworn enemy, Reed (Ron Eldard), another smart and bitter young adult who has chosen the path of crime. The two end up helping each other to free themselves from their bitterness, which allows them to take off. <br /> <br /> For these young adults, taking off or breaking free can mean both moving forward in life and dipping into death. <br /> <br /> Will's life is filled with the marks of a young "stuck" adult: a soul-sucking job, sweaty and underpaid, raw customers, an ex-girlfriend who 'left because he was unmotivated, a partial university education without a degree, a home full of self-taught art, and of course the new friend whose impious choices help him to save himself.
