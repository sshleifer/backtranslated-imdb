Lang plays as well with Hawks as in the first part of this extraordinary western, before settling for the final in the typical Lang, determinist, dark and haunted by guilt. <br /> <br /> This is one of those films that shows its grandeur almost instantly but at the same time very subtly. Vance Shaw (Randolph Scott) is on horseback and pursued, we do not know why - he falls on Edward Creighton (Dean Jagger), injured, and decides to take his rifle and his horse, but discovers that Creighton is in a deplorable state. repair it first. This is reflected mainly in facial expressions and a very short and cut dialogue - in 2 minutes we know that Shaw is an outlaw, but basically a good guy. Shaw eventually helped Creighton on his way to civilization and then disappeared. <br /> <br /> A few weeks or months later, Creighton is about to repair and is on an expedition to install a telegraph wire from Omaha to the west. . He hires Shaw as a scout, who tries to leave when he discovers that Creighton is in charge; but Creighton wants it anyway, repaying a debt and feeling something of quality. Also hired is Tenderfoot, the son of one of the project's benefactors, but in an unusual way, Orientalist Richard Blake (Robert Young) is quite competent since he immediately shows a funny but exciting sequence. The two hires are fighting over Creighton's sister, Sue (Virginia Gilmore), who - still rarely - seems to be as capable of taking care of herself as any other man. The camaraderie between the three men, the comical elements involving a reluctant cook and various types of rough, and the wonderfully played romantic elements dominate the first third of the film and make me think more of Howard Hawks' "Red River" or "Only Only". . Angels have wings "that most Langs - but they are so well played and the action progresses so naturally that it does not matter and does not change our pleasure - if it may change our expectations - like the more usual Langian themes from the haunted past, the dark secrets and the immense attraction of the easiest, most destructive and perverse ways that come to dominate the last part of the film, Shaw's old friends come back to haunt him while the train Wagons and their cables are heading west, attacks are increasing, and Shaw must fight what Creighton has to say about his tortured relationship with Jack Slade (Barton MacLane), chief of the outlaws. law. <br /> <br /> A nice shot At the beginning of Technicolor and moving quite harmoniously sound scenes to Western countries, it is for me the money the best western of Lang and one of his best movies, translating with so much power e that one of his films the tragic inability of men to escape their past and new future. Scott is as good as I have seen, showing more than one glance that many actors can not make in a dialogue paragraph, and the rest of the cast is consistently good. The inevitable confrontation between Shaw's past criminal life and his potential future is extraordinary and a surprise, even for a longtime Lang follower like me. and even in 1941, there seems to be no place more meaningful in the margins of civilization than the hair salon and the dusty street outside. You can shave, you can feel like a new man, but you can not be one as long as old ties hold you back. <br /> <br /> Genius.
