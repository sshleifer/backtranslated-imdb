PUBLIC ENEMIES is a kind of reminder of gangster biographies of the early 1960s such as PORTRAIT OF MOBSTER, MAD DOG COLL and KING OF THE ROARING TWENTIES. Although made cheaply, the film has a lot of energy and the acting, especially that of Eric Roberts and Frank Stallone, is pretty good. Theresa Russell may seem too glamorous as a mom, but she has a great time. There are two scenes of action: a shooting in a hotel and a machine gun fight in the middle of the street between the Barkers and the FBI. Both sequences are well done, and compared to other junkies of low-income gangsters like DILLINGER AND CAPONE, this film shines.
