It's a very good movie for television. And as in, if the terrorists blew up a "dirty bomb" in a big city, in this case, London. Many people make fun of those who say, "We are all ready in an emergency," which reveals that they are not telling the story exactly. And is someone prepared for something like this? You can bet not. This shows the equipment used for the bombs smuggled into the country, the making of the bombs, the secrecy and the double life of the people behind them, and so on. they receive no help, while the government does not want to send anyone else to the affected area. It also shows how "preparations" are terribly inadequate for such an event, as the government talks about everything, but remains speechless when the tragedy unfolds. And could it happen here, in the good old United States? Well, unless you've lived in caves for 20 years, something already has, to a certain extent, and you do not bet someone would be prepared for something like that. It's pretty realistic and yes, even scary. It is worth visiting, but I hope nothing of the sort really happens. 8 out of 10
