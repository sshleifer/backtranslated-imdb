"Five Fingers of Death" is a 1970s kung fu movie classic. Like the film that "exploded" HK cinema in the west, it's a must for any serious fan of the genre. It's also a damn entertaining film, with a hard-hitting, non-stop action, a solid and somewhat believable combat choreography and a stunning 70's reverse dubbing ("Oh, I see ... so you want it hard! "HWAA !!") <br /> <br /> "Five Fingers" is a story of revenge for an eye ... and I mean literally an eye for an eye! It's great to see Lo Lieh represent a hero Later in his career, he played in many villains, including Pai Mei in the classic FIST OF THE WHITE LOTUS, which was one of the characters that Tarantino had used to create the KILL BILL Pai Mei. > The complaint is that I wish there was a better DVD - mine looks like a VHS transfer.At all in all, it's a very good movie - do not miss it! <br /> Bart Blackstone Film Club - Hollywood, California
