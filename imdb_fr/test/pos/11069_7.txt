This film is pretty good, it's actually a good wine, it gets better as you watch it. The pace is quite slow for a subject of such height, but the cinematography is beautiful and surreal. There is a cool blue hue that "mounts" the whole movie. There is also a great performance in the performance of the character "Midget" by Gabriel Casseus. It is awesome. Why does not this guy work anymore? If the movie got better support, he probably would.
