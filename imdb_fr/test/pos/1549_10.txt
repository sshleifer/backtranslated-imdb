In the 1960s, this dark study of Joy, a young proletarian woman, was the introduction to the career of Ken Loach, who became one of the most distinguished and respected British filmmakers of all time. At that time, I did not know much about Brecht, politics or the reality of the underprivileged, and the aesthetics of the film, his free style, his cinematography in austere colors and Joy's monologues in front of the camera left me with impress. I was also very surprised to find that Terence Stamp (now a celebrity with "Billy Budd", "The Collector" and "Modesty Blaise") had so little time on the screen. Although 20th Century Fox distributed "Poor Cow" in Panama, Loach did not stay in mainstream cinema (which this film is barely) and I lost touch with his films. I just heard about his successes, "Kes", "Family Life", "Black Jack". until I catch up in the 80s. The beautiful song Donovan is also available in his anthology "Troubadour".
