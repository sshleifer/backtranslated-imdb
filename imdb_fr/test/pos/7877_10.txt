Oh man, this film is amazing, it's very good it's the story of a man who does not accept blacks of the kind, he is sitting in a bar having a drink during his evening and he's screaming about hippies who are anti-war, and how blacks and hippies deserve no welfare check. This film is very realistic because it portrays a guy "Joe" who represented a lot of guys at the time, and now too. The story goes like this ... Joe is in a bar and he rubs a rich who has just accidentally killed the hippie boyfriend of his daughter. And this rich man goes to the bar to rethink what he just did, and while he's doing it, "Joe" talks to hippies and opponents of the war. The rich guy accidentally tells Joe that he killed a hippie; and of course joe applauds the rich guy, because Joe hates hippies, an amazing movie looks at him to see what happens next. I liked this film, because it reminded me of the era of the early 70s, the way movies were shot at the time, very good things, it's not like the movies 'today. Basically, the movie gives you an inside look in the mind of the main character "Joe". I like the theme of the movie ....... about the worker, who breaks his ass while trying to make a living
