I like movies about weird people. "Flying over a cuckoo's nest" is perhaps my favorite of all time, so you can imagine I had a blast with this one. It certainly is not to look if you want to leave with a smile. This film is unpredictable and intense. Some scenes are downright frightening, even after several views (because that kind of thing can really happen). This will certainly keep you on the edge of your seat all the way. And after seeing the end, if you are not deeply disturbed, you should really check your pulse. <br /> <br /> The acting game has been phenomenal. Marcy, with her extreme turret case, goes from extremely cute to utterly terrifying, sometimes seeming so out of control that she looks like an undead. Seth was great too. The film certainly does not hold him as much in the heart as in Marcy, although it is the one that gains the most momentum as a fulfilled character. <br /> <br /> It's a classic love story with some unconventional twists, and it's also my favorite love story next to "True Romance". There are two bad reviews about it here, but one of the people who gave such a review did not know the facts and confessed that they did not see the whole movie, while the other was looking for thrills to Hollywood without the deep characters. (and perhaps he was somewhat shocked by the shallow appearance of the plot, as the ultimate goal is to steal a black Bobbi's head from a toy store). The fact is that this movie is not for those who want to see something "normal" or "light". This one is messed up and indie as one can, and will not let you go to the climax.
