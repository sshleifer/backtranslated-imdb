One of my favorites. As a child, growing up in the New York metropolitan area in the late '60s and early' 70s, I often had the opportunity to travel to New York with my grandfather or father because they were doing business. The cruel, animated, human reality of this city, especially in winter, stayed with me. <br /> <br /> This film is a good illustration of the winter and freezing weather of New York's winter season, while unmistakably exposing the infamous sub-world of crime and policing in the region. . A superb overview of a place, a time and a culture. <br /> <br /> And the car chase is simply amazing. At least on par with that of "Bullitt", and surpassing the hunt in "The French Connection". I can watch, time and time again, as the suspension goes wild on this Plymouth Fury police cruiser heading towards the GW Bridge in pursuit, as it sneaks into this sharp, bouncing, clearing right-hand bend. in oncoming traffic. "Bullitt" and "The French Connection" were coordinated by the stunt coordinator for this scene, as well as for many other film chases. Well done too, and a decent plot. The music score is audacious and compelling, and cinematography and direction are first rate. A great cop drama of the 1970s, although underestimated. A guardian. Not yet on DVD, though. <br /> <br /> The style and content are comparable to: The French Connection and Super Fly. The dramas of the cops of the early 1970s take place in the dark winter months of New York.
