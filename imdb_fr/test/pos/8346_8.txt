Lady and the Tramp II is very lively and the songs, especially the Junkyard Dogs, are pretty good. However, the family seems even too idyllic, and I can not help but understand that Scamp is unhappy when everything is forbidden. However, I also pity Angel who has never had a loving family until she meets Jim, dear and dear. In any case, it is clear that the original version of Lady and the Tramp is better than this sequel.
