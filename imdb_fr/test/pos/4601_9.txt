This film was a good surprise. It had been a long time since I had anticipated it and I was afraid to go on it. That would have exceeded them. <br /> <br /> I loved this movie. . <br /> <br /> Hilarious from beginning to end (stay until the end of the credits!), it is absolutely remarkable to see how a movie about stupid and annoying characters can be so smart, witty and engaging. <br /> <br /> With its obvious matte paintings, the Earth of the Future Film recalls the series Planet of the Apes and other science-fiction films of that time. <br /> <br /> In fact, this film is essentially a planet of the apes, but with people who are the mental equivalent of the monkeys. <br /> <br /> It's moving fast enough, and Luke Wilson is doing the movie very well, with a character reminiscent of the one he played in "Bottle Rocket." (There's even a wink not too subtle to "Bottle Rocket" in an early scene). <br /> <br /> Maya Rudoulph is also surprisingly good as a former "painter" who has also been frozen. <Br/> <br /> Despite all his strength, "Idiocracy" has the distinct sensation of a film that was removed from the director / editor before it can be adjusted. <br /> <br /> I can not for life I understand why such a funny movie would be thrown in some theaters without advanced projection, without trailer, without marketing. <br /> <br /> It's as if the studio decided not to spend any more money. <br /> <br /> Or maybe they thought the film had the qualities of a cult classic, and that the only way to become a true cult classic was to prepare it for failure? <br /> <br /> Anyway, it's a shame, because Mike Judge and this movie in particular deserve better. <br /> <br /> I predict that this movie will have real legs on DVD and a mouth will propel it to the success it deserves. <br /> <br /> Maybe the Fox executives saw themselves in the characters, were confused and thought it was a documentary?
