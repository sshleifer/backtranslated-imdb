Originally, I had seen this movie in a Times Square movie theater in the late eighties. Who would have thought that this film would generate two suites and would have this cult after. Night of the Demons looked like most of the other films that were released at the time. A group of excited teens find themselves trapped in isolated premises and are then killed. The formula is still used and seems to still work as Saw II proves that I recently saw. <br /> <br /> I saw Mimi Kinkade at a Fangoria convention about Six years ago, she had such a sweet heart! I guess that made her a very good actress if she could make a career playing this demon-possessed woman in all those horror movies. The film still resists. A bit slow at first, as I remembered when I saw it for the first time, but it quickly picks up speed. One of the horror classics of the 80s and worth the detour!
