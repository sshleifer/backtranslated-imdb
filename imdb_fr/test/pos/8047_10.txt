Some of the critics here have stupidly judged this film silent according to today's politically correct standards. <br /> <br /> "Battle" is an excellent film for several reasons, correctly noted by more rational critics: super casting, lots of action, editing and innovative photography. <br /> <br /> His stars were actually D.W. Griffith Stock Company and this silent moviegoer, this is a sufficient incentive to watch and appreciate it. <br /> <br /> I saw it many years ago and I watched it on YouTube again; it was a very poor print, but coupled with my memory of a good draw in a real theater, I can rightly recommend it to reasonable people and film historians.
