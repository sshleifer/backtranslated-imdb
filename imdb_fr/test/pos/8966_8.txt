Charlie Wilson (twice Oscar winner) is an easy-going congressman ... who likes to party, enjoys the company of a woman and especially drinks alcohol. When Charlie's old friend and former friend, Joanne Herring (Oscar winner Julia Roberts), wants Charlie to visit Afghanistan, a country the country certainly needs help with. Charlie is shocked at what he has seen, especially of all ages, killed or wounded by this war with the Russians. He decides to help the people and the rebels fight against the Russians who started the war. Charlie, Joanne and a CIA agent, renegade named Gust Avrakotos (Oscar winner Philip Seymour Hoffman) will start a good fight to win the biggest secret operation in history. <br /> <br /> Directed by Oscar-Winner: Mike Nichols (The Birdcage, Henry Concerning, Wolf) directed an animated, entertaining and satirical war comedy, based on a true story. Hanks, Roberts, Hoffman in an Oscar-nominated performance and Amy Adams as Charlie's faithful assistant play very well in their roles. Despite the excellent principle of real life, "Charlie Wilson's War" never really catches fire and it's not as funny as you would like it. Director Nichols and screenwriter Aaron Sorkin (Some Good Men) keep things moving and characters are always appreciated. <br /> <br /> The DVD offers a sharp and panoramic transfer (1.33: 1) and a good Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVDs only feature special features: a behind-the-scenes featurette with the casting team and a real featurette with Charlie Wilson and others. "Charlie Wilson's War" is a good movie that could have been really great, but it's not. But this movie is smart enough to please those who have enjoyed well-written or well-written adult comedies. (*** 1/2 on *****).
