Surface, from the day his trailer aired for the first time in the summer of 2005, was a real success. On the one hand, it seemed so conceptual and plot-based that for the passer-by, it seemed to him that it would work better as a movie (or more). Plus, it was like it was an NBC attempt to "kill the killer". On the other hand, we may have realized that the story was too long to tell in a movie or two, and Lost's fans seemed intrigued. <br /> <br /> So after a season (and perhaps the only) on NBC, the show is on an undefined hiatus that could either put it in the safe, on science fiction, or fill a gap in NBC programming in the summer or fall of 2007 or beyond. His ratings were among the best in the network (which does not say much), but the show was removed from the broadcast without a real official announcement of his future. <br /> <br /> Is it worth it? ? Yes. <br /> <br /> Surface follows a continuous story format, based on a plot with virtually no filling episode. Almost everything that happens in the series is important for the plot, much like a movie. No filler that made you uncomfortable when you missed an episode. However, the double advantage of the series made it possible to compensate for this; It seems that great things happen each episode, but as it feels like a movie, you end each episode feeling as if there was almost nothing and you do not miss it! This feature of the series shows just how awesome it is. The cast is solid; The three main protagonists, including Laura Daughtery, the beautiful Bell Lake, perform a solid performance at each episode, each motivated by her own reasons to research / study the creatures. The actors, including Ian Anthony Dale and the brief performance of Rade Serbedzija, complete the cast. The story is slow to start (my only regret is that it does not really start until 3 to 4 episodes of the short 15-episode season), but the second half of the season makes up for it. The visual effects are amazing (the jaw will fall when you see an aerial view of one of the creatures "attacking" a ship), as well. <br /> <br /> Many of the problems of the series can be solved by buying the Finish the first season and do not wait a week (or three) to watch the next episode. <br /> <br /> In short, if you missed the first season and are curious, come back and look back. . There is no Twin Peaks in terms of oddness, but its very conceptual nature puts it in touch with that of Lost, and other similar shows, with a flair for action and adventure. Enjoy it.
