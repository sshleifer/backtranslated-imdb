I also joined IMDB for the sole purpose of commenting on this film, but to be able to sing the praises. I had never heard of this film (its packaging is so horrible that it's easy to understand why it might go unnoticed), but a good friend suggested it to me and I'm so happy that it's did. It's a movie gem. The actors are great (Kathy Bates and Meredith Eaton in particular) and seem to have fun. It is true that it was sometimes a little exaggerated, but I do not remember the last time I laughed so loud or so many times in two hours. If you like to laugh, you owe it to yourself to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
