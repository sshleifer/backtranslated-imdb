Recently, I reviewed this movie (after 25 years). In the original, there is a scene in the bathroom of an airplane during the disembarkation between the character of Jacqueline Bisset and that of Michael Brandon. The rented version did not have this scene. Did I imagine that? <br /> <br /> Or, is this part of the "cleaning" of movies some of which are modified to exclude parts that some people consider inappropriate? <br /> <br /> I love this movie. It's exactly like the friendship between a friend and me. We have been friends for 25 years and have seen it together. Her husband thought that was our case too. <br /> <br /> Thank you Joan
