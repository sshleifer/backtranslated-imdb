I bet I watch this movie 4 or 5 times a year and I will do it more often, now that the Hollyweird magnates have seen fit to put it on DVD, because it's a classic with a capital "C"! This film is timeless! How can people pay $ 10.00 today to see the JUNK coming out of Hollyweird with movies like THE Egyptian (Egyptian); THE TEN COMMANDMENTS; BEN HUR; CAPTAIN NEWMAN MD on tape; DVD; and cable movie channels; I could go on forever, but this movie is great and for an unknown stranger, Edmund Purdom is wearing the movie as Atlas wore the world. The story is beautiful, the acting is first rate and the graphics at the end are so powerful that you sit in your place for a few minutes, just trying to let the words in! Really a coup de grace of a movie. I would give 15 stars to this one if they let me! They do not do it anymore, but they should !!!!!
