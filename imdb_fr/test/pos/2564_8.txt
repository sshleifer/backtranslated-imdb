Black Snake Moan is scary. He is extremely rich, incredibly orchestrated, strange and cumbersome, unique and visionary. In the continuity of Hustle & Flow, Brewer draws his portrait of the southern United States almost as a mythological country that one would expect to see in an epic fantasy or ancient Greece. And yet, even above us, his films hover, they are still rooted; Rooted in the darkest and deepest soil. <br /> <br /> As in traditional fairy tales, Brewer paints his portrait in Black Snake Moan using extremes and exaggerations. Neat, empty character traits, combined with such extreme actions as driving a half-naked white girl on a radiator to try to redeem her from her sins, exaggerating and emphasizing the metaphor in the same way as such extreme visual techniques that some characters Color in Pleasantville has reinforced the metaphor of this fairy-tale film. But Brewer does not start his movie with "Once upon a time"; in this film and also in Hustle & Flow, Brewer presents us with a different fairy tale; a dark Gothic fable of sex, prostitution and finally redemption. Bloody, these themes resonate in the veins of the film and bloom in its dark and dark frame. <br /> <br /> But despite these extreme extremes, Brewer treats his characters as humans and creates extremely well executed images. Dimensional characterizations in Lazarus and Rae, particularly emphasized in their relationship with Lazerus's friend at the pharmacy, Angela, and Rae's mother. <br /> <br /> The acting game is perfectly perfect. One has the feeling that Christina Ricci and Samuel L. Jackson are both born to play these roles. Their characterizations are so intense and so severe. It's even more of a challenge for actors to keep their heads on and create realistic characters. And they succeed admirably. Samuel L. Jackson in particular disappears completely in his character, which is an opposite to most of the characters he has already played. With films like Pulp Fiction, Jackie Brown, Shaft and other films, he has built a cast of the song "The Bad-Ass". In Black Snake, Moan Jackson plays an old terrified, defeated and earthy character that looks nothing like what he did before. And frankly, it's just fantastic. What is quite surprising, however, is the cast of Justin Timberlake, and more specifically the fact that it seems tolerable enough. Of course, he does not have much time on the screen, but like what Brewer did with Ludicrous in Hustle & Flow, he forces Timberlake to act and do what he is supposed to do, and not to seem totally unconvincing and irritating. <BR /> <br /> But what's really great about the movie is the atmosphere created by Brewer. Southern rural areas work to its advantage to create a dark, dirty, gritty and rough texture throughout the film, which more than matches the thematic and metaphorical aspects of the film. And using all kinds of elements, such as the sound of cicadas coming up when Rae is itching, or a raging storm that escalates as Lazarus plays his blues number "Black Snake Moan" for Rae, Brewer really manages to to almost create a fantasy. world, a mythology sapped to the rural South. And the unique vision of Brewer is worked wonderfully. <br /> <br /> And we can not talk about a Craig Brewer movie without mentioning the music. In Hustle & Flow, he used a hip-hop street soundtrack and dirty to showcase the atmosphere and vision. In this film, the music works even better to polish and fully represent the unique atmosphere. It's a rural blues soundtrack, but it's the dirtiest, rawest, and hardest blues you've ever heard. And that seems absolutely fantastic. <br /> <br /> In all, we can say that this film was a simple story of an old black singer blues broken, lonely and God fearing, buying a young white woman was sexually abused as a child and now suffering from nymphomania, there may not have been much to write at home. But this film does not deal with the plot, or even characters, because they were designed in the film anyway. No, this film talks about the vision ?? and what a unique vision it is! It's the atmosphere, the mythology, the setting. It's about anger, fear, redemption and, most importantly, blues. And all this is packaged in a unique, entertaining, stylish and impeccable ribbon. Brewer has secured a place in the list of the most promising directors and, with such a solid follow-up to an excellent first film, Hustle & Flow, he will undoubtedly be on my eyes for my future projects. <BR /> <br /> It should also be mentioned that the film has one of the most fantastic and unique titles I have ever heard.
