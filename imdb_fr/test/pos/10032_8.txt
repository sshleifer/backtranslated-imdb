When we stop to remember the frequent association on the screen of Errol Flynn and Olivia DeHavilland, "They die with their boots" (1941) is probably the best memory of the film. This is the great saga of General Custer (Flynn), told as soon as he entered the West Point Military Academy and his dominance for the sumptuous Elizabeth Bacon (DeHavilland), during his tenure during the American Civil War, and finally after his died in Little Big. Horn. Director Raoul Walsh takes his historical epic on the laurels of the highly questionable removal of historical texts, rewritten by screenwriters Wally Kline and Aeneas MacKenzie, until truth and fiction are distorted. As a result, the battle against Crazy Horse boss (Anthony Quinn) is described as a twisted deal between politicians - California Joe (Charley Grapewin) and an absurdly absent society that wants to reclaim the territory that Custer gave to Indians by systematic genocide of the first peoples nation. <br /> <br /> Flynn, who plays cleverly on Custer as if he were a part of Albert Schweitzer's two-part Arnold Schwartzenegger, has never been so despicable. He literally breathes the charm and sex appeal of all the pores that easily melt the heart of his loyal heroine. Arthur Kennedy and Sidney Greenstreet, resident players of Warner Stock, produce beautiful cameos that seem to have much more depth and character than what is written in their material. <br /> <br /> Overall, despite his loose rendering of the story "They are dead with their boots" is a good movie for a morning or a Sunday night cooing with his love. The Warner DVD is pretty pretty. Although the grain of the film is often obvious, the gray levels have been very well rendered with deep blacks and solid and white very clear. Some fainting is evident during scene transitions. The sound has been very well cleaned and is presented at a sufficient level of listening.
