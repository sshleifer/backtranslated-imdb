I now understand that this film was not intended as an indictment against all Indians, but it is an amazing film because it dares to investigate the hypocrisy of some Indians about their women and their sexuality. I have known for some time that sexism is widespread in this society (women are murdered because the husband's family does not want them anymore after his death or because she had a small dowry, as well as the frequent killing of female fetuses they are seen as a curse instead of a blessing). I also realize that the film will offend a lot of people in this culture, but the bottom line is that the subject is true - even though the film was attacked with such violence during its debut in India. ten years ago. As a result of the film's extreme misogyny, most western audiences will be shocked or at least emotionally drawn into the fate of the ladies of this film. <br /> <br /> Although I'm a man, I'm not an avidly feminist and I'm straight, the film had a very positive impact on me and it's NOT a film on the agenda which can not be watched by lesbians and "haters". In fact, I do not think the film promotes male hatred or homosexuality, but rather gives a credible argument that, in the case of these two women, it was the only reasonable alternative because of their bad husbands. Yes, I use the word "naughty" and I think so, because the two husbands of this big household are extremely selfish and ignore the sexuality of their husbands. This is indeed the case in many traditional societies and women are condemned to an empty emotional existence. <br /> <br /> One of the married couple married a living young woman, Sita, with no family obligation. This arranged marriage is uncomfortable for both of them but at first Sita tries to connect with her moody husband. However, he considers himself a victim and could have cared less about Sita - and he continues to have an affair with a liberal-minded Chinese lady. To make matters worse, he did not hide anything from the case and did not apologize. In their dead marriage, sex was purely for the purpose of having children, and it was impossible for Sita to satisfy her sexual or emotional needs. And unfortunately, he could have cared less. <br /> <br /> Another husband was married to a barren woman (Radha). Strangely, after first trying to have children, they spent the next 13 years without any sexual contact! It is because this man has decided to become an ascetic (that is, in Hinduism, a person who abandons the pleasures of the world to obtain the inner illumination). Now his desire to do that was fine if he was not already married and had obligations for his wife. However, being married, it was an incredibly selfish act and, like his brother, he assumed that his wife had no sexual feelings and did not seem to care. For him, sexually, he was content to sleep near him, because his presence at his side allowed him to learn to "overcome the desires of the flesh." This should only bring him frustration. <br /> <br /> So you have two neglected and normal women living in the same household who yearn for both an emotional bond and an outlet for their sexual needs. Ultimately, these needs bring these sisters-in-law - at first, just emotionally, but also sexually. The film was brilliant. That's what led me to look and understand how, in some cases, homosexuality is inevitable and even healthy compared to a life of emotional desolation. <br /> <br /> At the end of the film, when the intensity of their sexuality the relationship is discovered, it brings about a not entirely unexpected reaction of Radha's "enlightened" husband - a man who seeks religious insight and peace is so wrapped up in itself that true insight and growth are impossible. <br /> <br /> It's a very difficult and mature film. Although there is very little nudity, the subject is very adult and it is not a film to show to your children. A minor character who masturbates in front of a paralyzed old lady is indeed very disturbing. As I said, it's NOT a movie to let your kids watch. However, for a mature audience, it is an excellent highly erotic film that will inspire reflection. <br /> <br /> The film features good actors, complex characters, excellent writing, music in a good mood and a slow pace might disturb some, but I found it rewarding. The only serious negative that I can not blame on the film itself but on the idiots who published this on videotape. Indeed, although the film is in English, the accents are sometimes strong and it is not always easy to understand what is said. BUT, and this is the worst, there are no closed captions or subtitles - they are essential for the Western audience. If you watch this movie, see if you can find it on DVD or, hopefully, captioning a new video version, but not mine. <br /> <br /> By the way, director Deepa Mehta (a popular director) has directed several other notable films such as EARTH and BOLLYWOOD / Hollywood. A recurring theme in his films is the conflict between traditional Indian culture and expectations and occidentalism - with a particular emphasis on female characters. It is not surprising, then, that this Western-minded lady settles in Canada and is divorced - an unusual woman to say the least. For a similar film that explores traditional culture and western culture, try another Canadian jewel, EAT DRINK MAN WOMAN.
