Footprints is a very interesting film and difficult to classify. "Psychological Thriller" is the most appropriate description I can think of. The female protagonist, Alice Cespi, discovers that she does not remember anything of the last three days. The only clue she has is a torn picture of a hotel. She is also haunted by a recurring, living dream of a sci-fi film she saw many years ago. In her search for the truth behind her amnesia, she does not trust anyone, but little by little, it becomes obvious that she has already visited the city where the hotel is located. It is an exciting film whose main virtue is that it is virtually impossible to predict how events will unfold, and in particular how they will end. The unusual loneliness of the main character and the unreliability of all the others make sure that the good old paranoid feeling is present throughout the film, while beautiful colors and dramatically filmed footage make it a film as appealing as visual. The important part of the one and only Nicoletta Elmi, the horrible Italian horror story of children's favorite, is an added bonus.
