CIA analyst Douglas Freeman (Gyllenhaal) will attend his first secret interrogation where Anwar (Metwally) is accused of having had contact with a known terrorist bomb maker. Anwar (Witherspoon)'s wife is upset about her husband's fate. <br /> <br /> Do not you hate it when the title of a movie refers you to a dictionary? I must have an old edition because this rendering is not a piece of music. No, it's the way the government legally takes a resident or citizen to interrogate him and perhaps even use torture to obtain the information he wants. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie, I remembered a similar story in the show Crossing Jordan (currently out of service), and I hope we'll see more of these stories. It's inevitable. The events of 911 are the catalysts. <br /> <br /> This is a difficult task to watch because we do not like to see people tortured and the government does not tell the truth about certain things. We like the idea that no matter what happens or happen, we can go somewhere to find answers, but when that door is closed, we are really lost and hopeless like Anwar's wife. <br /> <br /> The performances of all were first class and it is possible that we see more Igai Naor (I do not know how to pronounce it) because it looks and can act like Telly Savalas. No kidding. <br /> <br /> Violence: Yes, Sex: No, Nudity: No, Language: Yes
