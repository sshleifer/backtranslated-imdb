A middle-aged man, Robert Jordan, puts himself in his habit and hires a troop of scouts after his predecessor left under duress. Jordan attacks the peloton mainly to learn what boys like so that he can revive his radio show, which loses its appeal to the youngest. He had early difficulties with the boys, especially with Mike, an 8 year old boy who forms an attachment to the old man who has nothing reciprocal. Are things going well for Jordan and the scouts? Check out this entertaining and entertaining movie from ancient times.
