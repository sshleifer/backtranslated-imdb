The hysterical Hardware Wars is finally released on DVD. HW has carved a place among the classics of parody and is not only an unusual short film of 20 minutes, it is also a staple in low-budget film production classes, where much of the cult status of the film comes and resides. With the DVD, we not only have the opportunity to revisit the original parody (4Q2, Cinnamon-Bun Head, Ballistic Toast, etc.) that Ernie F. made in 1978, but there are many other documents illustrating the Fosselius spirit. . Ancient Sideshow is an uninteresting parody that is very funny, but makes a statement about the confluence of ignorance and greed at the same time. The director's commentary is also hysterical, as is the Creature Feature, which parodies the fact of filming a film on the talk show circuit and is in fact based on the removal of HW on the talk show circuit, although the public access circuit. I'd love to see Ernie, Michael Wiese and his team face other contemporary targets in parody - like any Hollywood movie reporting $ 100 million pop nowadays - not so much cunning movies as Spider Man or Men In Black (actually, they are parodying!), But all sorts of exaggerated, overhyped, overwrought and overpiced features. <br /> <br />
