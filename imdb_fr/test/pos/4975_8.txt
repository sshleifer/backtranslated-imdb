It's one of my favorite westerns. What a casting! Glenn Ford plays his role in his usual, gentle, controlled but firm manner. Ford plays one of the smallest breeders In the shadow of the powerful anchoring ranch that wants to engulf the entire territory. Edward G Robinson plays the crippled patriarch of the anchoring ranch and Barbera Stanwyck plays his sneaky wife. There is a lot of action In this impressive western, the landscape is delicious and the photography of the mailbox is breathtaking and the soundtrack is in stereo! I would say that this Westerner had an imposing budget. It looks expensive. One of the great westerns of Glenn Ford.
