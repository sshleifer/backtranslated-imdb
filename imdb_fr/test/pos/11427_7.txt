Mud and Sand is one of Stan Laurel's parodies in popular films of the day, this one being Rudolph Valentino's Blood and Sand (hence Stan is Rhubarb Vaselino). Although partially incoherent on the characterization (how he defeated these bulls at first is not explained), it was quite fun from start to finish with one of the best sequences being a dance he does with his spouse , Mae Laurel. Another amusing sequence concerns his reluctance to romanticise a femme fatale, Filet de Sole, while his wife, Caramel, is waiting for him, showing a glimpse of his later innocent character with Oliver Hardy. It's worth seeing for anyone who is interested in seeing the early work of Mr. Laurel before his fateful team that has made it popular around the world.
