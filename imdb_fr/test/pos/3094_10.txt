Fata Morgana is an absolute masterpiece. It is the least conventional film of Werner Herzog. He has no plot or history. Instead of a story, we have a collection of images, words and music that work perfectly. It's not a documentary either. Some people in this movie are directed and have lines to read. He has some of the most beautiful and haunting pictures. Herzog makes real mirages and we see cars and people floating in the middle of the desert that are not there, but hundreds of miles away are reflected in a mirror. The use of music in this film is so brilliant - Leonard Cohen, Mozart and the third ear. Imagine 2001: Stanley Kubrick's space odyssey in the desert; That's what this movie is like. This film is so hypnotic that it has the ability to make you feel as if your mind has left your body. A must see. It will change the way you watch movies. Rating: 10 out of 10
