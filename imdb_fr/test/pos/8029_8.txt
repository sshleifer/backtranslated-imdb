Once, I knew that Donald Sutherland (Jack Shaw / Henry Fields) appeared in this movie, he told me instantly that it would be a good picture to watch. Most of Sutherland's images are full of action and suspense and he can play a rather cruel character and can be as charming as he is kind. In this picture, Jack Shaw did his best to be a good and a bad guy while he was forming a navy office to become a spy who had to change his whole identity and become a different person in one night. There are a lot of car chase scenes and a lot of stunt man situations that I would not want to play. This naval officer lived in a peaceful community with his wife and was a father, but it would never be known until the film revealed his horrible underlying secrets that he had to keep from his family and friends . Good spy film and good acting from all actors.
