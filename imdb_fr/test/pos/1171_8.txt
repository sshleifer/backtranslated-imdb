"Out to Sea" is a fun movie featuring this wonderful duo of Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau. This movie is not as funny as their "Grumpy Old Men" comedies (which it looks like), but there is a lot of laughter all around. Lemmon and Matthau play a couple of in-laws who are cruising together. Once on the boat, Lemmon does not know is that Matthau has recruited them as dance hosts, so they do not have to pay for the cruise. It infuriates Lemmon who is not in the mood to dance. Worse, Matthau can not even dance. Nevertheless, they accept and meet during the process some of their fellow passengers and crew members. Here are the crew members: there is the cruise director, Gil Godwyn, played by the veteran "Star Trek: the new generation", Brent Spiner, who acts as a diabolical dictator. There are two other dance animators, starring Barney Miller star Hal Linden and veteran music star Donald O'Connor. There is the owner of the ship, Mrs. Carruthers, played by "Golden Girl" on McClanahan Street. As for the passengers, there is Vivian, a widow played by Gloria De Haven, who falls in love with Lemmon. There is Liz, played by one of my favorite actresses, Dyan Cannon, who falls in love with Matthau. There is Mavis, Liz's mother, played by the famous actress Elaine Stritch. And they meet others too. All of these actors are a pleasure to watch as Lemmon and Matthau play them. It's great to see Cannon here, see is beautiful as always; Stritch is a hoot; Spiner is a funny comic villain who plays the game deadly right; De Haven is wonderful. Linden, O'Connor and McClanahan have a good time or two; and finally, the two main stars, Lemmon and Matthau, are doing well, as usual. A little gem of comedy. <br /> <br /> *** (out of four)
