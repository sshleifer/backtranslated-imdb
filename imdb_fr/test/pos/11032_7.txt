I remember this film, it was the first movie I watched at the cinema, the picture was dark in places where I was very nervous. In 74/75, my father took me with my brother and sister to the Newbury Cinema in Newbury Berkshire, England. I remember the tigers and the abundant snow in the film and the appearance of Dan Haggery, actor of the Grizzly Adams. I think one of the tigers gets shot and dies. If anyone knows where to find this on DVD, etc., please let me know. The cinema has been transformed into a fitness club, which is a great shame, because the nearest cinema is thirty kilometers away, would love to hear from those who saw this film or any other like that .
