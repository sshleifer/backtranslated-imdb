I am not quite sure of the accuracy of this film, but I can tell you that this film completely amused me. Gust's character, played to perfection by Phillip Seymour Hoffman, was one of the most unique and entertaining characters in our memory. This film informed, but managed to avoid preaching to the public. it made me laugh, made me feel sad, made me feel alive and happy to spend time watching the movie. it does not take long to understand what is happening and takes you to a roller coaster of authentic and human emotions. I thought I knew my story, apparently I did not know it at all! I give this movement 9 out of 10, and recommend it to all adults and young adults, and young at heart, but not to young people. but as soon as they are allowed to see "r" rated movies, make it a priority.
