I do not know why critics call it weird and macabre. Truly not. Dark -yes, weird - no. It's sad and emotional, especially with Pinguin's story. They say it contains elements of S & M, but I can not find anything like this other than Catwoman's whip. <br /> <br /> This movie is deeper than its kind and the villains are not just crazy monsters dressed like a masquerade. They have strong motivations with strong feelings involved. Catwoman (a great performance by Michelle Pfeifer!) Is not just a sexy girl who loves to make jewelry - she participates in her personal crusade and Pinguin ... well, at the end of the movie, you feel really sorry for him (strong performance of Danny DeVito). Again, I think Michael Keaton is the best Batman and he wears his suit well. <br /> <br /> You can see that it's a movie of Tim Burton because he has an unusual style and is a very talented guy. But also the music is fantastic and corresponds to the emotions.
