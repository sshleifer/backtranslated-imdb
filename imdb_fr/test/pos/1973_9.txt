I loved this movie but again I'm a big fan of Cronenberg. If you have not seen a film by David Cronenberg, it's not a good place to start. Scanners, The Fly, Rabid would be a place to start and then work up Videodrome before checking this one. This is certainly one of his best assets and he goes a little further in the phenomenon of interactive gaming. <br /> <br /> In this game, players plug a bio-designed controller through a plug inserted into their spine and enter the game directly through their nervous system. It is very difficult to tell you more without revealing the story and the plot, but suffice it to say that it is a game you will not forget. It is filled with slime-like works on Cronenberg's body, dark and sinister scenes peopled by a superb cast, including Jennifer Jason Leigh, Jude Law and Willem Dafoe, who take the situation seriously. These people will do everything in their power to understand the game and then win. Like his other films, he has no shortage of imagination or pieces where you get into the seat, but like a car accident, you do not look away. If you liked any of the movies mentioned above, go out and get this one.
