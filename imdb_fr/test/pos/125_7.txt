This is my first film Deepa Mehta. I saw the film on television in its Hindi version with its character "Sita" presented under the name of Nita. I also note that it is Radha who underwent the allegorical lawsuit burned in the film and not Nita / Sita. However, what I liked about the film was Ms. Mehta's screenplay, not her direction. The characters, big and small, were well developed and seemed almost inextricable towards the end - a bit like the end of Mazursky's "A Single Woman". They are brave women surrounded by cardboard men. And a cardboard man (Ashok) seems to come alive in the last shot we see of him - carrying his invalid mother Biji. Finally, he seems to assume a future responsibility going beyond celibacy and adherence to religion. <br /> <br /> Ms. Mehta seems to grope as a director (however, compared to most Indian cinemas, she looks brilliant) because she can not use her script to go beyond the microscopic common family that it presents, with the exception of the presentation, an overview of the Chinese micro-minority in the Indian social milieu. She even dedicates the film to her mother and daughter (not to her father!). Yet Radha remembers her happy days with both parents in a mustard field. Compare it to Mrinal Sen, Adoor Gopalakrishnan, Muzaffar Ali and she is overwhelmed by these giants - thanks to her skilled Canadian production team and her financial resources! Mehta's film about two bisexual ladies in a middle-class Indian household can be a sacrilege to some people, but only captures the atrophy of middle-class homes that do not seem to aspire to something better than their own. immediate survival in a restricted social space. The Kannada, Malayalam and Bengali films covered parallel themes in India, but they did not have the publicity surrounding this film and were therefore not seen by a large segment of discerning movie buffs. <br /> <br /> Jafri and Kharbanda are credible but not outstanding. Ms. Azmi is a talented actress who has achieved great performances under good directors ("Khandar" by Mrinal Sen, "Paar" Gautam Ghose, "Ankur" Benegal), a brilliant that is particularly lacking in this film. Ms. Das shone by her presence on the screen rather than by her ability to act. In total, the strength of the film lies in the structure of the scenario, above average in terms of international cinema. I'm sure Ms. Mehta will be able to perfect her writing skills in her future scripts.
