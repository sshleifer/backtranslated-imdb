Great adaptation of the novel Christie. A surprising attention to the authentic details of the time (Many films from the mid-70s to the early 80s that try to differentiate between the 20s and the early 30s seem far too expensive for my taste, I I was expecting the worst proved wrong) The costumes and sets are very well done. I really liked this production ?? in large part because of Francesca Annis' adorable portrait of a bright and carefree young "Frankie" and James Warwick's charming Bobbie. The couple would then continue to portray Christie's Tommy & Tuppence, which is entertaining as some contemporary book critics liken Frankie and Bobby to his previous Tommy & Tuppence characters. The secondary characters were also well done ?? Ms. Rivington (played by Miss Marple, future Joan H.) and "Badger" play wonderfully post World War I, the "type Bertie Wooster".
