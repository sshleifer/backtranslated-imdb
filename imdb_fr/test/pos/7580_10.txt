I'm not a filmmaker, but I know it's hard to tell a story and attract people in just seven minutes. I think a good movie is a movie you do not want to finish. Eric did a great job in developing the character of the microbe and making it look "human". I loved the music and the voice used for the microbe. I can not wait to see what Eric has in store for future movies. It's a movie I did not want to see finished. Good work.
