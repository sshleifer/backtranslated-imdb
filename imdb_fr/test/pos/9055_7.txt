Dude, is it good to just see Young and The Restless star, Melody Thomas Scott, something other than Niky Newman? A doctor with a brain no less! And super nice to see it with the likes of the beautiful Lorenzo Lamas instead of Victor Newman! <br /> <br /> Mel plays a micro-biology professor at a university who goes to the islands with her son for the spring break, only to be trapped on the island infested with a fast-spreading virus . For her, the brilliant character played by Lorenzo, who has a girl just the age of his son. <br /> <br /> Mel shines, just like Lorenzo with a little over-activity of the young couple. An interesting premise in these times of conversation about chemical and biological terrorism. Worth seeing, especially for Y & R fans.
