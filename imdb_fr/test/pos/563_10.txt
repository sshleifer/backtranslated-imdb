Very good movie. Very good documentary. <br /> <br /> I'm delighted to see these vermin detectives humiliated and discovered as fanatical, narcissistic and heartless pigs, that their parents, their community and their environment have only one glance at. >. > I lean my lid towards Pat McGuinness. Can we get this decent human being on some kind of 911 commission or inquiry? We need its integrity, endurance, intelligence, clarity and spirit to fight the rigged game of global politics and big business. <br /> <br /> All animals come out at night - whores, wet pussies, fuckers, queens, fairies, dopers, junkies, sick, venal. One day, a real rain will come and remove all that foam from the streets. Pat McGuinness should be the first drop of this real rain. The people who control this land are animals. They must be drowned. <br /> <br /> I'm just in shock. Walking at night is a scary affair. Inhuman roar and sneer are detectives, in Murder On A Sunday Morning. In the spotlight, Pat McGuinness looks horribly caught, horribly guilty and ready for a dreadful and horrible drowning. <br /> <br /> It's exceptionally satisfying, in a world where bettors play a rigged game that justice is done and that all narcissistic criminals drown themselves like the pathetic human rats they are. <br /> <br /> How are you feeling running, abominable fingers of the law? How do you feel when your rigged pursuit, faked confessions, and rigged detective work are discovered for what they really were? How do you feel? <br /> <br /> I hope it turns like a knife, you're miserable, nothing to do.
