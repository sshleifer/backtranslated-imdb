Do not forget that this came out before the first Gulf War, which gave us the "Lessons of Darkness" by Werner Herzog. <br /> <br /> The Last Fight is not a "science fiction". It's more like a judgment. I watched it at least a dozen times. He is a companion of choice for Herzog's "Lesson of Darkness": "At that time men will seek death, but they will not find it because death will escape them." <br /> <br /> alas can be today in Iraq. <br /> <br /> But back to The Last Combat, make sure you watch the last second of the movie. I would not call it a "surprise ending", but it is something you will miss if you assume that the end will be no more than what you have already seen.
