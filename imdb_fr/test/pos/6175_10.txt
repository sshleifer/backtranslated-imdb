My flight instructor had "passionate" me about this film and I'm wondering now how on earth he'd been out for almost five years before I finally found out. If you really like flying, especially your attachment to World War II planes, it's an absolute must, far superior to the pathetic "Pearl Harbor" and rivaling the famous "Battle of Britain" filmed more than thirty years ago . There are times when you feel like a flying winger, literally dodging your leader's bushings when you get to a Me 109 or an 111. <br /> <br /> As a historian, this movie is about me. deeply touched. because of the difficult situation experienced by tens of thousands of brave Poles, Hungarians, Slovaks and Czechs who, in 1939-1940, fled their country of origin, went to England and beaten with the greatest courage for the survival of Western civilization. unscrupulously abandoned by "us" after the war, when they were arrested by the communists on their return to their country of origin. I stood at the summit of Monte Cassino, Italy, and the cemetery of Polish troops that stormed this mountain that the British and Americans could not take moved to tears. I also traveled to Prague (the most beautiful city) and studied their history. I think that their history of abandonment should serve as a lesson, even today, regarding the obligations towards brave allies. <br /> <br /> But let's go back to the movie. If you like to fly, see this. If you are interested in World War II planes, see it for sure. Without a doubt, the most brutal, direct and terribly fast aerial combat scenes ever reproduced for the cinema. And yes, if you're even looking for a touching romance, you'll also find heartbreaking details. <br /> <br /> Bill Forstchen, professor of history, co-owner of the replica of the "Second World War" P-51 Mustang "Gloria Ann"
