Bluff I really think this movie is very good. <br /> <br /> Is in a way a different film from Colombia. It's hilarious and the actors use local expressions that are so important to listen to. <br /> <br /> This shows a different face o Bogot√° and I think it's very important because Colombia is a diverse country and we have to show the world This is the first film of the director Felipe Martinez and me, except that this film will mark the beginning of a great career as a director. <br /> <br /> We must continue to support the Colombian film industry because film and other good films are the beginning of something big.
