Therefore, it is important to talk about the release of the DVD rather than the movie. Tales from the Crapper is a film that only one studio in the world could deliver. For over 30 years, he has been bringing us innovative and original REAL independent films: Troma. It's really a very special film, because it's certainly not my favorite among Troma productions, but it came out on a record that, because of what I just said, is one of my DVDs the most precious and favorite. Not only counting the countless Troma discs I own, but counting all my film collection. The film itself is the result of an unfortunate project to produce a television series directed by a director who has been entrusted with a substantial amount of money (especially for Troma) to achieve something wonderful and who has delivered a lot of unfinished and incomprehensible material before. leave (or be fired, I do not know which one at the moment). In order to avoid having to invest a lot of money in the toilets, Lloyd Kaufman and Michael Herz decided to form a team of directors and actors and to use the material as the backbone of a film. A film that really consists of two, in the beautiful and old anthology of Tales From The Crypt, presented by Crapkeeper and interpreted by Mr. Kaufman himself. But, as I said, it's not really my favorite of all their movies. This is largely due to the strange sense of discipline on the various sets, forgetting Troma's strict rule of "no alcohol on the set" that was discovered by an angry Lloyd and other minus employees. respectable that Troma had at the time of filming. added scenes. All this prevented Mr. Kaufman from making an interesting product in the editing room. But Lloyd Kaufman is a genius and, with the troubled scenes added to an already deformed starter, he has crafted a true masterpiece. The film itself is as effective as the circumstances would allow the most brilliant filmmaker, and it is certainly very entertaining, totally confusing, loaded with the elements that made Troma awesome, unique and unique. As a film, however, not as brilliant as many other Troma productions. The genius of independent cinema, however, made the DVD of this film much more than the release of a film with some extras. The film is ultimately only a part of the DVD that sums up the plight of experienced filmmakers who have to survive in a monopolized world by the very few who do not really allow other actors on their market. A document about the problems encountered when people are trusted to be on the same level, but only to discover that freedom is sometimes difficult to respect and to realize that access to a film budget in the same way absence of the boss can corrupt even those who should really know better. The interest of this DVD is that the film is not perfect and that Lloyd KNOWS and does not want to let anyone believe he believes it. The full commentary is a show in itself (as is often the case with Mr. Kaufan's audio commentaries), mixing humor, sneers with those who deserve it, and extremely interesting information for anyone interested in independent filming revising the movie with this comment right after to have seen it for its merit is so interesting that it is difficult to stop. The feature film THE THICK BROWN LINE takes us behind the scenes of the various film locations where Lloyd goes on the set to take over and make the most of what he finds there. We sometimes see him a little disillusioned, different from his appearances in other Making of documents such as Fart of Darkness and Apocalypse Soon, both to be found in the essential box of MAKE YOUR DAMN MOVIE. <br /> <br /> The scenes added with James Gunn (who started his career at Troma only to be successful as a writer and now director in Hollywood) and Trey Parker (again someone who starts with a work published by Troma, later becoming a national hero with his South Park series) are entertaining and probably (as in many things on this release) a motive for getting this record alone for anyone who is closely involved in the work of these two characters. Loaded with much more than what I could mention here (including a SECOND audio commentary), this is one of the best versions of Troma-DVD.
