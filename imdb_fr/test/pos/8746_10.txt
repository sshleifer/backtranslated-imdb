It is a drama beautifully engraved in detail, detailing the different facets of the international drug trade by heroin - Hills of northern Pakistan, where the tacitly permitted cultivation of opium poppy cultivation takes place on a large scale; the "Euro-Trash" jet-set in Germany and England, which is organizing the importation of heroin turned into consignments of several kilograms of smuggling; end-users caught in the fabric of drug addiction and the crime necessary to support their growing habit; and finally all the levels of corruption and hypocrisy of the international government surrounding police efforts to control "the drug problem" - this drama is sketched out with a wide range of detailed and complete characters, a fully evolved plot and a excellent character set and shoot. <br /> <br /> This puts Hollywood epics such as "The French Connection" in their place! <br /> <br /> Traffik is a modern drug-related espionage story that provokes thought and suspense. and the international efforts of many people to try to eliminate it. <br /> <br /> Unlike many drug-related "crime dramas", Traffik is committed to discovering the societal reasons for addiction. As one of the characters puts it, "... as long as our society does not build a world in which people will want to participate, instead of wanting to flee, we will not be able to stop people from taking drugs ..." <br /> <br /> It's a fascinating and captivating drama. I highly recommend it!
