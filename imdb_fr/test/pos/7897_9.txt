Attention-possible spoilers to come ?? .. Just watched 'Joe' for the second time. The first time was more than 30 years ago on an air base. This was recalled by the Air Force coat with Tech. Sgt. scratches worn by the boyfriend / dealer; we, the aviators, laughed the first time that appeared on the screen because it is a grade "for life". Over the years, I made several other images of the film. In the front row was the absolutely gorgeous and vulnerable daughter of the executive. As someone else commented, you could not leave her eyes. I had not realized until now that it was a Susan Sarandon aged 20 in her first film. What a loss she did not make movies anymore when she looked like that. I also remember the irony of having a counter-culture hero like Peter Boyle playing the main role of a right-hand cannon. It's not unlike George C. Scott, who plays generals in Dr. Strangelove and Patton. And of course, the shocking end left a lasting impression. <br /> <br /> More than 30 years ago, it was the most talked about film of the base. We thought it was a good movie and I hesitated to see him again because I was afraid he would be as unreasonably dated as Easy Rider. But looking at this today, I was amazed at the resistance of the film. It's a very solid scenario with a few holes, although we have to wonder about the boyfriend who comes out of the bath immediately when Sarandon enters with him. <br /> <br /> Looking for an explanation of why this movie is always so entertaining I must think that it has something to do with the perfect physical cast. Boyle was physically credible as Joe (as others have pointed out, his performance would inspire the character of Archie Bunker a few years later). Did Ted Knight model his "Caddyshack" -Judge Smails character after Dennis Patrick's advertising director in "Joe"? They look alike and sound the same. Patrick was totally credible as a too tight executive of the upper middle class. And the innocent doe-eyed Sarandon with the Raggety Ann doll always arouses a protective reaction from all the spectators, the perfect cast. <br /> <br /> The drug and nudity scenes really hold (they were very provocative for their day) and are as explicit as anything in "Thirteen". The only thing that dates with this movie is that violence is neither realistic nor graphic. "Joe" was about the same time as "The Wild Bunch" and the tone of violence in the movies had just changed. <br /> <br /> Another reason this film holds is that the events of the past two years have reduced the relevance of the theme and context of this film. In the film, both types of "conservatives" are described as being filled with fear and hatred for the unconventional methods of counterculture; and full of envy to their free and hedonistic lifestyle. Counter-culture is described as making fun of hetero culture; and although paranoid vis-Ã -vis the conservatives (legitimately when it was a few months after the state of Kent), they can not help but display their lifestyle in an attempt at antagonism. The political landscape is not so different from 30 years later. I am not sure that the Conservatives envy young people and the Liberals as much as in 1970, but they fear and hate them more. <br /> <br /> An excellent film surprisingly as relevant today as in the early 1970s.
