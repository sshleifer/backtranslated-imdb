In the eighties, Savage Steve Holland produced three films, including two classics of what seems to be a tiny genre, absurd comedies for teenagers. The third "How I entered college" does not compare to "Better Off Dead" and this one, mainly because of the absence of John Cusack and Curtis Armstrong (except for a small cameo) . <br /> <br /> One Crazy Summer is an underrated movie, with lots of great characterizations and gags. If I remember correctly, Savage Steve's films were vexed as brain dead at the time. After three films, he went on television for children. We could use more movies from his peers.
