Last night, I had the remarkable pleasure of seeing the movie Hitch. I was stunned and surprised. Will Smith did a phenomenal job in a role that he is not always associated with. He proved once and for all that he did not need to hold a gun to be a great actor in a movie. Kevin James was also very impressive. I recognize that I have always loved him in "The King of Queens", but this role has enlightened him a lot and I hope to see him much more on the big screen in the near future. The movie was funny and adorable and I recommend it to all guys as the best date movie you can imagine. The mix of comedy, romance and drama left me complete. It's not like most "chick movies" in the sense of tears and sadness, but it's still alive and I think it can be enjoyed by both men and women. I especially encourage all couples to watch this movie, but even if you are not involved with someone, you can find good ideas at Hitch. <br /> <br /> TWO WAYS GREAT BLOW !!!
