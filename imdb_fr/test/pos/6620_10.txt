If you have ever been, if you have a friend or a child who is or was a skating enthusiast at a time, then watch this movie! I've seen it many times and I'm getting something new every time I see it. It reminded me why I started skating (a long time ago). It reminded me of what skating brings to a person and I found that it would also help a person who does not understand why skaters, well, skate. Of course, there is a very dark side in all seen, that the film touches slightly. But he tends to focus more on what is at the heart of skating. Just a person on a board, doing it because they like to do it. This film was so inspiring for me that I'm skating now (I'm 32) and I'm not so happy with myself for years?
