I loved Dracula's house much more than Frankenstein's house. Carradine is much more passable and his acting is not as ridiculous and overboard as in HOF. The actors offer quite solid performances. Secondary intrigues (for example, the monster, the village gangsters, the village idiot, the hunchbacked nurse, etc.) are well mixed, so that none becomes a strange shine like in HOF. Better to run than the HOF sewn together. The hunchbacked nurse is as friendly as the hunchback in HOF. The doctor is very good. In addition, Lon Chaney adds a touch of class to his werewolf. It's worth it to watch twice. A classic universal horror with this typical flair of the 1940s. The doctor's performance before / after Dracula's blood contamination is particularly good.
