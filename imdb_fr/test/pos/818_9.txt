This movie contains essentially all the elements of a great 70s movie, except that it was shot in the late 80s for the direct videophone market. <br /> <br /> You have a young couple in love, but the whole world around them is involved either in the crack trade or in gang violence. When the boyfriend goes to jail, she ends up being vulnerable to all the criminals, who are all in this movie except the cops. First, she is hooked to crack by a dealer and then, because he owes money to drug lord Jim Brown, it becomes the property of Brown. Then, she is essentially enslaved in a house of military-style critics who gave her name to the film. <br /> <br /> As if that was not enough reason to see this movie, Anthony Geary also played the role of a conservative guidance counselor. but he is really a major crack dealer. In a scene both fishy and hilarious, he asks the heroine for sexual favors because she has no money to heal. In an earlier scene, it was established that he was his advisor. This scene and another where Jim Brown forces him to take a hot shower because she stinks are hysterical. The lead actress Cheryl Kay was really good in this movie. Tarantino, bring her back. <br /> <br /> It is not surprising that someone mentioned in another review that Tarantino was a big fan of it. It just contains the right mix of comedy, action, sex, romance and, of course, a vital message to stay away from drugs. The perverse turn of Jim Brown here deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as another big nasty of the 80s, Wings Hauser, in Vice Squad. Sometimes I think there should be an Oscars Oscar movie where performances like this could be recognized. In the meantime, hope that modern movie buffs learn to use the same type of language in humor.
