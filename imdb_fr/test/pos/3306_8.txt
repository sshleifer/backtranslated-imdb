Great piece of time that shows how attitudes have changed in 40 years. Excellent production design, attractive stars, outlines ("Miss Bender, I do not mind if you beat her with a native drum!", Says Hope's Amanda Farrow, at Crawley summarize a large amount of manuscripts in a very short). If you have seen this film scanned and scanned on television and not in the pay-TV or AMC (American Movie Classics) version, you have not really seen it. Hopefully this guilty pleasure of a movie will soon be available on DVD in a mailbox version and with its stereophonic 4-track soundtrack. Superb opening sequence that really resonates with the 1959 atmosphere in New York while Johnny Mathis sings the theme "Best of Everything" in an echo chamber surrounded by a choir of violins and another chorus of screamers . The miscarriages! Madness! Office romance! Chefs with a cold heart! Upset love! Everything is there to enjoy.
