I can not believe that I have never added my two cents about this movie yet! <br /> <br /> This is one of the best movies of all time. Many critics and moviegoers talk about John Carpenter's "Halloween" for defining trends and "his best work". These people have not seen this version of "The Thing" because it lives up to "Halloween". <br /> <br /> The work of John Carpenter shines in this film. He took a film already made and instead of "redoing" the film, he made the book on which the first film was based! Brilliant. <br /> <br /> The casting of each man was great, the tension between them was real, it made me scream, scared me, made me guess, made me laugh, made me ask questions, even up to today. "Who's there?" in this film. This film had no Hollywood ending or the end of the funny genre, and what a daring move not to have in 1982. Another brilliant shot. <br /> <br /> I was at the screening of this movie when I was on vacation in Southern California. The audience at the screening went crazy! I wear these memories for years, it was so much fun! We all thought there was no way on God's green earth that this movie was not a success. But considering box-office receipts, it was a failure because of "ET, The Extra Terrestrial" and "Poltergeist", two very good family-oriented movies that hit the box office in 1982 when This film was released. <br /> <br /> This film was what I was looking for, as a horror film enthusiast, a thriller / horror with an adult screenplay and real adult actors. Not the kids playing adults. This is not the little Miss "Busty" who is the queen of the day shouting for titillation BUT real guys with real problems delivering some of the best monologues you'll ever hear. Heck, being a feminist, I did not even miss the women in this movie! Well for Mr. Carpenter not to put one, it really would not make sense! (Unless "The Thing" is really feminine! There's something to think about!) <br /> <br /> I've seen special effects from that era that I've never seen before, but the makeup that made me sit a few nights. This is what horror / thrillers lack today. Today, directors are mouthing. Today, studios are off the beaten path. Too much CGI and not enough belief, too much CGI and not enough history, not enough imagination. You leave the theater and in a week - or less - you forget the film and you go to the next big movie. This one stays with you. This is one of the marks of an excellent movie. <br /> <br /> In many magazines, I have written how terrible a $ 10 movie is worth. For movies like this, you would pay for it without feeling aggrieved. This film is not for everyone. <br /> <br /> I find it awful to call this film "cult". I find that the audience is wider than many would suggest and although it was not a commercial success in 1982, it is an example of how to release a damn good movie to a wrong date can give a movie an irreproachable quality. After John Carpenter's film, many people have copied many of the techniques, makeups, special effects and scenarios from this version of "The Thing". <br /> <br /> I am now happy to be able to record and declare that this film is one of the best films of all time, very underestimated. Please see it uncut, please see it in the mailbox and please hear digitally. You will also talk about it for years.
