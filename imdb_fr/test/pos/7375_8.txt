I saw this movie late at night on a free channel, and I must say that I was pleasantly surprised. Being a fan of horror movies, I often watch this kind of midnight movies during the school holidays. More often than not, the horror films presented at this time are usually big projectors. "Campfire Tales" certainly does not fit into this category. <br /> <br /> Campfire Tales is basically a news anthology based on well-known urban legends. They are assembled with a setting involving teenagers telling these stories around a campfire. This campfire setting has a mysterious plot in itself. However, this particular story is weak and confusing, it is obviously mainly used to create other phantasmagorical tales. <br /> <br /> There are three tales in this movie (four if you count "The Hook" at the beginning), which are all really spooky and well done. I particularly enjoyed the third story ('The Locket') featuring a guy whose bike breaks down in front of a mysterious house. This particular story works well to make you panic with sudden flashbacks of the house's story. On top of that, the end of the story will shock you completely! The first story ('The Honeymoon') was also very scary, but the second story ('People can lick too') was somewhat lacking. <br /> <br /> Being a veteran of horror cinema, I do not usually get scared. This film did this job well! What I particularly liked in this film is the fact that it is divided into three short films. This means that the film will not go through an hour or two of character development and establishment until the real bloodbath begins. This makes 'Campfire Tales' the perfect place for a slumber party, parties, etc. <br /> <br /> Campfire Tales is a scary horror movie that will make you beat more than once. It's certainly better than the crap you often find in movie theaters these days (Blair Witch 2, Urban Legends: Final Cut ... No!). Find a copy and watch it ... if you dare! <br /> <br />
