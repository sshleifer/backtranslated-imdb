Boogie Nights is perhaps one of the best examples that a future filmmaker should take a close look at. Of course, you could spend a lot of quality time reviewing the classics from Hitchcock to Scorsese; but follow the movement of the modern generation and study reluctantly. <br /> <br /> Where do I start, I guess we could think of the film as a simple story, maybe even a documentary about the pornography industry in the late 1970s-and what industry would you like to see? 'was! The other half could be devoted to the incredible details that a brilliant filmmaker can achieve simply by using polyester and rubber * ahem *. But honestly, Boogie Nights brings you the pure, no-bul! Shi $, a kind of cinema that I have never known since the great film of the 1970s ... ironic ... or stroke of genius. The story is full of richly detailed characters, which you can all tell, love or hate; but the impact is clear: you feel something for them. Among the characters, the two performances that stand out are: Burt Reynolds as director Jack Horner and Mark Wahlberg as Eddie Adams / Dirk Diggler. Julianne Moore is also brilliant, as is Heather Graham ... but if I focus on one actor in particular, it would have to be John C. Reilly. John's performance is a perfect balance between humorous timing and character-centric emotion ... I'm a fanatic of the line "Ever seen the movie Star Wars? ... People say I look like Han Solo." Anyway, the film has an incredible look, the director of photography and the director / writer / producer have come up with a vibrant color and a flashy style that compares to Martin Scorsese and Stanley Kubrick (in that which concerns the perfection of sound) but by creating its own unique look and pushing the edge with the longest single shot ever seen ... it's the New Year's party sequence. <br /> <br /> The music, as in any great film, is a character apart. Sometimes, it is consumed with sorrow or sorrow ... but above all, it is about amuse, to dance and to have fun; the spirit of the 1970s. Well, let's get back to the show. <br /> <br /> Burt Reynolds plays the character of Jack Horner, a porn director who feels the burden of what the future of "film" means for his genre. The terrible transition from film shooting to tape recording. The loss of his art, so to speak ... and the changes of mentality in the people with whom he works. Walhberg adds the perfect blend of innocence and sexual bravado needed by the character. For all who have seen Burton's Planet of the Apes, do not pay attention to Wahlberg's performance in this movie ... Rent boogie parties and see how a good story can make all the difference! <br /> <br /> Julianne Moore plays the role of pretentious mother for all, and the torment and anguish she experiences come as life imitates art; and she loses all her relatives. Heather Graham is a marvel for the eyes, but she defends herself later and steals some scenes from the great Mr. Reynolds himself. Each character is multidimensional, rich in life and interpreted by actors who seem to be perfect for the piece. <br /> <br /> The film itself is often funny, tragic, exciting and offers an uncompromising look at the turblulant. 1970s lifestyle at a fast pace. He makes no excuses, and tells no lies; and offers a return to the public. But more importantly, the film gives us a great example of how films should be made. and a new director whose bold visions bring art back to the cinema.
