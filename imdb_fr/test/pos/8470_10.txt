The very first speaking image has come back from oblivion, and now you can hear it and see it! In the fall of 1894, William Dickson, a partner of Thomas Edison, tried to combine two existing technologies (the phonograph and the kinetoscope) to record sound and image together in the Edison lab complex located in West Orange, in the New Jersey. In this case, Dickson was unable to synchronize sound and picture playback. This experimental film was therefore never shown to a paying audience ... and therefore (unlike many silent films that Dickson made at this time for Edison), he has no official title. . The silent image (recorded at 40 fps) has been in the Library of Congress for years, which film historians consider to be a silent curiosity. It was also known that the "soundtrack" was recorded on one of the rough wax cylinders languishing at Edison National Historic Site ... although no one knows which one. <br /> <br /> But now it has changed. Recently, curators have located the cylinder of wax, which had broken into several pieces. These were reassembled: a reproduction was obtained and the sound digitized. The veteran Hollywood sound editor, Walter Murch, cleaned up the background noise and adjusted the scan to synchronize it with the film's image, which Murch digitally compressed at 30 frames per second. The sound and the image are finally synchronized! <br /> <br /> The film begins with a call from a man on the screen who says, "You are ready, go ahead!" (The invisible speaker was not identified, but it was probably Dickson's assistant, Fred Ott.) On the screen, Dickson plays a violin in a huge funnel mounted on a tripod (one Edison's sound recording devices) while, at her side, at the sight of the camera, two male lab assistants kiss for a dance party on the tempo of Dickson's music. <br /> < The film lasts just 17 seconds, laughing at the sight of two men waltzing in their arms, speaking of this, here is a WARNING: a well-known but extremely inaccurate reference work ("The Celluloid Closet", of the late Vito Russo) includes an enlargement of the frame of this film and identifies it as "The Gay Brothers." That's wrong. "The Gay Brothers" is a totally different film, directed by Dickson at Edison Lab during the same period. "The Gay Brothers" never had a soundtrack: it's a court t fiction film about two brothers who are NOT "gay" as Russo understood it. The late Mr. Russo, for his own reasons, wanted us to see Dickson's experimental sound movie (probably the first musical film!) As an artifact of 19th-century homoeroticism. (Hmm, what's up for gays and musicals?) Sorry, but that content does not exist here. <br /> <br /> This critically important movie deserves a rating of 10 out of 10. I have often argued that no "lost" film should be considered unrecoverable if it has not been deliberately destroyed. : I am delighted to inform you that this film is finally available to the public as its producer wanted, more than a century after its shooting!
