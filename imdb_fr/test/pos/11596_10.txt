Many more eloquent critics than this have described the acting, the cast and the rather spectacular style. It seems that the only negative critics focus on a perceived imbalance in the treatment of the fundamental moral issue (euthanasia) by the film. <br /> <br /> make an important point, but simply that for him a life devoid of dignity is a life that is not worth living. As viewers, we see a tremendous amount of dignity in his life - we see family and friends, as well as culture and, without his physical limitations, a life fully lived. At the heart of the tragedy of this film, there is only one person who thinks that Ramon's life is not worth living - it's him. <br /> <br /> To watch this movie and say that the only counter-argument comes from visiting a collapsed priest is nonsense. The priest's visit is a sheer joke, a direct assault on the simplicity of the Spanish Catholic Church's response to the question of euthanasia. However, the words of separation from the sister to the priest momentarily expose the powerful "pro-life" feelings that underlie the film as a whole. We are constantly encouraged to see the hope and beauty of a life lived with love. As the film progresses, we can be gradually encouraged to understand Ramon's reasoning but we are never reconciled with his decision. <br /> <br /> I do not remember a film that moves me and provokes me as much as that.
