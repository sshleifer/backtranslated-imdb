Debbie Vickers (Nell Schofield) and Sue Knight (Jad Capelja) want to become one of the coolest girls in their high school. Ugly and ugly girls have two options: to be a mole or a prude! Debbie and Sue imitate them by using their cheating practices in an exam. Two nice boys, Garry (Goeff Rhoe) and Danny (Tony Hughes) ask for their answers and they get cheated. After a scream from the director (Bud Tingwell), the cool girls find them outside in the playground and confront them to see if they have "disobeyed" all. As Debbie and Sue had not been invited by the cool girls to "dunnies" for a smoke. They then start spending time with them on the beach weekends, watching all the boys surf. Sue ends up going out with Danny and Debbie with Garry. Many teenage acts usually take place, including sex, drugs and rock and roll. Garry has a possible overdose of heroin that causes Debbie to face the inequalities of life and she decides to learn to surf instead of just looking at the boys. They are not happy but watch her by calling names, and finally Debbie masters the board. A cool Australian movie of the early 80s.
