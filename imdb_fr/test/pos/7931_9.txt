Looking at some sequences (the whole third of the film dedicated to the battle on the ice) by Alexander Nevsy, a film directed by the Russian legend Sergei M. Eisenstein (co-directed by Dmitri Vasilyev in his only significant film). credit), made me understand how much we really had to work in the staging, at least on such a scale. If I were a member of an award group at the time of this film's release, I would most likely award Eisenstein the posthumous director of the year award. It's really a cinematic genius shot to remove some of the things that are being shot in the film, although for someone like this director after finishing his best job - Battleship Potemkin and October - it could have been something he mocked first. But in the middle of a film that is sometimes a little frustrating with the lack of gray that go into the black and white subject, it's still a celluloid wonder nearly 70 years later. Fans of the Lord of the Rings, meet the grandfather of the film, so to speak. <br /> <br /> To say that something is a propaganda already has a connotation that is often bad. It's something that has a message in its own right, a point of view. There is still a hot topic of debate (see the swarm of arguments around Moore's films for proof), whether a great art can come from something that is supposed to awaken the audience in a specific way. In this particular case, the Russians against the Germans. At the time, it was approaching the Second World War and Russia had to face the "German invaders" again. It is interesting to note that Eisenstein was actually commissioned to make this film, thus calling on the Russians to never forget a crucial part of their story. The end result appears as something that is actually a bit common after seeing Battleship and October, however; if nothing is reflected in these films, it is because Eisenstein is more concerned about how the image and the content can fit together finely for the viewer, this style can completely envelop the viewer. On these terms, Alexander Nevsky is not afraid of anything. <br /> <br /> But even with the very idea that "Russia is great, the Germans are mean", there are some small moments where things are a little less strict, a little less strict for these ideals. For example, when we first see the Germans at Privka, they are not faceless people who are totally barbarians and who have an intention to conquer blind (not that they are not ready to take what they can). They also have their own national pride, namely that it would be no less for them to go ahead with everything their masters led by Christians will tell them. At the very least, the perversity of the picture has a face, but it is kept to a minimum to allow the most dominant team to engage. There is also a brief scene before the battle of ice-scape, where the Russian troupe has a joke going on. said and laughed, and he added a little extra depth where there might be little precious. Because most often in Alexander Nevsky, with his fighting songs charged with a warlike pride, the characters are not complex, including Nevsky himself (played ultra-heroically, not questioning that very early, by Nikolai Cherkasov), which must perhaps be like that with the intention of Eistenstein to have it as the only infallible force with which to count in the story. After all, looking for naturalism in an Eisenstein film is like trying to find the feet of a non-kosher pig in a grocery store. <br /> <br /> But the real reason for seeing the photo is not the actor, anyway, but for the look of the movie, how it moves and takes in such an expansive environment that Eisenstein has . On the epic level, he's just as ambitious as his twenty-something films, with a number of extras not only on the main battle scenes, but also in the urban scenes, with hundreds of visitors. In fact, I would say that any director working in Hollywood or elsewhere thinking to realize a gigantic epic, especially the war, would do very well to watch this film, even without the sound. It's even better if you consider it a silent movie, with visual traits sometimes accentuated in a fantastic way. We could spend an entire month analyzing the battle on the ice, how it starts with the distant German soldiers, then presenting themselves as insects, then how Eisenstein interacts between close-ups of the fighting actors and overall plans and with accelerated editing. And, of course, one can not deny the power of music, Sergei Prokofiev delivering one of the best catchy discs of any epic work. During all this time, the direction of the director makes move the eyes, accompanied by this frenetic action at a vertiginous speed. If it were only a short film, it would certainly rank among the greatest, a bit like the sequence of Odessa Stairs. <br /> <br /> If I found it a little less than totally beautiful, it would be because of the defects that comes from a director who is much more suited to the silent medium than sound. Although I have not yet seen Ivan the Terrible, I would like to make a negative criticism of his acting direction, which is actually as wide as possible, with melodrama as acute as it is amazing (the sub- plot of the two soldiers vying for the Olga is the best example I can think of). Nevertheless, even in this case, the film Alexander Nevsky is too extraordinary to be ignored, and reinforces the commitment to action and the realization of the film to a level that allows the movies, even today, to show the height.
