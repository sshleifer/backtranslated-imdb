It's easy to understand why many people see In the Mood for Love as Wong Kar-Wai's best film. The moderate attraction of the film, centered on the studied vision of a relationship passed through an emotional ring, is a retreading on the territory of Happy Together, but without the hyper-kinetic patchwork of jerky films and hyper-saturated sequences that have become a trademark. Kar-Wai movies from Chungking Express. Like Soderbergh's The Limey, this is a different type of curiosity for Kar-Wai; where dialogue and intrigue are abandoned by mood and composition to create a narrative of two delicate lives in an apparently confining emotional stasis. <br /> <br /> It is a testimony of the genius of Kar-Wai that he is able to make a tale so simple so resonant. Chow Mo-Wan (Tony Leung) and Su Li-zhen (Maggie Cheung) sit side by side in the same building. Journalist dreaming of publishing novels devoted to the martial arts, she is secretary in a transport company. Their possible coupling is evident from the beginning, but the pleasure here lies in the way Kar-Wai ambiguously describes such a journey with his great master strokes. <br /> <br /> The key to the film's success lies in Kar-Wai's use of the interior space, playing with the foreground and background shots in a similar way to the works of Polanski. In the first half of the film, Kar-Wai isolates Leung and Cheung in the shots so that the second person is never visible in a conversation. Kar-Wai is interested here in the environment and space, creating a close emotional dynamic between his characters. It is also said that Kar-Wai never chooses to focus on the physiognomy of the wives of Mo-Wan and Li-zhen. Their faceless partners are visibly absent from the film because they themselves have romantic relationships. <br /> <br /> This does not mean that In the Mood for Love is a confining experience because Kar-Wai manages to flood his film with large splashes of hypnotic movements and sounds. There is a shot where Cheung's slow and sensual rise: a metaphorical staircase turns into a descent from Leung into the same stairwell; their movements complement each other perfectly, suspending the shot and creating a sense of erotic duality between the two characters. Their souls have connected but they have yet to physically unite. The erotic displacement of these scenes is both fascinating and frustrating, as two cursed lovers reject any physical consumption because of their humble fidelity. <br /> <br /> Other scenes from the film are punctuated by Cheung's slow-moving, slow-motion shots of eroticism through his inner environment, directed to Mike Galasso's magnificent score. Cheung's dresses are a great addition to her outdoor space as she moves slowly around her surroundings. His movements slowly become what seems to be an inevitable fusion between Li-szhen and his dream lover, even though the process of seduction seems to be entirely unconscious. <br /> <br /> If I get the impression that these two characters are more like two birds that drop pheromones, it's probably not such a far-fetched statement. The close connection these two characters have with their internal spaces is almost as intense as their relationship to the outdoors. The film rarely moves into an outdoor space and when the video camera does, it usually involves peaking through oval windows and symbolic bars that always remind us that these characters are like confined animals. Kar-Wai continues to tease us even as lovers approach each other to touch each other, breaking the proximity of each other by shooting them through mirrors or interstices in clothes inside a closet. Mother Nature even seems to respond to their desire for love, often dropping a soft ridge of rain on the characters after their bodies have moved closer to each other. <br /> <br /> The shooting of Kar-Wai's atmospheric omnipresence on a waterfall allowed Leung's Lai Yu-Fai to experience a cathartic ride in Happy Together, even though Leslie Cheung's Ho Po-wing was not here to enjoy it with him. At the end of the film, love was so inextricably linked to the act of war that the silent declaration of love by a third man signaled Yu-Fai to realize that his dreams of seeing a waterfall would bring him peace. interior, even if it does not bring him back. lover. Mo-Wan's journey ends within the ruins of a ruined temple. His own emotional exhaustion parallels his country's political climate, and the absence of Li-szhen is only tolerated by the fact that Kar-Wai allows Mo-Wan to experience a release. Mo-Wan bends to an ancient myth and his secret release into a crack of the temple leaves him able to live his days with the hope that all his loss and sorrow have a higher purpose.
