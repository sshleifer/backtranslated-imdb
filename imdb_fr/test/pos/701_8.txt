I loved this western with the stars Randolph Scoot and Glenn Ford.It contains pretty much everything a Western should have. There are shootings, action, horse chases. There is a small romance angle that alludes to. there's a pretty comical relief in the form of Edgar Buchanan, who plays Uncle Willie McLeod, a character claiming to be an old fool, but who's aware of everything that's going on.Randolph Scott plays the city sheriff and Glenn Ford plays Cheyenne Rogers / Bill Smith, an outlaw on the hunt. I finally liked the mix of characters in the movie. I have not always found it at a fast pace, but I have never found it boring either. Even though the film is in 1943, it is in color. 8/10
