It's a quiet movie. It's a simple story about a writer who can not write his story before returning to his hometown, but instead begins to form friendships with a strange old man whose life may be externally representing the internal state. of the writer - it is a museum of unfinished ideas, obsolete equipment and "useless" people. <br /> <br /> There are no extraordinary circumstances or big movements in the plot. It's a film about internal changes. Stuck in a life that does not develop much, the main characters help each other to transform themselves, stop dreaming and realize something or at least get a change and give their lives the long-awaited and expected new direction of life. long time. <Br/> <br /> Regarding filmmaking, I can only think of a weakness that could also be considered a feature: we do not get a lot of character description or inner world. It's very narrative on the side of thoughts and events and we have to guess their true feelings that are rather hidden but you can still see them, and that's what makes your mind work, trying to understand them, understanding the impressions. made by these people, and it's not empty below - the actors certainly hold certain inner states proper to their characters. It's close to real life where most of the time, you never know enough about someone to understand it perfectly, which makes us turn our heads and puts us in front of our own feelings and choices. <br /> <br /> What is most important to me is that this simple and almost flat story lets you think about your own life, your dreams and your accomplishments, where are we? -We caught in the routine and the pleasures, leaving 100% or dreaming only, could we do more and move somewhere where we would prefer to be rather than leaving ourselves and feeding others with stories like " I'll do that one day "- do not move a finger to make it happen, or" I'm fine where I am "because it's easier to respect the habits than to actually change? At least that's the impression it left me and it was very timely for me, which adds to my appreciation of this film far from famous. I recommend it without hesitation to anyone who loves heart-loving movies, but those who need events and actions need to stay away.
