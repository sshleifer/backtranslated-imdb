Often considered as the last "big" Argento movie, this entry into the giallo canon is without a doubt better than any Argento film that followed it (although I have not yet seen "Mother of Tears" ), but to call it his last "big" film maybe stretches it a bit. <br /> <br /> The epic of the director and the style - characteristic of all Argento films - is well and truly present, some of his suspense sequences ranking among the best (the "peephole" sequence is particularly memorable), and Ronnie Taylor's cinematography is remarkable (the fluorescent light is beautiful). <br /> <br /> However, the story - which is a hit and a rat in all Argento films - is missing here. There is indeed a strong sense of mystery and intrigue, but the plot is essentially a succession of murder sequences, one after the other, leaving no real time to fully construct a right and focused mystery to solve. . All this leads to a climax ... well ... anti-climatic, because the film did not invest enough interest to make us really attentive. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this is recommended simply because of the masterful direction and the beautiful images evoked by Argento. However, I would not recommend this as a starting point for the Argento films (for that I would recommend either "Deep Red" or "Suspiria"), but if you liked them, or even any giallo, it's a great addition to your watch directory.
