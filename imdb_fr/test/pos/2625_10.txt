I was 20 years old and lived with people when I saw this for the first time, and I never forgot it. I am a big fan of Joan Hackett and this movie was perfect for his remarkable talent. I am so happy to see that so many other people have such memories. Of course, it is not available on any media! It would be great to show on Lifetime, but because of its age, they will not do it. You never see anything until the mid-eighties. I still remember what made it look when it was launched: Rex Reed reread it in the New York Daily News, and he said it was like a step back from the big Hollywood movies of years forty, and if that had been done at the time. , the Hackett and Grimes games would have been played by Stanwyck and Crawford. Think about that! P.S. So sad that Joan Hackett left us tragically so young.
