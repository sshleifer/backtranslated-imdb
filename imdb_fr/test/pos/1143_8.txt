I agree with msinabottle; It's a good movie. Here are some excerpts of dialogue: <br /> <br /> Raisuli (Sean Connery) to Eden Pedecaris (Candice Bergen): "You see the man at the well, how does he draw water? When a bucket empties, This is the case with the world, you are full of power now, but you are overthrowing it unnecessarily, and Islam is licking drops from your bucket. "<br /> <br /> Raisuli: The English have paid very well in the past. Pedecaris: Well, you will not succeed with the Americans. President Roosevelt will have your head for that. Raisuli: Roosevelt. This President Roosevelt - he would try to take it himself? Pedecaris: He certainly would! He is a man of courage and strong moral fiber. He does not kidnap women and children! Raisuli: What kind of rifle does he use? Pedecaris: a Winchester! Raisuli: Winchester. Winchester. I have no knowledge of this rifle. Pedecaris: You go. <br /> <br /> Teddy Roosevelt (Brian Keith): The American grizzly bear is a symbol of the American character: strength, intelligence, ferocity. A little blind and reckless sometimes, but brave without a doubt. Oh, and another trait goes with all the precedents. Reporter: And that, Mr. President? Teddy Roosevelt: Loneliness. The bear lives his life alone. Indomitable. Unbeaten. But always alone. He has no real allies, only enemies - but none of them is as big as him. Reporter: Do you think this could be an American trait? Teddy Roosevelt: Certainly. The world would never love us. That can respect us. It can even make us fear. But that will never love us. Because we have too much audacity. And we are also a bit blind and careless.
