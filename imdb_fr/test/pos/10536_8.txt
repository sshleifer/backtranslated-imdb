I saw this movie at Galway Film Fleadh the year he won the Best Short Film Award. I must say that I thought the management was fantastic and the performance of the key cast members was very memorable. The two main actors are definitely names to watch. <br /> <br /> The last shot above the cliff was hypnotic and I'd love to find myself there if I waited for the end of the world to happen. The kiss was really a good gain, made with a lot of enthusiasm !! <br /> <br /> I can only assume that the film was shot on film and I heard that the DOP won an award at the Tribeca Film Festival for its work on this film and I must say that ... well-deserved. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this movie to all the teens of the 1980s. It reminded me of great memories and scary memories.
