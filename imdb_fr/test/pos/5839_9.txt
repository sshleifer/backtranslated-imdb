I do not support people who comment on this program or other programs in the HBO channel as "too graphic" or "unnecessarily graphic" or that contain "nudity / violence / free sodomy". <br /> <br /> Guess what? Life in prison is not a PG-13. The "free" graphical content is TRUE TO LIFE of this situation. The prison contains rape / murder of detainees / drug cases and showers. If you do not like it, then do not look at the program. I'm certainly not a fan of rape in prison, but if it was left out of the series, I would be surprised and lend less credence to the series. If the prisoners did not curse, it would be just stupid. Of course, it's a free language, but it's REALISTIC. <br /> <br /> The show is good, some viewers ... less, I guess.
