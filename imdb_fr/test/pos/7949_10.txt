I had the chance to see this film at the International Film Festival which has just ended here. In fact, I was able to watch another South Korean film (The Power of Kangwon Province), but Christmas in August caught my eye more. The story is pretty simple, the usual boy meets a girl (or will we say girl-meets-boy?). What makes it special for me is the way it was rendered. We can say that the film was calm and endearing. We do not have a rowdy and artificial romance here, only two ordinary beings made marvelous by their friendship and their unexpressed love. I also liked the way the film uses images as expressions of past and present relationships. I wanted this to be shown here as a normal movie. I'm sure it would appeal to a wider audience.
