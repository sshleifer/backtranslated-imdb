Watching the director of Stranger Than Fiction, Marc Forster, The Kite Runner is the cinematic equivalent of eating his veggies, as this art epic of the PG-13 rated art house is good for your movie scheme. No, it's not the kind of movie I like to slide on the couch at the end of a difficult day. Kite Runner is not your typical mainstream movie designed to entertain you and make you forget your problems. First of all, there is no celebrity. Secondly, nothing is cut and dried, black or white, or so weird that you do not believe an image you see. Third, The Kite Runner loses its subtitles when the characters speak occasionally in their native language. Fourth, Forster's film is not a romantic trifle about boy-will-girl, boy-loser-girl, then boy-girl-girl. Fifth, this foreign-language film can make you feel uncomfortable and question your assumptions about life, friendship, and survival. The main themes here are cowardice and redemption. The protagonist commits a cowardly offense in the first half of the action that he must redeem to the detriment of his personal security and integrity. Yes, The Kite Runner is about redeeming yourself from the sins of the past. We are talking about personal responsibility, so do not rent and buy this wonderful movie for a boys night out or to forget the bad taste of the day to your system. Based on Khaled Hosseini's bestselling novel, this culturally enlightened right-and-lower melodrama originally resembles one of those fiery friendship films about teenagers in the style of The Adventures of Tom Sawyer and The Sandlot. About half an hour after its 127 minutes, this escapade around two young people flying kites in Afghanistan becomes dark and unsavory. Nevertheless, if you can handle the remaining time of the plot, you will come out satisfied, relieved and maybe even entertained. <br /> <br /> The Kite Runner opens in San Francisco in 2000 when our protagonist, Afghan émigré Amir Jan (Khalid Abdalla of United 93) and his wife Soraya (Atossa Leoni of The Florist) receive two boxes of copies of Amir's first novel. No sooner Amir has had the opportunity to enjoy his triumph of a storyteller life than the phone comes out of his reverie and he is reluctantly brought back into a past that is better left forgotten for him. Rahim Khan (Shaun Toub of The Nativity Story) calls Amir from Pakistan to make a request. Rahim was a servant in Amir's house in the 1970s, when Amir was living with his wealthy father, the Pashto merchant Baba (Homayoun Ershadi of A Taste of Cherry) in Afghanistan before the Soviet invasion. "You still have a chance to be good," Rahim informs Amir without the sugar covering his claim. Basically, Rahim wants Amir to go to Pakistan, then war-torn Afghanistan and rescues Rahim's young son, Sohrab (Ali Danish Bakhty Ari), who is currently being held prisoner against his will as a sexual slave to Assef. (newcomer, Abdul Salam Yusoufzai). the head of the cruel Taliban and Amir was a dreaded opponent. <br /> <br /> The Kite Runner moved from San Francisco in 2000 to an extended flashback to Kabul in 1978, when life was idyllic. Twelve-year-old Amir (Zekiria Ebrahimi) and the son of his father's servant, Hassan (Ahmad Khan Mahmoodzada), love watching movies, such as John Sturges' The Western 7, when they do not fly kites. Incidentally, it's a kite that flies like you've never seen it fly. Not only do the kids drive them, but they are also competing with other kids to see who can cut the strings of another child's kite. Flying scenes of kite fights generate the same kind of excitement as dog fighting scenes in Tony Scott's Top Gun. Hassan is Amir's best friend, but unlike Amir, Hassan belongs to the revolted Hazara minority. A little earlier, the young Amir and Hassan had a confrontation with the young Assef (Elham Ehsas) and his two violins. Assef was about to hit them, but Hassan pulled out his sling and threatened to use it against Assef. Assef had no choice but to back down. Meanwhile, Amir was ready to undergo the hand that fate had inflicted on him. Amir's father, Baba, laments his son's lack of backbone and fears he will become a half-human because he is a coward, unlike the unfortunate little Hassan who allowed Amir to get out of difficult situations. Anyway, Amir and Hassan come out of the confrontation with Assef without a scratch. Later, after Amir set a new record with his kite and fighting skills, Hassan ran after a kite to claim it. Hassan is the eponymous character mentioned in the title. Hassan claims the fallen kite but he is at the mercy of Assef and his two henchmen. Assef lets Hassan keep the kite, but his henchmen pin Hassan, his stomach in an alley, while Assef sodomizes the youth. Worse, a traumatized Amir observes the neighbor's onslaught but lacks the courage to intervene on behalf of his friend who intervened for him. <br /> <br /> Aside from the extraordinary aerial scenes with kites, The Kite Runner is down-to-earth, simple things. When Amir returns to Afghanistan to save Sohrab, he masquerades as a Taliban fighter, but he does not carry a firearm. The rescue scene in The Kite Runner is like the escape scene of The Midnight Express. Forster does not explore local politics and does not delve into the ethnic and cultural issues at play. Indeed, Troy writer David Benioff has had to eliminate parts of the book and racial and ethnic prejudices are unclear. You must therefore accept certain things in faith. Forster screened the film in almost China to give it an authentic look. Forster deserves credit for making these two hours more fascinating epics. Representations, especially by children, are distinguished by their credibility. The Kite Runner is a movie you will not forget easily.
