Everything Park Chan-wook creates is guaranteed to be unique, brilliant and very twisted to a minimum. Well, all that is not, I'm at least a Cyborg. Park's new film titled Thirst is a dark-romance-thriller-erotic-vampire drama comedy ?? yes, it's a lot of adjectives ?? inspired by the French novel of the 19th century by Emile Zola entitled Thérèse Raquin. Park creates a vision of Park's exclusively Korean vampire myth, and asks the public to explore the dilemma of a Catholic priest who himself discovers a thirst for blood and the moral and spiritual crisis that will develop. Park delivers the elements you were hoping for, but does not reach the quality of a masterpiece like Oldboy or even Lady Vengeance. Carefully upset by a story that often loses much of the audience, Soif desperately needed a new trip to the editing room. He crawls when he should be running but luckily brings him home before completely losing the audience. As negative as it may seem, the positives definitely outweigh the negatives and another volume has undoubtedly been added to the dark and twisted film Zeitgeist film Park Chan-wook. www.thefilmstage.com
