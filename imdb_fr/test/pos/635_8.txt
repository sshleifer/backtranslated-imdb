I could not stop watching this movie, even if it was far from bed. <br /> <br /> Comparisons with Hitchcock are deserved - this thing really plays with you. He traces a wonderful border between immediate and real suspense and a dark and distant humor. Like many of Hitch's heroes, our silent, doe-eyed witness innocently fell into something really horrible. endangered. <br /> <br /> Filmmakers have taken a lot of care to solve this problem. From the very first, they engage you and challenge you to determine what is real and what is being made. who to trust and who is a monster. The plot turns and turns unpredictably. The suspense is created with a combination of carefully chosen cameras, images and music, but more simply THE EYES of the characters, which sends you a raw fear. <br /> <br /> A warning: there is real scary gore, as well as nudity. The horror scenes unfold in an emotional way, which makes them much more frightening and disturbing than in any movie to the teenager. <br /> <br /> The characters are weird and feel like real people. On the one hand, a couple (including heroin) can even seem endearing to you, just like me. There will be no mistake if you watch a movie made for adults. I mean, Alec Guinness is here briefly, and you know he did NOT NEED work! <br /> <br /> Put this in the VCR on a night where you can not sleep. . . and do not want, for the moment.
