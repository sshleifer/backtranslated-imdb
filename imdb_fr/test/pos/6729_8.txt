I remember seeing it as a child during the Friday specials of the movie Foundations on CBF children's films, and I recently came across a copy. nothing lost. <br /> <br /> It's an atmospheric tale that seduces with Cornish folklore and adds some really scary footage of the ghost of young miner Billy. <br /> <br /> Shot in the beautiful landscape The Port Loe region of Cornwall uses the mixture of rugged coastline and abandoned tin mines to make the scene truly credible. <br /> <br /> This drama of the CFF contains a lot of things, since the television is worth it if you can find a copy.
