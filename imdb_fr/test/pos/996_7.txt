The Welsh poet Dylan Thomas, excused from his active service, does his part for the war effort and produces excerpts from prose for a branch of government propaganda in Whitehall. <br /> <br /> Thomas is described as a free-thinker believing in a free married love. to a woman with an equally demanding artistic tendency and also with a penchant for extramarital romance. Thomas, writing and reciting his poems in systematic domestic chaos, becomes somewhat gloomy towards the end, relying somewhat on his social connections and establishing the rank of a veteran, who had razed his house and who was otherwise married to the woman he had had an affair with. <br /> <br /> The real story of this film is the love of two women, one (Keira Knightley) whose first love was Thomas (Matthew Rhys), the second (Sienna Miller) who is The woman from Thomas. This is sometimes reminiscent of The Singing Detective, as in a very good television with slightly sinister accents on scenes of surreal camp absurdity.
