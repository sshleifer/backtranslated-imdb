Another great performance from Kiefer Sutherland. I like his films because he always plays his role very well. For a low-budget movie, it was very well done and kept me on the razor's edge all the time. I love this type of film and I was happy to understand it. I will buy the DVD or tape for sure. <br /> <br /> 9/10.
