I just watched the finale of Doctor Who Season 2 and, apart from a few bland episodes, this show is fantastic. <br /> <br /> It's a sad loss that we say goodbye to a main character of the final season but the show goes ahead. <br /> <br /> The BBC needs to increase its budget, there is little that can happen in London and the surrounding area. In addition, some special effects are very good, but sometimes it takes a little more polite. <br /> <br /> It was a big bet for the BBC to bring back a lost show. It's been a very long time and we have to congratulate them <br /> <br /> To go to the 2006 Christmas special, the Christmas 2005 special was by far the best thing on television.
