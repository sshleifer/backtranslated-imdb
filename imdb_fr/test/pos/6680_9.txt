at least for me. and rather unexpected - as subject. a film that makes you question your beliefs, your life, your approach on everything. it helps you to see the world you live, we live through a lens - or a multitude of lenses ... a moving film, surprising and haunting. <br /> <br /> Kevin Spacey. very well supported by Jeff Bridges. there is no wrong note in this tango. it's a perfect dance. perfect 'until the end. <br /> <br /> What does the end reveal? well ... everything you want ... <br /> <br /> a movie we want to see again. maybe not right now. maybe after a few days. month. years. but it's something to go - or come back - to.
