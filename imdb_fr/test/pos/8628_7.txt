For us, an Abbott and Costello movie is something for which you have to be in the mood. I am very happy to have recorded this - my wife remembered it since her childhood, but I had never seen it. The family wanted to watch something not serious before going to bed and this was selected. <br /> <br /> Our daughter watched a lot of old movies with us - always complaining at first, but coming more often. She mostly ignored this at first, preferring to check her emails, but she started having fun - many times laughing at the zaniness. <br /> <br /> It is wonderful to think that you can spend a fun evening with a 55 year old. The monochrome introduction that blends into the fairy tale in color. It's a fun story everyone knows, including a little song and a little dance, as well as everything you expect from Lou and Bud on delivery. <br /> <br /> Take a look at it with your children and enjoy a very fun evening!
