It was a television show I watched in the 1960s when I was a kid and captivated me. Over the years, I have often thought about this show and the value of seeing it again, but I realize that things in the past are not always as good as those you remember. It was an excellent series in the 1960s and did not lose anything, even in 2007. Of course, there are some production errors that you see when you watch old series, and it takes a few episodes to get used to voices doubled, but that made, I was as captivated as in the 1960s. The Samurai is played by Koichi Ose, who plays the role in a very humble way. I remember that in the 60s, because of the popularity of the series here in Australia, he played in plays, etc., and was overwhelmed by his interest in the series and for him. It was great that one of my favorite shows of all time keeps the magic of her childhood. A series to see absolutely.
