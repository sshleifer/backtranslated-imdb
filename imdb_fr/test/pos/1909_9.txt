Dolemite is awesome. Rudy Ray Moore's rhymin kung-fu pimp with horrible choreographed action sequences is about as close as you can become to become a parody of a genre without being one. Citizen Kane, this can not be The Infant A Goodbye, but it's definitely a genius in its own right. The production values ​​of this film are so bad that they could be described as existential special effects. The plot lurks a bit in the middle, but the power of a local as cheap as that of kung-fu prostitutes is enough to convince all moviegoers, except the wildest. The infamous micro always evoked evokes the shades of the glorious incompetent Ed Wood and never pushes for nothing. I sometimes wonder if the micro boom was left on purpose to comment on the ridiculous aspects of movies in general, but I am generally distracted by erotic scenes that lack eroticism to the point of becoming mundane. All this film is alive and breathing, dripping with desperate desire to be simultaneously loved and revered. It works. <br /> <br /> 9 out of 10
