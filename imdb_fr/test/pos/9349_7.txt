I have seen this film more than once. It's not the best scifi movie I've ever seen, but it's not a bad movie. The acting is good and the characters are more "real" than most low-budget science fiction movies. (At least, it's not full of stupid bimbos, like so many other low-budget scifi.) I especially like Elizabeth Pena. She is a good actress and she is a worried single mother as well as any one and better than some. <br /> <br /> Do not let the non-reporters send you away. See for yourself and judge for yourself.
