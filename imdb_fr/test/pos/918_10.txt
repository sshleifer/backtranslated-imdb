Valentine "Dogkiller" Dussaut and Joe "The Judge" Kern join forces to clear the streets of Geneva! Chills as they get their hands on international heroin traffickers, Polish fugitives, sighted hooligans, stupid girlfriends, renegade dogs and too lazy critters to scrap their recyclables. Do not be fooled by Miramax's misleading advertising campaign, which describes it as a pretentious and artistic film. This movie is 100% action!
