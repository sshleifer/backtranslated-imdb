That's exactly how the director John Madden comes to settle with Nicolas Cage and Penelope Cruz in the role of an Italian officer and a Greek villager in an honorable story: "The mandolin of Captain Correli", escapes me! Witness: Cage's unstable and incoherent accent in the middle of a horrible overprint, with Cruz - better interpreted as a spoiled Latino against Johnny Depp in "Blow" - during a rehearsal under the pretext of a Greek nurse. .. yes, it was painful. But there were life-saving graces. <br /> <br /> The story itself is thrilling to tragic, and Cage has some musical abilities (reductive, that's it!). Then, a superb performance of John Hurt (father of Cruz, the village doctor) of Oscar Callibre, as well as Irene Papas, each as elders of the village, as well as Christian Bale (the son of Papas) among the freedom fighters of the village, go far to counterbalance the delicate performances (especially at the beginning) of Cruz and Cage. The last two seem to evolve in their respective roles as the film progresses, but it is very early. Finally, the landscape itself and the photography could deserve a technical prize, which provides a pleasant distraction if necessary. <br /> <br /> John Hurt already has two Oscar nominations and it would be a third; I hope he will understand his performance as a doctor makes this film worthy of interest. The real test of a secondary actor / actress is whether the movie would be identical or not without the character in question and, in this case, it would certainly not ... not even close. <br /> <br /> The value of entertainment, but for the aforementioned mentioned factors that help raise the bar. See if you do not want it. Rating = 3.5 stars (out of five).
