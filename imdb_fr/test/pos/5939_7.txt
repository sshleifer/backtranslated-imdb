It was essentially a remake of "Diagnosis Murder", without Victoria Rowell, Scott Baio and Charlie Schlatter. Dick plays a college professor who teaches criminology 101 and can not even find his own class. Barry is now a private eye, not tied to Dick. This allows Barry to shoot fleeing guys, which a cop can not do. Barry still gets the girl in the end. Tracey Needham describes the girl. She is the prime suspect and Dick and Barry believe she is innocent and prove it. That's all the spoiler you get. The end is unexpected enough that you do not already know it in the middle of the film. <br /> <br /> Do not take it seriously. Do not criticize him. Relax and enjoy Dick and Barry Van Dyke.
