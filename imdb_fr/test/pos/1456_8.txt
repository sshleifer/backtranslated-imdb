The man with the golden arm was part of a trio of great movies at the same time that dealt with drug addiction. The other two were Monkey On My Back and A Hatful of Rain. But I think of the three that this one is the best. <br /> <br /> Maybe if Otto Preminger had shot the film in real Chicago instead of those obvious studio sets, the film could have been even better. Who knows, maybe Preminger would not have enough money to pay for the site. That's the only flaw I find in the movie. <br /> <br /> Frank Sinatra is a heroin addict who was beaten for covering his boss, Robert Strauss, during the search of the game. He took the cure in jail and wants a new life of jazz drummer. But many people conspire against him. <br /> <br /> First of all, Bob Strauss, who wants him back in the game, especially because two very heavy players are in town. He uses some sneaky methods to recover Sinatra's services. Second, Darren McGavin is the local drug dealer who wants Sinatra to be good and become a customer again. And finally, Eleanor Parker, his wife who clings to the conquest, just beats to keep it. <br /> <br /> Frank Sinatra was nominated for best actor award for this film, but lost against Ernest Borgnine to Marty. Sinatra might have won for this one if he had not won for From Here to Eternity in the Supporting Actors category a few years ago and Marty was such an acclaimed movie that year. His scenes of withdrawal locked in the apartment of Kim Novak will leave you upset. <br /> <br /> Eleanor Parker does not get enough credit for her role. She's really something mad as crazy intrigue that wants Sinatra to be attached to her, no matter the price. If she had not been named the same year for Interrupted Melody, she might have been nominated for that. 1955 marks the culmination of his career. <br /> <br /> Darren McGavin got his first real notice as a very serpentine drug salesman. His performance is sure to thrill your flesh. <br /> <br /> Elmer Bernstein wrote a superb jazz score to accentuate the general sadness of the dark Chicago neighborhood in which the characters live. This is not a place you would like to see appear. your family.
