I saw this movie for the first time not long ago. If you ask me, you will not get the credit it deserves. It's a bit like if American Pie met Fast Times at Ridgemont High but with more depth. It deals with the same problems as the two films, but in a way that preserves a grain of truth. The end is sad, but that's how life is. I think everyone should see it. I have it as a DVD, and it took a long time to find it too. That should say something, hey and another thing I'm going to add is that it's pretty hard to find the soundtrack. I think they stopped him, but the soundtrack of this movie is amazing. It contains songs from artists such as The Commodores, U2, Devo, REO Speedwagon, The Cars, KC and the Sunshine Band, and many more.
