If you like Chan-wook Park, you know what to expect. His films are brutal, poetic, tragic and artistic, with touches of very dark humor. THIRST is clearly Park's style, and I loved every second, from cinematography (every shot is beautiful and creative) to the story, which combines Shakespearian tragedy, murderous love, Gothic horror and superimposed characters' dramas. The characters are complex and the moral ambiguity is great. Even the most sociopathic character evokes sympathy. Management is limited and performance is nuanced - like SYMPATHY FOR MR. VENGEANCE, there are too many subtleties to take into account during the first viewing. Chan-wook Park is an intelligent, daring and always surprising filmmaker. It's unpredictable - the scenes go from brutal and heartbreaking to hilarious laughter in an instant. This is closer to LADY VENGEANCE, then to SYMPATHY FOR MR. VENGEANCE to be comic and comic. But, like LADY VENGEANCE, he is incredibly rich, stimulating and enriching. <br /> <br /> If you like admirably told vampire stories (leave room on the right) or if you're a fan of Chan-wook Park, see The third should be obvious. Easily one of the best movies of 2009.
