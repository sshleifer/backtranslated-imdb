CÃ©sar (Alain Chabat) challenges Cleopatra (the delicious Monica Bellucci): to prove that the Egyptians are better than the Romans, she promises to build without delay a magnificent castle for Caesar. She calls the single-armed architect Numerobis (Jamel Debbuzi) and offers him two options: to be covered with gold if he accomplishes his mission or become a crocodile-based food if he fails. Numerobis will ask help from Panoramix (Claude Rich), Asterix (Christian Clavier) and Obelix (Geraard Depardieu) (with Ideiafix). This movie is very entertaining, especially the games where Obelix and the hackers led by Red Beard participate. However, the screenwriter and the director should have noted that French is not a universal language like English. As a result, jokes with words (as in Austin Powers movies, for example) do not work well for non-French speakers. The French and people who speak French fluently will certainly appreciate these jokes, but that makes no sense to me, it does not speak French. My vote is seven.
