A surprisingly good and witty adventure starring Kelsey Grammer (who is supposed to play her first lead role in a feature film) as a sub-commander of the unconventional Navy who wants to run her own nuclear submarine; he deserved it by facing the US Navy in a series of war games with a crew of untested, dubious and adorable men (as well as a woman). <br /> <br /> Director David S. Ward ("Major League") and his writers have concocted a hysterically intelligent and upbeat comedy that tries to make the film easy to understand, which they do very well. Secondly, in addition to the Grammer character, most of the team members provide some of the film's humor, which is treated like a double-edged sword. Three members of the secondary distribution - Harland Williams, Toby Huss and Rob Schneider provide the funniest scenes, which include strange gestures, imitations and their personality. <br /> <br /> "Down Periscope" is more than a marine version of "Police Academy" or "The Dirty Dozen". The film is about doing the job properly and I liked it.
