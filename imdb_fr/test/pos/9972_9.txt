The problem inherent in any staging of "The Merchant of Venice" has never been a pseudo-controversial anti-Semitism, but the fact that there are two lines of scenario extremely different in terms of content and tone; a frothy romantic comedy and a burning tragedy. Although genre mixing was fashionable in the 16th century (and Shakespeare makes fun of him in Hamlet), he rarely fails to appeal to modern audiences. As a result, most filmmakers are forced to focus on one scenario to the detriment of the other, and it is not surprising that the decision is favorable to Shylock. Great tragic heroes, Shylock continues to fascinate after 400 years because he is a difficult and complex character. Pitiable, proud, angry, vengeful, weak, arrogant; his behavior simply defies the analysis and continues to be discussed. He is imperfect not because he is Jewish, but because he is human. It is rare for modern writers to imbue their creations with rich and textual contradictions, and Shakespeare must take advantage of them to inspire us. Shakespearean language is unleashed and saturated with multiple meanings. play and metaphor. To be understood, it must be discussed and tamed by an actor with the strength and knowledge to do it. When an actor fails, the words burst into a torrent of incomprehensible words, but when he succeeds, the English language comes alive with breathtaking immediacy and vivacity. Al Pacino is one of those actors and here displays an incredible level of clarity and control that, if there was justice, would sweep every reward in the offer. He takes on the challenge of presenting Shylock head-on and offers an extraordinarily subtle and nuanced performance. It would be a crime if we never had a chance to see what he's doing with King Lear. <br /> <br /> The support cast is remarkable. Jeremy Irons gives an original version of the famous Antonio, presenting an older and quieter figure that displays the unsavory contradictions between medieval chivalry and the ugly prejudices of the time. Joseph Fiennes is a revelation as he matures beyond the superficial miracles to actually inhabit a character for once. Lynn Collins is the only disappointment. Many Shakespeare women are underwritten and ask an actor to work hard to bring them to life. Collins' personification for Gwyneth Paltrow seems a little flat and unsuited to the darker tone that Radford aims for. <br /> The design team must be recognized for having created a unique and completely believable vision of the Venice of the end of the Renaissance. The city has not seemed so threatening since "Do not look now". Taking full advantage of existing venues and natural light, the film has an aspect of authenticity greatly enhanced by the design of dark and outdated costumes. Once again, everyone deserves to be rewarded. <br /> <br /> Donors of such films should be commended. With a budget of $ 30 million, they must engage in such an enterprise knowing full well that they will never make a profit and that they invest nonetheless. We can all be grateful because the result is a remarkable adaptation that will certainly be a reference for the years to come.
