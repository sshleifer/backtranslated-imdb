Before seeing this movie, I read the comment of someone who did not like it very much. This, I must admit, made me afraid of spending 1 hour and 48 minutes of my life, but I am happy to have done so. Ryan Gosling is a fantastic actor. I particularly loved the believer. Don Cheadle was also fantastic. The film presented an interesting vision of life and death. It was very touching and very sad, but it always interested me, which most touching stories can not do. It's a movie that does not care whether you like it or not, you should see it. It was unique, and I do not think anyone can ever reproduce it. All the young actors were surprisingly successful considering the subject and the emotion he must have felt. I was pleasantly surprised.
