I really refused to see this movie. I refused to go with the school and I refused to go with my parents. Just looking at the trailer, it seemed stupid. One of my friends wanted to take me to the movies that day and he offered me two choices, "The Dukes of Hazzard" or "Wallace and Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Bunny". It took me 17 minutes to decide. Time was running out. I had to choose. He appeared on the screen "Few" as in a few remaining notes. By the time we had to queue and get our ticket, only one of us could enter. I desperately wanted Nicholas to see him. But he forced me. I crossed my arms and was in a bad mood and disappointed that I was going to see this childishness. I came in, sitting in the only seat available and prepared for the movie! I must say that I was very surprised to witness this masterpiece! It was incredible. I do not know what I was complaining about. The Clay animation was by far the best I've ever seen in my life. The story was brilliant. About a rabbit disturbing and crushing a carnival planned for more than 500 years. Essentially, pest control products protect people who participate in the vegetable contest. The anti-pesto known as Wallace and Gromit (responsible for this trade) is trying to keep all rabbits away from the carnival of vegetables. I will not say anymore. It's too good to say. I admit that the idea of ​​a werewolf is incredible and childish, but Nick Park adds a substance that makes everyone love him. I mean, there will be no 10-foot rabbits at liberty and there will certainly be no 8-foot werewolves like the "Dog Soldiers". Again, werewolves and werewolves are not real creatures. But anyway, it worked very well. <br /> <br /> The jokes were also bigger. Children will not understand some of the jokes. It's going well above their heads. There were a lot of British jokes in there. If you like British humor, this movie is for you. <br /> <br /> I also liked the cast and the voices. Everything in the movie is incredibly well done. The direction and rhythm were absolutely ... FANTASTIC! I recommend it to the fans of the old Wallace And Gromit shorts (and no, I have not seen them yet), and I recommend it to those who liked "Shrek" and "Shrek 2" and, more importantly, I recommend it to users who love Clay Animation: a good movie that breaks!
