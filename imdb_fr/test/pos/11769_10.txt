what a good little movie, full of good roles of random stars. Basically, there are those pot producers who embark on a comic adventure. At times, the movie makes you believe that everyone will finish dead! Which adds to the comedy. When the character of John Lithgow (3rd Rock) reappears - impossible not to imagine the trip, it may have provoked, as a total paradox. The film is full of twists that make you guess until the end. Billy Bob Thornton, farmer astronaut) is brilliant. In fact, the character is quite similar in the fact that he keeps the family of market gardeners together. Everyone involved in this film should have a big boost. <br /> <br /> As I say, the final scene is a dream; However, one nightmare at a time. I love when Hank Azaria (Carter) says in the end, do you think we should do it every year? I felt myself wishing they did it. <br /> <br /> I'm not going to say that this movie is good for everyone, but as a stoner movie lover, I give it 10/10. - My advice has a seal ready; Relax and enjoy!
