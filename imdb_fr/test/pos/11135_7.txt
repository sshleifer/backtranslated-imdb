In 2023, in a world governed by the economic interests of big business (and not by the people or politicians), Kam (Bobbie Phillips) is a hybrid human agent and an agent of the IBI (International Bureau of Investigation). It is called a "sub" (subhuman), and its genetic composition is 80% human and 20% animal. She has a combination of cougar genes that gives her strength and flexibility. Falcon, which gives him an increased ability to see and hear; and chameleon, it gives him the power to hide. In the first film, she was a very seductive and amoral woman, using sex to get information. I have not watched the second yet, but in this third, the story is full of action. A group of scientists has been developing a new form of hazardous energy generation for fifteen years. The search is not over yet, when one of them betrays the other and steals the search. The problem is that, because of its molecular instability, a black hole will be created and will suck the whole planet. Kam rescues Dr. Tess Adkins (Teal Redmann), the survival of the team of scientists, and tries to recover the dangerous invent from the hands of the "bad guys". There is a very strong "under" in this band that causes a lot of difficulties for Kam. This sci-fi action and television movie is better than the first, recalling "The Terminator" in some parts of the plot. Bobbie Phillips is a very beautiful actress and her outfit is very cool. I am becoming a fan of this good entertainment. Fans of science fiction movies will not be disappointed. Now I'm trying to buy `Chameleon 2 '. My vote is seven.
