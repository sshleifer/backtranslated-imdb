Documentaries in which sons and daughters seek to understand a parent and, in doing so, their own lives are not so rare. Results that also reflect the lack of talent, a lack of introspection, a profusion of narcissism and, perhaps, a carefree quest for vengeance publicly spattered with countless past wounds, real and fantasized. What is unusual is the brilliant, just and captivating portrait of a fascinating parent. "My architect: the journey of a son" is a rare feat. <br /> <br /> Louis Kahn emigrated to this country as a child, his face irremediably and brutally marked by an accident. He and his parents moved to Philadelphia, where young talent adored art and music. Soon, he fell in love with the buildings and decided that only a career as an architect would meet his creative abilities. <br /> <br /> Kahn became an architect, but as this film shows, it took a long time to get the attention of the leaders in his field. An architect suggests that he was a victim of the "yellow armband", that anti-Semitism, which with prejudice against women, has long been an unsavory aspect of the profession of American architect. <br /> <br /> When he managed to get noticed. he was accurately seen as a workaholic prophet, self-assured, tirelessly exclaiming, asking him to realize his vision and only his vision. This inflexibility was the reason why he built magnificent plans for many buildings, but he built some of them. The interview with an old man who fired Kahn in Philadelphia because of his unacceptable dream of a transformed urban center where people were leaving their cars on the perimeter and entering the city was hilarious. <br /> <br /> Kahn was a born teacher and some of the many archive footage presented here show with students, his firm but passionate voice, their eyes intense and respectful. <br /> <br /> Many architects were interviewed by the director, scriptwriter and project specialist, Nathaniel Kahn, the only architect son. Some are world famous - I. Mr. Pei, Robert A. Stone, Moshe Safdie, Frank Gehry and the still active ninety-year-old Philip Johnson. Their comments paint a striking picture of this idealist, but in the end, financially unsuccessful, designers of buildings blending castles, fortresses and great buildings of past centuries to projects today. The buildings of Kahn are shown, among the most impressive being the Salk Research Laboratories in La Jolla, California. For me, her style has a neo-romantic air, softened by too much empty space that repels rather than attracts human interaction. <br /> <br /> But Kahn's son was after more than the story of his father, the architect. For many years, Louis Kahn had three families: a woman with whom he had a daughter and two long-standing relationships, one of which had a daughter, the other the son. Kahn often visited his son at the mother's house, but at the end of the evening, his mother and son took him back to the matrimonial home. Nathaniel clearly wanted to know more about this unusual set of relationships, but it does not seem to be marked by what was certainly a strange case for a little boy. <br /> <br /> When Nathaniel was a young boy, Louis Kahn died of a heart attack in the men's room of the Pennsylvania Station in New York after returning from India where he had launched one of his gigantic projects, another built. At that time, his Philadelphia business had at least $ 500,000 in debt and probably would have gone near the Federal Bankruptcy Court. <br /> <br /> Kahn has left several monumental buildings whose government building in Bangladesh is clearly the largest. A local architect in tears congratulates Kahn for creating a building in which democracy could flourish (hopefully). <br /> <br /> His fellow architect Moshe Safdie believes that it might have been better for Kahn to have a fatal heart attack at a station because of his incessant globetrot. I do not agree: it is unfortunately ironic that Kahn dies to replace without face one of the true jewels of the American architecture, the old Pennsylvania Station, destroyed to leave the place to a sterile replacement without character and without continuation of the civic memory. <br /> There are several emotional moments filmed during the young Kahn's journey, especially with his half-sisters and his mother, but they are sincere and moving, and not threatened. Architecture historians will always study Kahn. His son had reason to remember him as an imperfect man, but very iconoclastic and ultimately private. <br /> <br /> 9/10.
