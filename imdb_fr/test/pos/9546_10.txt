I'm salivating for the suites. I needed something to keep me from going crazy with tension, anxiety (if it was not so good ?!) and constant lack of information. I needed something to calm down a bit, to pass the time, other than, of course, The Matrix. That was it. <br /> <br /> I found it informative (like the part on Keanu's neck ...) and some were funny. I feel so sorry for Carrie-Anne when she said there was only one bathroom and all these guys. I found only one problem with that. Since 95% of those present were actually men, they just let their mouths go wild, and there was a language. It's not as bad as the feats of The Shawshank Redemption, but this scene where Keanu tells a bad day, close your ears if you're small. > <br /> <br /> It was fun and it was exactly what I needed. That's what all the crazy Matrix fans need to keep quiet. They talk a little bit about the suites, and someone gives almost something, but he makes up for it in time (shoot!). It does not give you almost no spoilers, but it's good to have it if you're a matrix head like me. <br /> <br /> There is no spoon.
