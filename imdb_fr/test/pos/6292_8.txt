I like that! I like Pauly Shore. It seems that some people do not agree. It's humor, and he's not like everyone else. The movie is great. I like the story and most of the characters in the movie. It's funny since the first time she met him at school. I like the fact that she chooses him from the guys at home. I like that Tiffani Theissan is not a bad girl at the end. All the secrets are revealed. Only the people you want to see are left. (Except for those of you who do not like Pauly Shore.) Even if you do not like him, there are funny roles and his family is torturing him for most of the movie. She is a peasant girl gone crazy and needs to be heard. She finally succeeds. There is just enough love and romance. I give it a 8 out of 10.
