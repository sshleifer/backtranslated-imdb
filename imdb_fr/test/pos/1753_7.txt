Hoppity is a charming but slightly phycadelic animated film that, since it was made in 1941, has stood the test of time. Now, I have to admit that I have a soft spot for "HoppityGoes To Town" (as it's called in the UK) after watching a VHS version of the TV recorded by our parents on several occasions with my siblings. Imagine my surprise when I woke up This morning, just in time to see it on Channel Four (at 6:15, this is not the slightest occasion!). The film was as charming as I remembered with a time-tested animation and a beautiful moral story that should appeal to parents and children alike. alike. Maybe someday he will share this forgotten classic with my own children. With a good running time for children (88 minutes) and a simple but captivating storyline, there's something for everyone in this story of the little man who is doing well. I could really see that this was done successfully in CGI. Take note of Pixar.
