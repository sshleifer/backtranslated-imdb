78 years ago ... the premiere of "Anna Christie" announced by the slogan "Garbo Talks!" The film lasts 16 minutes and the curiosity reaches its climax: Greta enters the bar and passes through a long-awaited transfer of silence to sound: a few seconds close its silent era and, finally, Greta Garbo announces a historic line: "Give me a whiskey, ginger ale and do not be stingy, baby! " <br /> <br /> "Anna Christie" (1930) is the film of Clarence Brown who presented a great silent star, Greta Garbo. Nowadays, one can only imagine what this important transfer was for actors and actresses. The careers of many of them were doomed to failure - something we do not see at all at present. And it is no coincidence that it was Clarence Brown who directed the first walkie-talkie with the beautiful Swedish. Garbo trusted the director after two of his big dumb productions, FLESH AND THE DEVIL (1926) and A WOMAN OF AFFAIRS (1928), films that were a resounding success at the box office, both with Garbo in the lead. <br /> <br /> But we are in 2008 and this fact about the film, now purely historical, seems to be of minor importance. The question for today's viewers is not how the voice of Garbo sounds, but if the film is still watchable after 78 years. In other words, we all try to answer the question if the film has stood the test of time. Does he have? <br /> <br /> When I watched it recently, I came to the conclusion that, aside from some minor technical aspects, including the static camera, "Anna Christie" was always a lot of fun. On the one hand, it is the wonderful story of a life, of a reality that the young woman is confronted with (inspired by Eugene O'Neill's play), and, on the other hand, an artistic manifestation of a real magnificence in the Let me analyze these two aspects in separate paragraphs. <br /> <br /> CONTENT: Chris Christopherson (George F. Marion), a great drinker, lives his life as a sailor on a barge. he is comforted by a letter from his daughter Anna (Garbo), whom he has not seen for 15 years, and says that she will come back to see him, and he begins to change everything for the better. is no longer an inexperienced child, but a 23-year-old woman who has lived all kinds of things on a Minnessota farm where she lived and worked, and forgets that she has the right to accept another type of love. in his life ... This brief presentation of the content not from the point of view of the main chara cter but cel What is presented to us earlier than Anna (her father Chris) makes you understand how universal it is. Simply no letter of all the text that life seems to have been erased after all these years. The cases discussed here in 1930 are still significant and valid ... <br /> <br /> PERFORMANCES. There are not many characters in the movie, but there are two that really shine in the roles. It is of course Greta Garbo herself who did something extraordinary in her phenomenon that lasts for 15 years, a presence that strongly marked the history of the beginning of the cinema (something that I had already mentioned in good many of my previous comments on his films). But here, Garbo is slightly different. I admit that there are moments in this film where she does not feel very comfortable with her role. This seems to be caused by his new experience with sound in English; However, his performance is, as always, authentic and unique. But that's what everyone expects from Garbo. The real surprise of the film for the viewers of 1930 and also for us is Marie Dressler in the role of Marthy. She is excellent in the expressions of her face, in her accent, in all the representation of a woman who drinks, who looks at life from the point of view of "hitting the bottle". Her best moments include the conversation with Anna Christie in the bar preceded by her hilarious chat with Chris. The rest of the supporting actors are good but not great (here, the German version replaces it). In particular Dressler, with the exception of Garbo herself, is an absolutely flawless choice. <br /> <br /> If you asked me what I like about "Anna Christie" today, that's what I would say: it's a classic movie. However, there is one more thing that I must mention at the end. It is a humor, a wonderful spirit that is noticed everywhere. Although the content is quite serious and "Anna Christie" does not carry the spirit of comedy (Garbo's only comedy was NINOTCHKA), there are times when you separate. Do not miss, for example, the visit of Anna and Matt to the amusement park, especially the restaurant where he orders her milk, thinking how virtuous and innocent she is, a beer for herself and where suddenly , Marthy joins them by chance ... "Anna Christie" is a perfect film for classical music lovers and a must for everyone at least a little interested in the true magnificence of the performance. If you are tired of these modern starlets, look for such films and you will be satisfied. Very worth your search! <br /> <br /> Skaal Greta Garbo! Skaal Marie Dressler! Let us toast to the excellent work you have done in the film! Skaal after all these years where the wine tastes much better and where your mind is with us in a different sense ...
