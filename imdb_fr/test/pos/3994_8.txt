This film, which won the Best Director Award in Cannes in 2002 for Im Kwon-Taek (tied with PT Anderson for Punch-Drunk Love), talks about a nineteenth-century Korean painter with common roots and impact significant on Korean painting. One of the highlights of the film is that Im is trying to help us see with the eyes of a painter. So we see many scenes and objects that help our drunken painter friend, Jang Seung-up (Choi Min-shik),? inspiration. <br /> <br /> The costumes and the artistic direction are all impressive and the acting is good. It's not a film that moved me, but it's a film that made me think about art and what it means to find your own voice. It's pretty cool. It is also interesting to see a version of Korea at this time just before the turn of the century, where the Chinese and Japanese powers are both in Korea and where the Chosun Kingdom is coming to an end. More than one revolution and one political ideology are united in the film, but are never the center. It's firmly on the painter. <br /> <br /> In the end, it's a well-done film about the life of a painter. But it does not exactly have the plot of the three-act structure, so you must be able to take a non-standard Hollywood story to look at it. Yay for art! 8/10
