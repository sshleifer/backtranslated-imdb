Or vice versa. <br /> <br /> This is a French black film directed by an American director (Jules Dassin) who had to leave the country because of his blacklisting by Hollywood thanks to HUAC. The premise of the story is quite familiar - a last jewel for Tony the Stephanian and his buds - just like the end when everyone arrives ... Well, no mess here, of course, since this is of the kind of film in which the tension towards the end is important. <br /> <br /> Dassin shot in the streets of Paris with realistic black and white lighting, with non-glamorous actors and actresses. The engaging, sometimes intrusive score of Georges Auric nicely enriches the film and will remind viewers of many similar scores of American black films from the 1940s and early 1950s. Jean Servais plays the hardcore and devouring role in a fedora, just as Humphrey Bogart could have played it. Tony has just come out of prison, past his peak, but remains tough and decisive when he must, his mind still alive when concentrated, the kind of anti-hero whose eyes keep flowing, even if the tears never fall. <br /> Dassin plays the Italian safecracker and the so-called lady, who knows the rules, but becomes careless. <br /> <br /> In the film noir, we are obliged to identify ourselves with the bad guys. There are often levels of villains, the "good" bad guys we identify with and the "bad guys" who have a hard time doing in our bad guys, and maybe there's really a bad guy nasty villain or two. (Here we have Remi Grutter, played by Robert Hossein, a somewhat sadistic drug addict.) Then there are the cops who are almost irrelevant. In a more modern black movie, the bad guys are not even "good" bad guys, and they are doing well or something. In the old film noir, from the gangster films of the 30s, the usual motto, following the old "Hollywood code", was "The crime does not pay", each criminal having to pay for his crime before the end of the film . <br /> <br /> The most impressive aspect of Rififi is undoubtedly the smooth running of the film. The plot unfolds quickly and smoothly, just like the great directors have always done, directors like Stanley Kubrick, Louis Malle and the best of Hitchcock. Some have compared this to Kubrick's The Killing (1956) and suggest that Kubrick flew a bit. Well, filmmakers always steal as needed, and there may be similarities, such as a "last flight" for the protagonist and the fact that the girl erases the job. The similarities can go further because this movie was nearing its end, I suddenly thought: oh, no! the suitcase on the back seat will come out of the convertible, hit the ground, burst, and all the money will fly in the air! Those of you who have seen The Killing may remember what happened to the money towards the end of the movie! Which makes me think of another movie where something good is going on: U Turn (1997) by Oliver Stone with Sean Penn. There, the money in his backpack chokes under the effect of a shotgun. Hahaha! To obtain the dubbed version of this film would be sacrilege, because the dialogue (when there is one: the flight itself is done entirely without dialogue, about 30 minutes) is complicated and easy to follow, asking for only one shot. occasional eye to subtitles. which, by the way, are rather utilitarian and orientable as opposed to the exact wording of each word. <br /> <br /> Another thing: all the brutality is done as the sex was done in the movie, it's off camera. A guy gets his throat cut. We do not see it. I like this approach. We do not have to see the gore. You could almost let your children see Rififi - or almost. <br /> <br /> Catch him now and be on the hunt for a Hollywood cover starring Al Pacino and directed by Harold Becker that will be released next year. sure that the violent scenes will be played in their entirety.
