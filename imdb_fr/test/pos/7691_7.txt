I first saw the opening of Otto Preminger's "Porgy and Bess" on television, probably in the early 80's, and my young person found it a bit slow, despite the timeless music. I put it out <br /> <br /> Yesterday evening, an extremely rare and paved copy that was screened at the L.A. Cinematheque was a bit of a revelation. The performances are strong and memorable. Dorothy Dandridge brings her a lot of vulnerability, strength and subtle eroticism (at least by today's standards). It is said that Sidney Poitier is uncomfortable with the film, but his performance is excellent, as is Pearl Bailey. Better yet, Sammy Davis as Sportin 'Life, cat-like lover, and Brock Peters as naughty Crown. <br /> <br /> Still, I'm not a fan of Preminger, who was earlier, leaded - and a lot easier to see - "Carmen Jones." Porgy and Bess "is far superior to this less controversial film - though it may have to do with the fact that the source material is also far superior. <br /> <br /> As we have seen at night Last, it's a far from perfect job, not every moment comes to life, and there is some discomfort in the way the film mixes the stylized game of Catfish Row (beautifully directed by Oliver Smith) In fact, even in my rather untrained ear, brief portions of the score seem unduly popularized. <br /> <br /> In addition, this does not affect the success of the filmmakers - the Preminger's decision to shoot almost entirely in wide shots, with no close-ups and occasional average shots, no doubt made unassailable on "swept and digitized" television, and can even be condemned even on widescreen DVDs if the restoration he rite is restored. On smaller screens, we can not distinguish the many details are crucial to the way organized Preminger film. <br /> <br /> x heard last night was strange. Many voices, especially at the opening of "Summertime", seemed excessively soft and submerged by instrumental music. Maybe this can be corrected in a restoration. <br /> <br /> There is the issue of the racial politics of the film. Personally, I do not see anything wrong with that, at least in a contemporary context. At the time when very few films featured strong African-American characters, this might seem like an unfortunate choice for a big-budget Hollywood movie. And while there may not be much empowerment, they are recognizable human beings who are not racial stereotypes. These are opera characters who make bad choices because that's what the tragic characters do. That alone took a giant step forward at the time. <br /> <br /> In a modern context where strong and heroic Afro-American characters are less rare (although not yet common enough), these characters seem neither more nor less than man. They could really be poor and under-educated people of all ethnic origins. <br /> <br /> Apart from the thorny politics, the original work is undoubtedly one of the greatest achievements of American (American) music and theater. Poitier, Davis, Dandridge, Peters and, yes, Pearl Bailey, were all incredible artists we will never see again. This film, less than perfect but still solid, clearly deserves to be seen and appreciated.
