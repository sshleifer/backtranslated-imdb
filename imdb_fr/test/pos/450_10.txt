Most people will consider that Yul Brynner's greatest performance was that of Siam in THE KING AND I. He certainly gave her a wide variety of moods to test her abilities in areas such as comic, tragic , the desire to learn to dominate and hatred. . It also showed him to his advantage as a "conversation singer" and dancer. Finally, as it was also his Tony Award-winning Broadway performance, the film allowed us to capture something of Broadway's superb performance. <br /> <br /> But he made other films that showed his talents as well as THE KING AND I. His comic shoot ONCE MORE WITH FEELING was pretty cool. The same goes for the role of General Bunin in ANASTASIA or that of Ramses in THE DIX COMMANDMENTS. Yet he was terribly close to being a successor to Eric Von Stroheim in the 1950s as a "man you love to hate". A certain vulnerability in his acting and his roles made him attractive to the film public, even after his best star years were behind him - and he retired more and more to repeat the king from Siam on TV and on the stage. <br /> <To me, his best performance is in this 1959 drama with Deborah Kerr, Jason Robards Jr., Robert Morley, Marshall EG, Anne Jackson and Ronnie Howard. The film takes place at a fairly recent time - the powder keg that was Hungary in 1956, when briefly it seemed that the iron curtain was about to collapse under the reforms of the Hungarian patriot Imre Nagy and his followers. But the Hungarian revolution collapsed due to bad timing. The Russians and their Polish and East German allies sent tanks to crush the revolt (and arrested and executed Nagy and other reformers). The West let it go and let that happen: England and France had been caught in the Suez crisis and the United States had reprimanded them, as well as Israel, for attacking Egypt. Due to the actions of three close allies of the United States, the West has struggled to condemn the overexploitation of the Soviet Union. It was an unfortunate situation and the Hungarians never forgot how they had been abandoned. <br /> <br /> In the film, Brynner is Major Surov, an officer of the Russian intelligence services on the lookout for some of the revolt leaders, including Paul Kedes (Jason Robards). Kedes could be helped by Westerners on a bus tour through Hungary, led by Robert Morley (including Marshall, Jackson, and Howard, and Kerr). The latter are kept in a hotel while their bus is being repaired, and Brynner mingles with them, hoping to have a track for the location of Robards. But Brynner is human - he tries to impersonate these people (who all see him as a monster), and in sequence, when he has drunk too much, he confronts them with the questions that historians have been concerned about since 1945: How is it? he that relations between Russia and the West have collapsed so quickly (even if one finds that Russia had Stalin in charge)? The Allies, on the whole, had worked well together from 1941 to 1945, but after Yalta and Potsdam, all sorts of mutual suspicions erupted. Did they have to? Surov is a good officer, but he is supported by his loyalty to the communist regimes in the Soviet Union and Hungary and by his growing attachment to Kerr, who hides Robards but is also ready to point out the more human side. of the Russian major. And while the film reaches its tragic climax, we see Surov decide whether he will follow his sense of duty or whether he should have pity on Kerr, Robards and other Westerners who want to leave. It becomes a real struggle for him - and a victory he could win much too late. It was a great film about a tragedy of post-war Europe and probably the most thought-out role ever played by Yul Brynner.
