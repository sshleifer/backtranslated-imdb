This is the kind of movie that older people will say, "I did not think they were making movies like this anymore." Walter Matthau gives his usual performance, but instead of leaving teeth marks all over the landscape, leaves endearing fat stains. He's like that great-uncle who always wears Scottish polyester and embarrasses everyone, but we still love it. <br /> <br /> Jack Lemmon's performance reminds us why he has received more Golden Globes nominations than anyone else (22). He gives a faithful interpretation of the "good ordinary man", even in the context of a joke. <br /> <br /> This movie will probably not appeal to people who prefer a direct and honest or offensive humor, but will please people who appreciate the farce in the broad sense. <br /> <br /> The entire cast is excellent in its ability to play such absurd characters while preserving the reality of each character. <br /> <br /> Brent Spiner gives a wonderful performance as a professional version of a salon lizard. Anyone who has known professional hosts in real life will immediately recognize the guy he plays. He nails the guy perfectly. His interpretation of "slime" deserves to be studied as a perfect example of the contrast between absurd and pathetic. <br /> <br /> The plot is rather a simple theme: "let's get married rich" which has the usual results. It's not because a plot theme has been done a thousand times that it's dated, but on the contrary it's a timeless theme. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast shows what can happen when professionals expose skills in the roles that are written for them, instead of competing for the spotlight. In this film, even the second-tier actors shine. It is also obvious that they liked to make this film. <br /> <br /> The plot can be classic and slender, but it allows the performers to shine. <br /> <br /> This movie is a real treat for people who want to see professional actors engage in their craft. The plot falls and the performers shine.
