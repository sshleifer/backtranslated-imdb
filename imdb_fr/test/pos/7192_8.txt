The second release for Asterix is ​​much better than the pasted elements of ten different stories called the first film, remaining rather close to the original comic. <br /> <br /> In summary, Queen Cleopatra made a bet with Caeser to build a palace in Egypt to show that the Egyptians are a great people. The royal architect Edifis asks for help from Asterix, Obelix and the druid Getafix to carry out his task. There are many moments of laughter, some jokes that only the French can have (jibes at the 35-hour week), others more universal. The big-budget special effects are spectacular but eclipsed by the jokes of the original comic. <br /> <br /> Depardieu and Clavier are still working perfectly on the pair, while Monica Bellucci is doing a perfect casting as Cleopatra. For comic book fans, hilarious pirates discover their absence in movie 1.
