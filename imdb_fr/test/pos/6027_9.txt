I had the chance to see The Last Stop here where I live at the Moving Pictures Film Festival (for those of you who do not know it, the Moving Pictures Film Festival is a tour of Canadian-produced films in Canada ). Just before the movie started, I was told it was a world premiere and was about to get a US distribution deal, which added to my enthusiasm. <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of horror movies, and yes, I also like the Scream trilogy. So when I discovered that Rose McGowan was doing a movie like Ten Little Indians, I knew I would be a feast. Rose McGowan was the best-known actor / actress of the festival. <br /> <br /> The best way to describe it without giving up too much of the plot is that it's not quite like Scream. And that is certainly worth the detour. It takes place in the midst of a snowstorm (it was filmed in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada) in a mountain-top motel, adding to the suspense. Rose McGowan achieves a great performance as a girl next door (?!) With the rest of the cast. And in terms of what's going on at the end, well, the only thing I'll say is that you'll never guess the end. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this will probably not happen in the usual North American theaters. Rose McGowan is the only manufacturer of silver worthy of the name. But if you have the chance to see it, I recommend it. And if the worst happens, there is always a video. <br /> <br /> I gave him a 9 out of 10.
