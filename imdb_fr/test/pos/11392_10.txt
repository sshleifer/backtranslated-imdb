"Boogie Nights" uses its protagonist, Dirk Diggler, as a metaphor for celebrities accumulated over a decade in the shameful past of the United States, which included an unexpected increase in pornography, resulting in an abundance of corrupt young people. His main character borrows features from a variety of authentic actors, engaging in many illegal deals that have been mixed with celebrities in Hollywood and too often exploited by the press. It sounds like the kind of big tale that could appear on an E! True Hollywood Story Special. Drugs, sex and violence - the American dream. But what goes up must come down, and the bigger it is, the harder it gets. <br /> <br /> Dirk Diggler's dreams are immense, as well as another valuable asset to his body. Dirk's real name is Eddie Adams, a Californian who dreams of becoming a star. He believes that God gives a great talent to every individual on the planet and that his gift is rather unusual. After having quarreled with his mother, Eddie leaves the house and meets the shabby Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds), an adult film director who offers him work. Eddie eventually becomes a big porn star, representing the "main actor" of most of Horner's films. With a new success, Eddie thinks he needs to invent a new name. That's how Dirk Diggler was born. <br /> <br /> Eddie / Dirk himself is mainly based on the famous porn star John Holmes, whose life was adapted in 2003 with 'Wonderland', with Val Kilmer. "Boogie Nights" is arguably the best of both, proving that movies about porn can be shot without disgusting its target audience: the usual movie buffs. <br /> <br /> The film takes place in 1977, era of pornography artists - the filmmakers really thought they could compensate for the weak points of the characteristics classified X by adding deep stories and a hypnotic atmosphere. In a way, the director of the film, Paul Thomas Anderson, implements a very artistic approach to the project, which culminates in a free and artistic film about a period in American history when coal was really both free and artistic. Anderson's style is so deep and so distinct that we quickly feel like reliving the era. There is not a moment where we are not convinced of the time range covered in the film. <br /> <br /> All was not happy on the set of "Boogie Nights". Before filming, Anderson had contacted Reynolds several times, repeatedly asking him to play Horner. Finally, Reynolds agreed, but said the film was horrible and was the worst part of his career, disavowing him publicly, before being nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor and suddenly closing. A year earlier, Anderson had suffered title disputes over Sydney / Hard Eight. He preferred this last title to his film and New Line Cinema thought that the first was more marketable. He essentially lost the battle and Anderson wisely avoided the title clashes this time by inserting the words "boogie nights" in his movie by the mouth of a character. <br /> <br /> The cast of the film is part of it. best aspects. The regulars of Paul Thomas Anderson are here, as well as many members of high level. To name some of the most famous stars: John C. Reilly, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Luis Guzman, William H. Macy, Heather Graham and Julianne Moore. But the whole film is essentially limited to Mark Wahlberg, Eddie, who is surprisingly convincing in his role. Wahlberg, previously known for his singing career and his disappointing activities in Hollywood, has all the necessary traits to describe such a character. This is his best role to date. <br /> <br /> Anderson knows how to captivate his audience and take full control of each scene. When Jack Horner meets Eddie for the first time, Anderson stealthily uses stars as a backdrop, a sign of the future, and a hidden symbolism as late as possible. The opening scene is three minutes, a long follow-up plan that follows Jack and Amber in a nightclub, where most of the characters are first portrayed. It reminds me of the discussions about filming in Robert Altman's "The Player" - it works so well in Boogie Nights, and that's the first indication that Anderson knows what he's doing behind the camera. His style evolves quickly in the spirit of Martin Scorsese, where the shots are fast but never seem rushed. In addition, Anderson refers to two classic shots of Scorsese: the closing speech of De Riro in "Raging Bull" and the scene of the nightclub tracking "GoodFellas". Anderson is a young and growing director, remarkably mature in history and direction, despite his age. While his first feature, "Hard Eight", was particularly wise and poignant, "Boogie Nights" is even more so. <br /> <br /> "Boogie Nights" began as a love effort for Paul Thomas Anderson. After filming the extraordinary Hard Eight in 1996, Anderson's film is so pragmatic that it seems almost authentic. Boogie Nights invigorates us with its free content, sometimes on the verge of pornography, but it is much more sophisticated than such waste. It is a flamboyant and wonderful modern masterpiece, as explicit as it is scathing, wild and elegant. We can say that this is Anderson's best film and one of the biggest and most important projects of the last decade.
