I saw this movie for the first time when it came out and I also bought a recording of the soundtrack of a vinyl record. I liked it so much that I went to see him several times. I do not understand why this was considered a flop. Julie Andrews was adorable in this film, her voice was at its best and she was beautiful! <br /> <br /> The film contains a bit of everything and even if some scenes were a little heavy, they were always fun. <br /> <br /> I recently discovered that I could get a copy in DVD format and I ordered it ...... I was disappointed that some songs and movie sequences were not included in the DVD version. I ordered.
