The problem with so many people watching this movie is the state of mind in which they are watching it. People come in search of a B-level horror movie or a movie "So bad, that's fine". Jack Frost 2 is neither one nor the other. <br /> <br /> This is, to put it simply, a very good film cleverly hidden in a very bad film. Seeing it as a comedy at the dumpling (funnier than all three "Scary Movies" with absolutely no merit combined) amounts to misinterpreting the movie at an elementary level. It would be like watching Shawshank Redemption and then complaining that there was no explosion. <br /> <br /> The principle is simple; the characters in the first film, haunted by the memories of Jack Frost, take a vacation on a tropical island. After them, a new and improved Jack, with essentially Spider-Man Hydro-Man powers; for the most part, it can easily and quickly turn into snow, water, divide, multiply and, even worse, it has been able to develop immunity to its unique weak point ... AntiFreeze. <br /> <br /> This film is sad because of the fact that the dead brain fans of the first Jack Frost (a simply HORRIBLE movie) can not appreciate the change of tone of the sequel. Exactly as Alien was a horror movie and Aliens was all about action, Jack Frost was a faint attempt of horror gimmick and Jack Frost 2 is a cleverly written parody of the horror genre gimmick. <br /> <br /> Most of the entertainment comes from the actors of the real action, which serve admirably. Among them, Ray Tooney (embodying the caricature of a retired British colonel in the early 1900s), Christopher Allport (offering a hilarious and hilarious version of his wooden performance of the first film) and David Allen Brooks role of ways to new weird heights). <br /> <br /> The absence of "memorable quotes" bothers me. <br /> <br /> As a horror movie, Jack Frost 2: The revenge of the mutant Killer Snowman, notes a zero. But you must understand, THIS IS NOT A HORROR MOVIE.
