I played this movie this month and I love it. I was in the 60's (oh my God), so it's nostalgic in a way. However, it's the fun beginnings, the catchy dialogue and the great performances that make me look. <br /> <br /> Dr. Winston's reactions to Stephanie at the end of the film are priceless. (I would be more specific, but I do not want to ruin it for anyone.) Who else but Matthau can play a man who does not play quite well in the game yet still loves him? As for Bergman's costumes, I think she looks as sullen as she is supposed to be. I think "she was stolen" the only time she appears in an evening dress. It does not suit him at all, which is a shame. I never liked it when I saw it for the first time and it still is not the case. <br /> <br /> Goldie won an Oscar for her role. People thought it was a revolutionary performance at the time, and yet it's the performance that I do not like as much as the others. However, she has the right amount of sweetness and sympathy, which is important for this role. <br /> <br /> And I agree - I thought Rick Lenz had been great and it was a shame that his film career had failed. Take off after that. <br /> <br /> I hope more people will watch this movie ... they will like it!
