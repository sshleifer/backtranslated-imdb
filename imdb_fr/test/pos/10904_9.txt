Kevin Kline features a brilliant comic strip in the 1997 IN & OUT comedy. Kline plays Howard Brackett, a small town history teacher who enthusiastically attends the Oscars this year because one of his former students (Matt Dillon) is in nomination. He is nominated for his performance in a movie where he plays a gay soldier and when he wins, he thanks Howard in his speech for having inspired him because Howard is gay. Now, this is hitting Howard, because he does not know why this man would say that on international television. Howard is even engaged (with Joan Cusack, in an Oscar-nominated performance), so he has no idea where Cameron Drake of Dillon got the idea that he's gay and finds himself forced to defend himself alone in front of everyone at school. shocked that no one seems terribly shocked by what Cameron said at the Oscars. Howard organizes a birthday party at which he receives gifts, such as the YENTL soundtrack, and explains to his guests why Barbra Streisand had to create FUNNY LADY. Her parents (Wilford Brimley, Debbie Reynolds) are in shock but promise to support their son, even if he is gay. He also receives a visit from a journalist from outside the city (Tom Selleck) who wants to make an article about him, because he is also gay. The moment Selleck plants a big kiss on Kline's lips is a classic. But all these little things have led Howard to ask himself questions about his sexuality and to wonder if he is really gay, much to the chagrin of the frustration and frustration of his fianc√©e, Cusack, who is more than confused. The scene where she leaves a bar in a wedding dress and stands in the middle of the street screaming about the lack of straight men in the world is a classic. But what I like in this film is how Kline fully invested in the role and was not afraid to look ridiculous or be gay. There is a fabulous scene, probably the most famous of the movie, where he buys a record of how to be macho, and the guy on the album talks about how real men do not dance and look disco (I WILL SURVIVE if my memory is good) and the narrator says: no matter what you do, do not dance, but Howard can not help it and he ends up shaking his thing in the room. It's hysterically funny and Kline plays it with sincerity and enthusiasm. The film is not a pro or an anti gay, it's just a clever and funny character study about a man trying to figure out who he is. Wonderful movie.
