Now, after watching The Advent Children twice, the story is not as superficial as the majority criticized it in my opinion. If you have not played FFVII or if you do not like it for some reason, this movie is probably not for you. Being aware of the original story is a prerequisite for the full understanding of AC, otherwise you will only see the greatest CG animation of your life so far. <br /> <br /> Without spoiling the screenplay, I must admit that after seeing AC we have collected pieces with my friends based on our knowledge of FFVII. Seeing it a second time, we were able to pay more attention to the story and most of the questions we could get were answered. Some were not. AC is clearly for FFVII players / fans and does not honestly try to be anything else. There is little realism outside the FFVII world that serves this purpose. The music is mainly composed of reconstructed FFVII themes with a heavier touch (TBM team according to the end credits) and works well with the pleasure of the eyes without exception. I found that music enhanced the experience added to visual fireworks in all situations. <br /> <br /> We all know that you can not put an FFVII in an hour and a half and, keeping that in mind, the story actually gave me more than I expected. FFVII is facing two problems: AC and the two stories were very well summarized between the action sequences. And believe me when I say that there are many. An action that is. <br /> <br /> I change my vote from 9 to 10 after watching it a second time because I missed some explanatory sequences that I could not assemble the first time and that gave answers. As a warning, it will be easy to ignore the story and focus on graphics, but try not to judge Adevent children because of it. If you do not let the story in, it's no wonder it looks sloppy. <br /> <br /> I will not praise the graphics, because I guess we all know they are great, which could be a euphemism. Especially the characters speak so much more with their facial expressions than ever before. I hope you will focus on the screenplay because it makes sense and works well with the whole thing. Get ready for the journey of your life, there are no breaks.
