While it is true that sadomasochism is a double-sided piece that contains everything in the diversified expression of its opposites, Erika Kohut's film portrait has its reality. Professor Kohut treats his piano students with a sort of fascist sadism while aspiring in the same way. His outward expression projects his desire. That's why she can hurt herself without guilt or remorse. <br /> <br /> The young talented, charming and handsome young Walter Klemmer (Benoit Magimel) attracts him because of his passion and intensity. He wants to become his pupil to be close to her. She rejects him outright, but the Vienna Conservatory, because of his talent, makes him vote. He falls in love with her. Again, she pushes him away, but he will not take no for an answer and thus begins his own descent into depravity and loss of self-respect. <br /> <br /> The question the viewer could ask at this point is: who is in control? The sadist or the masochist? Indeed who is the sadist and who the masochist? It's hard to say. Is this the person who has just been badly abused both psychologically and physically, who is actually hurt on the ground in a grotesque triumphant and fulfilling, or is it the person who rushes to the door, satiated, giving the order anyone to find out what happened. <br /> <br /> But Erika is not just a sadomasochistic phenomenon. She is an extreme sex phenomenon. She wants to experience the extremes of human sexuality while maintaining the fa√ßade of respectability. In fact, it's not even true. She says she does not care what others think. She does not care if they come in and find her bleeding on the floor because she is in love. Love, she calls him. For his sex and his love are one. <br /> <br /> At one point, Walter tells him that love is not everything. What irony for such a superfluity! As the comment is free. <br /> <br /> The film is beautifully cut and brilliantly directed by Michael Haneke, who tells the story with expert camera work and carefully crafted decors in which the action is not only clear but also illustrated (as in the bathroom when Walter propels himself up above the stall to find Erika inside). It also uses a good positioning of the players so that they are always where they should be with cuts well synchronized from one angle to the other. This is particularly important in the scene in which Erika, like a bloody corpse caught in a black and white light, is under her lover, stiff as stone. Here, for the most part, we only see his face and the sharp outline of his neck and throbbing artery. We do not need to see anymore. <br /> <br /> The part of Erika Kohut is perfect for Isabelle Huppert who is not afraid of extremes; Indeed, she excels. I have seen her in many movies and what she does better than anyone else has become the body and soul of her character. Like the woman she plays in this film, she is not afraid of what others may think and cares little about her appearance in a decorative sense. What matters to her is the performance and the challenge. No part is too demanding. No character too depraved. It's as if Huppert wanted to experience all of humanity and wanted us to watch her as she does. She is always fascinating and almost flawless. She is not simply a leading light in French cinema; She is one of the great actresses of our time who has created an incredibly diverse body of work. <br /> <br /> I think it's very informative and gives us a beautiful and striking contrast if we compare her performance here with her. performance in The Lacemaker's Lacemaker from 1977 when she was 22 years old. She was sweet with apples in her red hair and her freckles, as well as her pretty face and her pretty little figurine playing Apple, an apprentice Parisian hairdresser. Her character was shy and modest for sex - a simple French woman who hoped to be a beautician one day. She is a self-destructive witch, bitter with a hateful knowledge of herself, shameless and totally depraved. <br /> <br /> Huppert is lucky enough to be an actress in France, where there are such roles for women over 25 years old. starlets. (Hollywood could never make a film like this.) In American cinema, only a handful of the best and most hard-working actresses can hope to have a career after the age of thirty or so. Huppert greatly increases her visibility because of her abilities and reach, but also because she is willing to play unpleasant roles, here and also in The Ceremony (1995), in which she plays a vile and nasty murderer. <br /> <br /> See this for Isabelle Huppert. You will not forget her or the character she gives to life.
