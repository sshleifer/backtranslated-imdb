STEAMBOAT WILLIE is an incredibly important film for our film history. This second appearance of Mickey Mouse (following the silent film PLANE CRAZY earlier this year) is probably his most famous film - mainly because he was so innovative. This is because it was the first sound cartoon. Although you still do not hear Mickey talk, there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the movie - something we take for granted now, but that has been a lot of fun for the crowd. in 1928. <br /> <br /> was only an important historical film, it would be interesting to see it - especially for animation lovers. However, after reviewing the short film after about 25 years, I was amazed by the timeless character of the film. Although Mickey and Minnie behave a little strangely in relation to the characters we have come to love (mainly thanks to the fantastic spirit and talent of the animator Ub Iwerks), the film has a communicative charm. It's just lovely to see Mickey playing "Turkey in the Straw" with a lot of imagination (though occasionally cruel). Intelligent and highly appreciated by the crowds, this film is still one of Mickey's best films, even after 80 wonderful years.
