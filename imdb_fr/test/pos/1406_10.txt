Haines is excellent as a daring cadet who thinks that West Point will really represent something now that he has arrived. Haines shows off his comical, easy-going character as he clashes with West Point and local beauty Joan Crawford. Very fun for the first half. And surprisingly moving after the character of Haines goes too far and is almost shunned by other cadets. The new Haines, humbled, enjoys a last minute respite to play the game against the Navy and won the game despite a broken arm. This Haines-style film offers exciting and exciting entertainment from MGM, showing Billy at his best. William Bakewell is also the lean follower. Clark Gable, Cary Grant, Gary Cooper and others in the following decades, will embody the seductive but whimsical character, another interpretation of the beautiful but daffy ladies of Carole Lombard and Marion Davies. West Point is a winner!
