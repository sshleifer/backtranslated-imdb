There were a lot of things about little Vera that were strange to me. Overall, I enjoyed this movie, but the way the characters behaved was not the one I was used to. For example, the environment in which Vera's family lived was very tense. Almost every time the family was together, they drank, fought or screamed and it was often a combination of the three. After watching the film, I felt tense because of all the confrontation that took place there. I was very interested in looking at the history of this middle-class Russian family. Throughout the film, we remember the industrialized state of Russia because of the repeated plans of a train passing in front of the screen. This gave the viewer the feeling of a life lived mechanically. The characters seemed to be focused on living their lives at work and drinking after work. There was no feeling of happiness throughout the movie. The only time a character did not shout was when Vera fell in love with her fianc√© Sergei. This was short-lived, as the viewer later discovered (after Sergei locked Vera's father in a bathroom and the latter pulled him out after which the father stabbed Sergei), which he was violent. Another time, Vera learns that the only reason she was born is that the family can get a larger apartment. It is very interesting to see how Vera and her family were able to cope with everyone's behavior. The film absolutely deserved to be viewed because of its description of what life could be like in some parts of Russia.
