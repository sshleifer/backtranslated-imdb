Now, that's the kind of movie we used to get every week. Nowadays, it is rare to see a drama that depends on the casting being spoken. <br /> <br /> There are no explosions, car chases or lawsuits, there are implicit sexual situations.This is not film for the younger crowd, it is for those who appreciate that people talk to each other, they argue a lot because we have a married couple with mid-life issues. <br /> <br /> Emily Watson and Tom Wilkinson are apparently very happy middle-aged man and woman magnets. Rupert Everett, who now lives in the same small suburb of London, returns home to visit his rich father. <br /> <br /> He meets, of course, Emily Watson. It would be easy for anyone to be mistaken for Emily. I do not say more, except that when the credits begin there is a fatal accident, the rest of the film deals with the repercussions of this accident and all the lies told by the various characters. > <br /> The acting game This trio and the others are excellent. <br /> <br /> Julien Fellows wrote the screenplay based on Nigel Balchin's novel. He also realized, it was his first directorial attempt and he did very well. All the production is of first quality. <br /> <br /> The film was shot a few months in late 2005, it has less than 80 rooms. It's a shame for me, stupid comedies open on at least 2,000 screens, but very good drams like this and many others only open on a few. <br /> <br /> By the way, there are some very amusing passages. <br /> <br /> Notes: *** 1/2 (out of 4) 95 points (out of 100) IMDb 9 (out of 10)
