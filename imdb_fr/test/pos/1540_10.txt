"Closet Land" has been sponsored by Amnesty International and has many political overtones, but this emotional story has much more to offer ... <br /> <br /> It's not just about the political tension in the late eighties - this is the personal persecution to which a woman child who has been assaulted by a friend of the family submits. We see the subtle allusion to the parallels of a dishonest government / society structure and the culture of sexual predation where one in four young children is assaulted and one in three women has experienced some form of rape. <br /> <br /> For This raises a worrying question: does the attitude of our sexual repression leading to predation create the political environment of fear and censorship, or the dysfunctional socio- politics fuel a culture of sexual predation? The psychological ramifications of even asking this question force us to a place where we are led to develop our own answers. <br /> <br /> Finally, our young writer (Stowe) has a similar moment to the one at the end of Hensen's "Labyrinth" - she realizes in a brilliant moment that the idea of ​​being robbed of her power by the Secret Police (Rickman) is an illusion. No one can steal your power - he can only persuade you to abandon it and you have the right to retrieve it at any time. <br /> <br /> This is not a film in which to enter lightly. and you will certainly enter it. The minimalist aspects associated with a childish animation shake the deepest parts of the psyche and leave no one indifferent.
