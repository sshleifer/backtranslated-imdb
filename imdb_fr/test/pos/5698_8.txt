I swore I would never allow myself to give in to the false authorities of the sixties who told me that things were better in the good old days ?? The current Australian Prime Minister is a sordid example of such a state of mind. <br /> <br /> But I switched to "A Decade Under Influence" because I found watching the so-called "Sneakers" documentary on the other channel such a daunting experience. I found the values ​​expressed by the "Sneakers" interviewed too ugly to be considered reasonable. So materialistic! So devoid of any outrage against a company capable of killing someone to steal his ugly shoes! If they were so lacking in interest that they could report without disgusting exploitation and hearing by asking them to hold these shoes over their heads to enter into a sponsorship deal with a cobbler's company, that was all. just too much to watch. <Br/> <br /> "A decade under the influence" described a completely different response to the fruit of stupidity, corruption and concupiscence in high (and low) places. <br /> <br /> I noted the film change- This fact accompanied the exposure of the disasters of US foreign policy in Vietnam and so many less-reported places on my website www.peterhenderson.com. in. "A Decade Under Influence" documents the precise moment when this change took place. <br /> <br /> Before the seventies, the armed forces were portrayed in American films as an invincible fighting force of honest human beings who transmigrated by conquering heroes on the battlefield. After the seventies, they are generally portrayed as a discouraged rage misled by a group of Pentagon clan bureaucrats. Before the seventies, the FBI agent and the honest cop tended to be described as your friend and protector. After the 1970s, the FBI agents were all incompetent and the cop could not aspire to ignore their foolishness and the corruption of his superior and defend justice in his own idiosyncratic way. <br /> Before the seventies, the archetype The "little guy" American, the "average Joe", the type Jimmy Stewart would face the problems encountered and thus give a glimpse of the wisdom underlying its leaders elected and justice of the "American Way". After the seventies, Kevin Costner has usurped this role, but he is now the voice of the one who cries in the desert for the evil to be exposed or for the one who accepts his fate and who comes out as best as possible. <br /> <br /> And now, these "religion of the past" mentalities have been devoid of all honesty and justice and presented (with some justification) as sectarian sectarianism and selfish hypocrisy. <br /> <br /> "A decade under influence" tell it as it was. "A decade under the influence" says it as now. It depicts the acquisition of the American film industry from the hands of studio moguls at the artistic, moral and intellectual levels. It shows the storming of the Hollywood Bastille by independent filmmakers who have promised to bring back a disillusioned and tired audience in cinemas. The fact that their failures were numerous and sometimes disastrous only underscores the greatness of their achievements. A feat that is reflected in the adventurous and questioning attitudes of movie stars such as Clooney, Daman, Affleck, etc., as well as directors and producers who provide the tools necessary for their talent.
