It's one of my favorites of all time. All the actors are doing a great job. Comparing this film to "Lawrence of Arabia" does not do justice to both films. "The Wind and the Lion" represents a much smaller budget with fantastic actors portraying comforting characters in a comforting atmosphere. Action and beautiful pictures are also provided, which together guarantees me a favorite movie.
