I think the consensus is quite unanimous on this recent television series: it's ok, but it's far from "Lonesome Dove". It is compared to the latter simply because it is a prelude to this famous story. <br /> <br /> "Commanche Moon" is a safe bet for all western fans. Do not expect it to be as intense as "Lonesome Dove". Steve Zahn and Karl Urban are not Robert Duvall and Tommy Lee Jones, and the characters they play are not as powerful as what Duvall and Jones described in the same way. Some say it's unfair to criticize this film because of the comparison, but it must be compared - it's the story of the same two main characters from Texas Ranger: "Woodrow Call" and "Gus McCrae". <br /> <br /> The main difference, I found, is that this pre-sequence is much slower and more relational (both Rangers and their wives) at times. However, it did not bother me because the two main ladies were pretty ladies and generally nice and nice people. Linda Cardelini ("Clara Forsythe") and Elizabeth Banks ("Maggie.") Played well. They helped make this long film enjoyable. If you saw pictures of women in the Old West, none of them looked as pretty as Cardelini and Banks. They were a joy for those male eyes to look at. Maggie's son, "Newt", was also a wonderful kid - the kind of boy that any parent would want to have. <br /> <br /> The most interesting character, I thought, turned out to be "Inish Scull", played by Val Kilmer. As in the Western movie "Tombstone", Kilmer almost steals the show from the main actors. "Scull" is really an original, if I've ever seen one: a strange guy, indeed. <br /> <br /> In fact, all the support actors here have done a good job, from Keith Robinson's "Deets" to Wes Studi as "Buffalo Hump". I still find that Studi is fascinating, no matter what role he plays. I would have liked him to play a bigger role in this miniseries. <br /> <br /> The film has one thing in common with "Lonesome Dove" and other good westerns: landscapes and photography. It's just beautiful sometimes and it's a joy to watch. We also have an excellent director of this film: Simon Wincer, who directed "Lonesome Dove" and another exceptional TV movie, "Crossfire Trail". He also shot two of my other favorite feature films, both based in his home country, Australia: "Phar Lap" and "Quigley Down Under". <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I liked this movie, "Commanche Moon". is not as good as the movies mentioned above.But, I still watched all this and I was sorry that it ends, if it makes sense. It made me want to see Woodrow and Gus again, this time with Tommy Lee and Robert. <br /> <br /> Note: The title page indicates that it is 360 minutes. This had to include TV commercials. The two-disc DVD version I saw was about 4 hours and 40 minutes long.
