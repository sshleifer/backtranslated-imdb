I saw this movie a few years ago and I quickly bought the soundtrack because it was just great. Bacharach's music is endearing and deserves the recognition it deserves. Cinematography is great. Critics hated him, but they also hated HOME ALONE. I did not find it on the video, but I welcome everyone who can find a copy.
