The images of Blind Spot are excellent. The action attracts you completely, even if the film is a bit long. In the end, all you can think of are the highlights of the movie. The main actors have the most incredible screen presence. The story is heartbreaking. The score of the film is well minimized. Completely moving in his own powerful way. This is not your classic melodramatic style. Trance moments add a poetic resonance to captivating narration and stunning visual compositions. I hope you will have the chance to see this movie. It plunges into a dark territory, but you leave the tunnel without seeing anything but a white light.
