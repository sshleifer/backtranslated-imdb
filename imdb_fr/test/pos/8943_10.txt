I think this movie deserves a 10 out of 10 because it's hilarious funny from start to finish. The plot is simple and straightforward, but it allows you to watch and there are so many laughs that you really start to like it. When I went to see this movie, I had not heard much about it and I did not know what to expect. I thought it would be a movie of old ladies like Calendar Girls or something like that but it took me completely by surprise. Even though I'm still a teenager and the film was probably not for my age group, I always thought it was great and I think people in all bands would like it. I think it's a pity that it's not at all famous and deserves more publicity for more people to see it and realize how good it is.
