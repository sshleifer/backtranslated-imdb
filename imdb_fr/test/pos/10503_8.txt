First, let me reread the movie. This film scares me and I do not even believe in extraterrestrials! However, the film has its flaws. <br /> <br /> There are three acts in this film. Act one is perfect. He installs the film and really creates the creep factor. I must say that the score is great! Everything is set up and perfectly set up. <br /> <br /> The second act begins when Jillian, playing Sherry Burton, goes to the psychiatrist. They hypnotize her and she remembers the kidnapping. Act two ruins the movie when extraterrestrials show up. "Screaming Mad George" made the effects for the extraterrestrials. I must say they did a good job, with the exception of their depiction of "Gray" aliens. No offense, but the Grays looked like inflatable door prices. <br /> <br /> Another remark, I liked the way they treated hypnosis in Acts 1 and 2. If you were careful, you will notice that the husband and wife have two different memories. In the husband's version of events, the blue light zaps them and his wife says, "Someone is here" or something. It makes sense. The husband worries about his wife. "Someone" can hurt her. This is his problem. However, in her version of events, she says, "Help me!" She does not say "Someone is here." It also makes sense. The extraterrestrials are after her. To want her husband to help her and save her is her problem. Now, back to the movie. <br /> <br /> Law three turns the film into a party. It starts with a "strange" ultrasound procedure. It's a typical gore festival, but it has a surprise ending. I will not mess because it's actually an interesting development. <br /> <br /> The DVD and the reviews are taken too seriously, but if you think that Wilford Brimley saying that "Horsesh **" is funny, you might want to check it in the interviews section with actors. Let's turn now to my praise to Jillian McWhirter. <br /> <br /> I only hope Jillian will read this. I had never seen it before, but what a performance! Let me tell this to the rest of you. First of all, it's a serious movie. The details that I will now describe may seem campy and amusing, like "Humanoids From The Deep" (1980), but that's really not the case. Got that? Ok. <br /> <br /> Jillian is hot, naturally beautiful. She is naked for a lot of the movie, it's a good thing. Unfortunately, she is usually assaulted, terrorized and raped, which is a very bad thing. However, she has to play a lot in this nude movie. She gets points to overcome that. She must be happy, sad, horny, frightened and physically hurt in a matter of moments. The reversal of emotions is amazing! She must rejoice in her joy when she learns that she is pregnant. She must scream in terror when the extraterrestrials extinguish her guts. She must act very angry when her husband suggests that the baby does not belong to him. She must act as if she refused, saying that nothing was going on with her baby, when her husband told him otherwise. I must note that this negation is really imposed by the extraterrestrials who control it. I am talking about a performance of Oscar caliber! <br /> <br /> Then there is the rape scene. It's annoying, but since it's just a rubber extraterrestrial, it's not that bad. In this scene, the extraterrestrial is not a "gray" extraterrestrial, so I will describe it. The stranger has tentacles, and it's a bit like a table. Jillian is on the table-like side, restrained by the tentacles. By his head is the head of the stranger. The head of the extraterrestrial is long and it tilts so that his head is now above the legs of Jillian. Then, the hey-nanu-nanu from abroad comes out of his forehead. It's the front! That sounds pretty campy, does not it? Well, Jillian is playing straight, and she's succeeding! She must behave like an alien. Her he-nanu-nanu coming from her forehead is violating her, and she's getting away with it! It's a very intense scene, but that's not what makes it. You see, this scene is done in flashback. What makes the scene is the performance of Jillian recalling these events. She's just lying in a hypnosis hospital bed reminiscent of abduction by an extraterrestrial, but her role here is more intense than the rape scene! How many actors can achieve a performance in a scene that describes a more intense rape than the rape scene? Not a lot! However, Jillian does it. <br /> <br /> I could go on and on. Jillian, if you're reading this, I want you to know that me, (unpublished name) alias of MegamanX-1, I believe you are the best actress of all time. You are the best actress of all time! I could only hope that you read this and take it away with you forever. <br /> <br /> As for everyone, "Progeny" (1999) is a film Agree for good. I would recommend it.
