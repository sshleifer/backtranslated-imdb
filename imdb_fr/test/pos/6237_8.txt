Some films fade, but Tourist Trap has stood the test of time and has become a cult favorite. Though not entirely original - he owes a lot to the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, he is distinguished by his sense of humor, real horror, a brilliant score of Pino Donaggio and the amusing performances of Chuck Connors and casting. Do not let the PG note keep you away, this movie proves that it is not necessary that every horror movie gratify you with nudity and nudity. These items are usually used to cover the lack of thrills in a movie. Here, the fears are deserved and effective. Plus, only Chuck Connors could make a scene in which he had to share a soup with a dummy! A classic scene indeed. Now more accessible on DVD in widescreen format, this movie is a must for lovers of horror cooking of the 70s.
