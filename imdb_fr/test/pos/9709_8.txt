This film far surpasses the previous incarnation, pushing everything to the next level. As always, the guys at JackAss are incredibly amazing and I personally have laughed more in this theater than I did for a long time. Like the first JackAss, it's not so much a movie as a chain of stunts and pranks of eighty minutes. It's pure circus entertainment at the highest level. Essentially, these guys are clowns that are degrading for the pleasure of others. And it's great. The shenanigans are so low, scandalous and often disgusting that they transcend into a form of superior entertainment. <br /> <br /> You can not classify this in other movies, it's a class apart. And it shines. Enjoy it for the pure spectacle that it is.
