Terry & June is one of the most popular programs of the 70's and 80's. <br /> <br /> He started his life under the name "Happy Ever After", but when Eric Merriman decided he no longer wanted to write, it turned into this, hence the departure of "Aunt Lucy" and the Fletcher who became the Medford. <br /> <br /> Yes, it was a comfortable place, domestic and middle class; conspiracies covered the whole range of shots of the chef coming to dinner, the curate organizing a random sale, and unwanted parents wishing to stay for the weekend. It certainly was not a "dreadful lazy comedy". As for being "not smart", it was not supposed to be. It was funny and well played, and that was enough! <br /> <br /> Me too, I loved the alternative boom of the 80s ("Spitting Image", "Black Adder", "The Young Ones", etc.), but I also liked the products classics such as this one. If nothing else, he was providing an alternative comedy with something to be an alternative to. I found it sad when the likes of Ben Elton opposed this and Benny Hill. The family comedy has almost disappeared from our screens, but where did it stay? Take a look at the latest TV V schedules. All the soaps and dross of reality. The few remaining comedies are for teenagers, which means they are full of swear words, jokes about bodily functions and explicit sexual references. And they are not very funny either. <br /> <br /> The boom of the "alternative comedy" was good in many ways, but had a dark side. He made classic sitcoms look old, chased talented writers and performers like Spike Milligan, and finally led to indescribable driving such as "Little Britain" and "Tittybangbang" (God help us). If it is not broke, do not fix it!
