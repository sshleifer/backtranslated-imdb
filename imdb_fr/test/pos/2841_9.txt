Perfect writing and brilliant acting make this plot particularly charming and witty one of the best American movies I've seen this year. Neil Labute's fantastic cast and cynical direction prevent this film from becoming too sentimental, while the authentic performances of Ren√©e Zellweger and Morgan Freeman give it a soul. Violent, provocative and humorous at the same time with a truly wonderful ending. Chris Rock, Greg Kinnear, Aaron Eckhart, Crispin Glover, and Allison Janney all perform noisy performances. The biggest parody of soap operas since the film Soap, but better and smarter. 9 out of 10
