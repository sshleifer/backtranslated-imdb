'Rejseholdet' is one of the best new Danish TV series I've watched. <br /> <br /> This series is dedicated to Unit 1 of the Danish police - a team a bit like the FBI that helps solve the murder cases the country and the businesses they work on, as well as that the influence of their work on their personal lives and the price they sometimes have to pay to be part of a high-level police team. <br /> <br /> Do not wait much when I started watching this series - I was pleasantly surprised, the series is exciting, sometimes funny, there is both drama and suspense, I love.
