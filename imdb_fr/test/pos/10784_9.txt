WOW, a masterpiece of a film not to be missed. <br /> <br /> I had no idea what this movie was like when I started watching it late at night. I did not discover it was a Stone movie before the IMDb movie. Looking at him, I was hypnotized. The cast, especially Eric Bogosian, is simply superb. One of the best scenarios and camera work of all time ... The film seduced me and fascinated me to the end ... I did not dare to blink for fear of missing something ... It's amazing how a low-budget movie can be so captivating and well done, while big-budget movies that feature tons of action and computer-generated special effects can be incredibly boring. . Do not miss this movie ...
