This film is probably the best new French film I've seen in this century. There have been a few, including Noe's Irreversible, Green's Bridge of Arts and Hadzihalilovic's Innocence, but none of them are close to the eternal glory of Regular Lovers. <br /> <br /> The film describes the events of May '68 and what followed as a result of this and in addition it is an update and a tribute of the films of the Nouvelle Vague of this time. As for the description of the riots in Paris, the film is meticulously precise (I'm only 19 years old and I was not there myself, but you know what I mean) and the scenes of riot very long and almost in real time perfectly prepare the scene sequels of events in the streets of Paris. The riots are neither magnified nor photographed like those of Bertolucci's The Dreamers (whose film is comparable in many respects). They are rather filmed in dark black and white thanks to the excellent William Lubtchansky. The love story that is the film's main concern after the riots of '68 is filmed in breathtaking and far less fuzzy shots and manages to evoke real feelings of teenage love and confusion in the midst of an apparently politically troubling environment. and apparently cold. <Br /> <br /> This film is a beautiful love story. The director wants to describe his own experiences of these myths of the late 60s, which makes the film even more captivating. But the film is also a tribute to the entire canon of the New Wave. A large part of the dialogue evokes the beginnings of Truffaut, and the length, the non-action and the less complex structure, recall Eustache or Rivette. There are even verfremdung effects to the Godard with people looking directly into the camera and even speaking directly to Bernardo Bertolucci. This film is undoubtedly a response to the film The Dreamers by Bertolucci. It's also a New Wave tribute, but it's still a beautiful and radiant love story. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: This film is incredible and fantastic. if you like French cinema, you should not sleep on it. It may be the best French film since La Mamain and the Eustache Whore.
