The basic plot of this movie has already been detailed in several other reviews, so I will not worry. First of all, I would like to congratulate the producer, the actors, the directors and the team for creating an extremely engaging movie on a meager $ 1 million budget, a small fraction of the standard Hollywood fare that does not seem cheap. . These people are determined to create something new and entertaining without spending a fortune to do it. It's essentially art for art. I know, I know, some of you will decide that this is not art but something less and that's good. For my part, I am happy that people like these continue to devote time and effort to our advantage without waiting for multi-million dollar gains. <br /> <br /> Now let's go to the reviews. I think that the scenario presented is credible to a point. It's wonderful when everything goes well and the hero / heroine saves the day and everything ends well. What gets me is the flagrant manipulation of events, so that blind luck is responsible more than courage and strength. dead guide. Then, miraculously, his loaded revolver is still in his holster and it works (after a bit of cleaning and fiddling). Finally, when Lee is attacked on the mud bank and jumps into the water, the crocodile can not kill it. She ends up with her hand in her mouth and manages to pull the trigger several times to finally blow up the fang brain (literally). <br /> <br /> I came to the conclusion that Lee would go hand in hand. to put in mouth with the crocodile was only a way to finish the film with the man in triumph. From what I've seen, the fang attacks and continues to hold until the prey stops struggling. Croc's will go around in circles to dismember and drown the prey. It happened to the first 3 victims but not to Lee. She had teeth marks, but they were not deep. <br /> <br /> I think the end would have been better if the hook had won outright, proving its dominance of the mangrove, its territory for millions of years. But how many of us would have been upset or disappointed that the pretty girl did not come out alive?
