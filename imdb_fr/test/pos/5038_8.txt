I really enjoyed this movie for what it is: A funny little movie that does not take itself too seriously. The plot summaries are available everywhere, so I will not go into details. Michael is not on a complicated plot anyway. It is based on good premises and takes the viewer on a wonderful journey on the road. <br /> <br /> John Travolta's performance as an angel, loving ladies, loving ladies and playing in bars is perfect. And who does not like Sparky? <br /> <br /> Look at this if you want to have some laughs and have a good time. Highly recommended.
