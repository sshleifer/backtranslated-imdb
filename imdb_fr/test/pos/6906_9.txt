I just saw this at SIFF and I loved it. There were places where I laughed so much that I could not catch my breath. The screenplay and staging of Glenn McQuaid are fantastic. I can not wait to see more of this talented young man. The performances make the film. Larry Fessenden and Dominic Monaghan are simply delicious as Graverobber Willy and his apprentice Arthur. Ron Perlman performs a fantastic performance (as usual) as an unattractive prison priest. Bonus: Angus Scrimm, an unscrupulous doctor! As always, it balances perfectly threat and humor. <br /> <br /> It's a horror comedy style that has not been seen since Vincent Price did "Comedy of Terror", "The Raven" and "Blood Theater." The movie is really scary in some places, then it will suddenly come back in hilarious mode, you now totally unbalanced. Some parts are both scary and fun. <br /> <br /> I can only afford to see three films at SIFF this year, but even if the other two are awful, "I Sell The Dead" was worth the price of the three. I'm going to look for other films from Glass Eye Pix by Larry Fessenden. He gives the kind of horror a much needed kick in the ass.
