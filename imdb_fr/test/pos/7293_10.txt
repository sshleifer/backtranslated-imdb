All I have to say is that this movie is the bomb. You will cry when you see that. I mean, it reminds all of how difficult and easy it is to fall in love. It reminds you of the days of your youth when you were carefree and where all that was bad for you was carried away by a simple kiss. Even though I'm still a teenager, that's how I live my life. When I'm with that certain person, everything that was negative in my mind has been erased. So, I give this movie a 10 for its heartfelt message and touching intrigue. Actors Josh Hartnett and Chris Klein, I also give a 10 to have a cute face.
