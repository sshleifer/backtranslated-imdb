There are subtleties in this movie that many people might miss if they were not careful. You really have to follow what Leland says and read her character to understand the "why" that the film presents in the end. Nothing is solid, it is not definitive, it is what the spectator gets from it. I think it was the plan from the beginning, people are not supposed to understand it the same way, it's almost about creating your own personal relationship with Leland so you can feel it a bit better. <br /> <br /> The story is interesting but its summary can never explain what the movie really is. It's dramatic and provocative, a lot of heavy ideas, but the film's rhythm is almost soothing, even with its most intense scenes with screams. I think it's probably Leland, he's just calm and almost serene, even for all his sadness. The film personifies Leland in a certain way. <br /> <br /> Of course, it is captivating and attracts you if you let it go, but there are recycled ideas. I mean, Leland has a lot of awesome dialogues, he's anything but typical, but he's not a prophet. Everything he says is not a revelation, many people I know mentioned things he mentioned, although I observed some things he observed. Leland is the unique and attractive character he is probably the main character for the portrait of Ryan Gosling. <br /> <br /> In the end, the acting is exceptional, there are no real bad guys, there is no way to evaluate Leland psychologically, only. maybe understand it and life a little better. <br /> <br /> Similar to Igby Goes Down I think, not comical, but similar in his general vision of life.
