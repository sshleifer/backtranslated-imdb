I can not believe that this movie has such a low rating. It's probably one of the best comedies ever made and certainly the best Bollywood comedy of the '90s. The film did not do very well at the box office and people had diametrically opposed reactions after having it seen. I guess most people did not expect it to be a complete comedy and expect a regular movie. If you like comedies, it's a must. And Aamir Khan is remarkable.
