Ms. Charlotee (Rosie Holotik), a young, ambitious nurse, is sent to work in a psychiatric shelter in the middle of nowhere. For 3 days, she encounters strange events, even a patient watching her in her room, but she still remains. The mental patients are all a bit of a twitch of the eyes (especially by the judge), but my favorite was the old crazy biddy (Rhea MacAdams). The scenario is at best correct, and the acting is surprisingly correct, but after a while, it gets a little too much. But, it's still fun, original, strange and original. <br /> <br /> Note: the interior of the basement is hardly horrible, the title is a little banana.
