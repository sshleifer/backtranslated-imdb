The few reviews I could find online about Barnens รถ really do not do it justice. I read them all before ordering the DVD, but for some reason I still ordered it. I regretted it almost immediately, but the order had already passed, so I could not cancel it. I am very happy now that I could not. It's an extraordinary film. <br /> <br /> I will not give a summary of the plot, because other critics have already done so. But I will say that I do not understand the comments saying that it is dark, shocking, strange, clinical, depressing or pornographic. It's certainly very unusual, which might make it weird to some, but the other reviews should reflect the commentators' own problems, because I did not see anything like that in the movie I just watched. I'm not attracted to boys, so nudity did not seem pornographic at all - it's just a child trying to find out who he is without any help from the irresponsible adults in his life. And it's Sweden, not Utah, so topless women are not a big problem. <br /> <br /> But what surprised me the most is how positive the film is in its description of this lost kid who goes through a kind of Odyssey all kinds of strange experiences, looking for himself - and finally finding himself - himself. It's fascinating, completely original and deeply satisfying. <br /> <br /> I'm not at all surprised that Barnens รถ won three Guldbagge awards for best film, best director and best actor, but I'm absolutely amazed that the actor who won this It's not Tomas Fryk, the kid whose intrepid performance as Queen must be one of the most remarkable ever filmed, but Ingvar Hirdwall in the relatively insignificant role of Stig, the shady boyfriend of Queen's mother. I do not understand that at all, but that does not change the fact that this film is excellent.
