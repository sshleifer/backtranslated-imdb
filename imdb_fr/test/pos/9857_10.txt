You have to pay attention to who you say to watch 12-hour movies. It might be easy for people to assume that this is a kind of regular occurrence - in fact, even in the arthouse cinema world, such gigantic travel times are extremely rare, for reasons obvious. It's a common thing in Hollywood and the art cinema: the generally accepted length of 90 to 120 minutes, with a minority of films that dare to approach, but rarely exceed the bar of three hours. <br /> <br /> For this reason, a film like Out 1 (duration: 729 minutes) is a challenge, even for the hardiest moviegoer, and partly explains why it was never screened before and that it remains extremely hard to find. <br /> <br /> Originally conceived as a TV series by maverick Nouvelle Vague director, Jacques Rivette, it aroused little interest from French networks and eventually culminated in a short theatrical series (Peter Watkins makes likewise with its brilliant pseudo-documentary on the nuclear war The War Game, although this has more to do with the censorship of the States than with problems of time of race). Presented a few times in 1971, Out 1 reappeared in two Rivette retrospectives over the last two decades, and many who saw it, including the famous American critic Jonathan Rosenbaum, praised her one of the greatest movies of all time. <br /> <br /> Is it? Yes, if you like Rivette. That alone is a big "if", as Jacques Rivette has never been a successful commercial director. Only two of his films have been successful (Céline and Julie Go Boating (1974) and La Belle Noiseuse (1991), both superb), and many are still hard to find on DVD today (Out 1 was only available only recently on the internet after a rare video tape has been downloaded). Nevertheless, he is well respected within the film community and rightly so: his surreal narratives, his sense of rhythm and his use of improvisation position him as one of the most unique and satisfying filmmakers in cinema. <br /> <br /> Out 1 discusses a recurrent theme in Rivette's work: the nature of acting, especially in the context of theater and improvisation. His fascination with film makes Rivette's films a much more collaborative process than many of his contemporaries, as the improvisational aspects allow actors to play a much more active role in determining how the film is formed. Out 1 is broadly divided into four main narratives, which gradually blend and fade as the film develops: two troupes composed of theater groups, each trying to devise post-modern theatrical adaptations of Aeschylus pieces; the two other small individual thieves (interpreted by the icons of the Nouvelle Vague, Jean-Pierre Léaud and Juliet Berto) in search of eccentric methods to earn money; and a global conspiracy involving a mysterious conspiracy inspired by Balzac and centered on an organization known as "thirteen". <br /> <br /> As in any Rivette film depicting a "conspiracy" story, mysteries and secret organizations are little more than red herring. As the characters are explored and revealed and their plans and interpersonal relationships collapse, the film becomes more and more symbolic of post-1968 boredom and the decline of ideals of that era. For a film made in 1971, these were remarkably precise themes. Another French director, Jean Eustache, will address this subject with equal satisfaction in his 1973 masterpiece, The Mother and the Whore. But this is not the limit of the scope of Out 1. <br /> <br /> Composed of eight episodes of about 90 minutes each (the beginning of each episode contains a brief abstract black and white montage of events from the previous chapter), Out 1 is no less observable than any quality television series, and may even be better known on one episode at a time. This does not mean that it does not remain difficult even when viewed in segments. Like most of Rivette's films, he uses the early hours to simply set up the characters before embarking on the plot, and some of these early scenes (especially the sequences describing the actors' highly abstract "drills") seem interminably long. These scenes are important, however, not only as an exploration of improvisational play methods that play both a literal and a metaphorical role in the film, but also as a method of adjusting the viewer to a somewhat languorous film. Paradoxically, feature films make long films much more tolerable for an audience, and this understanding of rhythm has led Rivette, along with more modern filmmakers like Michael Haneke and Béla Tarr, to create films with less commercial filming times. retaining the ability to leave viewers fascinated. <br /> <br /> In a film that has many aspects of acting, the acting is fantastic. Many famous faces of the New Wave are appearing, including the previous Léaud and Berto, the impressive Michel Lonsdale and the great usual Rivette, Bulle Ogier. Even another legendary director, Eric Rohmer, has an excellent reputation as a Balzac teacher who appears in a pivotal scene. People and architecture of Paris c. However, 1971 seems to play an equally important role: urban landscapes, crowd scenes and interested spectators are filming Out 1 in time, a document about a historic site. <br /> <br /> After a little more After 720 minutes, the film ends on an enigmatic and incredibly short note. Yet the exhausting journey the viewer has undertaken is so rich in possibilities, complexity and spontaneity that he would be forgiven for wanting to start over again or see the next twelve hours of these characters' lives. For those who have watched many genres of cinema and who think they have seen the art form, Out 1 recalls that the cinema has the potential to be so many things and to diverge in many more directions than the conventions allow. current. For filmmakers, film critics and artists of all disciplines, it is a valuable asset.
