A real comedy.The dialogue is fast and very spiritual.Eleanor Parker at his physical climax.Flynn as only Flynn can be "the charming rascal" .. although his saddle is passed now .. Most of the scenes between the main are short If you have not seen this movie, take a look.You'll be surprised by the timing of Flynn's comedy.The scenes between him, Tucker, Parker and "Cudddles" Sakal are hilarious.Just on the basis of outfits worn by Parker, the most appealing movie, is worth the detour.The novel of this 40s movie will not be lost for those who are so prone to watching movies from Hollywood's golden past. My bet is that Never Say Goodbye will not disappoint you.
