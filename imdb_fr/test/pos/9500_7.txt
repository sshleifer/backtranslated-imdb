Do not change your husband is, on the one hand, the beginning of a series of comical light comedies Cecil B. DeMille. On the other side, this is her first picture in the star Gloria Swanson, probably the greatest actress of the time of silence, and it's the film that made her a star. <br /> <br /> and his films became more verbose and less purely visual, with an interpreter as expressive as Swanson, we find much of this style of silent narration. His character does very little, but transmits volumes through subtle gestures and facial expression ?? with a particular talent for the looks of disdain. In real life, Swanson herself arrived at the end of her disastrous marriage with Wallace Beery, and it is possible that this fueled her compelling performance. <br /> <br /> To best complement his wife's talents, the use of DeMille framing and close-ups are particularly strong here. He uses the cinematographic technique to show the game ?? often holding Swanson in long close-ups at key moments? and also to clarify the story visually. For example, when we discover the character of Toodles, she appears three times in a vanity mirror. His character disappears from the story to become important towards the end. This striking first shot of her helps us remember who she was. Later, at the birthday dinner, Swanson and the future husband, number two, Lew Cody, are presented in one fell swoop, while Elliot Dexter is isolated in his own frame. Also ?? and this is a sign of the increasing sophistication of cinema in general ?? there is a lot of use of reaction shots ?? for example, the disapproving look of the bishop when Cody expresses his intentions with the dolls figurines of marriage. <br /> <br /> The visual narrative method of DeMille contrasts with the more and more verbose screenwriting of his collaborator Jeanie Macpherson. As I pointed out in several other comments, Macpherson could compose a strong and dramatic story, but, like DeMille, she tended to set her themes in a somewhat pretentious and flamboyant style. So we have these very long, almost philosophical title cards on the traps of married life that, if they improve history at all, it's only because they are unintentionally funny. For example, only Jeanie Macpherson could suggest a phrase like "Fate is sometimes hidden in Christmas shopping". Fortunately, in this picture, these titles mainly present scenes rather than divide them. <br /> <br /> Although the images he made at that time tend to be small, it was at this point that DeMille seemed to develop his taste. for the spectacular. You can see him starting to look for excuses for a bit of razzmatazz, like Swanson's fantastic little scenes bathed in "Pleasure, Wealth and Love". It would only be in the early twenties, after the lifting of the unofficial embargo on historical images, that he would have the chance to participate in the big show. <br /> <br /> All in all, do not change your life Husband is a silent image of DeMille pretty decent, though to be honest, it's really only the presence of Gloria Swanson that elevates her above average. It is curious that this is supposedly a comedy, and Swanson was projected at least in part because of his past at Mack Sennett's slapstick manufacturing plant. She hated playing in comedy and here gives a dramatic performance rather than comedy. It is therefore logical that the only direct drama she made with DeMille, Male and Female, was by far the strongest of their collaborations.
