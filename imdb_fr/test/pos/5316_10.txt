My God, Ryan Gosling has made a lot of deep characters in his career, this is one of his wonderful acting roles. For me, it's a very deep film, which requires a lot of concentration, not because it's hard to watch, just because you understand it if you put your shoes in this kid, even if he has everything and to a famous father who is a writer, has a deeper mind, you do not understand why he is killing this poor child, until you have really heard what he has to say and you begin to think, least for me, that many of the things he says are true. A simple kid, sweet, very kind, in a way as normal as a teenager, but who suffers inside him because he starts to look at the world differently, then you understand why he did what he did. I recommend this film to those who love deep drama.
