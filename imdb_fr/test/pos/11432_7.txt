Vincenzo Buonavolunta, a man who has been working for years in a steel mill, as a maintenance worker, whom the Italian owners sell to the Chinese, arrives at the end of the meeting where the purchase is organized because he wants to tell the new buyers of a fault he has discovered and he thinks he has the solution. He is not really passionate about the old Italian management or the new Chinese owners. He even argues with the translator about the exact term he wants to use to express his concern. <br /> <br /> Next comes Vincenzo who arrives in China and tries to contact the new owners. To his amazement, a new official was fired, Mr. Chong, the man he had tried to warn in Italy, was sacked. Her next quest is for the woman who was the interpreter, Liu Hua. He finds her working in a library, but she tells him, in no uncertain terms, that she blames him for being removed from his post. Liu, who sees the despair of Vincenzo, agrees to accompany him to find his ironworks. <br /> <br /> Thus, Vincenzo and Liu begin a journey in a part of the dark countryside that involves traveling by train, steam boat, bus and truck to remote areas of the giant's country. At best, finding the right factory turns out to be elusive, but Vincenzo discovers a life that is totally alien to him, as well as finding a benevolent soul who does not hesitate to help the Italian man, despite his initial disgust for him. . <br /> <br /> Gianni Amelio's film is a kind of travelogue. He takes the viewer to unknown territory. Some comments compare Vincenzo to Marco Polo, the great Italian traveler, although the similarities are not tangible. The film takes our attention to the beginning of the trip, but it starts to get a little less pleasant while Vincenzo gets stuck after his separation from Liu. Mr. Amelio is an interesting director, as he clearly demonstrated with this film for which he worked on the adaptation of Ermano Rea's novel, which we have not yet read. <br /> <br /> Sergio Castellitto is the only reason to watch the movie. This versatile actor brings a lot to the film, which is sort of a tour de force for him, as seen in almost every frame of the photo. The combination of Amelio and Castellitto proves to be a winning combination. Ling Tai, who debuts as Liu Hua, has good times and shows good chemistry with her co-star. <br /> <br /> Luca Bigazzi photographed the Chinese landscape in all its darkness. We see a China that is not pretty as a postcard. Mr. Bigazzi captures all the greyness typical of the regions where the film takes place. The musical score of Franco Piersanti serves the film well.
