yes barney is nonsense now, but when I was a kid it made perfect sense. <br /> <br /> I had nothing smarter, but I appreciated. as a child, they made fun of me because nobody could say my name, so I changed it. Since I was 4 years old, my name is Tina de Barney, because I can say she comes from a different culture. I'm 17 years old now and Barney has a prominent place in my life. ... my name comes from here ... I can not say the show I grew up with, no matter how stupid it seems now. <br /> <br /> I do not care if I hang, I have nothing more to say. they should not do the minimum of 10 lines because some people just do not have much to say. OK done
