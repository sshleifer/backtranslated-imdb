The BBC has outdone itself with the borders it has crossed with Tipping the Velvet. In the past, they have "dared" with the works of Dennis Potter, but this mini-series (as projected in the UK) is superb. The work of Andrew Davies is excellent. I did not read Sarah Water's novel, but I imagine he did it justice. I'm commenting on the leanness - most men have watched her - turned out to be a topic of discussion and main selling when it was originally announced. The fact is that this testifies to the lesbian side of society in the nineteenth century - at a time when most people thought it was older men and renting boys - it's true - lesbianism took place mainly at home. shelter of closed and often respectable doors. <br /> <br /> You can also consider Tipping The Velvet as a "love story" - it's actually - as well as as a "self-discovery" that many gay, bi or heterosexual people go through and comment on it happen and repeat themselves all the time. <BR /> <br /> If you have not seen it yet - repeated on TV or on DVD - get it back - you'll be satisfied - and even its production and filming are perfect. Just try to hide your blushes in the parts - as I said - the agenda - "rascal" - and beware of a "phallus" or two! <br /> <br /> Have fun!
