This MGM-produced reel in 1936 showcases the talents of two of its young contract stars, Judy Garland and Deanna Durbin. In a sense, these short films were promotional trailers featuring new talent in front of or behind the camera. Felix Feist realized this one, which was a way to promote the two talented stars to the public. <br /> <br /> The story is pretty simple. The orchestra that occurs in a public park every Sunday does not receive the attention it deserves. Enter two music lovers, Judy and Edna, who like to hear the play group led by one of their grandfathers. Two seniors in the city, feeling that there is no audience for this type of entertainment, have decided to cancel their Sunday concerts for a more popular orchestra that will attract a wider audience. <br /> <br /> The two girls embark on a promotional tour on their own, doing what they know only, calling and shopping and helping their neighbors in exchange for a promise that they will attend the concert from the park next Sunday. Well, that day is coming and, to their surprise, hardly anyone comes when the music starts. The two girls decide to take things in their hands and ask the conductor to make them sing a song. The result is clear: people in the park crowd to listen to talented young singers, thus ensuring the existence of the orchestra. <br /> <br /> Of course, the only attraction of the short film is the song inspired by the two stars. who are wonderful in their interpretation. Ms. Durbin's operatic voice blends well with Ms. Garland's natural, creating a charming duet. <br /> <br /> Do not miss it every time it happens on the MTC!
