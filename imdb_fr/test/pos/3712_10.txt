A short film beautifully photographed and rhythmic. It captures in an evocative way the feeling of this family and most of the country in the period before and just after Pearl Harbor. <br /> <br /> I appreciated the visual aspect of the film - both naturalistic and poetic. Excellent work of a great P. David Boyd. <br /> <br /> Although it is a family film, history never becomes maudlin or saccharine. We understand and believe in the motivation that drives the boy on his odyssey. I understand the younger brother's love for his elder brother and do not ask why he plans to do what he does. I understand that he is driven by a deep desire to be with his brother in this time of crisis. The kid is tough and Jonathan Furr's performance is superb, as is Ron Perlman's veteran.
