If you want to emulate James Bond, it's a brilliant idea to find a prominent man who looks like Sean Connery and Leonard Rossiter at the same time. Go ahead, Jean Dujardin, who perfectly captures Connery's smirk, who pretends to be a smile and the illusion of Rossiter's thought. he is sweet. Dujardin plays him like a Clouseau who can defend himself in karate. The plot makes him look for Our man in Schtook who has mysteriously disappeared and who includes improbabilities such as a Nazi cell hidden in a pyramid. If there is a discordant note, it is the main woman, Berenice Bejo, who has all the sensuality of a tallow pudding and is eclipsed - but only - by Aure Atika. It's good for viewing, but that's about it.
