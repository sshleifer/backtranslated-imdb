I will do this brief. It was a joy to watch. It could have been more effective if the characters had looked like their real life counterparts, but apart from this minor sighting, I found the fantastic animal characters very enjoyable. The visual effects were the most breathtaking except for the second-rate scenes, which could have been left out. Anyway, I do not like computer-generated animations, it goes against the purpose of a biopic like this one. Look at it, you will appreciate it too!
