Seeing this at the Newport Beach Film Festival the other day. The film is really exceptional. The crowd that I went with everyone loved it. Funny, poignant and great actor. I'm tired of the proven Hollywood novels, who can tell? David Krumholtz (Max) is truly amazing as a sure and sincere enthusiast of Grace, the ultra-visionary (Natasha Lyonne, also excellent). When Max falls in love with Grace, we believe him. Why? Because love at first sight is crazy and we are dealing with two lost and perhaps less crazy souls. Giullmo Diaz as Hector and Rosanna Arquette as sexless / sexy neurotic, the two "roommates" of Max and Grace before embarking on their trip to Sheboygen, Wisconsin. Do not miss this one, it's something special! P.S. The soundtrack, directed by Kevin Hearn (from the celebrity Bare Naked Ladies), is also really super cool.
