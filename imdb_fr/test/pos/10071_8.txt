I am not joking. Yes, "Who's That Girl" has the merit of being one of Madonna's bombing movies, but I liked this movie more than "Desperately Seeking Susan". In "Susan", the character of Madonna is relegated to the background by Rosanna Arquette and has little to work. No disrespect for Rosanna, but in WTG, Madonna plays this wacky and scandalous character, only in a style of the 80s. Although it may sound "corny" today, it's actually one of the best Madonna's films and one of her most underrated films. <br /> <br /> Madonna plays Nikki Finn, an ex-convict who is sent to the slammer for a crime. she did not commit. She is released from prison after four years of good behavior. Griffin Dunne, who is also a little known actor, plays the role of Louden Trott, a lawyer who has the unpleasant task of looking for her in prison to drive her to the bus station. Of course, when these two meet, madness occurs. Sir John Mills has a small role as a wealthy businessman who has a huge mansion in central Manhattan with a rainforest (???) on his roof. <br /> <br /> This film parodies everything. Rich people, sordid characters living in Harlem and totally destroying Louden's Rolls-Royce, homosexual cops who follow Madonna and Dunne in town, and Dunne's fianc√©e, Wendy Worthington, who slept with every taxi driver in town. New York (played by Haviland Morris, who was Jake Caroline's girlfriend in Sixteen Candles). Hilarious! In addition, Dunne is also in charge of a rare breed of leopards reminiscent of "Bringing Up Baby". In addition, Madonna had a beautiful blonde platinum of the 80s at the time and the film had a fantastic soundtrack. Add all this to the mix and you get the zaniness of WTG. <br /> <br /> Madonna is the queen of the deadly game. There are moments in the movie where she says a totally straight line and surprisingly, she turns out to be funny! This is how some of the best comedies should be played - straight. Madonna should have done more comedy and it was a pity she did not choose to do it. Later, she became much more controversial and played more in the dark and sexually charged roles in the notorious "Body of Evidence" and "Dangerous Game" movies. <br /> <br /> Some people say that Madonna can not act, which is good, people have the right to express their opinion, but I think the real problem is that people can not see the difference between Madonna playing a character in a movie, I still see only Madonna and this is the main reason why he is given more respect for his music than for his films. It's still a funny comedy from the 80s. Not for everyone, I'm sure some of you will not like it, so I'd recommend it to Madonna fans, but you never know, you could to be surprised and to love! <br /> <br /> Interesting note: Coati Mundi, who plays Raoul, is one of Madonna's friends since the early 80s in New York, and was part of the groups Kid Creole, The Coconuts and Savannah Band.
