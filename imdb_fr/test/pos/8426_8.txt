Here is one of Jane Austen's films that I found very delicious. I first read the book, then I listened to it on CD. I was fascinated by the fact that a young Victorian girl could be persuaded not to marry the man she loved because of her lack of fortune or education. The joy of knowing that Anne is obviously reunited with a lost love. The fact that her godmother tries to marry her to a good-for-nothing cousin who is only looking for money. Looking at the snobbery that comes from the upper classes and finding out how class distinctions can dissociate couples from following their hearts. Captain Wentworth realizes he still loves Anne after seven years. Her final understanding that Anne's love was constant all this time and that she was not going to let her family interfere with her true happiness and eventual marriage with the one she really loved.
