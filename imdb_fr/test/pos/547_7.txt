The main attraction of Anywhere but Here is Natalie Portman's superb performance. She gave her rather ungrateful character a deeply appreciated emotional depth. Susan Sarandon, an excellent actress, is sincere as a mother figure. I thought the chemistry between the two stars was credible, a chemistry that could have been developed more with a more complex script. I'm not saying that the script was bad in any way, I'm just saying that it sometimes seemed underdeveloped. I do not think it was the writer's fault. The film has suffered too much and has sometimes become blurred in the longest scenes. The film is beautiful, with good direction and excellent performance. Overall, certainly listenable, but perhaps more for an older audience. Bethany Cox.
