I only voted excellent because this film took two pictures of Americana: one in 1970 and one for each year thereafter. <br /> <br /> Nothing has really changed. <br /> <br /> Joe is actually an idiot, a fat stupid asshole who is angry at everyone for his own idiocy. It's not really a spoiler, but the key to the film is the big businessman "who never gets it wrong" who befriends this semi-troglodyte Joe, and he gets some sort of ... validation of his bigotry and his stupidity feeling of being wronged. <br /> <br /> However, few people would say that the boyfriend of the concession deserved to die. And these kids should not have scammed Joe and Compton. And Joe and Compton were getting into hash and young skin until they got ripped off. A simple film in many ways, except that, in 1970, New York City was comparable to a battle zone thanks to the care of Nixon and all the funds invested in the Vietnam War. As I write this (25/02/2007), Netflix has "a very long wait" for this movie - which makes me happy because I think there are people who want to learn. It was a pretty good shot - not exact, a little caricaturist - but actually pretty close to what it was at the time. And what is scary is that things have not changed much. Of course, there is no more welfare, but it simply means that wage slavery has won. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly how the millionaires will complain about not making enough money, then complain that $ 5.15 an hour is too much, to pay their people.
