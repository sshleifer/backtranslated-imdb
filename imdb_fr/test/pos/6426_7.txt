Alice (Florinda Bolkan), a translator living in Italy, discovers that she has a memory loss and that she does not remember the last days. She begins to follow a trail of fragments of memory that lead her to the small town of Garma. The city's inhabitants seem to recognize her and she begins to suspect that the recurring nightmares of astronauts with terrible experiences have something to do with her own amnesia. The film is interesting and the plot is good, but it's a little slow to move and arty for my taste. The plot takes a few twists and it is very difficult to know where he is going. Florinda Bolkan plays well in her role (but even better in "Flavia the heretic") and it's always nice to see the actress "star" Nocoletta Elmi. The role of Klaus Kinski is however too small. It's not a movie for the gore hound gore or an addicted to exploitation, but it's still a beautiful mystery for an hour and a half.
