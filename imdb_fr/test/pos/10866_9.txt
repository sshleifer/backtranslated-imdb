Here we have a clever mix of typical hongkongmovieshootouts, theories of world destruction and intelligent cinematography. This does not mean that the script does not have its big holes and that some special effects are a little cheaper. But cinematography is an optical treatment and the soundtrack is first rate. The mixture of fast action sequences and slow, sometimes almost poetic, color parts has no comparison in its genre of film, so a classification is rather difficult. The closest genre is a disaster or terrorist film with deeper human and political ratings than usual. It's worth being seen in cinemas around the world. But I hope for so many other films (mainly Asian) before and no one seems to believe me. Sadly.
