I do not understand this average rating of movies! <br /> <br /> I really liked it a lot; I even stayed up until the early morning to finish watching it on TV late at night <br /> <br /> There are three excellent characters here, excellent characters. Danny DeVito played a gem, an achievement considering that he also directed. His sometimes laughable character was sometimes brilliantly written and was surreal in a very credible way. There are people like that, Owen was right on the line without crossing her. <br /> <br /> Billy Crystal's comical style and sense of timing were PERFECT for his role. His frustration / comedy was interesting and captivating and besides ... you could understand his feelings. It is difficult to feel that you know a character from the point of view of writers. Finding the right actor is an art in itself and both have been done here three times. <br /> Third, who else could have played mom? Nobody can play that role so well. There is a style like no other, something you like to watch, I found myself waiting for it to appear on the screen ... and not because the rest was bad, oh no, but because the Mom's character was, once again, so straight without crossing it that it was excellent to watch. <br /> <br /> And what more? A happy ending with new friendships found, no injured person and everyone getting what he wanted in life ... WITHOUT a big piece of cheese knotted at the end. <br /> <br /> A brilliant script, a brilliant idea, a perfect cast, A good movie.
