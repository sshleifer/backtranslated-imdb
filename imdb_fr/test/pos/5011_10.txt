I saw the movie at the Nashville Film Festival on May 1, 2003! It was amazing! Tony Vidmer (scriptwriter, director, producer, publisher), Michael Imperioli (amazing work as Stuey) and all the other actors of what I read about Stuey were very well described. I'm glad he (Vidmer) did not follow the "Leaving Las Vegas" routine with Stuey's bad habits, but instead inserted us into his life, his family, and his gift. Linking the entire story of the motel room where he died was an excellent vehicle and showed his talents as a screenwriter. Congratulations to this one!
