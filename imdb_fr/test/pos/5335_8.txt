Coming from characters previously developed in a series of highly praised shorts, THE BURSE OF THE WERE-RABBIT is about as far removed from the "family dishes" as you can get: to perfection, with witty dialogue and clever concepts, this really is a movie that will appeal to almost everyone in the family. <br /> <br /> The story concerns Wallace and his dog Gromit, who live in a village obsessed with growing large vegetables for the annual fair and who operate "Anti-Pesto", a humane solution to all these rabbits pesky that torment passionate gardeners everywhere. The company is very successful, but Wallace is a little too smart for his good. When he tries to "rehabilitate" rabbits from their vegetable habits, he unexpectedly triggers an old horror of legendary proportions: the werewolf rabbit! And suddenly no vegetable in town is safe! The film is full of crazy inventions, cleverly unexpected dialogues, and references to everything from King KONG to WOLF MAN - more than enough to seduce even a jaded teenager - but the real charm of it lies in its characters. The amount of personality that artists and animators can extract from clay is incredible: they look as alive as any flesh and blood actor. The DVD version (and I recommend the widescreen) also includes a number of informative and entertaining supplements. Strongly recommended! GFT, Amazon review
