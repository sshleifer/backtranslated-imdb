The 1978 adaptation contained all the ingredients of a potentially wonderful film. It is based on an absolutely charming book by Charles Kingsley. James Mason, Bernard Cribbons and David Tomblinson, not to mention the vocal talents of David Jason and Jon Pertwee, are talented actors. There is also Lionel Jeffries, the director of great classics such as The Railway Children and The Amazing Mr Blunden, and although the film is good overall, it was also a little disappointing. I had no problem with the performances, especially those of Mason and Tomblinson as Grimes and Sir John Harriet respectively, and Tommy Pender and Samantha Gates are credible as Tom and Ellie. The composition of the voice is also commendable, especially Jon Pertwee, who expresses charming characters in their own right. I also liked the casual music so beautiful and haunted, and the script was fairly faithful and well written, especially at first. The characters, especially the Water Babies, are very charming, and the bad guys are both sinister and fun. I loved the role of Tom and his friends who helped the Water Babies escape, see the shark chasing the electric eel with an ax was very funny. However, I will say that the film looks dated, especially the animation sequences, the actual action scenes were not so bad, if you forgive the rather dark work of the camera. The animation of the character was rather flat, and the sets were sometimes a bit bland, although there were good moments, like the scene with Krakon and of course the first meeting with the Water Babies. I also had mixed feelings about the songs, the Water Babies song was beautiful, but I found the first song forgotten, when Tom finds himself underwater. Hi-Cockallorum is an example of a song that looks like a pot, whether you like it or hate it. Personally, I do not know what to do with this song, it was fun to listen to at first, but once it's in your head, it may be annoying. Although I like Lionel Jeffries and his films, his direction lacked wonder and magic. Overall, it's certainly not a terrible movie, but could have been better artistically. Bethany Cox.
