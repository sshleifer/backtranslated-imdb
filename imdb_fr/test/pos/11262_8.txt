Being a high school student, I have to take a health course. this year, the subject is drugs. we learn from the wrongs they can cause to a person. From what we're talking about, I still believe and know that drugs can really mess up a person. anyway, my teacher wanted us to watch that. Naturally, we groan and start to sleep, but like the rest of my class, I really enjoyed this movie. it was totally real, and not at all sugar coated. the characters were incredible and believable. even the plot was incredibly realistic and believable. What I liked most about this film was the way it helped to understand the effect that drugs can have on an abuser and the consequences that that person has to suffer. everyone is reassured that nothing bad will happen to them. well, let's take it seriously. anything can happen in a small town, even to your best friend, like Sam and Chris. this film shows it. a person can really learn a lot by watching this. it was quite effective.
