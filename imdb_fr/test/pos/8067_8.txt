Annie Rooney lives with her father-in-law and her brother Tim in the slums of New York, where she is constantly involved in a lot of fighting with other kids in the neighborhood. Annie secretly has a crush on Joe Kelly (whose little brother, Mickey, is at the head of the gang Annie constantly fights), who belongs to a gang that is heading for trouble, said Constable Rooney. Kelly is sponsoring a dance where Tony plans to shoot Kelly in revenge for making him look like a fool in front of his daughter, but Officer Kelly is fatally injured. Tony and his friend Spider told Tim (a member of Kelly's band) that Kelly had shot his father, so he takes revenge on him. Annie learns this and will stop her brother if she is on time. Very good mix of humor and heart in this film, even if the plot does not begin before the 40 minutes of the film. Pickford is nice (although she was 33 years old and did not play a girl over 12-13 years old) and is very interested in her character. Haines does not play the role of Kelly as difficult as he should, but manages to make the audience feel emotionally at him. The scenes where the officer tells Annie about the death of his father and the end that really puts your throat tight. Mixing all kinds of kids throughout the movie is fun to watch. Note, 8.
