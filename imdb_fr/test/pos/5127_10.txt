I saw the movie "Hoot" and immediately decided to comment. The truth is that NATURE needs our protection because we are the dominant species of this planet. Some people think that if they have money, they can do what they want, which is probably the case, but if they thought more about the future, they would think of themselves, they would do something. 'useful! This film does not only concern children, it shows us that it is usually children who care more about him than adults. When I was twelve, I saw water lilies and I knew they were protected by the law and I dared not even touch them, without fear of the law, but fearing that I could make them wrong. (I'm currently 15 years old) Anyway, the acting was great, the 3 main characters are well interpreted and we all have to learn from them. I hope you all think about what you saw in this movie !!! and appreciate!
