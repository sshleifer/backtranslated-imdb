For the record, the 1949 version of "The Blue Lagoon" is not the original movie, as many have said. <br /> <br /> This story was shot in Britain in 1923, just after the writing of the novel. Although I would love to see the 1949 version, I would like to take this opportunity to see the true original version of this movie story. <br /> <br /> Granted, the 1980 film with Christopher Atkins, Brooke Shields, and the two youngsters were filmed with beautiful cinematography. The acting did not seem so great when I first saw this movie, but after seeing it a few times ... it becomes obvious that two children growing up on an island without the help of an adult will actually have a simplistic approach to life ... whether in their language, their appearance or their daily activities. <br /> <br /> Although some have had the chance to see the "blue lagoon" of 1949, I can not help but wonder if there is any living person who can remember the exit from this story in 1923 to the cinema.
