I'm tired of people complaining that Never Say Never Again is a weak remake of Thunderball. Yes, the influence of this film is undeniable, but the enormous and almost universal inferiority of the films redone is reserved for films as unthinking and as unintelligent as that of Psycho, redone in 1998. If it is true that the theme The opening of the twelfth film of James Bond (and the latest film by Connery) is one of the worst in the series, the film itself still manages to remain autonomous, despite many other weaknesses. Plus, even the low title song is made to blend in pretty well with the closing dialogue of the movie. <br /> <br /> Of course, Sean Connery was getting a little younger when this movie was shot (at least by James Bond), but the story does not lack evidence to show that was not entirely unknown to the filmmakers. James Bond is about to retire before receiving his assignment, having spent most of his time teaching, doing nothing, and it is even foolish for M to pay more attention to his health, his diet, training and exercise practice. And so on. By the way, it's James Bond, remember? This guy is supposed to be some kind of super human, and all his fans are more and more upset because he has white hair. When this guy retires at the end of the movie, M sends a poor `Small-Fawcett '(in a hilarious Rowan Atkinson cameo) to tell Bond that without him, he worries about the security of the free world, and you all can not forget the fact that he is no longer a playful young man. Come on, Sean Connery could ALWAYS embody James Bond as best as possible, or at least better than anyone else ever was able to. <br /> <br /> The majority of the film deals with the elaborate plan to steal nuclear missiles and hold the world hostage (as Dr. Evil would say, "Oh, let's do what we always do?"), there So there's not much new there, but it's one of Bond's films that had the best liners. There is the funny scene where Bond is asked to take a urine sample ?? "If you could just fill that cup for me ??" "From here? There are many good interlocutors, but the sexual insinuations directed against Mr. Bond are particularly present in this article. But then, he sometimes throws this urine sample on the face of a villain, making him scream as if his face was burning. This is not a very good comic relief attempt, especially since this guy was kicking Bond's ass with some kind of super-spring device that could cut just about anything. And of course, Kim Basinger is featured in this film as one of the best Bond girls in the series. <br /> <br /> It's no secret that Never Say Never Again has had bad dates, and one of the things that has dated the worst is the special effects ?? with the exception of flying missiles, which were obviously wrong, but still impressive for 1982. The colored contact lenses at the beginning of the film were totally ineffective, and the laser watch was one of the worst things in the whole movie, second only to those damned sharks. Clearly, Fatima Blush installed on her suit a device that attracted sharks (admittedly, they had their own guiding mechanisms), in a scene that more than likely inspired the classic line: "I have a simple request. And it's having sharks with FRICKIN 'laser beams attached to their heads!' And then, of course, there's the explosion of the hotel room scene that was redone in an episode of The Simpsons and was obviously followed by another obligatory and too casual one-liner of James. <br /> <br /> The domination The video game created by Largo, the villain of the film, is a particularly memorable scene. The film also claims what is probably the best motorcycle pursuit of the entire series (far too much of the ridiculous Tomorrow Never Dies). But despite many strengths, the film's weaknesses are clearer in the minds of the public at the end of the film, largely because of the anti-climate underwater conclusion (one of the most obvious parts borrowed from Thunderball and recreated inferiorly). Regardless of the fact that Largo revealed crucial information to Bond as he left it alive in the tower (the brilliance of Dr. Evil, again, `I'm going to leave him there without witnessing his death and presume that everything went as planned What? '), The culmination of what should be a fast-paced action movie should never take place in a muted underwater atmosphere. <br /> <br /> In total, Never Say Never Again occupies a prominent place on the James Bond scale, and Connery's wink at the end of the film (as well as the last two lines) suggested that he could always come back for another round as a Bond. Clearly, it is not very likely, so we can only wish.
