"Distant" is a film of Turkish life that follows the mundane activities of two adult male cousins; one photographer and the other an underperforming unemployed person. There is no doubt that author Nuri Bilge Ceylan is a work in progress with considerable talent. However, this little foreign minimalist artistic drama is so full of empty things and so devoid of story or engaging or provocative content that it will probably appeal to the most fervent moviegoers and that the general public should go elsewhere. Personally, I quickly became bored with the slowness of the film and found myself moving quickly through the empty spaces - and there are many - between the dialogue, the development of the plot and the denouement. "Distant" is a piece of esoteric very well done. (B-)
