This film is well presented, often silly and always funny. Lemmon and Matthau work their team magic to perfection. Brent Spiner is just a riot as a selfish tyrant of a cruise director. From the first "Krishna Hare" to the last one "you should pay him fifty bucks to call you two stallions", I thought it was a fun entertaining comedy
