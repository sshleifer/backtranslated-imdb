I can not believe it's been 25 years since I watched this story for the first time on television. I remembered being very touched and I was lucky enough to get the VHS tape several years ago. I have not looked at it until recently. I have watched it over and over since. I must have watched it 10 times in the last two weeks. <br /> <br /> The acting is superb, the story is convincing and I am embarrassed to say that I have not appreciated the talent of actor Bryan Brown so far. The playful facial expressions shown in the first half - when he gave John the drug stolen in Malaysia - contrasted so much with his very reserved and nervous body language shown in the second half: in their first drink together at Caines and the homestead tour. We have to wait for the wedding reception, especially the final dance scene, to see his demonstration of open affection for John. The same dancing eyes that first revealed his admiration in Malaysia. Who would not want to be his Mrs. Boong? <br /> <br /> As Joe moved from an arrogant and almost larger-than-life figure in the Malaysian jungle to a shy person, in his own garden, John took the opposite route; his experience of the war seems to have restored his confidence. She did not waste time and searched for what she wanted. She took steps to take what she could get - just as Joe had told her to do it once upon a time. <br /> <br /> For me, all these transformations help to show that it's more than a love story - it's a story of growth, courage and fragility in life. The notary-noel is at once a sweet and sad figure. He too gave a lot to John - he gave his last hope of love. In the end, he did what true love requires: he put his happiness before his. <br /> <br /> I happen to like the fight between Joe and Jean who was not in the book. I thought it was an appropriate and necessary addition, because it brought out the inner struggles they faced in order to make their life together possible. <br /> <br /> Now, I'm older, maybe I understand life, love and loss a little better. This story touches me even more deeply. <br /> <br /> However, I am surprised to see that B. Brown has blue eyes on the promotional picture on this site. He certainly did not play in "A city like Alice". Well, 25 years is a long time!
