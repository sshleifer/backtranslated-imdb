Heya Denver fans! Animation is a cartoon classic and one of my favorites too (and yes, it has been broadcast also in Europe, including my small Central European country, Slovenia! = =) Oh, how I miss the cartoons of the 80s !! Honestly, they were much better than today's children's shows. More imaginative, creative, full of fun with good morals, more substance, a fantastic storyline and great character voices. Today's computer animation shows do not have all of these features. So all of you, who agree and want to bring all the shows back so kids of today's generation can see the entertainment that these cartoons have brought us, log in below and sign a petition for a replay of the 80's best cartoons! <br /> <br /> http://www.thepetitionsite.com/ 1 / we-want-a-80-kids-cartoons-kids-show-channel <br /> <br /> Carp Denver! =) <br /> <br /> Lejla
