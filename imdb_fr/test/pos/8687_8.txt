This is one of my favorite movies for several reasons. For starters, the ravishing Debra Paget as a princess / dancer, Michael Rennie as a villain, the handsome young Jeffrey Hunter investigating crimes committed in his city / state and others. The film is an unusually colorful adventure, and we even see the princess repeat (for once) the dance she will perform later. She manages to hook Hunter before learning that he is on his side; The photography, Travilla costumes, Lionel Newman's music and the style of the film are exceptionally good. Add to this clever action, intelligent characterization and fine direction by the veteran Harmon Jones a Gerald Drayson Adams script set in 1249 AD, and you get the ingredients of a nice Grecianized Middle East. However, there is plenty to rent about the unusual and well-developed plot here, as there are plenty of other things to rent than the film's fast paced, well-managed physical action sequences and superior technicalities. Classically trained actors such as Michael Ansara, Edgar Barrier, Wally Cassell, Jack Elam and Dona Drake are not commonly featured in a "B" movie together; there are also no fascinating scenery, a variety of places and a mystery of the quality provided here. One way to rate a movie is: "If I were sure of the experience, would I choose to go through these events and do those actions?" Since my answer is a resounding "yes" in this case, this film remains one of my choices as a favorite and much underrated cinematographic work. Would this be the all too common disdain of American critics for women as warriors and thinkers who, as in so many other cases, has brought the closed minds to misinterpret the obvious qualities of anti-tyranny and entertainment of that estimable movie?
