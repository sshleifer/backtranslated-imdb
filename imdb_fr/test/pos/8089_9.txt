This satire is really, really, and no one is spared. But even if this film has a lot of laughs in the silly story and the grotesque imitation of Hitler (here cleverly renamed "Hynkel" and speaking with some kind of hilarious pseudo-German), the general tone is pretty sad, maybe because of the place of the film in the story. And the actors do not even exaggerate as much as I suppose. One of the greatest cinematographic moments of all time must be the closing speech of the Jewish barber, if only things could have ended as well. It's not even really the character who talks, it's Chaplin who says something he really meant. If you ignore the technical aspects, the film does not feel old or old, it moves at a rather pleasant pace. And the lively humor that we find everywhere in this work will never die, the only thing that matters to me is the burlesque, but it comes with the time, I guess. It's an incredibly daring and hard stance on fascism. It's so striking again after all these years.
