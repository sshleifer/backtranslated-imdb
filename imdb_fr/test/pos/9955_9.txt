one of my favorite lines in Shakespeare. <br /> <br /> ie * We have not finished with you by a long shot * and not only does Shylock not have his pound of flesh, nor the 3,000, 6,000 or 36,000 (all the six were a ducat ducats, minutes, it is ruined to have to give up all his goods. and his daughter has already abandoned him for a long time. <br /> <br /> Vengeance is a dish that serves the best served cold. but Shylock's revenge is totally against her. <br /> <br /> I guess this piece has been and is popular because it responds to the wish we have for justice. but the harsh reality is that the world is engulfed in injustice and most of them are valid some big names find themselves thrown in jail, some gang punks lose their territory to the benefit of the "good guys", but in reality most of the time, it's the other way around. <br /> <br /> but not in this room. the screams of racism and anti-Semitism forget that it could have been any other excluded group in society that was successful, it was simply that the lenders of the day were Jewish and that Therefore, the needs of the story are staged by the Jew of Villain. <br /> <br /> Merchant of Venice is my third favorite work of Shakespeare, 1 and 2 being Hamlet and Macbeth. this production gives an excellent treatment of the moral of history. the scenes with the suitors alone deserve to be watched. also the embarrassment of the new wiggling husbands and minimize the fact that they leave the rings so easily that they swore to keep them forever. in real life, this trick is the thing the husbands use timidly to remind their half that the promises MUST have a meaning and not be done sparingly. This piece has a much deeper meaning than mere comedy / drama. it's about loyalty, commitment and love. <br /> <br /> It's worth watching over and over again.
