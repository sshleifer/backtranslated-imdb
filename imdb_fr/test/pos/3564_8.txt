"When I die, someone will bury me, and if that's not the case, what's the difference?" Who cares, huh? " Thus, the philosophy of life (or lack thereof) is summed up once and for all in this less than classic but nevertheless fun version of Sergio Leone's "Trilogy of Dollars". In the opening scene, three obviously evil gunmen go to a western town and, with a threatening look, intimidate all the pathetic people who are hiding in their homes. The watchful observer will notice that each of these three people bears a striking resemblance to Leone's "For a Few Dollars" characters. There's a guy in Eastwood's poncho, another in Lee Van Cleef's black suit and another pretending to be Gian Marie Volonte's Indio. But this movie does not concern these guys. Hardly had they entered the city after being shot by an even colder person, a mysterious bounty hunter known simply as the Stranger. <br /> <br /> No It's a different story altogether. <br /> <br /> In an obvious copy of Leone's Good, Bad, and Ugly, three shooters seek hidden treasure again. Once again, there is the bounty hunter and the Mexican bandit. The Stranger (George Hilton) is a super cool bounty hunter with a penchant for shooting people dressed as priests. He is after the reward for the bandit Monetero (Gilbert Roland). But when the band of Monetero steals three hundred thousand pieces of gold, the stranger turns away from his usual work. <br /> <br /> To complete the trio, there is Edd Byrne's corrupt banking director, Clayton. He too wants the money for himself. But once the money is hidden, the only man who knows where he is getting himself is shot. Now, the only hint on the hiding place is a medallion that shows a family crest. The game also involves finding the treasure before everyone else. And all guns can play. <br /> <br /> With a lot of shootings, punches and double crosses, the action leads these three players to an ultimate defeat, a three-way draw for the hidden evil treasure, and the ugly - but with a twist. <br /> <br /> This movie is not as good as Leone's movies, of course, but in the end, who cares, huh? This film is fun - 60s nihilism, western spaghetti style. There are no rules, no lasting loyalty, no good or bad, just the treasure and all it takes to get it. And, although the film is not classic, the end is surely. Hey, maybe we can all get along after all, a hundred thousand dollars a piece. <br /> <br /> If you like spaghetti westerns, look at this one. It's fast, furious and deserves a look.
