Larry (Billy Crystal) and Owen (Danny DeVito) lead an unpleasant life. Larry's old wife got rich by publishing a book he wrote and Owen has the most dominant mother imaginable. When Larry tells Owen to calm down by watching "Strangers on a Train", Owen gets an idea of ​​what they should commit cross-murders, as in the movie. And as in the movie, Larry thinks it's a joke, but Owen is serious. <br /> <br /> How they got the idea of ​​"Throwing my mom off the train", I'll never know, but it's a hilarious movie. There is not a moment of boredom in it. And that end was funny. Crystal and DeVito are at their best, and Anne Ramsey is as wise as in "The Goonies". A modern classic.
