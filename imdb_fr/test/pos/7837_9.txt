I found the episodes fascinating and well written. As a TV show, it was entertaining and that's what I expect from a fictional entertainment. I like the "relationship" between the teacher and her female security guard ... although sometimes her Scottish accent makes it a bit difficult to understand what she is saying. I was hoping there would be more than four episodes. I recognize that a commentator / critic of this series had comments regarding his opinion as a physician. I understand the comments of this gentleman. However, this is a fictional TV series intended to entertain ... without presenting specific facts like a documentary. Patrick Stewart performs well and makes his character credible. If you want to watch a documentary, then this is not the series for you. But if you want to watch unique scientific theories on entertainment-based support, you'll enjoy all four episodes.
