Of course, seeing some micro buoys means nothing, is not it? Lord, Rudy Ray Moore and D'Urville Martin really put that in place, did not they? I laughed a lot, as often happens in this kind of movies, but I do not know what to laugh at, because I laughed at so many other things. I'm not saying that the movie was bad, but I will say that a little more editing would have worked wonders. I'm a big fan of Blaxploitation, so I do not think it was horrible, but I know that "The Human Tornado" was many times better than that. I think those who can get through this movie might need a Colt 45 or two afterwards. I mean, it really helps you not to notice the boom pickups when you look at them again.
