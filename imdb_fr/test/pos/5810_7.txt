Hammer House of Horror: Witching Time takes place in the English countryside at Woodstock Farm, where stressed musician David Winter (Jon Finch) lives with his wife Mary (Prunella Gee) and is currently composing music for a horror movie . One night while looking for his dog, Billy David finds a mysterious woman in his barn. Her name is Lucinda Jessop (Patricia Quinn). She claims to be a witch who has traveled 300 years in the past. Obviously, rather skeptical, David has a hard time believing it, so he locks it up in a room on his farm and calls his doctor Charles (Ian McCulloch) for him to come and examine him, but once he happens, Lucinda is gone. Charles attributes the problem to David who drinks too much, but in the following days, strange and disturbing things begin to happen for David and Mary ... <br /> <br /> Witching Time was episode 1 of the short series of British horror anthems produced by Hammer Studios for television and broadcast in the UK in September 1980, the first of two episodes of Hammer House of Horror directed by Don Leaver (episode 13, The Mark of Satan, being the other), rather pleased me. As a series, Hammer House of Horror dealt with different themes and was unrelated to each other except by name and without surprise. Watching Time is a sinister and effective little story about a witch. Anthony Read's script has a duration of 50 minutes. & advance at a good pace. The characters are pretty good, just like the dialogue, there are some nice scenes here & I liked the way it never reveals if David and Mary go crazy or not. I think it's a well-structured, amusing and reasonably scary horror-themed TV show that I enjoyed more than I would have thought. <br /> <br /> Being made for British TV means that Hammer boys have a lower budget than usual, even if it were possible, there is no beautiful period decor, as in their movies the best known Frankenstein & Dracula, although the contemporary English decor gives it a special atmosphere that you can relate to a little more. Another restriction based on television is that operating levels are lower than you might expect. There is a bit of nudity and gore but not much, although it did not bother me too much because the story here is pretty good. It is well done for what it is & the experience of Hammer on their feature films probably helped to give them a nice appearance, the acting is good too, with the big favorite like Ian McCulloch doing a little appearance. <br /> <br /> Witching Time is a good start for the Hammer House of Horror series, a 50-minute British TV show is damn good. Now, why do not they make a show like this here?
