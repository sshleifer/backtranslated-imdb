One of the best sitcoms to broadcast on Indian television with Dekh Bhai Dekh and Idhar Udhar. A good acting, a steady pace and an extremely entertaining storyline made it a memorable series. The opening montage, filled with pleasure (interpreted by none other than the inimitable Kishore Kumar), gave a very accurate picture of what we could expect. I borrowed it from my local video library years after Doordarshan stopped broadcasting it. I hope that Indian television will return to series like this one rather than saas-bahu and reality TV that are to its advantage these days. Anyone who discovers a real good comedy must go and get this series. You will also enjoy some Pakistani sitcoms such as ups and downs and Aik aur Aik, which are certainly comparable to the best in India.
