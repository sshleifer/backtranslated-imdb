It's a great show with total freshness and innovation. This usual presenter (couch for woman), this obligatory group playing monotonous tunes, the same old jokes, the same pattern copied in the Nebuchadnezzer era ... probably the Johnny Carson motif, copied by everyone, Latterman, Leno, Conan ... Daly, this show seems to have none. <br /> <br /> I fell in love with this show in the first 10 minutes and I will stay there. Although it is too early to say, this show seems to be devoid of intellectual pretense, most talk shows striving so hard to project, and I hope that is what would make this show different from all others. I hope this show will last a long time! <br /> <br /> Going back after months, I still love this show and I like its humor that went down forever (for example, its claim that only loners watch his show on Saturday at midnight and, therefore, the jokes are only fun for the broken men), which does not involve however the usual monkey of Conan O'Brien, for example (I know it is a capital sin that O Les Brien antics, but I really do not like his style and repetitiveness). <br /> <br /> I watched it again the other night with Tom Arnold inside. Ferensen's parody of trading spouses (and Nanny 911 in a previous episode) is hilarious. Foolish paparazzi are fun, especially when a security guard warns them to pick up people and, if I'm not mistaken, they start taking pictures by shouting "Gary Coleman". <br /> <br /> Added April 16, 2007: Returning again, I am confused by the neighbor and her dog. I can not decide if it's a joke or a real thing. Anyway, it was very funny. <br /> <br /> I do not expect Spike Feresten to read these pages, but maybe he does. He's crazier than a group of monkeys, so I'd better write my suggestion here: I'd like him to do a 30-minute full-length show with Crazy Gideon, the late-night TV star. evening. I would like Crazy Gideon to have an interview in Spike's talk show, sing a song (and play the guitar), do a skit in the lineage of SNL and also answer questions from the public about his possible mayor mandate of Crazy Gideon may not be aware, but some websites explain why he would be the ideal candidate for the Los Angeles Mayor's job.) <br /> <br /> God willing! <br /> <br /> Back July 14, 2007: Someone wrote here that the people who rented Spike's talk show had to be corrupted by Spike. I admit that Spike really bought me, but I must also confess that Rockefeller named me in his will and last night I slept with Cindy Crowford.
