Spending an hour seeing this brilliant Dan Finnerty and his "Dan Band" performing their special show on Bravo is the most enjoyable time I've ever had to watch TV. This young man (Dan) is an incredible talent as a singer, performer and even dancer. He can go from the most expensive songs to pop ballads, all of which have been sung by women, through hip-hop, rock, but also songs written for women. This guy can do anything. I saw him play at least eleven times. So I did not expect his show to fit perfectly in the format of a film or television, but all the bookings were instantly removed at the beginning of the show, because of the exceptional quality of the show. from Dan. a favor and look at this, or better yet, buy it.
