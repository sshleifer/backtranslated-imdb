Growing up like a child of cinema, one of the trilogies that I will not forget anytime soon is that of Karate Kid. You can put anything you want on Ralph / Daniel, but it's the message behind the movies that is important, that it's important to be respectful of all creatures, big and small, but to defend yourself when the time requires it. Coming back to the movie, it's kind of fun because I saw Boys Do not Cry and I was really impressed by Hillary Swank's performance. Flipping through the sea of ​​canals, the other night, I came across the projection of this film. film and I did not realize at the time of my first reading of this movie that she was there. The story is centered on Julie, just like Daniel, not knowing where to fit or if she wants to fit in, and the head teacher is responsible for helping her to straighten and guide her. I really liked this addition to the series because it gave a good feminine side to the story and yes, even some outfits in which Hillary was dressed kept me, we say stimulated. Overall Rating 3.5 out of 5
