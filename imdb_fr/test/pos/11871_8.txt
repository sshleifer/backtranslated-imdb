This movie will never be on the list of the 50 best movies of all time, but if you make a list of "funny movies", it's not a bad start. Liv Tyler is amazing, captivating and succulent, and all others are dedicated with all their might. It's a counterpart of the 21st century to "Tom Jones" - in other words; just fine, fun bawdy. I think it may be Tyler's groundbreaking film about to become a major celebrity. Without nudity, she oozes sex in this movie. No wonder all the boys give him toys. How could they help if not do that for a defenseless innocent, such as Jew's Jewel?
