The creator of Donnie Darko offers a tale on the theme of the strangest area. The film is centered on a young middle-aged couple living on a paycheque in 1976. One day, a mysterious box appears with a red button. Later in the day, a scary man introduces himself and tells them that they have the choice to press the button and receive a million dollars, but that someone they do not know will die. This is a disturbing and provocative question, highlighted in the trailer and TV spots. But know that you do not know what you expect before seeing it. Sometimes pretentious and a bit melodramatic, the film is ultimately effective because of its good performance and its intriguing subject. It would be unfair to spoil the intrigues of the plot, but let's just say that the film will meet the expectations you expect and will not completely fulfill the others it begins to describe. There is a lot of apparent symbolism and subtext in the film, which is both interesting and annoying, as it was not so obvious in his other top film, Donnie Darko. There is not much to add without ruining the movie. it's supposed to inspire a lot of coffee noises afterwards. However, I would also like to say that the photo turned out well and that it has an aspect aged appropriately and that it is worth being watched. Check it out.
