This short topic gathered congratulations from all walks of life for his advocacy of religious tolerance. <br /> <br /> After a session in a recording studio, Frank Sinatra leaves a group of children hitting another because he was Jewish. He taught them as only an American icon can understand the meaning of prejudice and what we have just fought against the Nazis. The meaning could not be clearer. <br /> <br /> The two songs of this short subject have been recorded and sold in bulk for Columbia records. If you're just a dream and the song written for the movie, The House I Live In. This is one of the best songs on an idealized version of America that we would all like to search for. <br /> <br /> Sinatra actually recorded The House I Live In again in the '60s for an album made for her Reprise label. The album is now a rarity and it should not be. His collaborators were Bing Crosby and Fred Waring and his Pennsylvanians with the orchestra led by Nelson Riddle. <br /> <br /> Axel Stordahl was Sinatra's principal conductor and arranger in the forties. When he died, this position finally fell into the hands of Nelson Riddle. Stordahl is responsible for the orchestration for the short film and Columbia's CD, Riddle for the CD Reprise. <br /> <br /> Sinatra aficionados and others need to listen and compare answers. And catch this useful movie every time it's shown.
