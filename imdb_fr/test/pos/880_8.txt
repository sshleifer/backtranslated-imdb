Jewel Thief is * THE * Bollywood crime thriller, and why would not it be? It is directed by the greatest representative of the art of crime thriller in Indian cinema Vijay Anand ('Johny Mera Naam' and 'Teesri Manzil.). I could watch this movie for one of the following reasons (in order of importance): <br /> <br /> 1 Direction of Vijay Anand 2 RD Music Burman 3 Dev Anand 4 Vyjayanthimala 5 Ashok Kumar 6 The lyrics of Majrooh Sultanpuri <br /> <br /> Even though Jewel Thief is not a Bond film, it definitely has links. Helen, Tanuja and the mysterious Vyajanthimala (and some cameos.) But our saved Vinay (Dev Anand) is anything but Bond. He is out of control for most of the story and goes where history almost always leads him as confused as we are. He even flirts with Anju (Tanuja) trying to touch him the romantic nerve, just to be able to work in his father's shop. <br /> <br /> Dev Anand could play a double role - well, I do not want to ruin your film otherwise I would have told you. That's what most of the mystery is about. Dev Anand works in a jewelery shop and there is a robbery while he is supposed to be at work - but that is not the case, or at least he has a perfect alibi. We wonder who did it, is it Dev Anand as "Vijay" the person he claims to be or is it "Amar" someone we have not seen yet, but many people claim that he is alike. As 'Shalu' (Vyjayanthimala) who even claims that he is his fianc√©, in a tense situation, Dev Anand must prove that he is Vinay and not Amar. Everyone wonders if Dev Anand is Vinay or Amar, he is asked to remove his socks. We are told that Amar has 6 digits on one of his feet. While we look forward to the events that will unfold, Dev Anand even finds time to joke. <br /> <br /> The real directors Vijay Anand and Actor Dev Anand have several movies between them. It's not the best of them, but the best of Crime Thriller. <br /> <br /> There are moments of Hitchcock's North By Northwest, but the movies are very different. Aside from the confusion that reigns over who is who, a treacherous female stream and a lot of trips there, there are not many similarities. Dev Anand could very well be Amar besides being Vijay. People have seen it, they recognize it wherever it goes. There are too many of these people to be a fraud. Finally, Vinay thinks it's better to continue to be Amar to find out what's the truth and it's a sad mistake. It sinks too deeply into the film to be saved by the twists and turns of the cinema. <br /> <br /> When I watched the movie as a child, I certainly was not amused, the end completely confused me. Even now, there are parties on the end that I do not like, but I would still recommend this film. <br /> <br /> Even as a child, I loved the songs this movie has to offer. 'Yeh dil ...' - a very specific song for the slackers in Kishor Kumar's voice. I could hear 'Rulake Gaya ...' all day long. Same for 'Aasmaan ke neeche' which is placed 'under the sky' of Gangtok (at least, the scenario suggests). 'Raat akeli hai' is one of Hindi cinema's hottest songs, featuring Tanuja as a seducer. "Meri taraf dekho" - Helen's cabaret and we "look at her". 'Hothon pe ...' - now, could there be a better thriller of a song than this one? As the song progresses, we are more tense than ever and the words "hidden in Shalu's lips" add a note.
