Peter O'Toole, one of our best actors, is wonderful as a dedicated teacher, dedicated to teaching young boys. He meets a show girl and falls in love. The story is a story of love and devotion. Petula Clark adds spirit and sensitivity, not to mention a remarkable voice. You will enjoy this film even if the end is not necessarily happy. I liked that.
