Homegrown is one of those films that has sort of fallen in the cracks, but deserves better. When I saw it for the first time, I had a lukewarm reaction. But, with time, it really grew on me - no pun intended ;-). The more I see it, the more I appreciate it. The writing is excellent, as is the acting game. Add some surprising cameos and good direction and you'll get a great little movie. <br /> <br /> It is also good to finally see Hank Azaria have the chance to shine in a leading role. And Thornton offers its usual quality performance. Even newcomer Ryan Phillippe looks good, playing an innocent friendly with finesse and subtlety. <br /> <br /> By the way, Homegrown is simply a "must" if you're a fan of Billy Bob Thornton. It seems that Stephen Gyllenhaal has been influenced by earlier Thornton projects such as One False Move and Sling Blade (although Homegrown is certainly much more ironic than either). And the role of Thornton as a character both sophisticated and down-to-earth is perfect for the actor.
