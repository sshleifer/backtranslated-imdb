Haha, what a good little movie! Wayne Crawford strikes again, or rather it is his first big strike, a small ball of manic, kitsch and delusional energy, masquerading as a psycho killer movie. It's actually a ** brilliant ** satire on post-hippie American culture in the country flyover, although the film was shot independently in Miami. It defies all types of convention or studio-based scenario that I can think of: PERFECTLY AUNT MARTHA IS NOT A DREAMS GAME, it may not be a technically clever movie, but it's is a wonderful little piece of Americana, made cheaply by honest, ambitious, imaginative people and had steel bullets. It took courage, nervousness and cunning to make this film, which surprisingly seems to have stood the test of time. This film is fresh, vital, alive, unforgettable and charming enough to be recommended to anyone with a sense of humor. <br /> <br /> I unearthed last year at a time when I was fascinated by "star" Wayne Crawford (here named under his pseudonym Scott Lawrence), a maestro of what one can not He is a writer, producer, director, and actor, probably best known for his favorite film of the '80s, NIGHT OF THE COMET. He plays Stanley here, the pants wearing half of a really wonderful couple of characters, seemingly homosexual killers in the Spree group after hitting an old Baltimore lady for her jewelry. Abe Zwick, legend of the underrated screen, is quite convincing in the role of Paul, who plays Stanley's aunt Martha, who made Stanley believe that he had committed the assassination to ensure his loyalty. Martha looks as feminine as the sailors of SOUTH PACIFIC's secondary choir in their coconut bikini top, but no one seems to notice - or care? - she is a he, has no visible means of income, seems to spend the whole day worrying about where Stanley is and walks around the neighborhood in a bathrobe with a butcher's knife. Only in America ... <br /> <br /> At the opening of the movie, the two men just arrived in Florida and made their home in what looks like the old house of Ward Cleaver, a television house Superbly lit and designed to be surrealistic. During a memorable scene, Martha and an unwanted guest from the house sit on the couch, discuss problems and drink a can of Budweiser in one of the most fascinating and subversive sequences I've ever seen in outside of a John Waters movie. Then there is Stanley, who is still in trouble because he is a hippie wearing an STP broom on his waistcoat, who drives a psychedelic painted van that is about as subtle as the Batmobile, drinks his milk directly from the cardboard, drinks drugs with blond bimbos. and amass donuts in an old cigar box for a snack Opposites attract, I suppose. <br /> <br /> But Stanley is also concerned not to like him when the girls he is being stoned with are trying to take off his pants, and it always seems like Aunt Martha is getting him out of the resulting pain inevitably. The corpses pile up, a nosy junkie forces them to use their house like a fiasco, Stanley's birthday cake is crushed, and everyone ends up at the local pizzeria before going to the wooden shed located at the back of the property for a nargile party where the girls dance in their underwear. Things get out of hand when one of the neighbors tries to become a little too much of a friend with Martha, who naturally prefers to keep people at bay, when they are crudely invited to chat. And here is a woman who wears not only a butcher's knife, but a 38 loaded in her underpants. Finally, the strange duo is stuck with a body, a baby and no place to go, and ends up taking refuge in an abandoned movie studio where the technical team borrowed the equipment used to make the film. I just hope they first politely asked permission and then cleaned up. <br /> <br /> Of course one must say a word about the relationship between Stanley and Martha / Paul, because dancing around the fact that they are at least two suggesting to be a homosexual couple would miss most of the plot. We never see them becoming intimate and even if Stanley mockingly refers to a "scene" in a scene, their relationship is more symbiotic than sexual. It is certainly not a "gay" movie, with abundant female nudity and an unquestionable air of misogyny of the 1970s. Stanley & Paul never consume their implicit sexuality on the screen, even if the film would certainly have had the courage to do so if it was important. This is not the case, the story does not concern their sex, but the link they share and how strange it is. It's not their gay, but their distinct identity, which are two of the strangest cinematographic creations that have ever inhabited my television. <br /> <br /> The film is unique. This was done for only a few thousand dollars on what looks like borrowed studio sets, occasional filming work and some public places in which they managed to get a film crew in while no one was watching. The dialogue is completely bizarre, banal and deliciously esoteric. It's a movie that will surprise you, not everyone will love it, but those who are fond of low-budget American horrors / thrillers like THE NIGHT GODED CASSÃ‰, HELP ME! I AM POSSESSED, BLOOD & LACE and children should not play with dead things, you are a winner here. <br /> <br /> 8/10: In general, I would say something like "deserves a DVD restoration", but I think it would spoil the sticky atmosphere of the movie. And Wayne Crawford, you, sir, run.
