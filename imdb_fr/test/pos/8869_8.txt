"Throw Momma From the Train" is a simple black comedy bursting with laughter. <br /> <br /> Billy Crystal plays a frustrated writer about to collapse; Danny DeVito plays a man in one of Crystal's writing classes. The ex-wife of Crystal is a witch to say it nicely and Crystal hates her. DeVito, sensing this, offers Crystal an affair one night: DeVito will kill Crystal's wife, if Crystal kills DeVito's mother's nag. Crystal refuses, of course, but later, corruption deep in his heart makes him say yes. And while things are playing out, we see what happens when you try to throw someone's mom off a moving train. <br /> <br /> This story is an interesting character study; a story of evil, greed, vengeance, ego, trust, doing well, but especially corruption. We see Crystal's white-collar writer becoming more and more stressed by the events unfolding around him and, because of DeVito's incessant lancet, he says "yes." But we know deep down in his subconscious that he wanted to say "yes," and he's delighted to have told DeVito. <br /> <br /> This movie is a bit dark on Hitchcock's immortal film "Strangers on a Train", and it's a tribute to the film from the beginning, when there's a theater playing "Strangers on a Train ". We see DeVito watching the movie and a light bulb in his head lights up. He has an idea. Throw mom out of the train! <br /> <br /> Billy Crystal gives another convincing and strangely comical show as a harassed writer about to collapse. He was so struck by everything that's going on around him that his inner emotions came out and he agrees to throw DeVito's mom off the train. <br /> <br /> Danny DeVito did this film very well. He uses the right touch of comic darkness to create a world of corruption and disease. Everything is crazy, but not as extreme as in other dark comedies. It is the touch of darkness that has transpired in "The War of Roses". <br /> <br /> "Throw momma from the train" is not only a simple story of corruption and morality, but interesting study of character. Must see on TV. <br /> <br /> 3.5 / 5 stars - <br /> <br /> John Ulmer
