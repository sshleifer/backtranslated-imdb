Zachary Scott does what he does best, that is to say he plays a worm in "Danger Signal", a 1945 B movie with also Faye Emerson, Mona Freeman and Rosemary DeCamp. Scott plays a writer who kills women after he has had their money. After the last murder, he rented a room in the Fenchurch family home, Hilda (Emerson) and his mother (Mary Servoss). Scott throws herself on Emerson and she is dazzled. In the midst of romance, her younger sister Anne (Freeman) returns home after medical treatment. When she mentions that she is Uncle Wade's favorite and has left him $ 25,000 (a lot of money by 1945 standards), Scott loses interest in poor Hilda and plays a piece for Anne. Anne looks like Rebecca from Sunnybrook Farm until she starts sneaking in with Scott - overnight, she's 10 years old and gets downright mean to her sister. Finally, understanding the message that her tenant is not good, Hilda uses a psychiatrist (Rosemary DeCamp) for the psyche and the counselor. <br /> <br /> Psychological dramas were all the rage during and after the Second World War. Scott does a great job as a smooth sociopath. That was his strong point: as a weak-minded sheriff in "Flamingo Road", he did not exhibit any real presence. As for the double timing, we saw it in "Mildred Pierce", where he was particularly talented. Emerson is a book stenographer, with her hair pushed back onto her face and her big glasses, but after hours she's lovely and gives a strong performance. DeCamp has always been an underrated actress. Here, she wears a slight German accent and is lovely. <br /> <br /> This is a very entertaining film, but a very routine story. The actor's play really elevates him.
