Movies do not always involve deep and provocative thoughts. Sometimes they are just supposed to escape reality. Out To Sea is perfect. <br /> <br /> A romantic comedy in the heart of the "golden years", Out To Sea may not be a big budget, you can easily say when they act in front of a green screen, but it's still a lot to watch. A film that deserves a break. <br /> <br /> This is just good, light fun. It's not supposed to be a deep film. It is something that deserves to be watched. If it's nothing else, you should definitely see it for the humorous and stiff replica of Oye Como Va by Brent Spiner. Gil is a character you love to hate and Mr. Spiner pulls the perfect and evil movie to two beloved comedy gods.
