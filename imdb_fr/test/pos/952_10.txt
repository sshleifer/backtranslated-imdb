Ghilli is the best film of vijay and one of the greatest hits of his career .... Since I had not seen the movie Telegu, I could enjoy even more of this film. The story tells the story of a young girl who wants to escape from the claws of a local moron who wants to marry her by force. As he is a moron, no body is ready to help heroin. Vijay, who came to play a Kabaddi match, sees him and decides to help him. The rest of the movie is how vijay help and how the girl finally escapes the clutches of the political companion of the moron and his father. The film has a lot to spare from thriller moments of siege and will keep the viewer engaged until the end. Vijay is as usual very good in the role of the Kabaddi player. Trisha, Ashish Vidyarthi and the group of vijay friends have all done their job competently. A special mention must be made about the villain of the movie Prakashraj. The character of the villain has been properly etched and prakashraj has very well portrayed it. Surprisingly, for the first time, I finally felt sympathy for the bad guy. The "Hi Chellam" dialogue really caught the attention of the masses. The vidyasagar music is brilliant and the song 'apadi podu' is a rage everywhere..Dharani has to be credited with such a nice masala movie, which will please not only the vijay fans, but also the general public. in the whole world.
