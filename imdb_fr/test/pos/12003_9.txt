Columbo is a guest speaker for a Criminology course. Students invite him to meet after class. While passing through the nearby garage, they discover their usual teacher, who died near a car, died from a gunshot wound. (No, Columbo was not looking for the work of the man.) As a class project, Columbo involves the students in his research. <br /> <br /> Two students, identified by the viewer as the culprits, were in the reading room the whole class. In addition, video surveillance recordings of the garage indicate that none other than the professor has entered or exited after his last unannounced appearance in the conference room. <br /> <br /> Inverting the usual routine, Columbo is the one harassed by the diabolical duo (?), eager for reports of progress and listening to his theories. Medico-legal evidence is almost non-existent. The solution of the case is based on an eventual and interesting chance. <br /> <br /> During the first visit, it seemed that Columbo had swallowed all the wrong direction of the culprits; however, after viewing several times, small details revealed that this was not the case at all. <br /> <br /> This author must still get tired of "Columbo Goes to College".
