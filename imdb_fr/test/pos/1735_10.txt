2005 will remain in the history of "Dr.Who" as the most incredible year. Everything seemed to click; a new doctor and first-rate companion, a large audience ($ 10 million for the first episode and a special Christmas show), major awards, rave reviews and idiots who have spent years chuckling at the seeming inability of Daleks to negotiate marches were silenced. But then, Christopher Eccleston launched a bomb after a single run. It seemed like the honeymoon was over. Fortunately, the public seems to have embraced his successor, the excellent David Tennant. On top of that, the show boasts of SFX's worth, such as the spaceship crashing on "Big Ben" in "Aliens Of London" and great stories like "Tooth & Claw", "Army Of Ghosts / Doomsday" . The new "Dr.Who" is basically the same as the old one, updated for the 21st century. Some fans have accused Russell T.Davies of "ruining" the series. They must remember that there was no show for sixteen years until his arrival.
