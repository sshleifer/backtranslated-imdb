The historical drama is one of the areas where the British are unbeatable. So, even though I'm not a big fan of it, I can usually be persuaded to look at something that's wrong if it's British and with decent actors. <br /> <br /> I have never read anything about Sarah Waters, which of course is something I should do. As a result, I did not know what to expect. I had heard that there would be a lesbian love story, but not much more. Looking at it, I found it much more interesting than expected. Without saying too much, the plot twists are both unexpected and well-crafted. Even though there was almost a twist too much somewhere, it took me a minute to make everything clear. <br /> <br /> The production values ​​are good, the actors are very solid and the pace is correct, although I found it a bit slow in the last half hour. Maybe it's just me, I usually have a problem with movies lying around after the plot is more or less over. Overall, the three hours are rather pleasant. I recommend it to anyone interested in historical dramas.
