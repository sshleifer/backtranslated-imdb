Incredibly close to reality, feelings and emotions captured by Joseph Mazzello as an AIDS-affected child with hemophilia and his new young neighbor, a tough redneck, played to perfection by Brad Renfro. Although the story may seem a little far-fetched (the two boys are trying to walk several kilometers to find a doctor who claims to cure AIDS), the emotions, actions and interactions of all the characters involved are tragically close to real life. As a "big brother" of a boy in a similar situation who died a few years after the release of this film, I highly recommend this picture to anyone who has ever wondered what was really happening in the life of a child with AIDS. Peter Horton's superb direction creates the perfect ambience and scenery for each scene and trains the viewer into the different emotions affected by friendship, illness, prejudice and the final separation of two friends who fought to overcome the adversity.
