If you forget the fact that the plot has been done many times, it's a humorous and happily enjoyable drawing of Looney Tunes. The animation is beautiful, the backgrounds so detailed and many bold colors. The writing is very clear, and the view, especially that of Daffy who is out of breath, is brilliantly timed. I really liked the arguments between Daffy and Bugs, and that Bugs wins every time. I also love the fact that Daffy is really greedy and mean while being ridiculously funny. I prefer him when he's crazy, but he's having a lot of fun here too. Bugs is still his charming and naughty self, and Elmer is funny, although rather stupid too. In short, it's absolutely great, and it's actually my favorite trilogy of the hunt for its entertainment value. 10/10 Bethany Cox
