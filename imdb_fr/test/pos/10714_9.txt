What can I say about Kramer vs. Kramer? On the surface, it's pretty simple, but below it's bigger emotions than life itself. It delivers a lot of fantastic moments, it makes you laugh, it makes you cry. You sympathize with the characters and you care about them. Many films fail, Kramer against Kramer is a success. <br /> <br /> I think everyone would agree that the acting is superb. Once you watched Kramer against Kramer, the game in most other movies started to get plastic and emotionless. The actors seem to get along well with their roles and the characters really live on the screen. There is a beautiful chemistry between them. I think the best performance of the film comes from the young Justin Henry. He is different from any other actor I have ever seen. He is incredibly natural. <br /> <br /> In addition, Meryl Streep has a neurotic beauty. And Dustin Hoffman delivers one of the best performances of his career! The story is very well written. It's simple but complicated at the same time. The concept is the simplest part, the feelings associated with the most complicated part. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen this movie yet, you're definitely missing! See now!
