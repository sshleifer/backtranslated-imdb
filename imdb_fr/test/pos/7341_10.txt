Thank you for having made such a beautiful escape. That's what I like about movies. I was so impressed by the aireals, by the way they were shot and by the timing that was chosen to be dynamically perfect with the music. As a dancer myself, and after having been part of many dance films, the choreography is usually chopped, cut out the beat ..... "Showgirls" movie. The relationship between women was very present in the movement. <br /> <br /> My favorite scene is the last one, when she's stopped. I have already seen the movie, a different version., And I did not like the husband much the last time. I felt a little more sorry for him this time. It changes how I feel about female love birds. It's so magical.
