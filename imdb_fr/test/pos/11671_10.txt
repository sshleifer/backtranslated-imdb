The unique and unique! <br /> <br /> The only very good description of the punk movement in Los Angeles in the early 80s. In addition, the definitive documentary on legendary bands like the Black Flag and the X. The disgusting views of Americans of the great audience on this movie are absolutely hilarious! How can music be so diverse in a country of supposed freedom ... even 20 years later ... discover! <br /> <br />
