This is a movie about loneliness and how far ?? physical and emotional - relationships between people tarnish relationships. <br /> <br /> The story is simple and banal: a young man, Yusuf (Emin Toprak), from a rural village, arrives in Istanbul to stay. his cousin Mahmut (Muzaffer Ozdemir); Yusuf wants to work in the big city. After trying for weeks to find work without success, living with Yusuf is too much for Mahmut. They argue ?? nothing physical, just verbal. Yusuf finally leaves, leaving Mahmut alone again. End of the story ... <br /> <br /> Except that the representation of the two men as a parent is one of the best of the film. Much is said visually; The dialogue is used to bring out the disagreement, mistrust, hostility and insecurity that exist between and between the two men. <br /> <br /> There are many visual jewels in this film. For example, while looking for work, young Yusuf, in need of a romantic relationship, tries in vain to attract the attention of various young women in the city. His face, as he is upset every time, says it all. <br /> <br /> Or, wanting a cigarette, Yusuf opens the balcony door of Mahmut's apartment and lights up in the icy December air, leaving the door open; Mahmut, finally getting up from his desk, goes to the door (all glass) and the cousins ​​look at each other just for what seems way too long. Then Mahmut closes the door, leaving Yusuf outside in the cold. The metaphor is complete. <br /> <br /> Or Mahmut cleaning up after Yusuf, reluctantly and with increasing anger; and during all this time, Yusuf was wasting time running after the skirts instead of looking for work seriously and spending Mahmut's money to buy a toy from a nephew ?? Yusuf is emotional, messy, impulsive and vulnerable. Mahmut is rational, logical, self-confident and a demanding control maniac: the right brain, left brain dichotomy, admirably interpreted by two actors who say more with a look, a gesture, a frown than anybody what word can not say. <Br /> <br /> But Mahmut is not completely emotionless: he still loves his ex-wife who tells him that she is going to Canada with her future husband. Mahmut maintains a distant and confident friendship with her ex and makes sure she agrees to go. He wishes him good luck. He says goodbye. He leaves the cafe where they were talking. Later, when she calls to say a last goodbye, on the way to the airport, Mahmut goes there and secretly observes him during his departure. The poignancy of the emotion on her face, as she disappears through a door, is worth the wait. <br /> <br /> In the end, it is a remarkable work of the two main actors and the director, Nuri Ceylan. Some might say that the pace is too slow; but life goes slowly for much of the time, especially for those who are alone. The work of the camera is also relatively simple: choose the scene, set up the camera and the light, then let the actors move into the scene, enter the scene and leave the scene, while holding the camera still. There were some panoramic shots, some high angle tracking shots, some rural scenes? but a large part of the film is represented as on a stage with a fixed camera and a wide angle lens. With the exception of the music broadcast on the radio and television in the story, there is no sound track. And, there are these long silences as the two men sit together and watch TV and / or engage in a very limited conversation. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie on TV, so I was amused to see that, Sometimes I watched TV as they watched TV too. The silence in the film corresponded to the silence of my house (I was awake, all the others in bed); my chair and my position matched Mahmut's as he watched television. Quite strange, giving me the impression of being almost there with him ?? And I guess so, in a sense. <br /> <br /> I will not say more, because I want you to enjoy the other scenes that I have not described. It's not a movie for everyone, that's for sure. More than any film I've seen, it shows how much we die when we are alone? just as we are alone when we die. The face of Mahmut, who becomes black in the final scene, will stay with me for a long time ... <br /> <br /> Highly recommended for cinephiles savvy.
