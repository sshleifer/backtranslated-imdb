Treading Water is a very beautiful film. I would put this directly under the wonderful short film: Cosa Bella by Fiona MacKenzie. It's not just about going out, but about tolerance and acceptance in general. I look forward to seeing more of Laurel Himmel's work in the future. The actors, Angie Redman and Nina Landey are very good. The relationship between the main characters could have been reinforced, because we understand that there is a strong link between them, but it might have been explained a little bit. I'm surprised that Angie Redman does not appear much in other films. A great first step as a director for Laurel Himmel, I'm sure her skills are an added bonus.
