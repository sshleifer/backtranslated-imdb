I remember hearing about this film and how it was presented in almost all open theaters here in Toronto. This is a group of girls who are not accepted by the other sororities of their college, so they create their own school and call it of course H.O.T.S. It's a fun movie, full of car nostalgia! Many t-shirts, vans, fights and complete football fights! This has been compared to "Animal House", which is a good movie in its own right, but for me nothing compares to H.O.T.S. He has his own brand of pleasure and character. If you are looking for a classic T'A movie, look no further than H.O.T.S. the girls are on the rescue, boom-boom shorts & all!
