Footprints are certainly not your usual route, Giallo, and that's not a bad thing. Unlike his previous essay, Luigi Bazzoni's film, The Fifth Cord (which was your "classic" Giallo), abandons almost all of Giallo's trademarks and replaces the murder; the focus is on the psychological mystery. From the beginning, it is obvious that this film will be totally bizarre, because the film opens on a scene taking place on the moon. Things do not become clearer after that because the lunar sequence turns out to be Alice's dream, a troubled woman. Alice is tormented by the dreams of an astronaut stranded on the moon, which seem to come from watching a movie called "Footprints on the moon". After a lot of things go wrong for her, Alice decides to go to Garma, a formerly mostly deserted tourist spot. When she arrives, she is surprised to find that the people she meets already seem to know her. Alice also meets a girl with a red head who also seems to know her already; the girl tells Alice that she looks exactly like Nicole, except that she is more beautiful and has shorter hair ... <br /> <br /> Footprints does not have many features Giallo's sex, murder and other commercial brands from the beginning with the main audience, because most people who enter this movie will not get what they expected (or, probably, they wanted it). Footprints, on the other hand, requires respect because it does not simply follow from what was before. In 1975, the Giallo began to lose its popularity and many films released at that time (with a few exceptions) were only retreading what it was before. Luigi Bazzoni would have had a great chance with this film. . Florinda Bolkan gives a strong performance in the lead role; and the fact that she is not the most beautiful heroine of Giallo does not really matter. The mystery is built well throughout, and although it can sometimes become a little turgid; Footprints are, in general, intriguing for the duration. Once there, it will probably not be surprising that many end up understanding that the end does not make much sense and clarifies nothing; but that adds nicely to the bizarre cult value of the film, and in total; I'm giving Footprints a boost!
