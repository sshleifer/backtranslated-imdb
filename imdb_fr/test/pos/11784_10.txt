Nothing is sacred. Ask Ernie Fosselius. Nowadays, everyone has a video camera and a movie is just out, before the periodontium begins to fly, is quickly written and filmed, and often posted directly on the Internet. Parodies are hot nowadays, and we are doing everything we can to make sure filmmakers do not get away with themselves. Twenty-five years ago, when the first Star Wars was created, the world was different. The making of films was the playground of a few privileged and parodies were very rare. Then God gave us Hardware Wars. It was shot to look cheap (or was it just cheap?) And the audio was obviously recorded after the fact. Does this take away experience? HECK NO! That's what makes it so great! It was raw and unpolished, and relentlessly hit some of the most pretentious moments of the original film. From Fluke Starbucker waving a flashlight instead of a lightsaber (I did that when I was young!), Chewchilla the Wookie monster, to Auggie's "No, just a little headache" remark Ben Doggie, this short film is just as much part of the phenomenon as one of the real movies of Star Wars. To rent. Buy it. Borrow it from a friend. And let the Stuff be with you. Always.
