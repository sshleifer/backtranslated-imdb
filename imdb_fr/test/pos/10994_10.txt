We went to see Manna from Heaven, my husband, two friends, and we all enjoyed the movie. The characters are funny, the story is fun and looks so much like real life. I think that's what I liked the most: just to see something credible, no murders, no science fiction, just good entertainment. You can take your children or elderly parents without worrying. How many of them are more around !!
