One of the most significant quotes of the entire film is pronounced midway through the protagonist, Titta Di Girolamo, a mafia man in the midst of the mafia, a middle-aged, physically indescribable man from Salerno , in southern Italy. When we presented him at the beginning of the film, he has lived for ten years in an elegant but sterile hotel in the canton of Italian Switzerland. He runs a business that is only gradually introduced to us. While this crucial but apparently innocuous scene unfolds, employees of the Swiss bank who normally count the money of Di Girolamo tell him that he misses $ 10,000 in his usual suitcase full of very tight notes. On the news, he threatens discreetly but frosty the director of his bank, persuaded to want to close his account. In the meantime, he tells us, spectators, that when you bluff, you must bluff to the end without fear of being trapped or appear ridiculous. He says: you can not bluff for a moment, then halfway, tell the truth. Having finally done this - bluffing halfway and telling the truth, and having accepted the consequences of life and finally love - is exactly the reason for the beginning of Titta Di Girolamo's troubles. <br /> <br /> This initially unattractive character, a sullen, sullen and stubborn man on the verge of being 50 years old, does not even respond to the maids and waitresses who tell him hello and goodbye the viewer cares deeply. At one point in her life, Titta decides to feel worried about appearing "ridiculous". The first half of the film can be described as "slow" by some. It reveals the days and nights of Di Girolamo in this hotel at a deliberately disjointed rhythm, revealing seemingly banal and irrelevant details. However, scenes that seemed useless reveal how essential they are as this innovative and cleverly constructed film unfolds before your eyes. The existence of Titta Di Girolamo - the unimaginative, identityless and lifeless man, the unsympathetic character that you end up unexpectedly loving and feeling when you least expect to do it - also results in elegantly edited sequences and a very Interesting music (a Scottish band Boards of Canada has particularly distinguished itself). <br /> <br /> Never the contrast between the way Hollywood and Italy treat criminals more disagree than since the release of films such as The Conseguenze dell'Amore or The Imbalsamatore. Another interesting element was the way the film used the insomnia of the protagonist. The Conseguenze dell'Amore uses this condition to symbolize a deeper emotional malaise that has been sunk so deep into the darkness of the unconscious, it is almost impossible to identify its cause (if there is one). <br /> <br /> The young and friendly hotel waitress Sofia (played by Olivia Magnani, granddaughter of the legendary Anna) and the memory of Titta's best friend, a man he did not see for 20 years, unexpectedly. give a small window on life that Titta will eventually accept (albeit timidly at first) to look again. Although this has never been explicitly stated, the viewer KNOWS that for a man like Titta, accepting the consequences of love will have unimaginable consequences. A film without any scene of sex or violence, a film that unfolds in its time and that does not yield to the expectations of the viewer, The Conseguenze dell'Amore is an excellent representative of this small, discreet and discreet Renaissance that took place in Italian cinema since the decline of Cinecitt√† during the second half of the 70's. The world is waiting for Italy to produce more dishes in the manner of Il Postino, more Bella Bella movies ... forgetting to explore beautiful creations like The Conseguenze dell'Amore, The Imbalsamatore and others. Your loss, the world.
