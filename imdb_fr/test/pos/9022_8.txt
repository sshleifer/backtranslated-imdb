I love that movie. I just saw it for the first time about 10 hours ago and had to rewind it so my sister could watch it. This movie is so funny. There were two times that I laughed so hard that I was sore on the side. I did not expect to watch such a funny movie. I really wanted to see him only because Laura Fraser was involved. I saw it for the first time at Titus, which is also a great movie. <br /> <br /> As other critics have said, too many people expect a moving film. You are not going to get it. What you will get is humor, blindfolding and the chance to ask what exactly your partner would look like if you could create them. You may also wonder what it would be like to be stuck in the body of the opposite sex. <br /> <br /> A hilarious sequence implies that Justine first sees herself as a naked man. I cracked. <br /> <br /> I swear this movie is the most imaginative teen movie I've ever seen. created; as entertainment, no philosophy in motion. Do not forget this and you will have a good time watching Virtual Sexuality.
