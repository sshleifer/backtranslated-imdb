If you find that the first 30 minutes of this movie are so slow that you wonder why you are watching it, do not give up. Moreover, hearing the Danish language is a bit new for most North Americans, who do not see and hear a lot of Danish movies. Anyway, the film progresses better and the spectator is rewarded for his patience. <br /> <br /> As a fan of the movie "Out Of Africa", this film piqued my interest because it is based on a short novel by Isak Dinesen (Karen Blixen), the main character of this movie . <br /> <br /> The meal - Babette's feast - was amazing. I am not a chef, but I was impressed! The way in which the story is interpreted also varies, I suppose, depending on your reading and your position on religion. In the latter case, the way you interpret the definition of "legalism" can affect the way you interpret this story. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it's a good movie, but do not watch it if you're dieting. .
