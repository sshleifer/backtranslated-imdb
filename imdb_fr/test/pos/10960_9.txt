"Shadows" is often considered the film that revolutionized American independent cinema. Whether true or not, this is an undeniably important movie, whose influence can be traced back to Sundance's current fodder. Here is a film that discusses controversial topics of the day (including racism), and refuses to give easy answers and to show them in a manipulative way. In addition, he treats sex in a straightforward way that Hollywood would not have even discussed before "The Graduate". <br /> <br /> There remains the question of whether it is as powerful today as when it was first released. The answer is yes. While many important movies are hard to look at and date to today, "Shadows" retains every ounce of emotional resonance when viewed now. It deals with racism as a personal and not a political problem. It is therefore still relevant. In addition, it functions as an excellent time capsule, capturing the 1950s generation and the New York art scene like no other movie has ever seen. <br /> <br /> From the technical point of view, it is good that it is unequal. As a director, Cassavetes had not yet gained all his confidence and the jerky editing reflects the low budget of the film. Still, the story of the film remains powerful. Moreover, the game of actors, given the inexperience of distribution and improvised nature, is phenomenal. All around, the actors create realistic characters, who remain sympathetic despite their often unimportant actions. "Shadows" is absolutely mandatory for moviegoers. (9/10)
