The cult filmmaker Corbucci is the rarest of his thirteen spaghetti westerns (of which I only have left what I do what I do in the middle of the revolution [1972]) is the one I discovered recently via of "Stracult" by Marco Giusti "to guide; It is an atypically gloomy jewel in the style of the director's masterpiece, THE GREAT SILENCE (1968), with desolate snowy landscapes. <br /> <br Johnny Hallyday, Frenchman Elvis Presley, whom I saw for the first time in Jean-DETECTIVE by Luc Godard (1985) is a curious but very effective choice to play the famous anti-hero Hud (who, like The Man With No Name by Clint Eastwood in Sergio Leone's famous "Trilogy of Dollars" is equipped with sheet steel armor for protection), and I met Hallyday's beautiful daughter Laura Smet , at the Venice Film Festival in 2004, but I was distracted by the presence of his esteemed director Claude Gaston Moschin is another curious addition to the band (which performs much the same function as Frank Wolff in THE GREAT SILENCE), but performs well and plays awkwardly in front of a swimmer FranÃ§oise Fabian; The latter then plays the role of an avid nymphomaniac of the widow of a banker who seduces everyone in pursuit of its objectives. Sylvie Fennec has the other great female role of peasant supported by Hallyday and who, at one point, is inducted into Free Love by "hippie" Apache Gabriella Tavernese (with that in mind, it is interesting to note that the welcome movie of Fabian and Tavernese's nude episodes)! Incidentally, the anachronistic addition of a group of long-haired youths (who also practice smoking and revolutionary discourse) is a somewhat half-successful attempt at contemporary relevance ?? but all of this finally adds to the pleasure (besides, even the black maid wears an Afro hairstyle!). <br /> <br /> Mario Adorf, too, has a lot of fun with the small role of a Mexican larger than life A bandit nicknamed "El Diablo" ?? who keeps a young biographer by his side (an element that might have influenced Clint Eastwood's UNFORGIVEN) and, at one point, challenges Moschin the captive in a heartbreaking duel! That said, the film also contains a very unusual "death weapon" ?? Hallyday gets rid of an opponent by kicking him in the saloon's cash register! As always, the fantastic fist fights are accompanied by too emphatic sound effects. just as typical of the genre, however, the nostalgic score of Angelo Francesco Lavagnino is a major asset. In reality, the ambiguous ending is entirely in keeping with the generally dark tone of the film ?? after Fabian returned to the local population, the hippies (who had previously idolized Hud) suddenly opposed him when they were wounded and terrorized the city (forcing everyone into the street and without clothes)? ? Take up their challenge (they rush to the prospect of facing him!), Then leave the city, leaving Fennec behind. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, I acquired it by means of a good quality Widescreen print. in Italian but with credits in French and an occasional lapse of time? about a minute of screen time in all ?? in French language (where, apparently, the soundtrack was not available).
