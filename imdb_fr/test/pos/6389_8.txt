The psychopath (1973) A trip to the past. I saw this movie several years ago on an old black and white TV. The host of a children's show, Mr. Rabbey will avenge the brutal abuse that parents inflict on his children's fans. Mr. Rabbey (who seems to always lose him) finally breaks and decides to go hunting. Beware of bad parents because Mr. Rabbey is on the lookout! What happens next is priceless. However, trying to find this movie will be a chore. <br /> <br /> What makes this film remarkable is the fact that Joe "Maniac" Spinell made a short promotion for a movie based on it. In his unfinished film, he plays Mr. Robbie, a television viewer. a clown (who looks like an old-fashioned chubby, Edward James Olmos) who would avenge the abuse of his young fans by attacking their parents. Unfortunately, Mr. Spinell was never able to find the funds needed to complete the project. The film was going to be titled Maniac II: "Mr. Robbie". Rabbey or Robbie the similarities are too close for comfort. Rough enough for a P.G. movie. <br /> <br /> Recommended.
