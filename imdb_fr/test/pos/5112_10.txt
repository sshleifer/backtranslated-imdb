It's an excellent movie. I liked the film in several parts. This movie is very funny! Visit the Ernest Fun Club website at www.ernestfunclub.com. There are several movies such as: Ernest goes to camp, Ernest saves Christmas, Ernest goes to jail, Ernest to the army, Ernest goes to school, Ernest still rides Ernest Slam Dunk etc. I highly recommend them for family movies. Star Jim Varney is still trying to visit www.ernestfunclub.com What is Ernest's best film? In my opinion, there is actually 2 Ernest goes to the camp and Ernest goes to jail. So, if you've never seen Ernest P. Worrell, it's time to go see him. You will find it rather satisfying "no what do I mean"?
