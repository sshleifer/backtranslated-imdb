One of the best movies I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> The performance of Louis Jouvet is fantastic. It really fulfills its role and it is wonderful. He's such a good actor that you can not think of anyone else who could do his part. <br /> <br /> And Suzy Delair and Bernard Blier are good French, trying to defend themselves in the fight born of a murder ... <br /> <br /> The story is breathtaking and well built. You can feel the atmosphere of Paris at this time (around 1930-1940), between two wars ... The clubs, the old buildings, the neighbors. <br /> <br /> All this helps to make a good movie.
