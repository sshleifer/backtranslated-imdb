I really have nothing to add to all the other comments except the following: For me, the movie looked like a silent movie, slowly adapted to the sound. I guess the text panels containing the story reinforced that impression. Along the way, the actors were allowed to leave the play on stilts. Marguerite Churchill looks a lot like a typical heroine from the early silent movies at the beginning of the film, but in the end she allows finer expressions. Gus, the Swede ?, reminded me of the comic characters in Shakespeare's plays, and Windy seemed to me to be an early Donald Duck. Even if the dust of all wagons, horses and cattle masked the view, it must have looked like real settlers! It was also clear to me that many of these Indians had to be real and I did not detect any obvious racism against them. And John Wayne looks incredibly young! Becoming a true Wayne fan thanks to John Ford's trilogy of cavalry, and thinking that the stage coach was a first for Wayne, this film was a revelation. The plot is very simple, still reminding me of a silent movie, but the grain is really real! An amazing film, made with this technique and under these conditions in 1930.
