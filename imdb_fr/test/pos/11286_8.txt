Begotten is certainly an experience and experience out of the ordinary. The use of color is fascinating and sometimes frustrating. A LOT of what happens on the screen is incredibly difficult to understand. Your sight is either obscured by a sudden and bizarre change of colors and tones, annoying characters and random cuts in the sky. The sound is very captivating and a welcome addition. It really helps the nihilistic and desperate tone that stifles this movie. <br /> <br /> As far as Begotten is concerned, the theory of "rape of the environment and rebirth" seems to me quite accurate. But I would not spend a lot of time focusing on meaning, it's hardly important. It is clear that the director did not want to explain anything. It simply presents it as it is, and if you want to look for a meaning, it depends on you. <br /> <br /> Watching Begotten is definitely not a walk in the park, but I was captivated from the start. It's really like watching a person's worst nightmare. What we see is sometimes painful and very unpleasant, but there is a surreal dreamlike beauty. If you are an experimental art lover and have not seen Begotten yet, make it a priority. I doubt you'll ever forget it. I know I will not do it.
