One day someone defined the definition of an INTELLECTUAL as: "A person who can listen to" The William Tell Overture "without thinking about the LONE RANGER!" In this, we are totally in agreement! This would surely be a difficult task to accomplish, and that Leopold Stokowski, Arturo Toscanini or Leonard Bernstein would find it almost impossible to do. <br /> <br /> And in there, there is no shame. The radio and television series, as well as feature films, feature films, Syndicated Newspaper comics and comics, have all contributed to making "the masked man of the plains and his faithful Indian companion, Tonto" a a deeply ingrained element of our collective psyche and literary folklore. <br /> <br /> As with most legends, it all started gradually, starting with a series of radio plays written for local use in Detroit on the WXYZ radio station. The creator was a certain George W. Trendle and the main author of the series was Mr. Trendle's brother-in-law, Mr. Fran Striker. It was in 1933, when the ranger arrived for the first time in "The Plains of the Early American West!" The Lone Ranger, Tonto and the radio series have all successfully guided Americans from the onset of depression until the 1930s until the Second World War. But post-war has put the country at the heart of a veritable explosion of invention and technology. A new means of communication was ready behind the scenes, but it was not possible to move forward as Victory Day in Europe and Victory at Sea Day were reached. Once these have been accomplished and the world and America are ready to settle for both peace and prosperity. The "new technology" was, of course, it was TV! And we would probably need something other than "Roller Derby" and "Wrestling From Marigold Arena" to fill the broadcast hours. And while in the beginning, a TV channel knew nothing except the portrait of this Mohican leader (Test Pattern, Schultz!) Very quickly, the networks began to exploit their existing natural resources, their existing programming! Virtually all would be ready to adapt to the television screen. <br /> <br /> The people of Lone Ranger, Incorporated were very interested when producers Jack Chertok, Harry Poppe, Sherman Harris and Jack Wrather approached them all. an agreement to put The Masked Man and Tonto on television, as well as the radio. <br /> <br /> Immediately, they went to work and offered us the first season, which used the very long Radio diary. Dramas, all potentially adaptable to televised dramas. They performed the role of Clayton Moore, an excellent actor in many feature films and with a dozen years of experience. He had also worked in series on "Thrill Factory" of Republic Pictures, which would be an invaluable experience in the realization of "THE LONE RANGER". Regarded as his "faithful Indian companion" and his partner to bring justice to different parts of the border, we had an absolute perfection in the actor who supports the character, Jay Silverheels. Moore walked and was replaced by John Hart. After about a season, Mr. Moore was back - he had missed so much! Now, back to our story !! The first years of shooting gave the episodes an aspect and a sound of their own. They made good use of Narrator off-screen, which gave them an impression of authenticity and a remarkable individual series. The actors employed were all veterans of the films of the end of the silent period in the 1930s and 1940s. Many of them had been exclusively "Cowboy Movie" players. A good example of this is the cast of Glenn Strange (bartender Sam in "GUNSMOKE") as the gang leader, villain and murderer, Butch Cavandish. And it was the Cavendish Gang's Texas Rangers massacre that led to John Reid (who was allegedly killed along with the other Texas Rangers) as "LONE RANGER". <br /> <br /> In the casting, you will find many new and promising talents (then) in the casting. We see people like Phyllis Coates, Dwayne Hickman, Denver Pyle and others in the week-to-week cast. All this, as well as a constant call for fair play, justice and peace in a Western world. <br /> <br /> The last two seasons have brought great changes. The first was the use of color filming. It made no difference, because a color TV was still far away for our household. The second was a new series of musical themes and queues. (Other than the Rossini finale from "U NO Wutt!") New music has never been a big problem for us, because we preferred the titles of the "old radio". <br /> <br /> With this series and two feature films Made during this period, THE LONE RANGER (Warner Brothers, 1956) and THE LONE RANGER AND THE LOST CITY OF GOLD (United Artists, 1958), the character has been deeply and constantly marked by our identity as people, us, Americans!
