It's a funny, intelligent and realistic comedy in the sense that a 14-year-old actress tries to live her first love on vacation and a complex, sometimes amusing, sometimes touching relationship between a divorced father and his wife. Growing girl ... and how much a woman (not just Nicole, the teenager) can fetch the man she loves! I laughed a lot with this animated scenario that never lasts.
