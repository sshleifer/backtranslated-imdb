Three crazy couples, all six sober, mingle with a crazy search for stolen bank loot. <br /> <br /> This is an animated and hilarious comedy with the six stars - Charlie Ruggles & Mary Boland, WC Fields & Alison Skipworth, George Burns and Gracie Allen - all very committed to doing what they have the better done: have laughs. <br /> <br /> Ruggles & Boland make another of their appearances in the film as husband and wife - this time a little more in love than usual. They were a perfect team - she's the strident lioness, the nervous bunny - and they dominate most of the screen time here. From beginning to end, they are a delight. <br /> <br /> Burns & Allen continue their approach from the Vaudeville, perfect on the radio and eventually go on television, with George, the perpetual heterosexual & Gracie, the eternal idiot. In the film, she sometimes tends to go a little too far, but it is hard not to like it. His heart was obviously solid gold. <br /> <br /> While Skipworth receives a fairly brief treatment, only fragments of her formidable personality parade through her - Fields is in her element as an unsavory sheriff from Nuggetville, Nevada. Whether he explains how he got the nickname "Honest John" or spends the night looking for the missing moola, he's never less than wonderful. Best of all, he must perform all his classic pool routine, keeping it forever for grateful posterity. Finally, he performs the almost miraculous - he forces Gracie to shut up. <br /> <br /> Paramount was so happy with the success of SIX OF A KIND that he wanted to rush the main actors into another comedy. Only rejected fields. He felt he had now reached the point where he no longer needed to share a movie with other celebrity comics. The studio finally accepted and started the preparation of Fields' first feature film, YOU'RE TELLING ME (1934).
