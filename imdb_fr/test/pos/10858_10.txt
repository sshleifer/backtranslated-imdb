I think Andrew Davies did an admirable job in taking a beautiful book that imitates the rhythm and style of a Victorian novel and makes it a moving and entertaining film. I'm happy to have read (twice) the book first, which is generally the case for me. I know that you have to consider a novel and a film as different media and judge them accordingly. But, despite everything, it is often difficult to read the original text after the projection of the best pieces by a film. <br /> <br /> I realize that Davies is a very good adapter, but I would like the producers to have chosen a woman to write the script. Davies, as he admits in the commentary accompanying the film on DVD, wished in particular to emphasize the more scatological elements of the book. I certainly enjoyed these, on film as in the book. But Davies missed half a dozen moments so excruciatingly painful that he could incorporate if his sensitivity was more feminine. <br /> <br /> I would also like to challenge his use of the main symbol of the book, the rose. <br /> <br /> The Davies scenario was resolved and the outcome was inevitable and appropriate. But I really think that the last sign of author Waters at the symbol of the rose was much more interesting. And I preferred that the novel let Nan "become major" than what Davies had chosen. <br /> <br /> A quick comment on the four actors who play the main roles. They all have remarkable talent - well, aside from singing and dancing, perhaps - and, moreover, their physical presence is what the mind perceives when reading the novel before seeing the film. I thought they were all excellent. <br /> <br /> I recommend to all lesbians and all those who love good fiction to add the TIPPING THE VELVET book and DVD to their library.
