I saw this movie the same night that I saw 6 other shorts. He was ahead of the others in terms of acting, directing, filming and originality of the story. This comes with a professionalism that is often missing in short films. <br /> <br /> This is an excellent short film for the following reasons: <br /> <br /> 1. Amazing performances. The 2 actresses are convincing and credible instantly. Their chemistry is palpable; the depth of their relationship is communicated, even if the film lasts 10 minutes. The acting and the staging are very powerful. <br /> <br /> 2. Beautifully shot. The lighting, the framing and the general shooting are striking. The 35mm film distinguishes this film from other short films. And what a difference it makes. The filming is worthy of this film. <br /> <br /> 3. Strong story. Often shorts try to do too little or too much over time. Or they try to tell a predictable story. It's a good balance between you telling an interesting story, without writing it too long or leaving you unsatisfied. You wonder what will happen next, while having the feeling to see something happen. <br /> <br /> Beautiful note, too. Compliments without mastering. <br /> <br /> If you can find it at a festival, make an effort to see it.
