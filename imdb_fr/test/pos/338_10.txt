The director of Kannathil Muthamittal directed the first Indian movie I had seen "Dil Se", which led me to buy more than 122 DVDs in Hindi during the four months. I can say that I understood the total attraction. I was a bit puzzled as to why the movie would stop for "music videos". It was an excellent movie. I did not know what to do with dance and the female voices were a bit acute for my Western ears, but I found the score of AR Rahmen hypnotic. I bought the soundtrack the next day, then Lagan, Kuch Kuch Hota Hai and K3G the following week and, with the exception of "Ichi the killer <br />", some other Korean movies, I do not mind. look a lot more. It's a bit odd for someone who has watched only the rigorous regimes of Hong Kong, horror movies <br /> <br /> and action / science fiction for 30 years. <br /> <br /> But I should go back For Kannathil Muthamittal, this is one of the last efforts of Mani Ratman and I laughed, I cried, I became completely crazy, terrified and above all I did not feel manipulated. The acting was superb, the photography was beautiful, I think you can stop the film at any time and you will notice that any frame would be worthy of painting. The music is perfect for the film and after the credits <br />, I wanted to see my movie again ... so I did it. <br /> <br /> It would be foolish to talk about the plot with fear. that you can miss the pleasure of watching the events unfold and the characters grow. That's what a great movie is! I got up and applauded in my home cinema when it was finished! <br /> <br /> My wife is watching, and I can not wait to see her reaction, I can not expect it to be less than mine.
