Unfortunately, because of a slow start, I can not say it's one of Hitch's best movies. It's very good anyway. The film stars Jimmy Stewart and Doris Day as parents who are involved in a plot of political assassination and who must try to recover their kidnapped son. They both give excellent performances, not surprisingly. Really, however, I was very impressed by the incredible use of music by Hitchcock. The highlight at the Opera was fantastic, and using an orchestra to create music and suspense was a pure genius at the same time. An absolutely fantastic suspense came out of this scene. In addition, the song "That Will Be, Will Be" by Doris Day was excellent. Especially when it is transposed on scenes at the end of the film. So for me, this movie is the best use of music by Hitchcock that I know so far. Unfortunately, the beginning was slow, or I could have recommended this movie a bit more. Even then, it's always worth a look. 8 out of 10
