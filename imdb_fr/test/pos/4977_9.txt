It's the classic western. The good, Glenn Ford, the dashing hero, the ex-soldier, the man who would not want to hold a rifle. He must finally defend the evil baron of the land, Edward G. Robinson, who owns most of the valley and wants it all. Then there is Barbara Stanwyck, the true sovereign of the group. The wife of Edward G. Robinson, who will not let anyone interfere in his path, giving even Edward G. Robinson a weak look. She is so perverse that everyone pales before her blind ambition and ruthless control of the valley and all its occupants. The gleam in her eyes when she sees people face death for her is disconcerting. It is worth the wait. Add a young Brian Keith and a few others and you have a drama that stands alone. With the necessary kicks, shootings, ambushes and close-ups of straddling cowboys, you've got a hell of a western. Without revealing anything, there are enough meanders inside to make it a standard shoot-cow -up.
