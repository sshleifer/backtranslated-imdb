Wow! the French are really aware of it. If we watch their first film on Asterix, we see a beautiful story with good actors (especially thanks to Gerard Depardeu) but a very lame special effect. In a fantastic story like Asterix, the special effects are really important. Well .. they did it well this time! That's wonderful. Personally, I think Mission Cleopatra is the best Asterix story ever written. In the movie, you do not get bored for a moment. Go watch this! A thing! they did not go exactly by the script which, I think, is a little pitiful. For example, in the cartoon Obelix breaks the nose of the Sphinx, immediately all small traders begin to break the nose of their miniature Sphinx. (really funny to see) .. Well they did not put in the film, they rather buried the nose under the Sphinx. Asterix: "They will never look for him here" (guess again). Was funny but not as good as the original. Another thing that I disliked in the movie was their choice of music. The film was designed for children. But still ... it's a must C! <br /> <br /> Grz Da Jean Holland
