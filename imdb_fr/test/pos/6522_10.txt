Fred was such a sight. It was simple but somehow very addictive. I still remember the time when I watched it on Saturdays from Kids WB, but then Kids WB did the unpredictable. act "hip" and "funky fresh". * shudder * They became like this family member trying to act coolly, but this attempt is a real disaster. the most useless shows I've ever seen in my life (Johnny Test). The only thing that makes me keep watching KWB is the occasional crossings of old shows and anime on 4kids. That brings me back to my first point ... bring it back !!!
