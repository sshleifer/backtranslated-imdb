For the most part, I appreciate only the kind of film that makes it possible to escape the present time, the future or the past. This film is purely escape. The dance begins almost immediately, and Debra Paget in her bikini dress "purple harem" just does not match the film in my opinion. Her dance, although sensual, is surpassed by her dance in Fritz Lang's Tiger of Eschnapur, available on DVD, where she played the dancer of the Seetha temple. <br /> <br /> A problem with the film is its closed scenario. There are few outdoor scenes shot and they are, like others, a little claustrophobic. The same pitches are used again and again, but with some interesting secret passages and waterways. Her double secret identity is totally incredible with a beauty of this magnitude. Debra even brandishes a sword and holds two enemy soldiers at a distance on a staircase, she could do everything. <br /> <br /> What works is Debra Paget as a princess. With her beauty, she would certainly be the center of attention anywhere and at any time in history. This film, when we hope it will be available on DVD, will be a must buy. Overall, taken with a little humor, I loved it. <br /> <br />
