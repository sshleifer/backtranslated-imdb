A young theater actress reluctantly accepts her first major role in a play starring Lady Macbeth, due to the production diva incident that falls in front of a moving car. Betty (Christina Marsillach), who wins a great success, finds the horror. It's the person who brought her to this point, who is cruelly terrorizing her. <br /> <br /> Stefano (William McNamara) 's first friend is viciously stabbed with a knife as she watches him, tied by a rope to a pillar in his uncle's vast mansion, preventing her from closing her eyes with needles taped under her eyes, with a pungent result if she blinks her eyes. By allowing her to escape, Betty finds herself again in that unfortunate position when a gold chain is on her Lady Macbeth wardrobe, torn apart by the madman after killing a series of crows escaped from their cage in the equipment room. , by the clothing designer who is first hit on the ground by an iron, then stabbed by a pair of scissors (.. to crown this unpleasant scene, the chain falls in his throat, the killer to open Find it - without specifically elaborating this act, Dario uses the ripping sound of the scissors to achieve optimal effect, the camera often pulls back on the dead face of the victim). Having nowhere to go, inspector Alan Santini (Urbano Barberini, playing coldly and bland at the request of Dario) promises to catch the psychopath while Betty relies on his few friends to comfort himself, the director Marco (Ian Charleson, from GHANDI & CHARIOTS OF A sad footnote, Dario revealed in an interview that Charleson had informed him at the end of the filming that he was HIV-positive) attempting the scene after a successful career in the horror cinema despite the rejection of his critics Mira (Daria Nicolodi, former wife of Dario), his agent and confident. But the serial killer is quite motivated and a confrontation between them will of course occur in the theater because Marco has added an interesting change to the production using the crows at his disposal. <br /> <br /> I think that Dario is his wildest and nihilist. Although he certainly made some horrendous movies later (like his entries in Masters of Horror and that SLEEPLESS would suggest), this movie really raises the stakes of pure violence towards the victims of the psychopath. His method of forcing Betty to watch was certainly a gag of Dario about the type of audience that likes to look away from the most horrible parts of horror movies. I found myself rubbing my eyes every time she blinked (.. brilliantly, Dario pulls the sting of the point of view getting a tormenting effect from our point of view, as if we were the ones with taped needles holding eyes open). I love the way Dario will show Betty's wide-eyed, horrified by what she's forced to look at, as if little tears of blood ran down the needles when she had no choice but to blink . Ronnie Taylor's photographic work is impeccable, like the raven's point of view in the theater at the end while he searches for the murderer. Or, when the camera "travels" in the theaters after the murderer who wants to see his muse from a box seat. Or again, the sequence of dreams where Betty remembers an event about the death of her mother by a murderer, wearing the same mask and gloves as the one that caused her trauma at the moment. The highlight, in my opinion, is the sequence of peephole shots, dramatically staged by all involved as the camera followed a bullet through the victim's eyes, exploding from behind the camera. his head and crossing a phone use to call for help. We even have a raven pecking the killer's eyeball (to add to this vicious scene, the raven is shown with the eyeball rolling in its beak). The only thing I did not like, as the movie's opponents often point out, is the "final" end that I personally deemed unnecessary, but I guess Dario wanted to point out that Betty was actually not like her. mother, a woman with sadomasochistic tendencies who, in a jiffy, explains why the killer torments our heroine. The rock music used during the violent scenes did not bother me, because I felt that these moments of perverse graphic attacks required a deafening sound that heavy metal can often provide.
