This wonderful film has never failed to touch me. The color, the compelling distribution and the breathtaking landscapes all make a great contribution. This production, unlike Carlton's later remake, is more impressionistic and more from the point of view of children. He focuses on some episodes of E. Nesbit's charming story rather than trying to create a somewhat more documentary style of the "warts and everything" type adopted by Carlton. Above all, the beautiful musical score of the late Johnny Douglas underlies the story, adding an additional emotional depth. The end result is a truly formidable combination of sensory experiences that cumulatively presents the poignant story of "The Children of the Railways". <br /> <br /> An annoying factor for the viewer to ponder throughout this film is how things have changed since time - and in many ways, for the worse! Yes, maybe many of us no longer need to use outdoor toilets and travel in horse drawn carts, but what about the quality of life in general? Consider the rude celebrities who are now sleeping our television screens. Their language is now apparently considered perfectly acceptable. Consider also today's fragile "today" and "many" present-day "partnerships" as well as all single mothers - whatever the fate of this institution called "marriage", when people accepted the shortcomings of each but remained together. to love their children? These details add even more excitement to the visualization of this wonderful film. <br /> <br /> I hope that, over generations, children will continue to enjoy this film. Not to mention some adults!
