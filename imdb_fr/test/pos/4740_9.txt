There were many documentaries I saw in which it appeared that the law was on the wrong side of the fence - the Thin Blue Line and Paradise Lost come to mind in the first place. But this is the first movie that made me angry after seeing it. The evidence presented in this film makes it clear to me that what happened in Waco was at least an unprofessional and messy mess on the part of the FBI and AFI, and at worst an act of murder. Like most people, when Waco's siege took place, I assumed that David Koresh was a completely diabolical madman leading a violent cult. After seeing this, I think Koresh was more likely a slightly unbalanced and confused type who inadvertently drew the attention of the US government by his eccentric actions. Of course, there were a lot of weapons in the enclosure of the Davidian branch. But none of this was illegal. It was absolutely heartbreaking to see the video footage of the people inside the complex, who all seemed to be very nice and safe. And it was annoying to see the ruthless testimony of government forces officials at the Waco site, the baseless testimony of Janet Reno and the partisan defense of the Waco attack, a defense led by some members of the Democratic Committee. . The representative of New York City and the current American Senator of New York, Charles Schumer, were particularly close to my mind. I voted for this man when I lived in New York State - I am a democrat, quite left too. After seeing his actions on this committee, I wish I could go back in time and vote for D'Amato instead! For all those who are interested in the government, it is a crucial film, to see absolutely. I even think it should be shown in class - it's important.
