I liked this movie the first time I saw it. It gives such details about what news executives are going to do just to get a story out on the radio: Jane Craig urges Kenny to finish editing the song, and Joan Cusack struggles to get the story out. bring in, and William Hurt, who according to Jane commits an incredible violation of ethics, simulates her tears during her rape interview, which is a defect reported by Aaron. Another strong point is that Tom uses Jane for her own benefits, and then goes to sleep with Jennifer. The scenario is brilliant and the staging is almost as good. The three main actors were great in representing their characters, including Holly Hunter, and Albert Brooks, who is the funniest film. William Hurt is also very good. It deserved at least three Oscars, best actress (holly hunter), best supporting actress (Albert Brooks) and best picture. I enjoyed the last parts of the film where he shows them their meeting 7 years later. <br /> <br /> 8/10
