I think Dirty Dancing was a good movie, they tried to create another night Havana, which was good, but it was nothing. I would like to see another dirty dance with the same people. without them, I think it would be a mess. often, the movies are shot, and then, when they try to add, they start to change people and make the movies go down. I'd like to see Dirty Dance get another one to see what happened after they could be together. Patrick and Jennifer did so well together. this movie was made in 1997 its time to make another one. but this time, start where you left the same people.
