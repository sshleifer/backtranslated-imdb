After watching this film, it is not hard to understand why Soviet post-silent cinema is held in such uncritical esteem. Do not mistake yourself. Cranes fly is, for the first half at least, extremely entertaining, enjoying a lightness of touch quite unexpected from his country of origin; a fresh, lively and spacious technique that ends up irritating as much as it initially seduces; two superb subjective plays; and a romantic verve that flirts without ever tipping over the territory of Lelouch. It's just that, as part of its vast array of social, national, and global events related to a love affair, it's essentially no different from a conventional Hollywood movie. <br /> <br /> Of course, in a Soviet Union that puts the state in value above all, and at a time (World War II) that suppressed individualism and the freedom to defend a murderous symbolism, this highlight of two young attractive lovers is a relief. And the thematic similarities - both devouring war-torn love - with two of the most wonderful of all films (SEVENTH HEAVEN, THE UMBRELLAS OF CHERBOURG) add to its potential for sympathy. <br /> <br /> The story is simple. enough. Boris, a young worker from a brilliant family of doctors and artists, and Veronika, a student, have a night-time relationship at night, their only free time. Boris's cousin, Mark, also has his eyes on Veronika. When the Nazis invade Russia, Boris is secretly voluntary, to the chagrin of his family and his lover. He promises to write to Veronika, but never does, thinking that she may not have bothered to leave, or that the mail may not be reliable. Veronika's parents die in an air raid and she moves in with Boris's family, helping at the hospital where his father is caring for wounded soldiers. <br /> <br /> Afflicted by Boris' silence, Veronika is also besieged by the attentions of Mark, who obtained the exemption from military service by bribing a local official. She ends up being worn out and the wife, to the disapproval of her adoptive family. Boris, meanwhile, is killed in action. Veronika, disgusted with herself and an adulterous mark, refuses to believe him and waits for his return, welcoming a young orphan named after him. <br /> <br /> The title refers to the birds that the couple sees at the height of their love, perhaps symbolic of its transcendent, epiphanic power. But this is illusory - the cranes fly in V and this form pervades the whole film, through the geometric shapes of buildings, interiors, exteriors, groups of people, compositions, camera angles, the name of the Heroin - or during assembly in which feet walking to the southwest in one floor meet by feet walking to the southeast in another. <br /> <br /> This serves to fatally trap lovers who have no control over their fate and to suggest Stalinist power that is never specifically mentioned in the film. Even if they seem to be free in space, whether they are literally in an uninhabited environment or privileged in generous close-ups, they are always ironic, understated, torn apart - by circumstances, families, crowds (see brilliant, so obvious, sequences where Veronika is engulfed by tanks, or the couple can not meet in a huge crowd), or simply by the structure of the film, which constantly removes, by their parallelism, their proximity. Although in the beginning, the lightness and brightness of the style suggest a beautiful romantic idyll, it is constantly broken by strange modifications or distracting angles of view. <br /> What is most remarkable is how these blocks to love are realized by abstraction rather than by the emphasis on historical forces. The whole film, but especially the war itself, is strangely unreal and dreamlike, it never shows us its harsh and brutal actuality, but only its effects on lovers. In fact, it turns into a majestic show, devoid of bad Germans. <br /> <br /> At home, air raids create delightful effects of light and shadow, or ruins of almost Gothic decadence. In the bunker, the threat to the Soviet empire is less important than the perceived indifference of Boris. The empty and dreamlike spaces in Moscow that lovers initially loved, that Veronika and his mother are doing well, are less real places than emotional spaces. <br /> <br /> When Mark tries to impose himself on Veronika, the air raid is less a destructive reality than a symbolic release of sexual and emotional frustrations. It is a brilliant sequence, filmed with a silent expressionist terror, in which the screen seems to burst with hysteria and violence, all the more convincing for the melancholy sweetness of the previous scenes. <br /> It's not much different from the front either, where girls' struggles for honor are more urgent than tactics, Nazis or desperation. The movement of Boris and his wounded comrade in a last space is an additional summary of the experience of the war, its installation in a forest giving it a sexual dynamic; and Boris's last flashback before death is an extraordinary blend of dream fulfillment and anxiety, in which what is desired becomes threatening and grotesque. From there, the film becomes a little less interesting, slightly more obvious. Another seizure for Expressionist overload - Veronika's suicide attempt and rescue of the baby - is poorly managed; and his dark guilt casts a paralyzing shadow over the whole film. The use of a deep focus, at first ravishing, soon begins to wear out, devoid of any moral force or sense given by Welles to its use in CITIZEN KANE. After what seems a sly criticism of totalitarianism in favor of the individual is cruelly betrayed in the end, when the individual suffering, as is often the case in Russian art, is metamorphosed into symbolic hope (ie -say asexual, dehumanized). Pity.
