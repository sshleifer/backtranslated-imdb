We are in the 1980s and teens are ready to party in a scary old house that would have been haunted by the ghost of Murder McGee. After mistakenly talking about the dead through an unfinished conversation on a Ouija board, children are forced to fight to the death by fighting an avenging ghost who owns and kills all their friends, one by one. Sounds familiar? It's supposed to. It is clearly marketed to pay homage to the classic slashers of the 80s with the slogan: "Excessive Violence, Free Nudity, Zero Budget." <br /> <br /> I can not get enough; It's pure entertainment! I enjoyed the humor and the way he made fun of all the horror clich√©s, but at the same time, I adopted what was fun in the movies of that time. There is something you get with this film that you never had with the old slasher films of the 80s: a good acting game. The entire cast was very talented and we do not see much in low budget movies, recent or otherwise. There was a lot of chemistry between the characters. I have been very entertained throughout the film, and I am quite convinced that the writer / director and casting will play a key role in their careers. The scenario was very well written and the dialogue was going naturally. <br /> <br /> The effects were a bit amateurish and the scenes were not well lit, but the fact that this film was allowed on its cover was practically BUDGET FREE. I already know what's going on. This film explains that it is simple to politely ignore one's mistakes, to sit down and enjoy. Although it is not an Oscar-winning opus, it never claims to be and is the medium. This is very fun. If you like slashers, you will really enjoy this movie. If you love blood and fools, you will enjoy it too.
