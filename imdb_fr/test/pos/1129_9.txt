I watched two episodes so far, I really like it. Even if I'm no longer in college, it makes me miss the wonderful university life. I wish I had spent more time socializing. I identify with rusty instead. When I rushed into a fraternity, my big brother was not at all like Cappie, I would like to have a big brother like him. So, if such a show can get people to identify with the characters, it's a very good show. <br /> <br /> It's more realistic than the American pie with less explicit sexual jokes. Can we also call it a younger version of "desperate women"? some of the writers must be Greeks themselves, the story seems to reflect a little the real life of fraternity and sorority. It was shot in high definition. And they actually filmed outside rather than in studios. so the quality of the image is very good. They could easily make a good movie. Unlike a film that only lasts a few hours, I can spend about 45 minutes of pleasure watching it for free on TV every week. <br /> <br /> The cast is excellent, the actors are about the right age and they are new and fresh, which makes them more real. This show is about everyone. There are also Asian and black boys and sorority girls in the series. It's almost shocking that they have a little story about two guys from the brotherhood who had sex during the first episode and then tried to find themselves in the second episode. I do not think I've seen anything like it on TV yet. This show had kind of reminded me of the television show of a Warner teenager called "Young Americans" that was canceled in early 2001. In this show, a girl dressed as a man kissed a man and this guy was thinking that she was homosexual. <br /> <br /> Greek life can be fun, but at the same time, students have to take exams, etc. at a time when people do have some free time in their lives, there is no sisterhood fraternity to allow them to associate more. I do not know how long this show will last. Sooner or later, these people will also have to "graduate" in college. Maybe they will find new actors for another 4 years of fun college life!
