Buddy Manucci (Roy Scheider, strong in a role of potential) is at the head of a secret police secret brigade called The Seven-Ups, whose tactics do not necessarily follow the rules of law. They do the work in their own way without any disclosure to the press, giving them the freedom to expand their means of communication with the most active criminals of detectives and police, who simply can not nab. Buddy has a friend from his childhood called Vito (Tony Lo Bianco) who shares with him information about the types of Mafiosi and the disturbances on the streets of New York. What Buddy does not know is that Vito is developing a schema using names from Buddy's "checklist" (this book is open, he takes notes provided by Vito, but he does not know that his friend has copied those same names written in his list (the mind) to install mob families in a series of money-generating gang kidnappings, thanks to two cop cops, Moon (the always naughty Richard Lynch) and Bo (Bill Hickman) working with him. When this scheme goes wrong and one of the Seven-Ups is killed, Vito becomes fearful, because he knows what Buddy can be when he strikes someone ... especially when one of his family is murdered. <br /> <br /> A little-known crime movie passionately pursues his car chase through New York City as Buddy watches the kidnapping of an impostor of cops trying to catch him after killing his partner. The film is not too complex once the plot is prepared and we realize who is the leader of the gangsters' plots. Scheider has never received the credit he deserves as a major actor. He has an emotional impact and we see how much his policeman and his friend get bored. The film is punctuated by good action sequences and staged an interesting plot of betrayal between friends, while greed comes before this childhood friendship and what seems like a simple series of crimes against families of the perversity can be killed.
