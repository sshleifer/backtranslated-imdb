This work is quite atmospheric, with some surprises some really scary items. I found this work more rewarding than I thought at first, given the rotten reviews it gets here at IMDb. The dialogue seems natural and honest (given the circumstances), although the film's progression from predictable to cliché, the heroines falling as they should run and investigating strange noises to close their doors. Typical price of a horror movie. <br /> <br /> Local characters are among the worst clichés, describing Appalachian natives as monsters suffering from developmental delay. The children's characters and directors are great! The development given is adequate, and Scout Taylor-Compton seems to develop his talents quite well. <br /> <br /> Now, I'm not going to say that this is totally original or the best thing since sliced ​​bread (By the way, that's not very good by the way), but that's interesting and I do not wait to return for my 107 minutes. I would not say it's a fantastic movie, but there are some very good horror here. But there are also really slow places where the development of the plot and the characters seems superfluous according to the whim of the director (or the editor of the film). <br /> <br /> All in all, it's good for a rainy night, but not so good for a Friday or Saturday night. <br /> <br /> He scores 7.6 / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> the Fiend :.
