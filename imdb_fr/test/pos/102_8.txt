Although Bullet In The Brain is unquestionably superior among short films, it seems more like a short writing than a movie. And it is a bit difficult to feel too sorry for the teacher when his intelligent remarks make him shoot. But after the bullet has entered his brain, we begin to understand a little why he has become so jaded with life. This rather short film contains a tremendous amount of detail and that makes me feel like it should have been extended a little longer - it seems to me that there is almost too much to do at the same time, so quick. A slightly more relaxed rhythm and a less poetic narrator in the last section would have benefited this film a little. Despite these complaints, it is clear that Bullet In The Brain is a pretty prodigious work compared to many short and even feature films. The filmmakers must be commended for trying to make such emotional and literary film in the current climate of fast-paced jokes and Hollywood action.
