"Sister Helen" is a superb documentary about a rigid, intolerant, bitter-faced, bitter (civil) nun who runs a drug and alcohol shelter in a very dilapidated neighborhood in the South Bronx. All residents except one are drunkards / drug addicts. Robert, the only representative of the middle class ?? he had a real job, a house and even a BMW ?? regret that she died before he could talk to her. Why? <br /> <br /> Robert, like six of the residents, was on parole. He complained that Helen was wielding a huge stick at him and constantly threatened to denounce him if he did not tow her. In an "extra" interview, he said that Helen ran the center to compensate for the deaths of the three men in her life ?? her husband and two boys. <br /> <br /> The husband was an alcoholic who died of a heart attack at 55 years old. One boy died of an heroin overdose and the other was stabbed when he was 15 years old. Helen left a girl she abandoned. head the center. The girl was not happy. She wanted her mother <br /> <br /> What's fascinating is Helen's little change. Externally, it seems that she has made a huge change. But after watching this fascinating and disturbing video several times - once with the directors in storytelling - it became clear that Helen replaced 21 male addicts to replace her three dead men. <br /> <br /> Helen admits that she ignored her children and spent every day in bars. But his control, his intolerance and his sharp tongue did not appear at 56 years. Living with her had to be extremely difficult. Even Robert says he stayed clean despite Helen. <br /> <br /> The film begins with Helen who abusively belittles a man who wants to live in the shelter. Supposedly, she shows her sense of the street. Another time, she publicly disparages Mel, his "assistant" for not having taken a bath for a year. Then she waves her dirty pillowcase in the air. The movie is slimy with Helen threatening and humiliating people. His flagship song is "My Way". His favorite phrase is, "I will be totally honest with you." Often, people who use such expressions turn out to be the opposite. <br /> <br /> The inhabitants are really depressed. Only Robert has marketable skills other than pushing a broom. They all desperately need a roof, and Helen, since she manages the place herself, has the power to admit or expel anyone she likes. It does not have a governing board and receives no public funding. It's his show. <br /> <br /> Helen believes in the cookie approach to sobriety. She stopped drinking cold turkey and that means everyone can do it too. It attributes drug addiction to drugs or alcohol, not to the underlying problems that drove men to drink and use drugs. She is not a therapist, but a hostess who dyes her hair, has a habit, exercises absolute power over her tenants and has stopped drinking. <br /> <br /> Helen also controls her inmates by demanding urine tests (which she calls this). A two-time major, a long-time, very strong and respected resident - whom she trusted - failed her tests. Helen was furious and expelled him. The major maintained his ground and said the results were wrong because he never made heroin. Helen did not give in and failed to consider that an error could have been made. This was particularly troubling as she had known Major for a long time. Yet she ignored his relationship with him, assumed that he was a liar and totally relied on the results. Major finally discovered that the codeine in his cough syrup was an opiate. Helen never apologized publicly, but pretended to be makeup in private. <br /> <br /> Helen also had a stained reputation in her old neighborhood. She tacitly admitted to Robert that she had been up late one night to cut someone's tires. The person hurt him and certainly deserved to be cut off. She was not a nice woman. So finally, she decided to keep only the name of Travis (her last name) alive ?? since the death of the three male Travis ?? was to start the Travis Center. <br /> <br /> It was a good deal for some residents. They complied with Helen and received in exchange an inexpensive, safe, sober and structured place to live. One, however, said he preferred prison. Drug addicts and drunkards do not all need to be treated like children. Helen used "old school" techniques that have been discredited. However, no one was forced to stay in the center and for some it was really a positive experience. The Travis Center is not a treatment center. It's a residence for alcoholics and doping people who want to put everything in order in their lives. <br /> <br /> To receive the full Sister Helen experience, check out all the additional interviews, as well as the audio version in which the two directors share their experience of the life of Sister Helen and her guests.
