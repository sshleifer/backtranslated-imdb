Not knowing much about the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, I can only look at this as entertainment. I started watching it too late in the evening (recorded on BBC2 earlier this year), but once I started, I had to look all the way through. <br /> <br /> The downside is that this is an audience drama - never my favorite genre - but it's amazingly photographed (mostly in super-saturated ochres) and good game. Like a good novel, I could not lower it. Throughout my career, I wanted to watch it at the cinema to do justice to music and photography. What happened to his theatrical release? I've been an admirer of Chiwetel Ejiofor since I saw her in Dirty Pretty Things, and Hilary Swank looks great in this respect - very feminine and sexy to change (maybe not in her place, but she adds to the visual appeal of the film). <br /> <br /> This image deserves a larger audience than it seems to get.
