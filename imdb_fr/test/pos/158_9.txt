Thirst <br /> <br /> I found that this movie was beautifully designed. Cinematography was much better than excellent. I thought almost any frame could be frozen and you would have an exquisite picture yourself. The use of color stands out the most. In many cases, the camera slid across the stage and the work was flawless. <br /> <br /> The management of Park Chan Wook was fantastic. He made me believe firmly in his world of being far-fetched. There were several touches of visual and visual humor (of a dark nature) that simply added another depth to the image as a whole. <br /> <br /> The game of actors that I would not call exceptional, but it suited the film and worked well. enough. <br /> <br /> For me, the only place where this movie was missing was in the story. Sometimes I will not lie, the comings and goings between characters just do not make sense. Sometimes the story was clumsy. Overall, I was disappointed by the moderate storytelling, and I felt it lasted a bit too long. <br /> <br /> But I still recommend this film, for its vision, its visual brilliance, its dark humor At the end of the day, it is an interesting film, even imperfect. 9/10
