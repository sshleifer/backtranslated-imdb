Thanks to the kindness of a fellow member of IMDb, I just watched this film for the second time in almost twenty years and I can honestly say that it has not lost any of its effectiveness. I can not believe that Channel 4 let it disappear without a trace, because it is an extremely powerful, emotional and moralistic take on the consequences of misplaced loyalty. <br /> <br /> It focuses on a clique of friends over a period of ten years and their relationship with two "strangers" of the school; especially how they use one and torment the other without mercy. As the events of the past and present unfold, the tension gradually thickens, similar to Shane Meadows' excellent Dead Man's Shoes. The acting, the writing and the direction are very audacious for 1983 and still make a hard blow today despite the higher accents of the central characters. Yes, it can be organized in a public school, but that's all except what Merchant Ivory has published; I had a public education and I can always draw countless parables from history. <br /> <br /> It's a movie you'll remember for a long time, except you probably will not see it because Channel 4 (or FilmFour) chose to bury it. On their own official website, they describe it as "an inexplicably neglected jewel of the Channel 4 debut" - neglected by whom? This is one of the very first Channel 4 films (which will later become FilmFour thanks to the success of films such as Trainspotting). Somehow, the teacher must still be printed. In these days when you can get collector DVDs more or less complete, it is a bit gloomy not to be able to give a film as good promotion as it deserves. <br /> <br /> If any of the crazy Channel 4 production reads this, stop doing programs featuring people who humble themselves in the hope of concluding a contract-tabloid, look for this movie and organize a nice birthday special edition disc or something, please!
