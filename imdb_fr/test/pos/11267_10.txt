I had the pleasure of seeing Saltimbanco live before seeing the video version of the show. While nothing compares to reality, the video's authors have captured the flavor, feel, feel and more. The wonderful performances of the amazing troupe of Saltimbanco are beautifully captured. The video flows as well and cleverly as the production itself. A wonderful experience.
