I think Gerard's comments on the doc have been hit to the extreme. Interesting film, but very long. This is certainly the antithesis of the new school of flashy, sexy and Moore style docs. There is no narrator, no facts or secondary information interlaced, and no other gadgets. What you see is what you get - a glimpse of the world disappearing from the Tibetan people. As a great lover of documentaries, I was surprised how much I lost the attention with this film, especially because of the length and lack of dialogue. In the end, I would recommend it if the subject seems interesting to you. It is beautifully filmed, informative and offers a valuable (and accurate) window into the lifestyle of Tibetan salt merchants (and women :) - all important attributes of a good doc. But put a big pot of coffee, it'll help.
