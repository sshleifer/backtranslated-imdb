The eighties produced many little bloody horror movies, most of them falling under the sub-genre slasher, thus giving this movie a head start over most others. Night of the Demons is a kind of cross between the ultimate gore movie, The Evil Dead; and haunted home movie-cum-slash Hell Night. Movies like this usually have a crazy / distorted fool as the main villain; but here we have demons thirsting for blood, which is always more interesting than a madman, if you ask me. There is also a lot of comedy in this film, and the first third of the film could easily serve as a backdrop for a simple comedy film. But once the characters enter the central location; an ominous funeral home known as 'Hull House' - the movie turns into a horror movie that you would expect to see as the title. The plot is as simple as you'd like and we follow a group of kids who decide to hold a Halloween party inside the funeral home. This turns out to be a bad idea, however, once it appears that the house is owned; and the demons begin to inhabit the bodies of the children! Their only salvation lies on the other side of the subterranean stream ... but finding the gateway to the property is not as easy as it sounds. <br /> <br /> The centerpiece of the film is the Gothic mansion where the action takes place. This creaky old house is an excellent filming location for horror films; the fact that it is a funeral home only adds to that. The director, Kevin Tenney, is shooting well on the house and it is particularly effective to see that the house is in the middle of nowhere and that the escape is difficult. The comedy at the beginning of the film is usually very funny, and I hoped it would keep laughing once the horror started. The film has its comedy moments when kids enter Hull House, but it's never too funny and it's obvious that horror is the main focus of the movie. Not that it is a problem; but the night of the demons could have been much better if it had correctly merged these elements. The characters are pretty much what you expect from this type of movie; but the acting is well suited to the film, and it is clear that the young actors had a lot of fun making this film and that it translates well on the screen. The effects are good in that they are well suited to the film and that most of the death sequences are well executed; it's a safe bet that most people will not be bored watching this. This is not a classic film or must-see; but I can highly recommend it because it offers a good time and will please fans of stupid fodder for the horror.
