"Curse of Monkey Island" is a treasure; In my opinion, the series as a whole was the holy grail of the adventure game, not to mention LucasArts. <br /> <br /> But back to "Curse", which is nice about CMI is that he is not afraid to be himself. It deviates from the first two but remains faithful to the productions of Ron Gilbert (if we could say as much of the fourth installment of the series!). The vocal work is flawless, Dominic Armato playing our favorite protagonist, Guybrush Threepwood. The animation, although very different from the classic pixilated characters, is beautifully done. It's really absolutely beautiful. And the music is fantastic! It's never boring and you never feel like turning it off. <br /> <br /> Although I'm not a big fan of romance, romantic scenes and themes are not at all irresistible. They also have the rare ability to be sweet instead of cheese. That says a lot about a girl who falls asleep regularly when she plays with girls. <br /> <br /> The classic element of MI humor is of course that one. CMI is quite capable of delivering impassive lines, a humor absolutely absurd and just fun. Gary Coleman debuts as a budding young entrepreneur and world events go unobtrusively without leaving the game. <br /> <br /> It's not quite right to compare CMI to MI and MI2 is in a kingdom apart. Personally, I can never find a favorite between the 3 because they are all very different from each other. However, if you want to have a good time with the flair of the classic series, I insist that you give a chance to this game. You will NOT be disappointed. <br /> <br /> 10/10 stars, hands down. <br /> <br /> - Emily N
