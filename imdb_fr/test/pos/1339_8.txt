It is a difficult film to review because several factors must be taken into account. Let's filter out the most judgment ... Ok, are you interested in the facts about Jeffrey Dahmer's serial killer? Can you support a low-budget independent film? Are you objective enough to NOT hate a movie just because of its lack of stars or its professional appearance? Well, if you said yes, then you should have an open mind to handle this one. This film is an almost 100% accurate dramatization of Dahmer's adult life and murderous frenzy, and is described as an autobiography. It is not a glamorous, unrealistic story that the theatrical film "Dahmer" (2001) has unfortunately been. The film begins with Dahmer, played quite convincingly by Carl Crew, sitting in the police car as they search his apartment. His reflections on what brought him there are presented to us in a narrative narrative style that accurately explains much of Dahmer's psychosis and motivations that led him to commit murder nearly 20 times. We get to know the character, both on the sneaky side and on the side that has been pretty close to a normal life. It's not anyone's fault other than Dahmer's that 17 people died, but as a criminal psychology student, I was delighted to see more than his animalistic side represented, to tell the truth , in this film. You see him having a love affair with his grandmother while trying to find a company, but of course, we are witnessing his side that everyone remembers. It should be noted that there is little on-screen violence, with much of this violence suggesting shots such as splashing blood or a body hit by a fuzzy curtain. You remember two deaths I remember, one being a pretty bloody cut in the throat and the other a pushed man living in a barrel of acid. Although you do not see anything graphic, this cruelty and the convincing game of Crew and his victim make it a disturbing scene. And even if the screen mutilation remains low, you will see the results. There is a hand and a head or two, but it seems that it would bother the viewer and does not seem to exploit. In addition, these fake anatomical pieces are those where budget limits are visible. Although acceptable, they look pretty fake not to be too disturbing. The film actually ends before Dahmer's death in 1994, due to its release a year or two ago. That's about the only big difference with reality, and the information that remains is, as I said, very accurate. The quality of the film could be better, the dialogue is often a little too quiet and the game of several characters is a bit heavy, but it is not excessive. In my opinion, this is an imperfect but honest and serious look at one of the most memorable serial killers in the United States. I think I can say that the film is also memorable, and I respect it for overcoming its limits to tell the story in a credible way, helped by an excellent Carl Crew, as Dahmer.
