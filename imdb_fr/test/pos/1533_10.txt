I am deeply grateful to have seen this film. The acting is astonishing, the film itself is powerful and clear, and the issues at stake are treated with subtlety and depth. <br /> <br /> This is an important film. It could be profoundly transformative. <br /> <br /> I would never spend a lot of money to see him again. Because it's * so * good and complex, it's extremely hard to watch. I admit that my tastes in the cinema tend strongly towards light entertainment; the visual medium can be so powerful that I tend to avoid it for all that is really important. Those of you who have more courage than I will find that it is easier to manage. <br /> <br /> But I strongly encourage people to see him at least once. Preferably with others, so you can talk to you and have someone around you to remind you that there is not only the movie in the world.
