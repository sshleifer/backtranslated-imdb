I just wanted to say that when I was young, my favorite TV show in the day was the night heat. I loved the characters and the plot of the show. I thought it was an excellent show and I'm still doing it today. I like to watch reruns and I am a big fan. I like how characters play against each other. I would always stay up late to watch my favorite show with my mother who was also a big fan. Now I can watch my show again and listen to the theme. What I thought was a great song for the show. My favorite characters were Scott Hylands and Jeff Wincott.
