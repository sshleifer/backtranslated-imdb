A political satire of a comedian (Williams) who, after dissecting political campaigns and presidents, is forced to run. But shocking, we win and ridicule the office. "Man of the year" is not the funniest film or the best, but in small doses, it works. Williams teamed again with Levinson after a hit with "Good Morning, Vietnam". Both seem to have great chemistry and work on each other. I do not compare them to Scorsese and DeNiro, but you can get the chart. Although I do not want to say to rush to see the movie in cinemas, I would recommend renting it. This film is a comedy but also has a great satire, please, if you like movies like "Scary Movie 4", it's not for you, take your brain with you to see it. - ***
