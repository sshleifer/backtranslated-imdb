I saw a lot of movies and it completely upset me. The trauma, the suspense is just amazing. I ended up so enraged in the psychological fear and philosophy of it, and linking it to reality. The movies that play and challenge your mind are movies you do not forget, the ones that make you doubt your reality. A problem could be the quality, but it does not affect the essence of the film. <br /> <br /> The idea itself is brilliant and the end leaves you completely shocked and with the question to look for. the answer. I totally loved it! So many clues, contractions and puzzles. One of the best movies of all time, hands down.
