Hunt for Justice concerns the organization of Slobadon Milosevic for his trial in The Hague. Although the presentation was a little too clinical, the subject could have become very depressing very quickly. Louise Arbor, a Canadian judge, becomes chief prosecutor for war crimes at the United Nations International Criminal Tribunal in Yugoslavia. She is fighting for everyone to find the evidence that led Milosevic to trial. This is not a bad docu-drama with class A management and production work. The "evidence" was troubling by the shearing discussion of the facts. Fortunately, they did not go into too much detail and no real picture of the tortured.
