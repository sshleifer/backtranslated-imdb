Although video technology is out of date, this classic piece of music, now on DVD, is the best version of Sondheim's largest and most refined work on Broadway. If you have never seen SWEENEY TODD, you have to buy this DVD. I saw this production in November 1980 at the Kennedy Center in Washington - and I fell in love with Angela Lansbury, an old "Murder she wrote". Subsequently, I tried to find all his work among which: FILMS: "The Harvey Girls", "The Picture of Dorian Gray", "Candidate Manchurian"; CD: "Mame", "Dear World" and "Gypsy"; and much more. The rest of the cast is flawless, too. In the end, this beautiful DVD gives us the final version of the opera Sondheim!
