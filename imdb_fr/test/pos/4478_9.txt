My opinions do not go with the majority in most cases. I tend to lean towards the artistic, imaginative and different direction. This film was reminiscent of Frances Ford's "The Black Stallion," in which an imaginary situation is created to showcase the beauty of a magnificent creature that is hard to see playing at its peak, except on these multitudes of documentaries Natural. Unlike these nature-based films, this offer uses the industry's best filming techniques for a diva, creating one of the most sensual super stars (the cat) on the screen. <br /> <br /> This fantasy illustrates the love relationship that develops between a French soldier (he is very nice too) lost in the Egyptian desert and a female leopard he meets when he has the opportunity to fall on an abandoned Egyptian temple is fascinating. I bought it wholeheartedly. If you are a little open to fantasy and enjoy the grace, beauty, power and sensuality of the feline, you should enjoy it. <br /> <br /> The only flaw in my book is the end. It was a perfect fit for a Romeo and Juliet finale - it would have won me over. <br /> <br />
