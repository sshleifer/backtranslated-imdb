This film is a powerful illustration of the struggle of two women in love in a culture deeply rooted in ritual and tradition. All this in the context of an India struggling to free itself from these same values. This film is both political and personal and is never too preachy or idealistic on both sides. It is easy to understand why "the fire" provoked riots in India, but nevertheless tragic. A true film like this deserves to be seen by all the peoples of the world, not only by the privileged Westerners.
