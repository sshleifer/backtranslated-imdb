Director John Schlesinger's frenetic and tense film tells the true story of Christopher Boyce and Andrew Daulton Lee, two young men who sold US government secrets to the Soviet Union in the early 1970s. br /> <br /> Timothy Hutton plays Christopher Boyce very competently. He is a young man very disappointed by the CIA's underhand activities in Allied Australia. Sean Penn, Andrew Daulton Lee, the anti-doping drug addict, is outstanding. <br /> <br /> The competent and professional management of Schlesinger, accompanied by very good actors, make "The Falcon and the Snowman" an espionage thriller not to be missed. <br /> <br /> Tuesday 4 February 1992 - Video
