I gave 9 points out of 10. I was sitting in tears for most of the movie, because I had to laugh! <br /> <br /> The story was certainly not great, but it was not boring either. Erkan & Stefan's mission is to become bodyguards for the beautiful Nina. While doing this work, they are located between the "front lines" of the BND and the CIA. Of course, both are neither bodyguards nor gentlemen, so they run from one disaster to another; and they do it in such a fun way that when you look at scenes, you will not be able to stop your tears! As actors, these two characters "who smile stupidly" are doing rather well, better than some so-called professionals. <br /> <br /> Do you think that the speech of the two heroes is a curiosity or a "foreign nickname"? Well, if you hear a lot of Turkish-Germans in Munich talking exactly like them, you will remember Erkan & Stefan. And maybe in 10 years it would have become the common speech of young people. (God preserve us!) <br /> <br /> So, if you like to laugh, watch this movie!
