The big champion is a bit old fashioned at first sight. Andrew Morton at Fort Worth Star Telegram said it was better "If Walt Disney was from Texas, he would have been the big champion" <br /> <br /> The film does not contain video and special effects, but he has soul. The kids are great and the number of stars is amazing. I bet Bruce Willis and Julia Roberts are proud to be in a movie that their kids can really see :) (G rated) <br /> <br /> It's a masterfully crafted "little" movie, made in Texas by Texas Barry Tubb. Take your children, bring your friends with your children, take Grandma too ... they will all enjoy it and you too.
