It is a classic continuation of Bleu, the film also excellent, with Juliet Binouche in the main star. Plus, she's a cameo appearance here, in Red, just a second at the end. But this film, really red and very sweet although very sad, is a real winner. The main heroine, played by the great Irene Jakob, is a successful fashion / photo model. She leads a full and active life, darkened by her traumatic relationships with her strange friend Mike, who is in England. Fortunately, she befriends the old judge, who spends time listening to private phone conversations with her neighbors. The story begins to weave even further and we see it in court, almost universally condemned for his hobby. She is the only one to feel sympathy for him, her pretty dog ​​Rita and her puppies, as well as for all the people around her. We are also witnessing the bursting of a happy couple composed of a young lawyer and his wife, and their argument is also fueled by this telephone scandal ... But the film does not even talk about that. It is mainly about loneliness and deep divisions between peoples, far and near. When she goes to England on a ferry, with the lawyer as an occasional co-passenger, as well as the one mentioned earlier, Binoche who played in Blue, the ship sinks and we see the horrified look of the judge when he looks at the guess if she survived. She did it and we still have a heavy heart. Mr. Kislowski has managed to draw a great and subtle story about loneliness, misunderstanding, secrets and pain. Deep and dark personal pain of those who are lost and alone. Shiny film.
