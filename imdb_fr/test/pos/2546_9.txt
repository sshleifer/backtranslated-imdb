It's one of those movies when you look at it, you wonder if it's a documentary or a fiction. After the movie, Ramin Bahrani answered many questions and we learned that the movie had a script. <br /> <br /> Bahrani's camera is dumb, it is not judgmental, it almost erases the director of the film by purpose, the background is not organized to make the picture pretty, but not do not get me wrong; there is a lot of preparation for this film. From the environment, be part of the environment, be ignored when you film. <br /> <br /> The main character is a "real" actor in every sense of the word. <br /> <br /> I would like to thank the entire team for this film, showing us another country within New York. I strongly suggest it if you like the stories of others. <br /> <br /> Bora Kizilirmak
