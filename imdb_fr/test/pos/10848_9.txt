This BBC series is incredibly fun. I had only seen a few minutes before knowing that I had to own it and watch it again with all my friends. I would not recommend it to anyone, but almost everyone will enjoy it - from the snobbish of cinema to thirsty crowds of entertainment. The main character is a lesbian, but it's always worth watching if it's not your thing. <br /> <br /> Rachael Stirling is amazing in a leading role that plunges her into a dazzling assortment of emotions and situations, some bizarre nature. No one who has seen this series would ever say that they can not act. It makes us laugh, cry, excite and strike our forehead with astonishment. <br /> <br /> You can not really compare this story to anything else. This is not a rehash of style or intrigue. It is quite his own beast, at once comedy, historical drama, eroticism, adulthood story, musical comedy and more. <br /> <br /> We must congratulate the BBC for writing this story. I can not imagine anyone in the United States (too prude and methodical) doing it. So, stop reading about it and go buy it.
