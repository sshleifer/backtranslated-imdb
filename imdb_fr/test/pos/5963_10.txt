Wladyslaw Starewicz was an animator born in Russia and living in France. He did incredible things in stop-motion. I have already seen some of these films and his favorite subjects are insects, frogs and various animals. They are extremely realistic and realistic. Even today, they are amazing to watch - the quality is just fantastic. <br /> <br /> This one features many frogs. They call on their god, Jupiter, to give them a king. Why do they need a king, wonders Jupiter - their life is fine now. So, to give them a naughty lesson, he makes the king an Egret and, one by one, he begins to eat the subjects! Then the frogs are again appealing to Jupiter, who states the obvious moral that it is better to be happy with what you have! <br /> <br /> While the quality of the animation is amazing, this is a very scary movie for kids. I would think that it would terrify them both by the reality of animals as well as by history itself, which is not for sensitive souls!
