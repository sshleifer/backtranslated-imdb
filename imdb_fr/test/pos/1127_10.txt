I love this show. I hate when it's going to the final of the season because it seems to be eternal until the season starts again !! I followed this show from his pilot and then all the way thrown from where rusty college begins and sees Casey his sister to now where he goes out with Dana .. I love this show, I can not wait Monday night! ! Plus, I'm so happy that Cappie and Casey finally found each other, which made me crazy! As for Evan and Rebecca, I hope they will meet, which gives them the impression of doing it before the final. I just watched about the main part of the cast and I'm so shocked that Casey Cartwright (Spencer Grammar) is the daughter of Kelsey Grammar !!! it surprises me so much and the other thing that is a huge SHOCKER is that she was born the same year as me and that she was born the day of the birth of my little brother with my year and that I had been watching all the time and no idea !!
