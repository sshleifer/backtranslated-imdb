So, Madonna is not Meryl Streep. Yet it's one of his first films and a comedy to that. Give him a break! Of course, the film is at best mediocre and pale in comparison to its previous counterpart, W / Katherine Hepburn, Bringing Up Baby. For what it is (a piece of down), it's quite fun to watch. I have never heard of anyone who criticizes Madonna's acting skills with evidence or even adjectives other than "horrible", "bad" or other vague terms. If you want to see a bad game or justify the argument that the singers remain faithful to the song, how about Whitney Houston? She had the least deserved commercial success of all the actresses in history and was unable to get out of a hat box. The American public obviously can not discern the difference between a credible performance in a film and the power of the stars. I think Madonna has always been at least credible in her films. Get real people. Madonna-bashing is so 90's.
