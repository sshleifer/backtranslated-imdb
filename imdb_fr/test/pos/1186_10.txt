It could not come at a worse time - just as the country entered the Reagan years, the boom boom of the 1980s, the time of carefree regrets. There is no word of mouth and opens badly. The studio abandoned it. But Hair is probably the best musical ever made - with Forman's directing and Tharpe's choreography, it's a triumph of stunning, well-done, well-written beauty that few people remember. . The casting is perfect, the musical numbers are unforgettable, and even the end of an end does not diminish the indomitable spirit of the film. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen this movie, you have not seen the best musical of all time. Seriously.
