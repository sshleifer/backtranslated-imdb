I saw it today with few backgrounds on what to expect from the story. I go to the cinema to escape, to leave everything behind me and enjoy a "story". I thought it was a good movie, not great, but good. It was worth my money and my tears :) <br /> <br /> Diane Lane was wonderful as always, Richard Gere is not an over-actor. He has behaved well and has a certain presence that we always expect. He brings his own style to the film. <br /> <br /> I think it's the kind of love story that is not always told. It was messy and they had other priorities, but they wanted to be together and expect each other. <br /> <br /> I would recommend it without hesitation!
