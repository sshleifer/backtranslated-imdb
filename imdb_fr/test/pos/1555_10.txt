An excellent story, a wonderful acting, amazing production values ​​and a cool and action-packed short film with a perfect twist at the end. What a beautiful short film! <br /> <br /> I saw this film in Vail or Aspen during a film festival and I was impressed by it. Then I saw him again at another festival (where he won again) and I was even more impressed that subtle touches became obvious the second time - for a short film, it contains a lot of smart layers in a very short time. <BR /> <br /> AWOL is not for the sensitive souls, but it is very well done and quite impressive for a short film - for any film in fact. It's an interesting story that is well told, and each scene moves, revealing the good instincts of a film director. The film is beautiful and David Morse is also superb, with a dynamic performance in every scene. Watching your character try to overcome the curve that life throws at him is an excellent visual experience. <br /> <br /> It should also be noted that when wartime tortures are in the news daily, the line between evil can become very gray while rhetoric becomes strong and attempts to blacken things up. and white. AWOL intelligently allows the audience to decide for themselves what they think is the message, what is real and what is not, which adds to the mystery. <br /> <br /> The two times I saw it, the audience was WAY more in this movie than others are playing with, which says a lot. There are a lot of shorts right now, but few of them offer the kind of excellence and complex topics that AWOL does. <br /> <br /> It seems to me that the previous comment has no place in the rocker, or has a personal agenda, because it is really a good example of independent short film. I see LOTS of short films, and I have to say that if ALL the shorts that tour the festival were so good, the shorts industry would have serious legs.
