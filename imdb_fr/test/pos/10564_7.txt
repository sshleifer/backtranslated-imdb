I do not know exactly why I ordered "Fingersmith" at Netflix - probably, because I like the BBC series, it was on a list of recommendations. I had no idea what I was going to see. The plot, which I will describe in general in order not to spoil those who will see it after reading my account, is more meandering than a mountain road in the Rockies, of the type that usually appears in "caper" movies. They are very unusual in a period drama. Not having read the novel (and I do not intend to do it), I was totally prepared for the surprise that ends the first segment of the DVD and also surprised by the subsequent twists. Nevertheless, it is extremely well played by the two young directors (Sally Hawkins, in particular, Sue and Elaine Cassidy, as Maud) and, in essential supportive roles, by Imelda Staunton as a figure of mother in a house of thieves and by Charles Dance embodies the rich uncle who collects pornographic material and saves the young Maud from the crazy house where his mother lived to be his secretary. The lesbian affair between Maud and Sue is the "big news" of the film, but not its centerpiece. The centerpiece is a plot to steal the fortune Maud must have on his 21st birthday. The twists and twists of the plot add tension, but not much credibility, to the film. However, no viewer will doubt that Maud and Sue will end up together - improbably - as the credits take place. Although one has been raised as a teenager and serves as a pornographic collector, and the other a pickpocket posing as a maid, the author obviously wants them to live together at the end. It's a bit hard to swallow, each having conspired to deceive the other. Despite these reservations, I loved the cinema. He does not deserve the praise that others have lavished on him. The most terrifying and interesting scenes take place inside the madhouse where one of the two young women was confined until she was able to escape and return to London to lead the plot at its unexpected conclusion. Sally Hawkins (Sue) is a very impressive young actress, able to convey the cascading and changing emotions of her character with her facial expressions and her eyes. No doubt we will see more of her. I hope so.
