When I got wind of this picture, it was simply called "Shepherd" and was supposed to be the movie that would give JCVD ​​a chance to do a theatrical shtuff. The whole room excited me. <br /> <br /> At the time, the title was entitled "The Shepherd: Border Patrol", I made taps, I had a particular excitement for this film. With Isaac Fluorentine at the helm of the staging and JJ Perry coordinating the stunts, I almost got pissed by anticipation. Photos were published of JCVD ​​hitting 8 different ass types, as well as Scott Adkins playing what I thought was the bad guy, and I was blown away by the excitement. I thought it would be another epic martial arts situation like Lone Wolf McQuade. <br /> <br /> Then this has been announced. I ordered it off Blockbuster online for $ 20 and was ready for anything. The critics of vandammefan.net had a little altered my ideas, but I prepared myself. The mail arrived on the fourth day and I tore up the package. My initial plan was to rush to the floor, tear the face of the cardboard wrapper, and then crush the box in the right momentum for the disk to land in my DVD player. However, I watched the case for 10 minutes, then I placed the disc in my drive and watched the movie. <br /> <br /> In the end, I was cool like a fool in the pool. The Shepherd is certainly one of my favorite movies of direct video directing and gives Derailed an even more messy look of the restroom. Of course, some of the fights were short, but they were still VERY great. The shootings were superb, as was Scott Adkins, who should have been the villain, unlike the unforgettable Steven Lord. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie. Seriously.
