It's not so much a review of A Tale Of Two Sisters as it's a discussion of some of the details of the plot, so I do not recommend reading this review if you have not seen the movie, as it will save you spoil a few surprises for you. <br /> <br /> In a way, A Tale Of Two Sisters is far from original, at least from a purely superficial point of view - part of his iconography is taken directly from Ring or Dark Water, while The script itself (especially what Brendt Sponseller calls the "rubber reality" aspect of the story) recalls movies such as Fight Club (the main character interacts with a person created in their minds), Mulholland Drive (the character creates an alternative reality in a psychogenic fugue), as well as other minor aspects of Lost Highway, Jacob's Ladder, and virtually every film dealing with mental illness threatened by Amenabar (The Others, Abre Los Ojos), Memento (especially in regarding the tortuous nature of memory) et al. Fortunately, all these similarities do not detract from the overall emotional impact of the film, and I have personally found the A Tale Of Two Sisters experience extremely moving and rewarding. <br /> <br /> Many people have emphasized the "confusing" nature of the film. narrative, but I personally found the narrative rather explicit, even if it is partly depicted in a non-sequential way. The story becomes confused for some because, halfway through the last third, the story moves from a purely subjective context (that is to say from the distorted perception of the reality of Soo-Mi) to an objective version , with a look back at the origins of Soo. -The nervous breakdown of Mi and the resulting mental illness. This change of attention will not fail to put some people off guard, but structurally, I found something reminiscent of that of Mulholland Drive mentioned above (even if we do not deal with the perception of reality by a character via a dream , but rather their own trends, in my turn, reminded me of another Lynch movie, Lost Highway). To be honest, I do not really consider A tale of two sisters as a horror movie as such, but rather as a tragic story of a family breakup, as well as an honest look at the mental illness of a character (and I hasten to add that fans of psychoanalytic cinema will love this film). <br /> <br /> Apart from that, the cinematography in A Tale Of Two Sisters is amazing and visually it's one of the most beautiful films I've seen on this side of Wong Kar Wai's 2046. The performances are also fantastic without exception, and I expect to see more than four major players in the future; not to mention music, but East Asian films without a big soundtrack seem few nowadays. <br /> <br /> It is very likely that some people will go beyond the artistic subtleties of A Tale Of Two Sisters and simply reject it as "yet another Asian horror film", forgetting its aesthetic beauty and its honest psychoanalytic approach. But then everyone in turn. If you can ignore some questionable aspects of the film and just take it for what it has to heart, namely. an extremely tragic and heartbreaking story, so I see no reason not to recommend it.
