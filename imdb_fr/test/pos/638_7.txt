If you like suspense, this movie has it. The fact that Marina Zudina represents a mute adds to her misfortune and increases the suspense. Alec Guiness's appearance was nice, but did not add anything to the movie. I do not know if Evan Richard's role as Andy Clarke was an attempt to add a little humor or if he was supposed to be just a disappointed idiot. I thought cinematography was excellent. This added not only to the quality of the production, but also to the suspense. The bathtub seen with the water droplets in slow motion was wonderful. In addition, the scene where the knife came down and then it went to Andy Clarke, cutting out an extremely rare piece of meat, was very well made. I would say that overall, it's a good entertainment
