It's a thriller in the Hitchcock tradition. You are kept in the dark while the suspects come and go. Dennis Quaid plays Dexter, a man doomed to death and Meg Ryan a great baby. There is not much to dislike in this little suspense and all the pieces fit together perfectly as it should. You will not regret watching this one if you like suspense.
