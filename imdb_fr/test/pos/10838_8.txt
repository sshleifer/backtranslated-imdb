This drama apparently caused some stir six years ago when he made his television debut - not much news on television himself, he went under the radar; but after seeing it, I'm not surprised that it caused a sensation. Not particularly because of the content (although it's a bit more 'out of sync' than the usual TV feed) - it has more to do with the reactionary media in this country. Be that as it may, this three-part series is based on a book by Sarah Waters and focuses primarily on lesbians - although the plot also allows exploring other "dark" aspects of sexuality. Our main character is an oyster named Nan (shortcut for Nancy) of Winchester. Singer Kitty Butler enchants her after seeing her at a theater show and she soon begins to attend all her shows - eventually catching the performer's eye and becoming her dresser. Soon, Kitty is offered a chance to play on bigger stages in London and, having become good friends with Nan, she invites him to the walk. The act grows as Nan comes on stage as well and the duo becomes a theater duo ... but Kitty breaks Nan's heart, leading her on an odyssey into the dark underbelly of London. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that my DVD collection is not short of lousy and sordid movies, so there is nothing in this one that can shock me. Although I am quite jaded, I must say that I am always surprised by all those who say that this film has gone too far; Of course, there is lesbian sex and other things, but it's never exploitation or overuse and the film really could not have been done without it. The focus is always on the story; and the story is really well done. The film lasts almost three hours in total, but if it is something that is not long enough to get everything done. Sarah Waters is obviously an inventive writer, and the film remains interesting for the duration. The acting is solid as one would expect, but I must admit that I found the lead actress Rachael Stirling clumsy and hard to understand at first; although it grows in its role as the film progresses. The performance is a bit of a problem and the director Geoffrey Sax is a bit too gimmicky for my taste. The story becomes a little mocking towards the end too, which is a shame because this movie is at its strongest during the dark moments (episode 2 being the climax of three for me). There is not really a definite point in the movie - or at least not one that I can see. It's not important to me; However, as Tipping the Velvet tells a good story and exceeded my expectations. It's worth checking out, for people who like this stuff.
