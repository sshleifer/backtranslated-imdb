I am a fan of independent film. Dialogue and character studies are there for me. Some of the other articles are right: "Wannabes" will not compete with "The Godfather" for the best mafia film of all time. On the other hand, "Wannabes" is a well-written and well-directed image that presents surprisingly good performances by all actors. My problem with one of the other critics: <br /> <br /> - Conor Dubin is the only Irish in the casting of Italians <br /> <br /> - Dubin is a jewish surname and, in as such has a dark complexion, not a traditional Irish red. It does not stand out at all, it rather offers a good performance. <br /> <br /> It has not won much, but it deserves a Saturday night with a bowl of popcorn. I found it for $ 7 at Blockbuster and I was pleasantly surprised to say it! Highly recommended.
