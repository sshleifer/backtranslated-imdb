I did not expect much from this movie, it was just one of those movies I thought I was watching because it was on TV. I certainly underestimated this movie. <br /> <br /> This is a guy who kills his girlfriend and boasts of his friends. I was very happy with the acting, they played the characters well. It was a particularly successful scene when Feck (Dennis Hopper) and John (Daniel Roebuck) talk about why John killed Jamie. It's shocking to hear how he explains that he wanted to feel controlled and that's why. But Feck had loved the girl he had killed. Feck felt remorse when John felt nothing, but he was proud of what he had done. It really makes you think of people. Keanu Reeves did a great job as Matt and Ione Skye was good. It's weird to see her as a fan of criticism in 'Say Anything' and her as Clarissa. Each actor played very well ..... It was really good for a change. It was a good movie and I would certainly say that I recommend it.
