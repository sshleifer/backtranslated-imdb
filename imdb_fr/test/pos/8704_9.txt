I was ten years old when I saw subspecies, I immediately had a crush on Michael Watson and Laura Tate, they really have excellent chemistry on the screen in the previous parts of the film. I ordered a copy of Full Moon in 1993 and I learned that Ion and Rosa, the maids, play a much bigger role in the scenario with the king. What most people do not know is that an alternative sequence was supposed to happen in the final scene: Michelle and Stefan are stuck in a room and Michelle has the idea for Stefan to make her a vampire to help him fight Radu and his demon-controlled ex-friends. However, for one reason or another, this scenario has never been filmed. Another scene from the screenplay, confirmed in the original trailer, shows Stefan drinking a wolf's blood, or in the trailer, you see him coming in with blood on his chin. <br /> <br /> This film receives a 9 because it is a memory of my childhood and I have good memories attached to the characters; Although my favorite characters were Stefan and Michelle, I think Radu from Anders Hove is a pure evocative evocative game that showcases his work.
