'Oldboy' director Park Chun-wook returns with what must be one of the craziest and most serious vampire movies in film history. <br /> <br /> Armed with the latest Hollywood fashion, vampires are supposed to be rather non-violent, asexual and weary knights of love, instead of juvenile, bloodthirsty and blood-sucking maniacs, manipulating their spirit. This is the movie you want to see if you want to remember the sticky shivers of the past ... well, at least in the second half. <br /> <br /> "Thirsty" begins with a long exposure of characters that culminates in a slightly different love story. The transformation of a priest by the vampires is, for a time, marginalized by the romantic and sexual aspects of the story, which makes the viewing annoying. But the last 40 minutes are surprisingly bloody. Well, maybe not so surprising that you know 'Oldboy' and 'I'm a Cyborg but that's ok', but I guess it's fair to say that 'Thirst' beats Park's previous films in terms violence in the head. <br /> <br /> Overall, be aware that this is not an art cinema or a horror movie. It may be too disgusting for many and too tame for some. 'Thirst' is original, entertaining and luckily a little less strange than previous Park Chun-wook attempts.
