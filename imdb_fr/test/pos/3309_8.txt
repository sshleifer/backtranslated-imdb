A nice film that gives romance, psychodrama at the edge of the street, sexual harassment in the workplace, adultery and fashion. Everything is there. Typical characters found in American companies. Joan Crawford is the usual executive of long-time employed bitches who feel the need to be because she is with big boys. Hope Lange is the first ambitious employee determined to reach the summit using her mind and not her body. Their personal life is the sub-plot. <br /> <br /> The wardrobe for the movie is great, but someone forgot to tell Stephen Boyd's hairdresser-stylist that "a little slap will do him good!" The amount of Brylcream in Stephen Boyd's hair is sometimes distracting. The relationship of his character with the character of Lange was never fully developed, which disappointed me. Overall, the film is nice. <br /> <br /> Rating: 8/10
