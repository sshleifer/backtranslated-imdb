This NFBC film was made in honor of the Montreal Canadiens dynasty in the 50s, 60s and 70s. My Grade 5 teacher played this in class in honor of my 11th birthday in 1987 and also to celebrate my return from a serious facial wound in 1986. I was a Canadian supporter for 29 of my 30 years of life. I give this film a rating of 117. On a scale of 1 to 10, all hockey fans should see it because I hope it will be placed in the Hockey Hall of Fame in Toronto and shown at the Bell Center in Toronto. Montreal or here in Edmonton at Rexall. In law. Watch this movie with your family, it's a good movie. I also recommend the book in French and English. Come on guys are going.
