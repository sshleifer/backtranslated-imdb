The film Jennifer with Ida Lupino and Howard Duff is a magnificence of the film noir. This is a largely unknown film that all movie fans should see. Jennifer was filmed with the most unusual shooting angles of the day, which gave the film a surreal quality. on time. I love black movies in black and white. The film in black is not so good.The cast and the script are excellent.The rather terrifying music is fun to listen to.Ida Lupino is one of the most talented and talented actresses so far I do not I had never seen a production in which she was I did not like her. She was not only breathtaking, but also an excellent actress.The first film in which I remember seeing Ida Lupino was Roadhouse with Richard Widmark and Cornel Wilde I have never forgotten the movie, nor her. I saw her latest movies like Food Of The Gods and Women In Chains, and even though the movies were not her usual fare, she was always delightful as an actress. Howard Duff is always great to watch. I recommend strongly this masterpiece to everyone. I have this film on VHS.
