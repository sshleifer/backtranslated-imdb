This show was a pleasant surprise after watching Mad TV on a Saturday night. Spike is an excellent host who is still used to it, but he is adapting very well to his new position. I can imagine that the transition between the writer (Seinfeld) and his host is difficult, unlike many new talk show hosts, he does not miss the airtime while trying to find a solution. He is quick-witted and each segment and section is seamlessly overlapped. It does not hurt to be a little sexy in a nerdy style, so it's not hard to look like Leno or Letterman. I do not remember the exact date of my favorite episode, but I particularly liked the silly Paparazzi sketch with a fake J-Lo and Katie Holmes. Super new show !!
