Well, I have a few days late but what the hell ...! Anyway, the word that best describes my reaction to "See No Evil" was .... SURPRISE. The film is actually quite good. There is really a lot of blood, blood and action in the movie with a modest amount of suspense. It reminds us of the good old days of the late '70s and early' 80s. Remember that "Madman" meets Leatherface with a hint of Norman Bates and you'll get a good idea of ​​this movie. Even though SNE is thin in the plot (most horror movies are), it is somehow offset by violence / killing methods, coolness, suspense and the fact that Kane is great job playing the very disturbed Jacob Goodnight. The title of the film comes from the fact that Jacob picks the eyes of his victims with his fingers and stores them in large pots. Why?? You'll just have to watch and see (pun intended). Some cinematographic elements have been raised in other horror films, including Psycho, TCM and Madman, but they are not obvious. Finally, SNE is not really going into a territory that we have long been waiting for, SNE is not a "Pyscho" or a "TCM 74", but certainly deserves a look. <br /> <br /> BloodStone Recommendation: Attend a morning screening of "See No Evil" Bloodstone Rating: 7.5 / 10
