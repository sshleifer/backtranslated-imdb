After seeing A Texas Tale of Treason, Cox's meager correspondence efforts could not even afford the massive collusion led by Stu without a budget. It tells a story about dedication, sweat, whiz, fire and punk rock. I like that! My favorite parts are the interviews with Marci (she is a very hot baby and she digs me but she does not know it yet). The Japanese clerk suffocating his lines, it made me crack. The sex scene was really cool. I'll see if Stu will come one day and do the lightwave stuff in the box when I do it with my wife. The intro and of course my 5 seconds in the closing credits. I know it'll give me chicks. I hope to see more Antstuie because I know I can expect the unexpected.
