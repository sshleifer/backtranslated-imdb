Ok, maybe this movie is not a revolution. But it's a very good entertainment, and it's Alicia Silverstone's variant of "Clueless" or Cameron Diaz's "There's something about Mary". <br /> <br /> Liv plays a femme fatale, who just wants to have a clean house and all sorts of material comfort in it. Well, she does everything to make it ... even crimes. Many crimes. And she drops every boyfriend who does not cooperate to get these things. Plus, it does not really bother him to have some extra lovers next to his current boyfriend. <br /> <br /> This movie is even more fun to watch if you know that Liv is actually a cancer of the zodiac sign - and that the cancer would be reported to be very domestic. So the character Liv played here is actually a travesty of cancer! <br /> <br /> I was alone at the movies when I watched this one. It was very comfortable because I could laugh as hard as I wanted - but it was also strange, as if nobody really cared about this movie? <br /> <br /> Myself, I loved it. The acting was between very good and excellent, especially the main actors were brilliant. There were enough jokes, lots of black characters and good dialogues. <br /> <br /> This is a trashy movie full of black humor. If you like this kind of movies, try this one!
