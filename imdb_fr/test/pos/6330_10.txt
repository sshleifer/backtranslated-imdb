Bergman is a director and writer of sublime comedy. This fact becomes evident in "In Ikärlek", where comic elements range from zany scenes to deep and moving scenes. This film paves the way for Bergman's latest comedies "Sommarnattens leende" and "Kvinnodröm", all with Gunnar Björnstrand and Eva Dahlbeck. This is an excellent movie to start your Bergman experience, thoroughly describing the emotional issues of young and old alike. The cinematography of Martin Bodin is astonishing, for example in the picnic scene. In short, the film is a perfect example of successful comedy, with a clarity of depth that goes beyond even some of Bergman's comedies.
