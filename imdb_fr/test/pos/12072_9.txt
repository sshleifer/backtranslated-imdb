I stammered like a little girl during the end of this movie and I challenge anyone to hold it without a sob. Absolutely heartbreaking, but inspiring at the base. <br /> <br /> A great effort on the part of Ann Margaret, who is a mother of 10 terminally ill children who will not know her husband who suffers from arthritic steel able to support the family after his departure, organizes the adoptions of his children before his departure. The role really deserved an Oscar. <br /> <br /> You really feel for this poor family, because the dying mother gives her everything so that her children do not end up in a poorly managed orphanage system. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen it, get it if you can.
