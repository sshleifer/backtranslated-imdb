The second (non-animated) film about the only people who still refuse to surrender to the Roman Empire is even more hilarious than the first film "Asterix & Obelix vs. Ceasar". <br /> <br /> Where the first movie got all the laughs because all the cartoon characters were perfectly restored to life without losing their cartoony identity, this sequel (which is a separate story as are all comic books) is even better. Of course, all the ingredients you find in the first film and in the comics are again present: Obelix still dying to taste the "magic potion" that gives his other members of the tribe such enormous powers , Caesar and the rest of the Empire Rome is still the number one enemy, but new refreshing elements have also been brought to the scene. <br /> <br /> Not only the scenery is very idyllic (the biggest role is played of course in Egypt), but it is not about repeating the film First, some extras were added by doing all kinds references to other films (Bruce Lee, etc.). All this is not new, but the unexpected combination of the known history of comics (with almost the same title as the movie) and references to things that have absolutely nothing to do with Asterix and Obelix works really. <BR/> <br /> This is how the film reinforces the tradition of comics writers Goscinny and Uderzo, who did not hesitate to bring Laurel and Hardy on stage and dedicate an entire story to Kirk Douglas. <br /> <br /> If all this does not convince you to watch this movie, I'm sure Monica Bellucci would play Cleopatra ....
