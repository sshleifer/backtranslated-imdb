A truly accurate and glamorous look in modern life. It could be installed in any city in the UK. <br /> <br /> I live in a residential area of ​​Glasgow and I can understand this movie very well. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, situations and characters are too realistic but unpredictable. <br /> <br /> The actors are terribly credible, I felt like I was spying on my neighbors. It was an intimate plunge into the lives of frail and hopeless people. I was very moved by some scenes. <br /> <br /> I loved the way this movie was shot. <br /> <br /> Overall, this film is a must see.
