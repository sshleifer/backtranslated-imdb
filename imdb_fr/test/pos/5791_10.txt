First of all, this film is a very well done reality on the artistic level. A kind of combination between "American Beauty" and "As good as it gets". And of course, something specific to all Russian films (of course the one that has value, no dirty propaganda!): The problem of loneliness of the man ... Especially recommended for people who really want to see beyond any emotive propaganda on communism or negative propaganda!). A film about the common people, their problems, their lack of satisfaction - especially for young people, the fear when we touch the real and dirty face of society ... and the false "solutions": alcohol and violence. .. and probably the only real solution: the true love ... Of course, it is very well located in the space and time of the "Russian perestroika", but it is valid for the whole society (except a perfect society , but do not worry - impossible to find this on our Earth!). For the last time - really recommended ...
