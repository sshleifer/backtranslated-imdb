On vacation in northern Australia, Gracie (Diana Glenn), her husband Adam (Andy Rodoreda) and younger sister Lee (Maeve Dermody) decide to take a trip to the Blackwater Barry Swamp for fishing. Their guide Jim (Ben Oxenbould) uses a small motor boat and takes the tourist along the river to a remote place. When they stop, they are attacked by a huge crocodile that capsizes their boat and immediately kills Jim. The three survivors climb a tree and when they realize that the help would never come to help them, they decide to try to find a way out of their sheltered place. However, in the muddy water, their boat is overturned and the crocodile tracks the trio underwater. <br /> <br /> "Black Water" is a tense, realistic and dramatic film with a small budget and in line with the warning. at first, based on a real event. The game of the unknown Diana Glenn, Maeve Dermody and Andy Rodoreda is remarkable, giving credibility to this simple but scary story. There are many similarities between this film and "Prey", but in different environments. My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Medo Profundo" ("Deep Fear")
