Since there have been so many critics of this beautiful film, I will write in a list and try to solve the problems that have not been discussed. <br /> <br /> 1. Dana Andrews was 38 years old when shooting this movie. According to the scenario, his character was about 20 years old. Andrews, a very underrated actor, brilliantly portrayed a character who was supposed to be much younger. <br /> <br /> 2. Fredric March, like all BIG actors, sometimes needs to be retained by the director to avoid excessive play. He scoffed at the cameras when he was drunk the night after he arrived and the next morning as he checked his hangover in his mirror. <br /> <br /> 3. Dana Andrews was superb as in "Laura", "The Ox-Bowl Incident", "A Walk in the Sun", "The Purple Heart" and many other films. Why did Fredric March win the Oscar and why was Dana Andrews not even named for his outstanding performance? <br /> <br /> 4. Harold Russell gave the best performance ever seen by a non-actor. <br /> <br /> 5. I realize it was the 1940s but Dana Andrews did not seem to have a romantic interest in her particularly attractive wife (Virginia Mayo). <br /> <br /> 6. Ray Teal, who played the bigot on the right, became famous years later for portraying the sheriff in "Bonanza". <br /> <br /> 7. The southern teacher wrote that the film was slow, boring and badly played. The teacher is most likely misinformed about classic movies. The beauty and significance of these ageless classics is that they are slow-moving characters that avoid blasphemy, excessive violence and free sex. .
