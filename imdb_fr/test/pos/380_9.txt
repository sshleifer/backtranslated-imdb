Well, it's about as good as they come. There are arguments as to whether Hitchcock was just a "master of commercial suspense" or perhaps a "compulsive technician" - or was he really "deep". No one knows exactly what it means, but it is legitimate to wonder if, at its best, it could not have been the three things at once. <br /> <br /> In this one, it seems to be at its peak. . There is practically nothing accidental. It is full of doubt, ambiguity and spirit. And the story is captivating, Patricia Highsmith apparently having complexes similar to those of Hitchcock. <br /> <br /> I'm sure the plot has been thoroughly described elsewhere, so I will not bother. I will simply point out five incidents on the screen of which Hitchcock is undoubtedly responsible. <br /> <br /> Bruno Antony (Walker) followed Miriam (Laura Miller) and her two boyfriends during a night carnival with the intention of murdering her. She noticed her attention and she is innocently flattered. <br /> <br /> 1. Laura and her two friends rent an electric boat to cross the tunnel of love and then go to an island in the center of the lake. Walker is right behind them, smiling, in his boat - Pluto. "Pluto." This is not an allusion to the cartoon character of Walt Disney. It is a reference to Pluto, also called Hades, a god of hell in Greek and Roman mythology. This little touch can not be an accident. And the "underground world" that Walker represents is not just a literal hell, but the underworld of the human spirit. I hate to say it's a Jungian "shadow", but that's what it is. (Did Carl Jung see this movie? He was alive at the time of release - but probably not.) 2. Now, it's a deadly sequence, right? Walker is a madman who is about to murder a woman he does not even know. Imagine how this would have been presented by most administrators. A night in a crowded carnival, flying shadow in shadow, the killer looking behind the canvas walls, etc. What does Hitchcock show us? When Walker walks through the front door for the first time, concentrating on his victim, a little boy in cowboy costume, holding a balloon, climbs up and shouts, "Bang, Bang, you're dead!" Walker shakes his head in surprise and looks at the boy indignantly. And when the kid starts to walk away, Walker throws his cigarette at the balloon and jumps it, then pursues his pursuit without another look. This is one of the ways that Hitchcock treats imminent destiny. <br /> <br /> 3. The famous strangulation that is reflected in sunglasses, which has been used many times. <br /> <br /> 4. Miriam and her friends stop in front of one of those machines that you fight with a big mallet, sending some kind of hockey puck into the tree to measure the strength of your shot . One of his friends goes there and the puck does not reach the bell at the top. Under Miriam's delighted and admiring gaze, Walker smiles and rubs his hands, then picks up the mallet, the flap and the puck bangs against the bell. She is happy. He lays the mallet, looks at it, smiles and WAGGLES SIS OF EYES looks at it like a ten-year show! 5. After the discovery of Miriam's body, while the whistles sound and people scream, Walker leaves the carnival and meets a blind man waiting at the sidewalk. Walker takes the old man by the arm and makes him cross the intersection, raising his hand seriously to stop the traffic. A macabre joke. <br /> <br /> These incidents, as well as others, all take place during the ten or fifteen minutes of the carnival visit. (Robert Walker's performance is exceptional.) It's basically a kind of invitation to the dark. (See "Ride the Pink Horse") But the threat of the scene is softened by Hitchcock's insistence on irony and distance. None of the known black techniques are used. There is nothing really "scary" about it. And the murder itself is not savage. I do not think a director other than Hitchcock would have treated him like he did. It would have been a threat and shadows, hiding places, abortive attempts, sullen looks rather than grimaces. <br /> <br /> This is not an absolutely flawless movie. A flawless movie is not with us yet. Part of the middle section is a little slow and Farley Granger, although a nice boy, is impassive, dull and rather stupid. His new girlfriend is just boring. <br /> <br /> Hitchcock had to deal with the guilty guilt with deadly gravity in "The Wrong Man". I'm not sure Hitchcock ever thought about the difference between legal and moral guilt. The latter was imposed on him very early by his Catholic education. "Original sin" - you are born with that - and all that. In the filmed interviews, he always explained his fear of the police and the authorities by saying that his father had taken him to the police station to scare him after a peccadillo. We are entitled to ask if this is what psychoanalysis calls a "screen of memory". I hope you get the word game. I know I know. It's difficult and inept, but I spent a lot of time thinking about it.
