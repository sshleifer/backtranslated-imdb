This film has gone from fashion to fashion more often than the miniskirt. A triumph of the post-war era, it was virtually forgotten by the 1970s, with the exception of film students. Recently, he began to be recognized as perhaps the most impartial representation of the integration of soldiers into post-war life ever made (and this certainly includes such films as "The Deer Hunter".) I like it, but my evaluation lies somewhere between these extremes. <br /> <br /> The story is simple. Three very different soldiers who gathered after World War II (The Big One!) Go home to their Midwestern town and try to take back or create civilian lives. One has a disability, one is waiting for him, and the other has only determination. <br /> <br /> There are good performances but unfortunately uneven. Fredric March won the Oscar for Best Actor for playing an old sergeant who returned to work at the local bank. Personally, I think Jimmy Stewart deserved it for "It's a wonderful life", which also deserved the Best Film Award, but it's clear that this film moved the viewers of the post-war period. As I said, it was fashionable. March has a fantastic scene, a humorous speech evoking a similar incident involving Pappy Boyington, a true hero of the Second World War, and which is also solid but not spectacular. <br /> <br /> I'm going against the grain, but I thought Myrna Loy, who played March's wife, was rightly ignored by the Academy. I barely detected a hint of warmth from her. In fact, I always thought she was going to slap Frederic March for bothering her. She practically winced every time they were together. There was certainly something missing there, in his forced smiles and his air of tolerance rather than joy. I think all of this nonsense about her being "the perfect woman" is only correct if you think that a passionless housewife of the 1950s is your ideal. You may disagree with that, but Academy voters apparently did not. This is a major problem with this film, terribly badly received. <br /> <br /> Dana Andrews as a former soda boy who became a war hero and then finds himself behind the counter again, is amazing. He is dealing with a wife who, of course, married him just before he left for the war for all the wrong reasons, and his future is dark. But then he meets March's daughter, Peggy (Teresa Wright, in a fantastic bend), and fireworks explode. Both are great, but then comes this inequality that permeates this film. Some moments of pure soap opera are interspersed, punctuated by the classic phrase of all time: "I'm going to burst this marriage!" The romance is uplifting and reflects a current situation after the war, namely the return of soldiers returning to love on their return. <br /> <br /> About elevation, we now come to Harold Russell. It has a naturalistic quality in its game, or is it a non-game, that sounds as true today as it probably did at the time. Take a simple approach to his situation, he is an inspiration. His best scene, one of the best of all cinemas, is when he brings the girl who loves him to his bedroom to show him the truth about his condition. "I'm lucky, I still have my elbows unlike some boys." Really very good. <br /> <br /> The film has moments that are skyrocketing. There are also moments that belong to the soap operas of the afternoon. Take the good with the bad and see this one for the best moments.
