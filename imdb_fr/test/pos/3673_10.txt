I love that movie! I had never heard of it when I saw it at the video store. I saw that Kathy Bates was inside, so I thought it must be worth it, you see? I looked at it the first time shaking my head. . . eh? Then it was the last scene and I felt bad to smile so hard. I clicked on "play the movie" and looked at it again. It's probably the most original movie I've ever seen. But the more I look at it, the more I love it. It's absurd and crazy and sweet and expensive. Kathy Bates is impeccable, but the rest of the cast is fabulous too. What strange characters they are all! The dwarf is too funny for words. And Julie Andrews and Barry Manilow are hysterical. It's just a fun and fabulous movie. I feel desires to see him again. Anyone looking at it for the first time, please stick it to the end. It's worth it!
