I have not been a fan of Madonna for quite a long time, however, I thought I could comment on this movie. <br /> <br /> This film is a mistake. One of them, as well as Madonna, has been criticized by critics. They were wrong and many potential viewers were upset by the bad reviews. <br /> <br /> First of all, Madonna does a great job in this film which is one of her first. She plays a blonde in the movie, she is far from being a blonde in real life. Most of her detractors were somewhat prejudiced by her fame at singing and did not shake her. When you watch this film, I hope you understand that the accent and the blunder are just acting. She was absolutely hysterical, just like the movie. <br /> <br /> Griffen Dunne is another person to whom the film did not qualify for honest criticism. If you take a look at his filmography, you will see that he is an accomplished actor. <br /> <br /> Regarding the film itself, it's something that looks like a pretty woman, but that happened three years before the Roberts Gere success. It's a goofy comedy with lots of gags, slapstick and liners. Part of the comedy is impassive and takes a comedy aficionado to really appreciate the more subtle humor. <br /> <br /> I know that does not tell you much about the film, but I hope it will dispel any idea it's a poor film. It is worthwhile to rent it for a good night's rest. <br /> <br /> Peace. <br /> <br /> Gary
