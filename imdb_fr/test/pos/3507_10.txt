"Just before dawn" is one of the best slasher films. It is very realistic and atmospheric. It reminds me of Tobe Hooper's "chainsaw massacre" and "Deliverance". scary and dark movie. "Just before dawn" is beautiful photographed and the soundtrack is very disturbing.I never liked <br /> <br /> movies slasher or gore except with this one.Very impressive and compelling film (at least for me)
