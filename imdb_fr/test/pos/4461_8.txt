Lucio Fulci's "Do not Torture a Duckling" paints an exceptionally unflattering portrait of the small Sicilian town, darkened by a series of brutal murders of young boys. perversity, wickedness, and two truly grotesque scenes of brutal violence. The children who are soon to die are portrayed as cruel and future-seeing toms; the quasi-seduction of Bruno by the nude Patrizia (Barbara Bouchet) to believe.Highly recommended - especially in couple with my other favorite cult "House with laughing windows" (1976).
