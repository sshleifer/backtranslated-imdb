This film is definitely the best film of Fonda. The plot is amazing, the acting is amazing, and the staging is incredible. A classic of all time, it should have won the best picture, not Kramer vs. Kramer. Although he was not even named. Jack Lemmon and Micheal Douglas are also at their best. One of the best ends ever. If you have not seen this film turn, do not walk to rent it. Should have been in the top 100 afi. Do not see it only for Fonda, but for everything. <br /> <br /> **** on **** 4 out of 4
