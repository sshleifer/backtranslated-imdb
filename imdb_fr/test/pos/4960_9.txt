I really wanted to write a title for this criticism that is neither nerdy nor gushing, but still described my feelings for this show. I can see now that it is not possible. "American Family" is one of the best shows I have ever had the pleasure of watching on TV. Several critics on IMDb mentioned the word "beautiful" when describing this show. Never has a word been so appropriate. The cinematography for this show is magnificent. Each scene and each stroke looks like a masterpiece. Lighting, camera movements, scene composition and colors ... I have to remember that I'm watching a TV show and not a movie masterpiece. The score of Lee Holdridge and Nathan Wang makes me cry. And more importantly, the game of incredible actors is honest and sincere. I do not feel like I'm watching performances ... I feel like I'm watching real life. If only real life could be so beautiful. <br /> <br /> "The American family" has raised the bar for quality entertainment on television. I highly recommend this show to anyone who is ready to watch it. I could easily blame CBS for transmitting this show, but I have to say that it does not matter who is broadcasting it. I'm just glad everyone can see it. I thank PBS for not letting this show disappear into nothingness. <br /> <br /> I must pay tribute to how the final of each season ended. The first was pure creative genius and it moved me to tears. I was waiting to see if Season Two would also end creatively, and of course, it did. Once again, tears. <br /> <br /> My thanks to everyone involved. You really did a special artwork with this show, and I sincerely think so. It's a shame we only have two seasons, but a miracle we did not have anything at all.
