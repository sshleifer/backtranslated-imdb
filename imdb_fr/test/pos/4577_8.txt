This film deserved better. Mike Judge's satirical spirit has brought to light something that too many people in this country are trying to deny ... our society gets wiser more evidence? Mike Judge portrays a scary future, where mutes survive and thrive. Make you stop and think and laugh. Can you look at the world and not ask if we are more stupid? Are we overwhelmed by human waste and our own waste? (Watch out for landslides). <br /> <br /> The movie is really fun. I'll tell you more about the plot, but I do not want to ruin it. So why release this movie with ZERO promotion? Could it be that stupid people are already taking over?
