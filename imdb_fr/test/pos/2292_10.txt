I agree with the guy above, it's so funny that I understand everything, but my friends just do not understand. Go to Japan and you will see a different movie after going there. When I met my girlfriend's father, at his home in Kanagawa. I swear I felt the same as Jack. frightened, but at the end of the day everything was good, so I give this movie a 10 out of 10. I watched it at least 30 times, I took it with me on the plane to go to Japan the month next. The ball game scenes are a good thing. It makes me feel like I'm there again. It's a must if you have any interest in Japan and baseball. Too bad they do not follow up. Does anyone know where the scenes of the temple were filmed and the fight with Hirko in the walkway with a roof over ???? need to know so that I can win an argument with me, ex-Japanese wife. Thank you
