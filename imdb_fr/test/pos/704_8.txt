"The Desperadoes" (1943) is a real classic, not for its history (which is quite routine), but for its technical elements of production. It was an emblematic western, the largest ever built at the time of its release and all the more unique as it was a Columbia production, a light studio with a haunting reputation. Fox's only "Jesse James" (also starring Randolph Scott) a few years earlier gave such a lavish treatment. Although "The Searchers" and "High Noon" eclipsed it in a few years, "The Desperadoes" was an innovative effort and historical treasure. <br /> <br /> In 1863, the economy of the city of Red Valley, Utah, rests on the gathering and sale of wild horses to the Union Army. The scenario is a bit messed up here with references to the railroad (several years later in Utah's future) and Custer's Last Stand (Custer was busy fighting Stuart in Pennsylvania at the time), but that's not the case. are not important elements of the plot. <br /> <br /> Red Valley has an honest sheriff, Steve Upton (Scott), but the banker and several citizens are corrupt; burglarizing their own bank every time the government pays a herd of horses. Cheyenne Rogers (Glenn Ford), a famous outlaw who became an old friend, visits the city. He wants to go straight there, especially after falling in love with the pretty stable owner Alison McLeod (Evelyn Keyes). Cheyenne partner "Nitro" Rankin (Guinn "Big Boy" Williams) is mainly present for comic relief, as is Uncle Willie McLeod (Edgar Buchanan) and the city judge (Raymond Walburn, who models his character on the ball "Wizard of Oz" crystal of Frank Morgan faker). <br /> <br /> Taking no chances with their huge budget, Columbia packed this event with tons of action and all the elements of the Western movie, with the exception of the Indians and box cars. There's the best rush of wild horses ever filmed, a spectacular bar fight, explosive climax, romance and a three-band Technicolor. All this does not necessarily go well together, but who would have cared in 1943. Unity is a problem because it tries to be both a serious western and a comedy. <br /> <br /> Cinematography was probably the best of all time at the time of filming. The interior scenes are solid, but it is the naturalistic photography outside that is really impressive; lyrical static scenes and moving camera shooting of action sequences. <br /> <br /> Scott and Claire Trevor were among the best, but the studio clearly wanted to promote Ford, who would soon be their biggest star. And director Charles Vidor used the film to introduce his new wife Keyes (whose portrayal of Scarlett's sister in "Gone With the Wind" had touched the public more than any other role in film history). <br /> <br /> The dynamic Ford-Keyes is the most important and important feature of "The Desperadoes". Rather than opt for the "love triangle" clich√© with Scott and / or Trevor (it seems like it will happen), the focus is on the two youngest actors. It was probably the best role that Keyes has ever had and she makes the most of it. Play a tomboyish but extremely sexy young woman who looks great in leather pants and dresses, and who rides and fights like Kiera Knightley's character in "Pirates of the Caribbean". It was revolutionary at the time and coincided with WAAC's 1942 training for military service in the Second World War. <br /> <br /> "The Desperadoes" is a well-maintained film and the impression is like new. Unfortunately, the DVD does not contain any special features. <br /> <br /> Again, what do I know? I am only a child.
