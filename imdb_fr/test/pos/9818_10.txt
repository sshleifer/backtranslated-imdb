Etore Scola's masterful rendering of this epic of the heart deserves a much wider audience. He is a worthy successor to the risorgimento classics such as Senso and Il Gattopardo de Vischonti, as well as Vanina, Vanini de Rosselini. The 19th century is indeed a fruitful source for Italian filmmakers. The settings and exterior signs of the period are beautifully done here, but the story is timeless and can come in any period. What is so intriguing in this story is that the hero finds himself trapped in a claustrophobic situation in which he finds himself the object of the desire pursued vigorously and he is utterly powerless to disengage himself from alarming circumstances. Giorgio (Giraudeau) is frustrated by his inability to visit his charming but slightly married mistress (Antonelli) and is prey to the dangerous passion of Fosca (D'Obici), the ugly and sickly daughter of his severe commander (Girotti) . The resulting anxiety and the resulting tragedy for this unlikely couple makes them understandable, pitiable and extremely sympathetic to the viewers. The stellar performance of Bernard Giraudeau will captivate and leave a lasting impression. Do not miss.
