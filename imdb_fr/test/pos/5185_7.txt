Excellent special effects make this disaster very plausible. It can be seen that producers have struggled to properly display screens on computer screens - all this is very convincing. The sets are also very authentic. A good choice of music completes the film well. <br /> <br /> Playing is good and the presence of David Suchet adds a little weight to the cast. Compared to other films of this kind, Flood is among the best. Fortunately, the aspect "human drama" has not been exaggerated, as is often the case with this type of film. Human suffering is described in perfect balance with the flood scenes. <br /> <br /> And of course, the film confirms what many of us suspect anyway: meteorologists do not do it often! :)
