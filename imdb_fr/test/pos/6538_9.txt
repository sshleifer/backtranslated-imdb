I do not understand why everyone hates this movie, apart from the fact that they are only jealous, their musical career has never flown like mega Popstar Aaron Carter. Like it or not, Aaron has been more successful in his young life than most people could dream of having, so it seemed natural to him to make a film. Lou Pearlman and his company are known for their overexploitation of their protected population. Do you remember Justin Timberlake's incursion into the TV movie Model Behavior? Admittedly, this film is not impressive nor large scale, but it is not supposed to be. It's not about trying to impress people or being an Emmy Award winner, it's straight out on DVD. It's just a cute little film about a clumsy teenager who realizes her dream of being with her favorite Popstar; I know that many of you have had this dream at one time or another about your favorite singer, do not deny it. It's sweet and kind and I congratulate him for not going into the realm of sex, violence and vulgar language, which seems to be slipping into our films today. Where is decency? Where is the line? Teen dramas are today's dozens because teens are a big market for businesses. At least this one is more tolerable to me than Bratz (aka Slutz) with all the fake little girls running around "Oh Mah Gawd!" in tank tops and mini skirts and is better than these gore fest movies like Saw. I'm sensitive to the main character's daughter because I was a nerdy marginal high school girl who loved Aaron Carter, NSYNC and the Backstreet Boys and other pop music and she still loves; and as Aaron's character would have overwhelming "testophobia", especially in Math. If you're judging this movie solely on the fact that you do not like or are not jealous of Aaron Carter and his fame, then of course, you'll hate him and criticize him in the critics. Crossroads, Britney Spears' dribble, got a higher score because she has breasts. Accept this film as it is and not what you want it to be. I think this happy teen movie ends on a positive note and makes you want to sing.
