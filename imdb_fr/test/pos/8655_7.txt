I caught my attention on Netflix Instant Play because it only lasted an hour and a half (it's almost 4 am here), and because it's Norwegian, what I wanted to do after Dead Snow and see what the country offers more in international cinema. now. Funny and deliriously delirious, this film features a man, Andreas, who is sent to a Purgatory in a Brave New World town, where everyone is happy and bland and where the food has no taste, nothing does not feel and even sex loses its appeal. . Pushed to the limit by his lack of common sense, he feels almost ready to commit suicide. After a hilarious and failed attempt, Andreas tracks down a man with similar complaints and discovers a tiny, vaginal-shaped hole in a concrete wall from which music emanates. The two are trying to break through to see what's on the other side, tracing a tiny ray of light they can barely see. But of course, in the fantasy allegory world, desire and nonconformity are not allowed, and elements of the city act to end Andreas's attempt at freedom and sensuality. <br /> <br /> Jens Lien and his team create an Advance to History, which presents its themes well and advances at a pace not to fall behind. It is not useful to list the similarities between other similar sci-fi works, but the film still has a unique feel and balances fun scenes with rather horrible scenes. I like the limited, but effective, use of gore in this film, a drop and flogging that will make your heart beat faster than The Passion of Christ, simply because it is so utterly out of place staged in gray tones. Trond Fausa Aurvaag is a trustworthy actor who feels physically out of place, which works very well. Although the concept itself is not a subject of writing, everyone makes it work and the film fully realizes its own world. <br /> <br /> --PolarisDiB
