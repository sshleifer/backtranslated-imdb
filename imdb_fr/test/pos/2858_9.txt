I do not know why I chose a mother loan for "Nurse Betty". I think just because I heard a bit of this movie. But I'm glad I did it. "Nurse Betty" is an original and intelligent film that has humor and a darker side. <br /> <br /> He was one of Renee's first big fat guys before hitting him in Hollywood. I can see why, she is an incredible actress. The scene where she finally realizes what happened and on the set of her favorite soap opera, you can see the pain, confusion, fear and embarrassment on her face. Just to leave you on the movie, she plays Betty. A shy and uncertain woman who supports her abusive husband, is a waitress and is in love with soap operas, especially one where there is some cute doctor, Dr. Dave Revell. When she sees the murder of her husband by chance in a separate room, the murders she sees are two clients she has just had, Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock. She then loses her head and leaves town after talking to the police and says she needs to find her former fianc√©e, Dr. Dave Revell. So she travels the country to California to find Dr. Revell and is looking for a job as a nurse to work with Dave. She has seen the show so many times that she is really great to be a nurse when she saves a woman's brother. Although everyone tells her that she is delusional, she looks at them as if they were crazy. When she meets the actor who plays Dave Revell, George (his real name) thinks she's just a crazy fan trying to get into the show. She looks at him in confusion and believes that he and she are going together. <br /> <br /> Renee was great, she was so credible to lose her head in the movie. She has come a long way and whether you want to admit it or not, she is adorable and a great actress. <br /> <br /> Morgan Freeman plays one of the murderers, Charlie, who is the father of both. He is so seduced and seduced by Betty and, while pursuing it across the country, he has almost fallen in love with Betty, to the point that he falls almost in love. He and his son Wesley must find Betty when they find out she was at the scene of the murder and could reveal their identity. When Charlie sees Betty and finally catches her, she is marked at first, but she calms down and they know they have a real connection. It was a beautifully played scene, my opinion is that Morgan gave a stronger performance. He is simply great. <br /> <br /> Chris Rock, son, Wesley, in a surprisingly decent performance. He's such a "gun" -hope about doing the job in a hurry and taking care of the business. I loved his comic performance at the end, where he and the gang he's holding hostage just watch the soap opera together. Classic. "Nurse Betty" is an excellent film that I would recommend for good laugh and a good little honest movie that I think everyone could enjoy. <br /> <br /> 9/10
