Finally a real horror movie. This is the first time in years that I had to cover my eyes. I am a horror buff and I recommend this movie but it is rather gore. I'm not a big wrestling fan, but Kane really pulled the film up. I must admit that I did not want to see this movie. My 17-year-old has trained me, but I am very happy to have done so. During and after the movie, I looked over my shoulder. I agree with others on the total remake of horror movies, that's enough. I think that's why this movie gets good reviews. It's a refreshing change that takes you back to the first Texas chainsaw, Michael Myers and Jason. And no shit CGI.
