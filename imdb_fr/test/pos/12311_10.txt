Naturally, in a film whose main themes are mortality, nostalgia and the loss of innocence, it is perhaps not surprising that it is better noticed by older viewers than by younger ones. However, there is a know-how and a completeness in the film that everyone can appreciate. The rhythm is constant and constant, the characters are enthusiastic and engaging, relationships and natural interactions show that you do not need tears to show your emotions, screams to show your fear, screams to show your argument or violence to show your anger. Naturally, Joyce's short story gives the film a ready-made structure, as perfect as a polished diamond, but the small changes Huston makes, such as the inclusion of the poem, are perfectly suited to it. It is truly a masterpiece of tact, subtlety and irresistible beauty.
