An excellent thriller of all time. Vijay Anand excels as director and publisher. The performances of Dev Anand, Vyjayantimala, Tanuja and Ashok Kumar prove to be an asset for the film whose scenario is elaborated in the smallest detail. Cinematography adds to the mystery, glamor and other demands of history as it evolves. And to top it off, Sachin Dev Burman's music is unforgettable. "Yeh dil na hota bechara" by Kishore Kumar, "Raat akeli hai" by Asha Bhosle, "Rula ke gaya sapna mera" by Lata, "Aasman ke niche" by Lata and Rafi and "Hothon pe aisi baat main" by Lata, reaffirm once again the unique stature of Burman Dada as a first-rate composer with his own style.
