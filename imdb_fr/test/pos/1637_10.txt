This X-Files episode is certainly the most stressful of the first season. This episode is what I think when I hear "X-Files". the plot is simple but exciting. Our main cast and some scientists are going to investigate an Alskan outpost in which his research team seems to have killed himself. It turned out that a small parasite that had been found in the ice had infected the research team. The parasite attaches to the brain and causes paranoia and madness. Soon, no one will be able to say who they can trust, or who is infected or not. <br /> <br /> This episode was a direct tribute to John Carpenters' great horror film, "The THING". The Thing takes place in Antarctica and a team of scientists discovers a destroyed outpost in which its occupants have been killed or have committed suicide. A stranger who had been buried in the ice for 10,000 years had been thawed. He has the ability to imitate any form of life. therefore, the main characters can no longer separate their friends from their enemies. Believe me This is one of the most exciting and stress-filled horror movies you've ever seen. if you liked the episode ICE, I advise you to see it. Or if you only saw the thing, I advise you to see ICE. <br /> <br /> ICE is the best direct tribute / tribute to The thing I've ever seen John Carpenter, and he lives up to his inspiration. some of the best X-Files episodes. I give him a 10/10.
