THE SENTIMENT of the need to make the referee play to the taste of the public and political correctness always manages to put us under the skin. It seems that these self-designated, self-superior and pseudo-intellectual types appear everywhere; whether in his family, church or bowling league. <br /> <br /> These are the guys who would like society to completely ignore and ignore everything that preceded us; unless, of course, anything "that" does not run counter to today's "acceptable" language, general manners and "norms" of "correct" behavior. <br /> <br /> That's why in recent days, high-tech book etchers have targeted much of what has been Hollywood's greatest achievement; namely, their participation in our own allied propaganda through themed films and non-selfish films. <br /> <br /> COLD brutally since its generation, the forbidden code and the list of Now unacceptable extend to war cartoons that do not meet the new attitudes "official" delicate and socially designed by society; that these "thought policemen" imposed on us. <br /> <br /> We were really surprised to see that there seems to be volumes of such short and lively subjects. We are aware of the majority of them, among the LOONEY TUNES and MERRIE MELODIES of Warner Brothers; featuring Bugs, Daffy, Elmer & Porky, all in conflict with Hitler, Goerring, 'Il Duce', Tojo and others. Surprisingly, we found many drawings by MGM, Walt Disney, Lantz, Paramount-Famous Studios and Fleischer Brothers. <br /> <br /> YOU ARE A SAP MR. JAP (Famous Studios / Paramount Pictures, 1942) is an excellent example of what we are talking about. <br /> <br /> BE virtually indistinguishable from the caricatures that were produced by the studios of Max and Dave Fleischer before the 1941 coup that moved them, bringing the new name of "Famous" Studios, YOU ' RE A SAP MR. JAP did not have any of the fictitious base elements that would reduce Popeye Cartoons' last day to the short film level of the ultimate formula. <br /> <br /> We all remember how we would have Popeye and Olive Oyl together. Enter Bluto, usually the hiss wolf representative and an acceptable on-screen version of a man's reaction to female pulchritude. Olive falls under the less than respectable attentions of Bluto; until he becomes a bit too physical and never too scrambled, "Hey Babe, why not a kiss?" At this point, we hear "Help! Help, Popeye and the little sailor show up to save the day, they're loaded with a musty spinach can!" Do not overdo it, Schultz? Again, this cartoon of JAP SAP does not look like Oh, sure, it follows the scenario of Popeye's current presence in the US Navy.The Fleischer brothers put the little guy in service in 1941 to conform to the country's mood and as a gesture of open support for the men who are being recruited in the first version of Peacetime in US history: Max and Dave even put Popeye on board the mythical Battleship, the USS Pensyltucky. > <br /> OUR remark is: YOU ARE A SAP MR JAP and others, like SPINACH FER In the UK, the Theater program is not a comic book for the relief of comics, but rather a kind of grouping of editorial caricatures very similar to those of all "major metropolitan newspapers". always an illustrations panel, have symbolic characters highly representative of nations, ideas and ideals, such as just and lasting peace. In most cases, the hero (Popeye, Bugs Bunny or anyone) is alone with the symbol of the Enemy. Both are highly exaggerated visual metaphors for the abstract concept and thought; even if they are wrapped in humorous traps for greater palatability. <br /> <br /> OUR liberal stupidity (the antithesis of intelligence) may not be seen this way; but for this type of behavior, they are only neo-Nazi book burners. <br /> <br /> PLEASE allow future generations to see and appreciate a vision of both historical and humorous past events. <br /> <br /> POODLE SCHNITZ !!
