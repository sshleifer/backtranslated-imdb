I recently praised "The China Syndrome" mainly because I read that it was this film that inspired ABC to direct "The Day After". The "syndrome", however, is more of a thriller than a drama. The film is quite political, but I fully agree with its message that nuclear power, while extremely efficient, is far too dangerous for everyday use. The risks are just too high. Let's hope that those responsible for real nuclear power plants are much more responsible and ethical than those described in the film. However, given that the actual near-disaster of Three Mile Island occurred a few months after the release of this film, this calls into question this reality. (In fairness, it was probably a case of incompetence rather than corruption.) <br /> <br /> "Syndrome" is not only critical to energy nuclear, but also modern media, similar to "Network". but much more serious. As a print journalist, I know quite well how people perceive the media. but it was a bit scary to see that even in the '70s the TV news was already selling. When Jane Fonda's character tries to convince her boss to let her do real news instead of deceit, she is advised not to try the change, because "research" shows that people prefer a pretty girl to do things. fluffy, not hard news. <BR/> <br /> What really makes the film memorable is the incredible suspense generated by its last third. During this period, the viewer constantly fears for the life of the protagonists, that the danger comes from the gangsters hired or the potential collapse of the nuclear power station. And this very last scene - I will not reveal it, of course - but you will guess. <br /> <br /> Finally, I had a clear impression watching the film that seemed to be more like a TV movie than a real theatrical movie. This could be due to the fact that the rental band I was watching was quite old and unformatted for TV screens as are videos and DVDs.
