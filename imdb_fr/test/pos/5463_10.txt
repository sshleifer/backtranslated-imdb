As a former TV publisher, I can say that this is as authentic as possible. This even led Letterman's producer (considered a source) to resign (possibly) in real life. Letterman was scandalized (OK, so a wacky thing, he threw a softball at a succession of tires, total manufacture) but the main information is hilarious, as proves the ridiculous bidding war for Letterman when decided to leave NBC in Leno with an agent who was not ready for the match, but let the show go (almost to a disastrous exit) out of his loyalty. If some of you do not understand why Letterman is jealous so far, watch this tape.
