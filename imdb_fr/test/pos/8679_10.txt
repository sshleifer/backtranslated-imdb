I must say that it's the best movie I've ever seen. I know that on this site, it has only received negative reviews, but for once, I would like to be the right person who gives a good review of the best movie in the world. I find the movie extremely funny, and the perfect mix of everything. it makes me feel all kinds of emotions when I look at it, and I do not get tired of it. the soundtracks are brilliant. I love it, I understand why people may not like it as much as I do, but I do not understand how people could hate it. The film is 100% brilliant. Blur is incredible. I had never realized that Australian films could be so good, and I did not realize that I could watch a movie, so many times in a single day without getting fed up. I think everyone should look at it, whether it's to get an idea of ​​what life was like in a younger age, or to see what you expect when you reach the end of grade 12.
