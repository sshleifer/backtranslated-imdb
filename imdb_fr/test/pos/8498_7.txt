If someone had given me a push for about 15 minutes in 'Ray' and asked me what I thought about Jamie Foxx in the lead role, it would have been time to look up. After all, what is this (fictional) person talking about? It was not Jamie Foxx on the big screen. It was Ray Charles. This is one of the best performances made by anyone in recent years. Like the soundtrack, Jamie as Ray is a brilliant shine. <br /> <br /> The blind genius of Soul (who took a revolutionary step of mixing gospel with R & B) died during production. The movie about his troubled life is good, not great. Taylor Hackford's direction and James L. White script follow the outline of the used biopic. Super talented youngsters struggle against adversity, reach greatness while self-destructing, and recover from the bottleneck for a happy ending. The film shows Charles's flaws (heroin abuse, chronic kidnapping, persistent bastard hell), even though his music is beautiful. <br /> <br /> Kerry Washington and Regina King play the lead role in the life of Ray, his long-suffering wife and the long-time mistress, Ray. The two actresses correspond to the stride of Foxx. What leads him to a different level, however, is his deep understanding and his mysterious usurpation of the great musician. The entire cast is effective, especially Sharon Warren as his stubborn mother and Curtis Armstrong as a musical performer. Hackford's stars will probably be rewarded with trophies and - even better - by larger roles. <br /> <br /> I was not a Ray Charles aficionado before "Ray". Apparently, the film has left a lot behind (like all biopics), but this image is both a treat for the old-fashioned crowd and a dark investigation of a shiny / troubled man. For those who moan that Foxx does not really sing (as if it diminishes his performance), go for a hike. In any case, no actor can sing like Mr. Charles. You can not have everything. What the talented star does in this picture is about as close to "everything" as we'll probably see for a moment.
