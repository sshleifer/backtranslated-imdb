This is one of the best and funniest comic series I've ever seen! All the characters are brilliant. <br /> <br /> Mr. Slatt (David Bamber) is a very very irritated man, irritated by everything and by anyone. <br /> <br /> He wants to do things and handle situations the best he can, but he never does things right and only gets himself in trouble. Unsupported by his wife, Janet, who is only trying to plunge him deeper and deeper into the troubles he is getting into (and really does not need help at all!). <br /> <br /> All characters are played / portrayed with brilliance. Just imagine sending your kids to a school like this. <br /> <br /> It's amazing that people do not like this (some may not be able to play the many word games, which are featured several times a year). <br /> <br /> It is also amazing that there is still no DVD. There are only 2 series! <br /> <br /> So, please, release it, let it go! So that fans can enjoy and enjoy it! <br /> <br /> Try it, you'll like it !!! <br /> <br /> Some names and words of the series: Pumpman, Helmet Man, Hot Bitch, Mount Suzy, Travis Fellatio, Cockfoster, Arshead (and many others).
