Dee Snider was inspired to make a two-part song by a horror movie. This film he wrote / directed / produced and played in detail the topics of these songs (Horror-Terria, TwistedSister / Stay Hungry). People have pointed out that he must have a sick mind to put something like this out. I do not hear anyone commenting on Stephen King, Wes Craven, Dean Koontz or Alfred Hitchcock in his day. The film describes a modern psychotic created by current trends in society. Personally, I thought it was pretty well done by pure imagination and inspiration, without the benefit of a big budget and interviews with real victims / criminals. This film is perfect if you want something that can give you nightmares and make you back away from the possible and the probable. IT COULD ARRIVE !!
