In fact, I'm going to admit that I'm a political junkie, so it touched me, but the erratic nature of Mrs. Green (yes, I know what they did to her), but the end was so blurry and totally inconsistent with the movie. himself. <br /> <br /> Why did not Barry L and his team let us wonder what he was going to do? Let us debate it. <br /> <br /> Instead, they have this bullshit end "oh I'm not worth it" and it just shows that when the chips are down, it's better to leave the table instead of doubling . Stop the end of Disney and put a bow on it. Life is not easy, they should have had the courage to give the backbone to the main character. <br /> <br /> We had to listen to the rhetoric throughout the film ... and then it turned into tears and stupidity, Mrs. Green's inept behavior (when shit was out of her system) had just given a ridiculous ending to the film that was the icing on the cake.
