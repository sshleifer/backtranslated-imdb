The film begins with an old grumpy Broadway producer (exceptionally well played by actor Richard Carle), led by a man who hopes to sell him a story for a forthcoming play. However, there is a big storm and their car gets stuck in the mud and they are forced to look for a place to spend the night. Fortunately, there is a manor nearby although it seems strange that the people inside know the author and he did not realize that it was a man's house. he knew (and despised). However, although this seems to be bad writing and artificial writing, it is not part of ... because it is part of an elaborate ruse on the part of the writer to leave a group of actors at home to play his plot. However, halfway through the trick, the producer and his assistant cross-examination find out that the mystery of the murder taking place at home is wrong and thinks that this whole thing is pretty funny. What no one realizes, however, is that a maniac who escapes is released and is about to engage in this small artificial plot, creating wonderful twists. So when it looks like there's a real murder, the actors are really terrified while Carle and his sidekick are convinced it's a hoax. While I've explained some aspects of the plot, you still have a lot of things to consider, and it's probably to entertain and guess. <br /> <br /> Since this is a B movie in the public domain, I certainly did NOT have very high hopes for this little movie. However, I was delighted when the film turned out to be a much better than average film - with a very interesting and innovative twist of the old plot reminiscent of a dark and stormy night spent in a mansion. In addition, although the film's script was very good, the dialogue was even better - with a lot of sparkling wit and a cheerful look. Plenty of pleasant surprises and well worth your time.
