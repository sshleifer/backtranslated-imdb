Jack and Kate first meet the doctor Daniel Farady, then the psychics Miles Straume and they demonstrate that they did not come to the island with the intention of saving the survivors. Locke and his group find anthropologist Charlotte Staples Lewis and Ben Linus shooting at him. Meanwhile, Jack's group finds pilot Frank Lapidus, who landed on the helicopter with minor damage repairable. Jack forces Miles to say his true intention. The second episode of the fourth season returns to the island with four new characters, stops the confusion that reigns between the two characters. it seems that this will eventually be the beginning of the explanations that I (and most fans and viewers) expect to be provided in "Lost". Why the government's interest in Ben Linus and how he is informed about the boat are some of the questions I would expect to see in future episodes. My vote is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): Not available
