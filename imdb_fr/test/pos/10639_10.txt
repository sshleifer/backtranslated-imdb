Some users are confused about the identity of the gunmen coming down the steps of the "Odessa Staircase" sequence. These men are not Cossacks, but troops of the regular army. <br /> <br /> The Cossacks arrive on the scene a little later. These are the men on horses cutting the crowd with their swords. <br /> <br /> To Russian history experts: Correct me if I'm wrong. <br /> <br /> But there are a few lines in the movie that no one apparently commented on. After the takeover of Potemkin, a member of the crowd on the shore said, "Kill the Jews!" This only appears for a few seconds on the screen, but it is there. <br /> <br /> What cruelty typical of history, not only in Russia, but in so many other countries, to immediately, instinctively and instinctively blame the Jews domestic problem! <br /> <br /> Maybe other parts of the film are not factual but the outcry against the Jews is real. Any comments, anyone? <br /> <br /> Also, why can not English speakers learn to pronounce the name "Potyomkin" instead of "Potemkin"? In Russian, it is necessary to distinguish the two possible pronunciations of "e": either "you" or "yo". Sometimes two points are used to distinguish these two pronunciations, but usually the difference simply has to be memorized.
