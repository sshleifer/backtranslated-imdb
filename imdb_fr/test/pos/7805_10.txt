There are movies that are loved by almost everyone you meet and yet, it turns out that they are box office failures. Andaz Apna Apna, an intelligent and hilarious comedy falls into this category. For once, an Indian director kept in mind the sensibilities of the public and did not release a stereotypical hoax Kader Khan type. The film is about two guys who dream of wealth and try to do it by courting the daughter of a millionaire. A humorous drama unfolds as many complexities surface in the story. Complexity adds to the pure comedy of the entire plot. Aamir Khan plays the clever little, while Salman Khan gives an unexpected performance as an idiot type. The villain played by Paresh Rawal and his henchmen Junior Ajit and "Kaliaa" make you laugh while you sleep. Although the film borrows from many other films, despite poor shots and sometimes "strong", it remains one of the few "funny" movies that Bombay has created after films like Padosan, Golmal and other Amol Plaekar. . It is unfortunate that it has not worked well at the box office, because it means that producers are using formulas and creativity is being abandoned.
