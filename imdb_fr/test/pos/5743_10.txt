Forget about Samara / Sadako and Jason ... <br /> <br /> Horror has a new name: GRANNY. The plot is simple but effective. The actors are good (congratulations for "Michelle" and the killer) and the dialogues are even quite intelligent. From start to finish, the action will take your breath away, you will not be able to escape ... There is blood, terrible murders, funny moments and a feeling of perversity far beyond any rule. "Already seen" ? Certainly NOT: "Granny" is not another slash movie, it's really a classic in itself ... It deserves the success it has had and there is even more success to come with its reissue. Congratulations!
