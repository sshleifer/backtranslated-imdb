A fantastic film and very neglected. Gary has never been so beautiful and Ingrid is more beautiful than in any other movie. If you do not believe, watch the movie. Every member of the cast is wonderful; love scenes between Gary and Ingrid will race your pulse! The story is great, the script is of Oscar caliber. Do not miss this movie !!
