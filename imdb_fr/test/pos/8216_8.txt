This movie was suspenseful and fun to watch. As a fan of this type of film, I enjoyed that. The premise is a little scary but the fact that I did not write it down as a 10 is that the movie was a little exaggerated in some places. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS: <br /> <br /> Cmon: Nobody could identify this girl? I understand the concept of isolation but it is hard for me to believe that SOMEONE-PEOPLE would not have been able to identify this girl as Angela Bennet. It was above the stage, as was the scene where she went to someone's desk and started typing. It was basically a very good movie, full of suspense and that holds your interest. Dennis Miller was super like Allen, REALLY believable, Bullock was good as a reserved and reserved computer specialist, the bad guys all underrated. <br /> <br /> I think the film's PREMISE was really different and scary. Nowadays, who knows what could happen? But some of the most important scenes prevented this film from being a 10. 8 out of 10.
