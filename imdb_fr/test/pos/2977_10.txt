I was attracted to "Friends" by the soundtrack composed by the very young and famous Elton John I had seen at a club in the nearby city of Houston. I had no idea of ​​the emotions and the impact of the film. Recently, a song that Heart called "Seasons" brought me back to the movie, and then I found Elton John's song "Friends" thinking it was the same song ... it's been 35 years. Anyway, the flow of emotions from "Friends" came back like an old photo of your first real love. I do not remember how the film hit me but the details of the production, the plot, etc., so forgive me a rather mediocre review. I remember taking a few special friends to an appointment to see the movie and they were as moved and tearful at the end as I was. I am both worried and nervous to find a copy and see it now. So many films that seemed so important to me at the time (ie "The Graduate" "Easy Rider") now seem just stupid and I do not want it to fall into the same category. But, I'll find it and if it's silly, then at least I can turn my wife into an exceptional soundtrack ... no ... exceptional. When we met, we experienced this with "Last Tango in Paris". The young people I work with (I'm 56) respect my opinions, but it's hard to explain the feelings of the sixties and the movies and songs that reflect such feelings, but that seem a little "old" now. I just can not know if the aging process is about movies ... or me. "Friends" is a very special, sensitive and wonderful film. I am sure that will bring back a lot of special feelings. Of course, rent or buy a copy ... The Indies were not so close to the kind they were today.
