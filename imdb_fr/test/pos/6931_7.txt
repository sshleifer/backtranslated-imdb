I was at the world premiere of this film and I even met Todd several times in town (once at Olive Garden). Todd is not a bad guy, he's just a small filmmaker, with little, if any, budget and big dreams. <br /> <br /> As for the film, it's good if you like zombie movies with very little plot and a lot of blood and guts. You can see Kansas City sites and a lot of raw meat, what's better? :-) Look for the same 2 dozen people playing different zombies (with just a change of clothes or hats). You can have a good drinking game with this movie, take a picture every time you see the same zombie in a different shirt.
