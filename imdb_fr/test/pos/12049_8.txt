The films of Shahrukh Khan and Yash Chopra have never disappointed. Dilwale Dulhania The Jayenge is a romantic classic. Dil To Pagal Hai was cool and perfect for watching. Mohabbatein remains one of my favorite movies. And Veer-Zaara was magical. Darr, although not the best, is a romantic thriller that differs from the aforementioned movies, but is well worth the detour. And SRK, who blew me away with an excellent performance at Baazigar, repeats a nasty act. And this time, he is assisted by an experienced Juhi Chawla and Sunny Deol. <br /> <br /> Before commenting on the actors 'game, it's not only the actors' game, but the magnificent scenario that is worth it. It's the writing that compliments the great acting game. The story is captivating, but it's the characterization that stands out. The comedy track is fine. But the film has a tendency to change the novel too. The spectator is doomed to lose interest and you will make some yawns. But the film is still good. <br /> <br /> Shahrukh Khan is brilliant in his role as author. Shahrukh Khan is again friendly and cruel. You have to cry at the end. Juhi Chawla is decent. His cries will surely become annoying after a while. But in facial expression, she is excellent. But his final scene is brilliant (although it has been overshadowed by SRK). She has a role supported by the author that makes her very friendly. Sunny Deol is adequate. His character was very friendly, but too perfect. And it gets boring after a while. He does a good job though. Anupam Kher is really funny, but his role was a little out of place. Tanvi Azmi supports well. <br /> <br /> The songs are nice and come at the right time. Jadoo Teri Nazar (Magic At Your Sight) is my favorite song, and the presentation is very similar to the movie of the 90's. You're Mere Saamne (You're in front of me) and Likha Hai (Written Here) are beautiful love songs. Darwaza Band Kar Lo (Close the door) is also a decent love song. The instrumental song is danced to perfection as well as the naughty wedding song Solah Button. The film may not be perfect, but your time is worth it, especially if your favorite actor is there.
