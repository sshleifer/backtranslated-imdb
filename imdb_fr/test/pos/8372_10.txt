Sam Lion (Jean Paul Belmondo) discovers that he must take a little rest, because all his entourage relies a lot on him and organizes his own death. When he discovers that those he loved and still loves are in need, he calls on Albert Duvivier (Richard Anconina). In search of his own past, his own desires, this fabulous film by Claude Lelouch is a quest for a mature man. <br /> <br /> Built like all Lelouch movies, the movie starts with constant flashbacks Be curious, especially in scenes where Paul Belmondo (who looks a lot like his father) plays a young Sam Lion while Sam Lion is in the same room - a back-and-forth sequence that takes a second to grab. <br /> <br /> One of the most elaborate works of Lelouch, The itinerary of a child is a story not to be missed.
