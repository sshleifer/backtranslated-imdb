For years, I had a distant memory of watching this movie, I searched the net to find it somewhere and I could not find it anywhere, so I thought it must have been faded away. <br /> <br /> ... my grandmother showed me a box that she had sent to the Daily Mail and I thought it would not be decent, but to my surprise, among the other jewels, there was The Water Babies! I had not been so excited for a long time! It's a very good light film, the songs are not memorable. If I were a child, I would have stayed in my head longer. Unfortunately, it was just a movie I had watched as I liked 10 years ago, when I was a little eccentric. And looking now, the animation is terrible! and the recreated voices they make to give richness to the sound in the movies are totally off! But no matter if you are a child, you never think about these things, even if their main boy is about 10 years old and sounds like a boy in puberty. <br /> <br /> An excellent classic movie for children!
