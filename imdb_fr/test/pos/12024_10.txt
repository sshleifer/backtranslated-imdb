Dan Finnerty and the Dan Band are so good that they have to be seen to believe. Does anyone have a copy of the Bravo concert for sale? Please, if there is an upcoming version, let us all know. I visited the Bravo site, but no date is scheduled for a rehearsal on behalf of the most attractive guys ever choreographed, the Dan Band. What a tremendous energy they release by throwing themselves with the cute attitude of an American boy, based on the fact that sensitivity to butch is wrapped in glitter and tears, making men and women fall in love with it. I hope enough people can influence Bravo's powers to bring the show back into our lives as a biannual special.
