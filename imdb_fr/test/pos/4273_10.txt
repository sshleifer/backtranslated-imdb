I love the TV contest. I hate seeing it end. There are so many talented candidates. It's a pity that only 2 are chosen. I like to watch judges too. They are sometimes as entertaining as competitors. I watched the show faithfully every Sunday night. Do not miss it for the world. It's the best reality TV show on television. Good luck to all the candidates, even though I have already chosen both I would like to see Danny and Sandy on Broadway. I can not wait to see if my decisions are correct. I do not know how long the contest will last until Danny and Sandy are chosen, but I will continue to monitor until the end.
