El Padrino has just been released in Europe and is really right. This film with its big distribution - Damian Chapa (Blood in the blood), Robert Wager, Jennifer Tilly, Robert Wagner and many others) - is the best gangster movie since SCARFACE. A movie that everyone MUST SEE. 2 hours full of action with an incredible amazing waterfall !!!! <br /> <br /> GRACIAS JENNIFER !!!! We are looking forward to the second part !!!! Does anyone know if there will be one? Keep up the good work !!! I liked it !!
