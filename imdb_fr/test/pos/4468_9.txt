As far as I know, I have seen most of Lucio Fulci's films, with the exception of some of the newer movies that come out on DVD, and I must say that was his best "pre-zombie" offer. In fact, he beats his latest films with flying colors. It's a story of superstition and suspicion in a small Italian town in the middle of nowhere, where young boys are dying mysteriously. It's not a mystery how they died, but rather who does it. Is it a woman that townspeople have always considered a witch? Is this a young woman who lives a lot of drugs in a modern and chic house on the outskirts of the city? Is it the idiot of the village, who gets caught early for being in the wrong place at the wrong time? You'll only know if you're watching, and you should, because it's a mysterious thriller of the highest order, or should I say, a "giallo". I've seen it before, but it's been a long time and, a second time, it was still as powerful as the first time. For those of you who only know Lucio Fulci for his zombie movies, well, open your mind to that because it's worth seeing and even though the "monsters" are human, they're also naughty than anything that was dredged in his later films. 9 out of 10 stars, to see! Please....
