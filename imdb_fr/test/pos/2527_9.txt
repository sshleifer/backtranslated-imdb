It is probably the best film of the director Hector Babenco. It shows a Brazilian reality unknown to foreigners, which is the same one that haunts all Latin American countries: poverty and the instinct of survival. The most affected people in this reality are children who are generally orphans, or abandoned by their poor parents who have to fend for themselves in a society known as "dog eating", often falling into the rift of delinquency, prostitution and crime. . Very well played and with a "no-frills" approach, this film will arrive to you, Great Story Story, a must-see movie about anyone's collection. The main role was attributed to Fernando Ramos da Silva, a young boy who fell into the crime wave, killed a few years later during a robbery. I suggest people watch the movie "Who Killed Pixote?" so you can get a deeper insight into the life of these characters. Some characters in the film had a similar fate, some died and others are in jail. Nevertheless, this film will last a long time in your memory
