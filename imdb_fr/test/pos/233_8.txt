I'm not a big fan of musicals, but I've always loved Mrs. Hayworth's looks. So I decided to try. <br /> <br /> This is perhaps the best showcase for the talented Mrs. Hayworth. She has never been so beautiful in a film (with the possible exception of "Gilda", where she is the sex symbol par excellence). <br /> <br /> Rita is more than well assisted by Gene Kelly and Phil Silvers. The comedy may be dated, but it's still a lot of fun. Kelly makes one of his dances of stunt, dancing with the image of himself from a window. <br /> <br /> But Rita drives all this movie. An excellent cast, starring Otto Kruger and the always wonderful Eve Arden is not afraid. <br /> <br /> Rita sings, Rita dances, while looking incredibly beautiful! The music may be lacking classical, but the lyrics of most melodies are rather clever. <br /> <br /> I find that this film works better than "Gilda", which I consider an imperfect film. To Mrs. Hayworth's credit, she also drives "Gilda", and Gilda drives crazy any red-haired man. <br /> <br /> The film holds well after all these years. A lot of leg sweets for the male audience is a good bonus!
