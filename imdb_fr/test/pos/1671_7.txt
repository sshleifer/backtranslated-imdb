As far as I'm concerned, this film noir had two totally different objectives compared to the black films that I'm used to seeing: 1 - the set is Paris, France; 2 - There is a scene of 28 minutes without dialogue. <br /> <br /> Both make this film a bit unique, at least for English-language film fans. In fact, an American, Jules Dussain, shot the film, so it's not just a European film. At first, I was disappointed after watching the first 40 minutes. It's an expensive DVD and I was bored. However, once this silent segment has started - the holdup (you already know what it's all about), the movie has grown in size and continues to improve. <br /> <br /> In fact, I thought the best part of the story was what happened after the heist. The best part of the whole movie was cinematography. This is why the record is worth having. It's an excellent film noir photography and a real roadmap for those who have never seen Paris ... and it's Paris in the mid-1950s. There are many streets and Parisian buildings soaked rain, but interesting, which I found fascinating to see. In fact, there were many more of these beautiful shots than London in the much better known film, The Third Man. <br /> <br /> The main actor here, Jean Servais, I think his name is, is also interesting to see. Someone described his face as a cross between Humphrey Bogart and Harry Dean Stanton, and that sums up the situation perfectly. A warning for those who do not expect blasphemy or nudity in a classic movie. It's France, not the United States, so there's a bit of both here. I enjoy the DVD offering the choice of subtitles or a dubbed version, too.
