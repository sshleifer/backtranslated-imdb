Good drama / comedy, with two good performances by Hunter & Hurt, but Albert Brooks steals every scene in which he finds himself. With a good script, this film skyrockets and gives everyone the chance to show his talent as an actor. And although Joan Cusack does not participate much, she has one if this is the funniest scene of the film. The highlight of the film for me was Albert Brooks' talk about the devil. Only one disadvantage is that it goes a little slowly in places. And the role of Brooks was totally interested me only that of Hunter or Hurt. I give him a 7 out of 10.
