Mike Nichols' film "Charlie Wilson's War", set in the 1980s, tells how the main character (played by Tom Hanks) managed to wage a secret war against the Russkies by helping Afghan forces. Of course, we know how much it has worked in the long run, but fortunately the film does not ignore unpleasant side effects. <br /> <br /> The cast is star-studded, with Tom Hanks and Julia Roberts being one of Hollywood's most profitable stars. As a bonus, you'll find Philip Seymour Hoffman, versatile, in a memorable secondary role, for which he was nominated for an Oscar. I'm not a big fan of Roberts but Hanks is always reliable. Nevertheless, I can not really adopt him as a drug addict, although the real Charlie Wilson seems just as eminently likeable as Hanks. Aside from the big three, however, there is not much to notice, even under a recognizable name like Amy Adams. <br /> <br /> The story is interesting and is supported by an excellent script by Aaron Sorkin. The verbal interaction between the main characters is excellent and full of memorable lines. Subsequent events triggered by the war are not ignored, although the scenes of booksellers honoring Wilson seem to me too serious to get the bitter-sweet atmosphere that was probably wanted. Overall, Nichols' management is flawless and admirably follows the action of the script. <br /> <br /> It's a movie that, like Charlie Wilson himself, has flaws but is nevertheless disarmingly sympathetic. Definitely recommended for fans of the three stars and for those looking for an engaging political drama with a light feel.
