I would like to order this film for women in treatment. I think it's a good movie to watch. I can not very well not have been on ebay and all the other websites to order this movie. Now, I'm asking for help to specify where I can edit this movie or what to do to get one. I will love to show this movie. yes, I was like this movie and a lot of people here in treatment to see how people can change their lives and move on. I think Markie Post played that shot very well. She is an excellent actor and I like her films. and if you have another film on addiction, I would like to order the women and men at the treatment center so that they can watch others go through what they have experienced in life.
