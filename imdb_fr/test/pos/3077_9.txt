This film was great, if you want a movie with puns and non-stop laughs, then this is for you. This movie was great because he took Robin Hood seriously and could please the whole family and make him laugh. I saw this film for the first time at the age of 10 and I learned the most. This film is also great because it makes fun of everything involved: "By order of the King's financial secretary, H and R. Blockhead?" <br /> <br /> not his liar with the "claw" or the saw. <br /> <br /> This film is worth watching
