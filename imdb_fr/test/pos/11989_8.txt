Amazing, one of my favorite movies downstairs. I guess I can be proud of not liking what "the general population" tends to want. Jackie Mason is hilarious in this film, as is Randy Quaid. I can never get tired of his "strong arm" tactic, as in Moving. He was also notable in Lampoon's Christmas holidays. I love this guy.
