Dead Man Walking, absolutely brilliant, in tears at the end! You can not watch this film and not think about the problems it raises; how can you justify murder (whether it is murder or the death penalty) and to what extent is forgiveness possible (not only in a spiritual way)? Do not watch this movie when you are down! But look at it !!!
