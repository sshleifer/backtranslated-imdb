This is an excellent film that I watch since I was 6 years old with my older sister. it's the type of movie you can watch over and over again and always laugh, smile and cry every time without tiring, like other movies. it is a film that will live forever through generations of families. I like it :) when ranking 1-10 in my case, I would easily note 9.9 each time. <br /> <br /> This is a film about the change of a girl (baby) and her first boyfriend (Johnny), their relationships within the family, baby's world vision changes and Johnny during their relationship. DIRTY DANCING WILL ALWAYS LIVE AS A TIMELESS CLASSIC. thank you sorry if only for the short comment.
