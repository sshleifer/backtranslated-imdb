Rivers Flow North tells a well-told story about the struggle of two peoples to live their lives in the face of "progress" and development. In addition to enjoying the film as entertainment, I also learned a lot about rural life in New England in the late 1920s. <br /> <br /> Cinematography captured the raw beauty of northern Vermont and staged gave life to the film. Very well done for a low budget film, produced locally. I found Michael J. Fox's weakest character in the movie, but Rip Torn and Tantoo Cardinal have two of the best performances I've seen in a long time. I was saddened that I was not named best actress that year (I guess the movie was too "small" to be considered).
