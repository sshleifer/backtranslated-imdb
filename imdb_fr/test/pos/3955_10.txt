I recently saw Blind Spot in Coyoacan, where it attracted a large crowd and a fairly intense discussion. I really admired the story and the visual approach. The action is frightening and the mood of loneliness that the film projects is amazing. There is a lot of beauty in the melancholy that surrounds these three unsuitable heroes. Not only in the desert but in the city too. My best scene was after the boy discovered his friends in the apartment, then skateboarded through all the city's remarkable lights. You really feel for this guy. I had never heard of actors before but I liked all three. I think they did a great job on their journey to self-discovery. All in all, it's an incredibly cool and suspenseful movie. I still have a lot of pictures in my mind.
