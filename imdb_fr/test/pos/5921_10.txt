It's a good story. Although there are some parts of Jimmy Stewart Cornball, it's mostly a compelling story about an individual with a compelling motivation, vision and sense of adventure - to say the least. At the end of the day, this is one of my favorites to watch and I've done dozens of times - that is until someone steals it from a bag I left on a plane on a flight to California! <br /> <br /> Some have spoken of too many backtracking, but I do not know of a better way to keep a long and interesting flight. For those of us who fly, the flight can be hours of boredom punctuated by moments of terror. I would not have wanted to see the shortcut at all. The oppressive need for sleep and the drone and the loneliness that surrounds it are part of the story. <br /> <br /> There are many areas that I particularly like, such as the Long Island take-off and the Paris night landing (Wow, everything's been changed with us and the French since!). The scenes of construction of the plane and the record flight of San Diego are interesting, as well as the incident in the Atlantic on the pack ice (which, as I understand, is not quite true but occurred during the flight to San Diego). <br /> <br /> It seems like one of Lindbergh's most valuable assets lies in his enlightened followers, as well as his perseverance. <br /> <br /> Some of the lines that come to mind sometimes include "Pull the holds! on the take-off stage and "I hope I do not have to use it this way" when describing the submarine-like "periscope" to the lady who lent her a mirror so he could see better his overhead projector instruments. <br /> This movie is not for everyone but it's definitely for me. I hope they will do it on DVD soon so that I can replace my stolen version!
