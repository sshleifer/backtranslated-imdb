I really enjoyed this movie and I am not a fan of classical music. The story of this tough street kid who discovered classical music and changed was nice to watch, without being sentimental or too incredible, although some details make me scratch my head (Frankie and his dog can live in the basement of the school without any students or teachers who discovered him, where he ate, for bathing, had he ever had spare clothes, what had he fed his dog? not that it was important to inform the police of looking for a missing boy, but let him live in the basement indefinitely? :-)). But we can let such unrealistic details slip and simply enjoy the touching, fun and slightly suspenseful story (for me, anyway) and wonderfully talented kids. <br /> <br /> I loved the scene with the mothers, shoulder to shoulder. on the steps forbidding the police to enter the school: I doubt they are getting away now. And I liked the kindness of the boy that Frankie stole from turning the tables on him (though it never really went anywhere), and Frankie's friends who helped him in the end. <br /> <br /> In the end, an excellent movie for everyone!
