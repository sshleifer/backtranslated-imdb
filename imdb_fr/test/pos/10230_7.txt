I enjoyed this movie. The look of these mutants, as well as the tone of the film, are very good. Plus, David Cronenberg as Philip K. Decker was great! I wonder if his personality is exactly the same in real life (with the exception of murders of course). <br /> <br /> I was impressed by the creatures of this film, although this film probably had a relatively low budget, the mutants / creatures / monsters looked great, especially from 1990. It's is a unique film and not shit. It makes me want to look for a new reading of the news. This is an interesting film because it shows that humans can be monsters and that "monsters" are those who possess humanity.
