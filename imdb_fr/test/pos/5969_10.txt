Reading the reviews, I am struck by the obvious effect of this wonderful movie on viewers. But, how can you watch this film without realizing that this astute dialogue was a subtle and audacious reproach to the authorities "controlling" what was then the USSR at this point in history? It was not souls only at the time and place of the revealed action. The questions, superficially asked, are naively provocative when they are addressed to the here and now. Who are the real "collaborators"? I marvel that the writer has remained in prison. I have read somewhere that significant stress can be a catalyst for the production of great art. This film is a misdirected masterpiece, which seems to be going in one direction, while asking the audience to "look over my shoulder, at what I'm really talking about". How brave.
