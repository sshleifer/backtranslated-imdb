Believe it or not, the Mona Lisa was stolen once and was missing for almost two years. In 1911, La Gioconda (better known as Mona Lisa) by Leonardo da Vinci was kidnapped in the Louvre by a small thief (and former employee of the Louvre) who allegedly sent back to his native Italy the most important work of art. famous world. His actions after the flight make it seem more likely that he intended to sell the painting for his personal benefit. (Of course, he had no hope of finding a buyer.) The Mona Lisa was quietly brought back to the Louvre on the very last day of 1913, where she remained since, except for occasional loans. When "Arsène Lupine" was released in 1932 (twenty years after the theft), most of the audience would have remembered this crime of 1911 and their knowledge would have given a certain likelihood to this film. "Arsene Lupine" is very enjoyable, with MGM's usual high production standards and Jack Conway's usually fast and efficient leadership. This film does not lack pleasure; what he lacks is plausibility. <br /> <br /> John Barrymore is the great criminal of the title: he specializes in the commission of "impossible" crimes, which he makes even more difficult by announcing them in advance ... but of course he always commit the crime and deceive the gendarmes. Tully Marshall has a good scene as a victim of Barrymore. Lupine has a penchant for elaborate disguises, allowing Barrymore (a "Grade A" American ham) to indulge in his own penchant for deceit. John's older brother, Lionel Barrymore, is Guerchard, the Surete detective of the Javert genre who swore to capture Lupine. <br /> <br /> Karen Morley was a very beautiful actress whose private life was full of populist political activities. On screen, she was particularly impressive in working class roles that fit her own political beliefs (like her great performance in "Our Daily Bread"). In "Arséne Lupine", Morley's naturally dark hair is bleached with a horrible blonde tone, and she's all disguised as chic outfits that make her uncomfortable rather than sexy. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS COMING. Finally, Lupine decides to steal the Mona Lisa at the Louvre. He cuts the picture of his frame, wraps the canvas and smuggles it in a basket of flowers. We see John Barrymore casually branding a tightly wound piece of cloth that allegedly is the greatest work of art in the history of mankind. I had to laugh at the filmmakers' mistake. In real life (but not in this film), da Vinci painted the Mona Lisa on a plank of poplar, so that a thief would have trouble wrapping it! <br /> <br /> Finally, Guerchard captures Lupine and transports him. departure for Le Calaboose. The scene between John and Lionel Barrymore in the police car is a pure delight, while their true affection is revealed in the dialogue of their characters. I would have found this scene implausible with two other actors. As things stand, I can not imagine anyone other than the Barrymore brothers playing these roles. Well, maybe Dennis and Randy Quaid, but barely. <br /> <br /> Do not look for a good plot here, but "Arsène Lupine" is a charming example of old-fashioned shooting. I will give 8 out of 10 points to this film.
