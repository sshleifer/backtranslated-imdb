With virtually all images of the Republic ever made, "The murder in the music hall" seems to have gone unhealthily into oblivion. A shame, because this lavishly crafted, astute and mysterious-suspenseful article, produced in a lush manner, directs an all-thrilling thriller in the spectator's way against the decor of Radio City Music Hall. A murder in one of the sumptuous apartments of the building throws suspicion on the succulent Rockettes - including Vera Ralston (who, in addition to giving an attractive performance of subtlety and vulnerability, provides some figures of dazzling production of ice skating), Helen Walker, Ann Rutherford, Julie Bishop and many other star movie starlets from the 1940s. Big, blond and handsome William Marshall (usually in musicals) chases the killer as the plot unfolds complex and more and more scary, against the most chic decorations ever seen in a film noir. The end is as surprising as this mystery of sad and sadly forgotten murder. It is worth restoring and reviving cable television, VHS or DVD. Republic has spent a considerable budget in this Grade-A production and "Murder in the Music Hall" is as slippery, annoying and extremely enjoyable as any film from the big studios of its time. POSSIBLE SPOILER: Pay attention to the rhapsodic song composed by the victim just before his death. Then, among the ceaseless chatter of showgirls in their locker room, try to locate the one who hums this fatal melody. You will discover who the killer is, just like William Marshall. Great pleasure, the kind of film they really do not, and what a loss, as much for moviegoers as for actors.
