I thought it was a great action movie. A very good role for Geena Davis. She is a very versatile actress. One of my favorites next to Angelina Jolie. In fact, I watched The Long Kiss Goodnight right after watching the new Tomb Raider movie. It made me think, Charlie or Lara? Which would win in a fight ??? In both cases, the two women are very strong characters, intelligent and fun to watch. Especially when they kick. I just hope to see Geena in another movie soon. Looks like she's been out of the projector a little too long. It would be particularly nice to see her in another movie with Samuel L. Jackson. Now they are a great duo. Watch this movie if you have not already done so. You will not be disappointed.
