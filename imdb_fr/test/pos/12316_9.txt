For his latest film, John Huston directed his daughter, Anjelica, in this adaptation of the story of "Dubliners" by James Joyce, and he has entrusted us with one of his finest achievements. <br /> <br /> It's about as impossible to film as anyone, but "The Dead" has at least one traditional story to work with. Much (if not all) of the important information in the story is in the spaces between the lines, in the thoughts and expressions of the characters - there are great moments, but they are cerebral - they are not the substance they are made movies are made of. But Huston does well, and manages an almost flawless adaptation. <br /> <br /> Anjelica is beautiful and the film is mesmerizing and powerful. <br /> <br /> Grade: A
