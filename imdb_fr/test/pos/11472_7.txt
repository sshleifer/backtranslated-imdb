You can not watch this movie for a history lesson. It was the first time I heard about the Ma Barker saga, but I could tell almost immediately that the facts were wrong. And with a little research on the Internet, I realized that I was right. Ma Barker, of course, is not the sexy and calculating woman the film describes, and apparently did not orchestrate all the schemes of bank robbery, kiddnappings and murder committed by her criminals. <br /> <br /> But do not expect a brilliant police drama. The scenario and the acting are adequate, the shootings are excessive and unrealistic, and the scene of death in slow motion is very laughable. So why did I give him a 7 out of 10? <br /> <br /> Because it was damn entertaining. Shootings are fun to watch, but deeper themes emerge between them. The film has a strong sense of intimidation of selfishness among its distribution of alpha males, each with its own agenda. And I appreciate the minimal use of de jure for the period. The sets are great, reproducing a convincing time of the 1930s. <br /> <br /> So watch this film as a cult film, and take into account the excess blood and cruelty with the very serious and unhealthy comments of the FBI man who wants to take the Barkers at any cost. In other words, do not take it too seriously, just have fun with it. And if you like that, you'll love Serial Mom.
