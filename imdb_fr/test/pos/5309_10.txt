that's what troubles me about the critics and their opinion. I usually take into account what critics say about a movie, most of the time before seeing a movie. <br /> <br /> However, I saw this one, without knowing anything about it. mainly because of the distribution. Kevin Spacey and Don Cheadle are two of the most acclaimed actors and, in my opinion, the best. and Ryan Gosling is also climbing fast. his reality and his humanity, which he releases in most of his performances, make the public really believe in the character and everything that happens to him. It's really my favorite actor of my generation. I've always found jena malone very cute, since darkie donnie, and if she chooses to continue playing the same role, then damn I will not complain. this film really touched me. I believed him. the acting was first class. as one would expect. the film left the public the ultimate goal of a good movie; the reflection and reflection that follows after the last credits. I think I have to watch it again to decipher how this movie was mistreated. I know that their criticism must be taken with a pinch of salt. at least I know now.
