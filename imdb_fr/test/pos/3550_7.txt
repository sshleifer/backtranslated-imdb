Of course, he has his pretentious moments, he plays like an art-house film, Fantasia, but he also has moments of deep beauty and humor. Omnibus movies are always a problem, but I have always been very interested. I will now note the segments individually. <br /> <br /> Nicolas Roeg - "A ballo in maschera" - This segment could very well spoil the film for some people, because it is really the worst of the whole group. It is hard to follow, mainly because it tries to adhere to a clear conspiracy (a hackney plot). The photograph is incomplete. The best thing about this is the little lesbian homoeroticism with which he can never do enough. This segment made me VERY nervous about continuing. 2/10. <br /> <br /> Charles Sturridge - "Virgine degli angeli" - a fuzzy segment, but it does not matter. The film has the best cinematography of the band, mainly because it is in a beautiful black and white. The segment is dreamlike and beautiful. 7/10. <br /> <br /> Jean-Luc Godard - "Armide" - I chose to brave this much-maligned film for the Godard and Altman segments. With Godard, I was much more impressed than I thought. I can not claim to have seen so many of his films since he did so that almost no one has seen, but, judging by what I've seen, this may be his best work since the 60s. This is the funniest segment of this film, and the most accomplished in an artistic way. Congratulations Jean-Luc! 9/10. <br /> <br /> Julien Temple - "Rigoletto" - a very entertaining segment, it is also quite predictable. Yet this story about a husband and a wife who are mistaken in the same complex is wonderfully filmed with long, complex follow-up plans that depend on the choreography carefully executed by the actors. He also has a great joke about the omnibus movies themselves. The final scene is very weak. 7/10. <br /> <br /> Bruce Beresford - "Die tote Stadt" - this short segment also concerns lovers of (I think) Venice. It's pretty, with some beautiful pictures of doves flying around the city. It's light, but nice. 7/10. <br /> <br /> Robert Altman - "The Bor√©ades" - is not one of the best segments. Unfortunately, it's more of a video clip than a conceptual short film. This implies that the occupants of an insane asylum attend a theatrical performance. The music and the images work well together, so I can at least give it credit for being a good music video. Frank Roddam - "Liebestod" - somewhat unfortunate for the segment of Beresford, this segment is very similar to him. As you can guess from my phrasing, this one struck me a lot more. This is a young man and his daughter who travel to Las Vegas for a fatalistic trip. 8/10. <br /> <br /> Ken Russell - "Nessun dorma" - perhaps the most striking segment, he plays in a fantasy world more than in reality. It's a beautiful story of a fallen angel. 8/10. <br /> <br /> Derek Jarman - "Since the day" - I've heard a lot about Jarman, and this is the first movie I've seen of him. Hope that I will see more in the future. This one is also musical-void, but it's better than the Altman split. This mainly concerns an old woman who remembers her youth. The editing and use of different film supports to represent time and emotion are very beautiful. 8/10. <br /> <br /> Bill Bryden - "I pagliacci" - this sad clown, perhaps one of the most famous tunes (especially memorable of an episode of Seinfeld), serves as a material separating each segment and the final. It's simple and it works. 7/10. <br /> <br /> Overall, I give him a solid 7/10. It's not as bad as you've heard it.
