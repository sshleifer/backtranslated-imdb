I just finished watching this movie for the first time and I must say that I am very impressed. <br /> <br /> How dark. What despair! It's nightmarish. Unbelievable. <br /> <br /> Visually stunning, several scenes are encrusted in my mind ... the first appearance of the ghostly carriage ... the soul of David Holm as it emerges from his corpse ... his mind his knees, imploring. <br /> <br /> This film tells a simple story: that of the ghostly driver of the ghost car, dedicated to collecting the souls of the dead for a year, which introduces him into the current frame of the film and then uses the flashbacks as a way to explain how David Holm finds himself in a delicate situation. <br /> <br /> I would very much like this film to be released on DVD so that more people can see it. Everyone should.
