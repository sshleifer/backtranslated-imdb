Yes, this movie is another remake. Yes, this movie can be considered a girls movie. And yes, this movie is not perfect. The Women, however, is a smart modern update on the social behaviors of all women, with an impressive cast of stars such as Meg Ryan, Debra Messing, Annette Benning and Bette Midler. <br /> The film revolves around four main characters, Mary (Ryan), her best friend, editor-in-chief, Sylvie (Benning), Alex (Jada Pinkett-Smith) and Edie (Debra Messing) and the female creature out of the ordinary responsible. for most of the film's drama, named Crystal (Eva Mendez). Mary tries to take care of her deceitful husband (who has never been seen in the film), following the advice of her friends and her mother (Candice Bergen). <br /> <br /> Apart from Mary, there is Sylvie torn between her social life and her professional life. She decided to test her moral and ethical values. Then there is the writer Alex, a lesbian with a lot of courage, but who knows how to go about it with words. And finally Edie with four girls and another baby on the way, who loves children and who has a heart in gold, with a hidden secret revealed in the end. <br /> <br /> Together, women live to take revenge, count on each other. other, and give lessons in life. But it's the cameos of Bette Midler, Candice Bergen, Cloris Leachman, Carrie Fisher and Debi Mazar that show the cruel and habitual behavior of women. Bergen plays the role of Ryan's mother. She is tough, experienced and thinks she could have become what her daughter will do later. There is Fisher who shows how to blackmail and test the limits of egoism, morality and betrayal. Mazar, the gossip girl, who shows no mercy for what she says and who she says it to. Leachman, who plays Ryan's sassy housekeeper, knows where she is, when and where she's needed, and knows how to deliver a good one-liner. Finally, there is MIdler, who plays Leah Miller, a crazy but eclectic agent of Hollywood. This is the character who gives Mary's Ryan an explanation of what she really is by discovering "what do I want". Despite the stealing scenes and memorable quotes from Midler, she was underused. <br /> <br /> But let's go back to the movie. Together, women show the public what it means to live in the 21st century without knowing exactly what you want. the time is coming when you answer this very clean question. It attacks feminism, what it means to be a woman (fierce, ruthless, impolite, sticky, clever, clever, intelligent, shy, proud, ashamed, shy, carefree, handsome, strong, independent); and also what women want, why are women the way they are. It's funny, modern and certainly not a masterpiece. But in the end, it's worth wasting time and money to see old and younger actresses teach us all about women.
