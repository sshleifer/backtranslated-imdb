Jack Black and Kyle Gass team up to promote their Tenacious D band in this rock classic called Tenacious D in the choice of fate. Jack Black and Kyle Gass invent their own rock opera. It was like a Rock 'N' Roll opera. Some of the most twisted events took place in this movie ... the big part of the foot ... the part of the mushroom ... and in the end, when they faced the devil. A classic formed in Tenacious D .... one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. The last two things I saw at the theater were stupid ... but this film rocks. It really made me laugh. Jack Black is looking to find his rock partner in Los Angeles. His partner is Kyle Gass and the man who has always been bald. They work together to find that magical choice that can make the most terrible musician play a lot. They finally reach the Rock 'N' Roll Museum and steal the pickaxe. Along the way, they meet The Stranger, played by Tim Robbins. They go to the club to win their prize when the owner takes the pick. He was always the devil and he was fighting the D in a Rock Off. The D does not win but the devil's cornet falls, sending him back to hell. So LIVE THE D !!!!!!!!!!
