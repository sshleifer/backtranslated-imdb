(*** minor spoilers ***) <br /> <br /> If there's anything in the world of silent clowns that puzzles me, it's that Charley Chase never had his "breakthrough" "Well deserved in the movies. Oh well, maybe it's not that strange, really, since he never played in a feature film. But when I think about it, such an explanation makes it all the more mysterious - because why on earth has Chase not had the slightest offer to play the main role in the features? One explanation is that his character, however amusing, was simply too realistic to fit into a longer story; without the burlesque elements possessed by Chaplin, Keaton, Lloyd, Langdon, and other comedians, it may be supposed that the comedy he made, which worked so well for twenty minutes, would be repetitive after a few other reels. I do not quite agree with that, however, the Chase de Chase building is beautiful and could, I believe, best preserve the interest of viewers for a longer period; at least, I'm tempted to think when MIGHTY LIKE A MOOSE directs the show. <br /> <br /> Mr. Moose is not extraordinary, and Ms. Moose is not a "classic beauty"; it has the largest front teeth of all human beings on the planet and has a remarkably large nose. Both undergo plastic surgery without the knowledge of the other. When they meet by chance, a little later, he does not recognize his wife or her husband. A number of hilarious misunderstandings begin, with many clever gags all along. I do not think I will reveal anything to make viewing more enjoyable for you. Because if you're a fan of silent comedies, or even if you're not, MIGHTY LIKE A MOOSE offers so many memorable moments in such a short time that I would consider it a real shame not to see it; stupid indeed, but no less extremely funny.
