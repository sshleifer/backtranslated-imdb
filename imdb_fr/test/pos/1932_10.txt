It is a story of events that have been the subject of several printed journals. I had already read two books: "A trip for fools" and "The strange last trip of Donald Crowhurst" before seeing the film in Sheffield just before Christmas. I must say that he exceeded all expectations in his account of the 1968 Golden Times Sunday Globe Race. These men decided to do something that had never been done before, without support boats, wooden boats, without satellite phones, without GPS, and just their intelligence and ability to make them go around the world in one piece. Not to mention months of loneliness, the thunder of the Southern Ocean, little sleep and boats literally collapsing around them. <br /> <br /> This documentary is perfectly set up in my opinion, well mounted, well paced. with superb narration. Archival footage and interviews are fascinating and bring history to life. The recording of Clare Crowhurst's interview is particularly revealing and moving, as she recounts the events that led to her departure from her husband, Donald Crowhurst, of Teignmouth. Doubts and fears he felt, as well as his reaction to subsequent events. <br /> <br /> I was moved and I even shed a tear or two when the credits began to roll, and I heard other people express similar feelings. <br /> <br /> The two books I mentioned above are useful for more details and history. It could not have been integrated within 90 minutes and I would recommend them too. <br /> <br /> It's finally a true story of human courage and human fragility. Must-see for anyone interested in sailing, adventure, human activities and real heroes.
