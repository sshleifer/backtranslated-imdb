This film is a variation of a theme that we have all seen again and again - the Posiedan adventure in space. The characters are all stock characters - courageous heroine, Judas, coward, etc. etc. The only question is really who is the next to take it. Sometimes this tested and tested formula works - as in this case - but more often than not - like the "red planet" which is really stultifying. <br /> <br /> So why does this one work? Because it's stylish. The game is above average. And above all, it is not predictable. The conclusion is not signed. I really did not know how it would end and I was surprised how it ended. This merit alone deserves the best marks in my book. <br /> <br /> It's an intriguing and entertaining film. And while this has never been likely to change the face of cinema as we know it, it does not disappoint.
