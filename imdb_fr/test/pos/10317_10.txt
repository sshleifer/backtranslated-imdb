Not wishing to repeat what everyone has noted, I will only say this: <br /> <br /> Almost everyone says that he liked Curly better ... but I will oppose BRIDELESS GROOM to ALL THE OTHER Stooges shorts. <br /> <br /> I think it's the most hilarious from start to finish, in addition to being the most viewable. <br /> <br /> The student who sings discreetly ... The cousin of "Christine McIntire" "The routine" of Basil, and of course the JP of Emil Sitka are strong moments, but only around the timing Impeccable Stooges and the superb writing that is brought there too. <br /> <br /> Nuff said.
