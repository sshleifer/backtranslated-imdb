This film, one of the first William Wellman, contains an important message, especially nowadays. It raises the idea that sometimes there may be more important things than your personal safety or personal well-being. The film, which has Walter Huston in the lead, is stolen by the performance of "Chic" Sales as Grampa. He is the most drawn character of the film and a joy to watch. You will recognize familiar faces if you watch many movies from the 20s and 30s. You have time to watch if you have the opportunity. Recommended.
