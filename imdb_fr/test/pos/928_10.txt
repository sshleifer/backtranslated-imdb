In the "gaffes" section of this film, it is indicated that there is an error of continuity in which Auguste's car is parked in a different place from that observed in a previous shot of the same scene. This is an error. One view comes from Auguste's apartment, the other from Valentine's apartment across the street. The purpose of this segment is to show how Valentine and Augustus - which can be made for each other - almost intersect (as happens many times), but never quite, until the circumstances join on the ferry at the end of the month. the film. (And here there is an implication that Joseph would have handled things for August to be on this ferry, after inspecting Valentine's ticket to see which sail she is on.)
