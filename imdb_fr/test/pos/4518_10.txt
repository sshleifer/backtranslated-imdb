The Kite Runner should win an Oscar! It's perfect in every sense of the word, the story, the scenario, the actors' game, the cinematography ... One would never guess that it was shot in China. The story of two childhood friends and what will follow in their adult life will leave a lasting impression. The description of life in Afghanistan under the Taliban is all too real and horrible. I did not read the book, but I saw comments that crush the film because "the book is always better" ... It does not matter. Nobody put "Gone With The Wind" because it was not true to the book! In fact, he won the Oscar for Best Picture and several other Oscars. I think this film is brilliant - BRAVO to the writer and the director, as well as the actors!
