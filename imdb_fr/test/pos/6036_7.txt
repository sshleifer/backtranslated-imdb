My first 'Columbo'. Rather appreciated. Excellent format, and the character of Peter Falk extremely good ... wonderfully offbeat, he can take his place next to Poirot, Miss Marple, but also Marlowe and Rick Diamond. I can see why this series has such a sequel. <br /> <br /> As a professional musician, I have to say a few words. First, a conductor who will be content to produce for these pedestrian shows the most basic examples of the repertoire (Eine Kleine Nachtmusik, Strauss Waltzes, Beethoven ...) can never have a house like this or a car like that, let alone be called a genius. And the actor's conduct is so bad that it's laughable. No orchestra would take it seriously. <br /> <br /> There are also a few things, like her rehearsal of Eine Kleine Nachtmusik (why repeat it when she just played it for TV? Any orchestral musician would be able to play it in his own room still sleep ...). His instructions to the ensemble are completely absurd, and when Columbo asks Blythe Danner what "quasi fantasia" means, she says it's "Latin". It's Italian, like the vast majority of musical instructions. <br /> <br /> And finally, there are never two great musicians who have the following exchange: "Play something". "What should I play?" "Chopin". Music is their job and their passion, they know it well. Something much more specific would be requested and offered! <br /> <br /> I know. I should go out more ...
