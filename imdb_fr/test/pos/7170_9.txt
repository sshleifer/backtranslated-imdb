I thought I already wrote a comment on this movie, but I can not find it here. In any case, I write it again. I accidentally found this film in the collections of my college library. It was free to watch, so why not. <br /> <br /> I'm certainly happy to have watched it. I love that movie. I have already seen some Russian films before, most of them having serious subjects. I'm surprised it's a good comedy. I had a good laugh watching him. and this is a movie I want to buy. this thing is so funny. and they are not just funny funny, these intrigues were very original and well thought out, so they do not seem at all ridiculous. I'm surprised this movie did not attract a lot of viewers. It's a classic that you can watch over and over again. <br /> <br /> These actors were also very authentic, their acting is real and not falsified. if you have not looked at it, go quickly get a copy! really recommended.
