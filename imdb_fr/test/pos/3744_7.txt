Dr. Paul Flanner (Richard Gere), a renowned surgeon, asks his wife to leave, his son (an uncredited James Franco) does not respect him and loses a patient on whom he operates. Adrienne Willis (Diane Lane) has two children and discovers that her husband has cheated on her. They both need to leave. She watches over a beautiful oceanfront inn at Rodanthe while booking a room. They are all alone together. You can pretty much understand the rest. <br /> <br /> This is what we call a weepie or a woman's movie. It's beautifully shot with a romantic setting and lots of quiet scenes. There is a tragedy, a love story, another tragedy and an edifying end (in a way). Gere and Lane's excellent interpretation helps to hide the fact that this film does not really have much to do. Every bit of the plot is predictable. I rolled a lot of eyes during certain events. Plus, it's way too short - I did not believe the romance between Gere and Lane for a second. If comes from nowhere and moves very fast. The film still works. The hostel itself is absolutely beautiful and I was in tears at the end with most of the spectators. So, it's a predictable but beautiful film with some wonderful actors. He does not deserve all the criticism he receives. I give him a 7.
