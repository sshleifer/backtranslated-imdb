Vasili Pichul's 1988 film, Little Vera, is a landmark film of modern Russian cinema. It presents in a realistic way the degradation of family values ​​and human dignity as a result of Soviet communism. The brutal drama of Pichul marks a clear break with the images of purified idealism advocated during the Soviet era (as in Aleksandrov's circus), brazenly shifting the social chaos of his time into the public spotlight. A contemporary Ukrainian framework further intensifies the effect, first by the immediacy of the film in its day, then by the use of a place that fights not only for identity instead of a Soviet system, but also as a separate nation from the Russian idiom. who had dominated the USSR <br /> <br /> Vera, the main character of the film and her protagonist, is a rebellious teenager whose family is "dysfunctional" and includes a father who drinks very hard and a mother well brought . Rejecting her allegedly beautiful Andrei, Vera begins a destructive (and mostly sexual) relationship with a student named Sergei. Despite the disgust of his parents for the slacker Sergei and his gross disdain for his parents, he moved into their narrow apartment. The tension rises until Vera's father stabs drunkard Sergei. Vera must decide whether she will remain loyal to her intolerable family by testifying that her father acted in self-defense or whether she continues to support and defend the ever-detached Sergei. <br /> <br /> Unbearable in almost every conceivable way, Little Vera captures and brilliantly communicates the inevitable emptiness that remains in social life after the fall of communism. The sexual aggressiveness of the film (the first film to show an explicit sex), combined with the implacable presentation of social reality (a marked distinction of socialist realism demanded by Stalin) actually confronted the conditions of the life of the ex-girlfriend. Soviet Union. The most interesting, however, was the public reception. While many wrote hate mail to the mail and the director, the film was extremely popular. Here appears the double-edged nature of "film as social criticism": if done correctly, the film will make the audience uncomfortable. Because no easy solution arises, some viewers will hate the film and the filmmakers for "raising" the problem. Many movies come to mind as comparable in this respect: Larry Clark's Kids, Harmony Korine's Gummo, or even popular movies such as John Hughes's Breakfast Club. <br /> <br /> I recommend this film to viewers for whom the prospect of nearly two hours of unsustainable internal conflict and social miasma is not too daunting. The film is absolutely beautiful and incredibly stimulating. Despite the difficulties of watching the film, some moments are deeply beautiful. Of course, one can not neglect the socio-historical and cultural significance of the film, and it is actually an even stronger reason to watch this film.
