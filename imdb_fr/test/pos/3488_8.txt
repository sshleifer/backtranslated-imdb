A formula for a murder is not a well-known Giallo, but that does not mean it's not a very good one! The film is directed by Alberto De Martino, the man behind cult classics such as The Antichrist and Blazing Magnums. The film was released late in the Giallo cycle, but withstands most films released around the "golden" period of the early seventies. Despite a lack of logic in some areas, the film works mainly because of the competent way he mixes Argento death scenes with really surprising twists and many well-defined characters. The film may not be as exciting overall as many other films of the same genre; but this is more than compensated for by the assured manner that the central situation is transmitted to the public and by the tension which results from it. The plot begins by showing a fake priest raping a girl named Joanna, before pushing her several steps. We then moved on for several years and the girl is now a woman, who is unfortunately in a wheelchair. She is coached by Craig for a sporting event. a man who also has romantic drawings on her. Joanna's personal assistant, who also has romantic reasons for her, does not appreciate her proposal. <br /> <br /> The film features a mid-point plot that is the backbone of the film. while it is not entirely logical; it's good to watch and to suggest that you are in an interesting movie. The director Alberto de Martino is obviously not afraid to show some scandalous gore scenes, and the best of this film is that of a priest beaten to death by a cat - and personally, I would not hesitate to name this sequence as one of my favorite murder scenes of Giallo! The plot can sometimes be a little uneven, but usually the action is very good. The director devotes what seems like an eternity to the film's conclusion; but the tension is total, and the way it works is good to the extent that it takes advantage of all the arguments of the plot that preceded it. The score, from Fulci's The New York Ripper, also works in this film and, breaking with a tradition Giallo, De Martino's film also presents very good performances of actor veteran David Warbeck and Christina Nagy, in his only role in feature film. . Overall, this movie is not one of the most easy to find of Giallo; but it's worth looking for and recommending it to fans of this type of movie.
