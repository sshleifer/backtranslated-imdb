Hilarious comedy where comedian Mark Blankfield describes Jekyll as a stuck doctor deeply engaged in his research. Once he snorted his experimental formula, he became the all-pervading Hyde of landscapes, causing endless problems for everyone around him. <br /> <br /> I was pleasantly surprised by this one. He has a really crazy, crazy approach; he is at full steam with an outrageously stupid but undeniably hilarious joke. Funny lines and visual gags abound; Blankfield plays every role at its true value. A highlight in Hyde bursting into the song; "Hyde has nothing to do with Hyde" is quite catchy and even now, I can still hear it in my head. The highlight will even spoof old horror movies in black and white. <br /> <br /> Secondary distribution is just as lively, with Bess Armstrong as fianc√©e Mary, Krista Errickson as Ivy, and Tim Thomerson as a flamboyant physician Knute Lanyon. I would have liked to know more about the character of Thomersons, because I am a fan of this man, but it is always nice to see him in something. <br /> <br /> A wide range of familiar faces parade past the camera: Cassandra "Elvira" Peterson, Peter Brocco, Liz Sheridan, George Wendt, Michael Ensign, John Dennis Johnston, Art The Flower, Lin Shaye and George Chakiris in a monochrome like himself. <br /> <br /> It goes without saying that if you prefer intelligent and intelligent comedy, you'd better avoid it at all costs. But for those who like to have a good time crazy, politically incorrect and cheerfully happy, it might be enough. <br /> <br /> One of the best elements is saved for the end. <br /> <br /> 8 / ten
