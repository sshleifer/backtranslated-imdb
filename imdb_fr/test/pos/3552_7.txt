A remake of the silent film of 1916, based on Maurice Leblanc's 1909 novel. The crime series would be transformed into numerous plays, movies and television series in the United Kingdom, the United States and France over the years. This 1932 version featured brothers John Barry (Duke) and Lionel (Detective Guerchard). They would also play together at the Grand Hotel, at the dinner of eight, and many more over the next two years. Sonia (Karen Morley) shows up in the duke's bed at a party in this pre-Hayes movie; first the lights go out in the bedroom, then in the main ballroom, then the search for the rogue and the missing jewels, as well as other missing valuables is launched ... You can to say that the discussions did not exist long, because they still use legends several times. Also watch for a new type of safe that does not require a combination. Intrigue well thought out, no big holes, but no big surprises here either. Not bad for an early talkie movie. Smart end.
