There are many ways to misunderstand this movie and some of them have already been shown in some comments. It is a film to analyze as a free reconstruction of a known subject and therefore not to be compared to the opera, the book or other films of Carmen seen before. This stands for itself and I must say that this Carmen does it very well. It is a mistake to compare because it is the first step to deny films the opportunity to be independent creative works of art. Vicente Aranda is a master of atmosphere. The artistic direction, costumes and photography are extremely well organized to offer you a pleasant aesthetic experience. Let's take things as they are. <br /> <br /> And that brings us to the next misunderstanding. Someone complains about the typical Spanish clichés of the film. Well, historically, the film is extremely well documented and you can see the results of this very serious work in every scene. It is not only a faithful portrait of the "black Spain" of the knife and sneaker that Goya has portrayed so well, but also of this part of the story seen by a stranger fascinated by the folk side of this society. Honestly, anyone who does not want to see a cliché about Spain should not buy a ticket to see Carmen, but in this case, these snapshots are presented before becoming one and the way to see them is to eliminate our own prejudices . <br /> <br /> Another important requirement to understand this movie is to speak the language. It is not acceptable to reproach an actor for not having understood his words. If the rest of the audience did, the problem probably lies elsewhere. Paz Vega has an impeccable diction with her Andalusian accent and everything she says is understandable and credible. His Argentine partner, Leonardo Sbaraglia, also gives a convincing portrait of the Basque officer who has become a "bandolero", and his accent is very scholarly. <br /> <br /> It is no less important to have a very open approach to the material. To say that Paz Vega is "horrible" suggests that the author of the sentence entered the theater for the wrong reasons. We already had in Spain a critic in one of the most prestigious newspapers who recommended us images that he found exciting for homosexuals, without mentioning it explicitly. And that was not quite right for the rest of us, especially for those who did not detect that the man was writing with parts of his anatomy that many readers did not necessarily have to deal with . I do not say at all that the critic had the same motivation, but the expectations had to be different from those of us who had gone to see a beautiful and talented actress play a role almost classic, because that's what we have had. Paz Vega is Carmen, and an excellent one, in Vicente Aranda's film.
