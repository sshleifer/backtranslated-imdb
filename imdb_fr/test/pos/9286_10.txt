If I had the right to watch only one program of my life, I should definitely choose "Hunter's War Against All". Of all the satirical programs that have been broadcast on Australian television, I have found "Chaser" the funniest ever. It's so amazing that boys are not afraid to do anything. <br /> <br /> Whether it's disguising yourself as Hitler to join a Polish club, or pushing a huge ball of string around Melbourne to try the tourism ad or go to Coke factory bare in a bath with $ 2.40 to buy water. The hunters will go there. <br /> <br /> In keeping with the comments above (and / or below), "The Hunter's War is All" is more popular than its previous program "CNNNN". But CNNNN was just as funny. Some unforgettable moments of this show ... Clean up Cambodia !!! Classic. <br /> <br /> So, anyway, to prevent me from continuing, I strongly advise you to leave at least a chance to Chaser, you will find it more than likely HILARIOUS !!!!
