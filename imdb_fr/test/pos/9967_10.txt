William Shakespeare's Venice merchant talks about a Jewish money lender and his commitment to extracting a pound of flesh from the wealthy merchant Antonio, the loser of a debt. The Jewish lender, of course, is Shylock and Al Pacino gives such an impressive show that even such outstanding actors as Jeremy Irons, Joseph Fiennes and Lynne Collins fade away. The film takes place in the 16th century in Venice and director Michael Radford relies on the decor, atmosphere and realism to tell his story. > Radford reduces the play time from three hours to two hours and eight minutes, while providing historical context. In the opening story, he tells us how the Jews arrived in England, were subjected to increasing persecution, and were eventually expelled from England. They were forbidden to own property, profits could only be made by loaning money with interest and forced to live in a Venetian "geto", precursor of darker events to come. In the movie, Merchant Antonio (Jeremy Irons) spits on Shylock in public, but is not afraid to go to the usurer to borrow 3000 ducats to help his friend and lover suggested, Bassanio (Joseph Fiennes), to woo Portia (Lynne Collins). , a rich heiress. Although Shylock was insulted by Antonio, he agrees to lend the money interest-free for three months, provided that the deposition of the bond gives him the right to demand a pound of flesh from the heart of Antonio. <br /> <br /> playing is above all a drama of hate and revenge, but as in most of Shakespeare's works, there are also touches of wide comedy. The comedy involves three pairs of lovers: Bassanio and Portia, Gratiano, Bassanio's friend, and Nerissa, and Lorenzo, another friend of Bassanio, and Jessica, daughter of Shylock. Portia offered herself to the person who can choose the good treasure in one of the three boxes of gold, silver and lead. The prince of Morocco chooses that of gold, the prince of Aragon the one of silver and both are disappointed. Bassanio, however, loves her for herself and opens the lead coffin to find the portrait inside. Radford's adaptation reflects a remarkable feeling for time and place. The residence of Portia in Belmont suggests one of these splendid summer residences embellished with immaculate gardens and art treasures suspended in each room. It contrasts well with the grungy look of the city of Shylock with its wet lanes. <br /> <br /> When it becomes obvious Antonio can not repay the debt, Bassanio returns to Venice, leaving Portia behind him. When he arrives, the loan is overdue and Shylock demands his pound of flesh. Even when Bassanio, backed by Portia's wealth, offers the repayment amount several times, Shylock is determined to take revenge, not only for the loss of money, but also for the fact that he lost his life as a whole. than outsider. The duke, who sits in judgment, will not intervene when Portia enters the shoes of Antonio's defense lawyer. It is here that the film reaches its dramatic highs as all parties appear in court to reach a final resolution. <br /> <br /> The Venetian merchant does not only concern an unpaid debt, but also the distance of Jews from Christians. society and their desire to belong. This is one of Shakespeare's most controversial pieces and analysts have long wondered whether it is an anti-Semitic play or simply a play on anti-Semitism that reflects the widespread view of Christian society in Elizabethan England. Although Shylock is definitely a caricature, he is an ambiguous figure and there are many indications that Shakespeare considers his faults as human failings, and not as Jews. The duke recognizes that he is simply a man who has not adhered to the compassionate language of the Torah. <br /> <br /> In the monologue, "I am a Jew, does not he look like a Jew, we sting, do not we bleed, if you tickle us, we do not laugh? if you poison us, do not we die, and if you deceive us, should not we take revenge? ", Shylock shows a universal humanity expressing the equality of all men. Although we are horrified by the pain he wants to perform, we can feel his pain build up over the years. Pacino's performance gives new vigor to the text and his often overworked character is replaced by a softer and more discreet behavior that brings understanding to his cause. In an interview at the Toronto Film Festival last September, Radford said of Pacino, "When you work with a brilliant actor, you have a great machine, it's like driving a powerful car. must dare to do it. " He dared and we are all the beneficiaries.
