The four signs on the road say "If you're looking for fun ... you do not need a reason ... all you need is a rifle .... it's the rabbit season! " <br /> <br /> In the woods, we see hundreds of "Rabbit Season" signs displayed on each tree. We are seeing more and more signs showing exactly the Bugs Bunny hole. Who put all these signs? Daffy Duck! <br /> <br /> Daffy puts the last registration form and tells us: "It's terribly disappointing on my part, I know, but what do I have to do? Have fun! It's really duck season. "<br /> <br /> From here we see now Elmer Fudd, shotgun in his hand ..... and a war of semantics between Bugs and Daffy, Bugs winning every time. Fortunately, fortunately we only see five times someone get shot in the head and continue like this!
