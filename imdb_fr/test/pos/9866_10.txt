This review is based on the producer's cut: <br /> <br /> "Halloween 5" was a major box office disappointment in 1989. Personally, I've always loved it and I'm proud to have it in my collection. But because of its failure and also because of rights issues, it would take 6 years before we can see another payment. The film had the makings of being one of the best, if not the best, of the series. A hardcore fan writing the screenplay, the return not only of Donald Pleasence as Dr. Loomis and George Wilbur as Michael Myers, but also the return of Tommy Doyle's character from the first film, from a major studio supporting the project and a free fall everything makes the movie sound like a success in the making. So what went wrong? I will give you two good reasons: Re-shoot and bad editing. Due to a poor screening test and the unfortunate death of Donald Pleasence, the film was changed, and not for the better. The film, like the pieces III and 5, is the subject of strong criticism at the box office and has been criticized by critics and most fans of the series. But then, thanks to the magic of bootlegging, the original cup was leaked and many fans, including myself, were very happy. I'll finish this part of my comment by saying this: This movie is, at least at least, my favorite "Halloween" movie and I'm not afraid to admit it. <br /> <br /> Pros: The score is simply haunting. A few of the best writings and dialogues in the series. 'Halloween 4' imitates the original in that it is more suspense and mood than blood and guts, and it's the same. Excellent performances, especially from the late Donald Pleasence. Moves at a breathtaking pace. An interesting explanation for Michael's pain and why he will not die. Some brutal killings. Some rather cold moments, my favorite being the character of Kim Darby. Many good head shots to previous movies. Some good surprises. Like the two previous suites, this one has an impressive cliffhanger finish. <br /> <br /> Disadvantages: Although Michael's explanation of evil is fascinating, it makes him a little less frightening. Since when can Michael move so quickly? <br /> <br /> Final thoughts: It was the first Halloween I saw at the theater. I was so excited because I really thought 5 would be the last and then I heard that was happening. I enjoyed it at the time, but over time, I saw what it really was: a good movie trapped in a movie OK with a terrible ending. Why did the filmmakers have to listen to the audience during screenings? If they had released this higher version, it might have done a lot better and the series might not be stuck in trouble, it is right now. <br /> <br /> My rating: 5/5
