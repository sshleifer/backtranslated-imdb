I recently saw him at the Palm Springs International Film Festival in 2007, where he was one of the public favorites. It is a parody of the French craft industry of OSS 117 films of the 50s and 60s. The first film OSS 117 based on the novel of Jean Bruce was projected on the screen in 1956, well before the first film of James Bond, in which Ivan Desny was portrayed as Hubert Bonisseur De La Bath and six other action-adventure spies were filmed until 1970. Luc Merenda, Frederick Stafford, Kerwin Matthews and John Gaven taking turns to interpret Oss 117. Jean Dujardin plays the lead role in this comic series. At the beginning of the film, in 1945, he wears the French mustache and looks like Desny, but from the beginning of the film he turns in 1955, he really looks like Sean Connery. Jean Fran√ßois Halim wrote this hilarious scenario of a spy sent to Egypt to investigate the murder of a friend. It borrows from the stupidity of Naked Gun, Get Smart and the Pink Panther and uses fresh humor for the news in a delightful combination that will appeal to the international audience. I'm sure this will be the only one among others to come from a revived OSS 117 reworked for comic adventures. Michel Hazanavicius directs. I would give him a 7.5 and recommend him.
