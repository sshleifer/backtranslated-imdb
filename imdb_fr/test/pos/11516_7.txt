"Lights of New York" began as an experimental short film about Vitaphone, which finally snowballed to become the first full-length walkie-talkie feature. Helene Costelle was supposed to be one of the most beautiful actresses in Hollywood and the sister of (in my opinion, the real beauty) Dolores Costello, who seemed to have every chance to take a break. Poor Helen is best known for her role in this rather sullen film that bought a revolution in Hollywood! <br /> <br /> Two smugglers on the torch of "Main Street" convince a couple of barbers in the city to try their luck Broadway. Barbers Eddie (Cullen Landis) and Gene (Eugene Palette) do not realize that their hair salon is soon a cover for illegal hacking activities. They realize it quickly and regret the day they left their small town. The only thing that keeps them alive is the loan that Eddie's mother gave them and they desperately want to pay back. Eddie meets Kitty Lewis (Helene Costello), a girl from her hometown who has been successful on Broadway. Kitty worries about "Hawk" Miller (Wheeler Oakman) still trailing around her but Eddie, innocently, thinks she's exaggerating because "Hawk" already has a girlfriend, Molly (Gladys Brockwell), but to reassure her he gives him a small handgun. to scare away unwanted admirers. "Hawk", who killed a police officer and whose "Feds" is near, decides to supervise Eddie. Meanwhile, Molly is fed up with the "Hawks" treatment for him and after a showdown where he tells her he's after a hen and not an old hen, the scene is ready for - A murder! !! <br /> <br /> The fact is that it's not completely abominable, except for gangsters and showgirls who speak in their best elective voices and that still happened in movies in 1930. Gladys Brockwell ( a bit melodramatic) and Eugene Palette (quite natural) were ok and were the most seasoned actors in the cast. Cullen Landis and Helene Costello quickly returned to the darkness from which they came. I also did not notice much about the "hidden microphone" - where people had to be grouped around different objects, such as a phone or sitting on a couch before they could start a conversation. Those who saw him at the cinema probably began to think that all the police officers were talking in this monotonous apartment while this trend continued in many early speeches, namely "Little Caesar" (1930). In any case, they were probably intrigued by the novelty of a completely talkative film - with some song and dance songs - filmed in 1928. <br /> <br /> Recommended.
