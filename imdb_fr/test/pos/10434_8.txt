The Last American Virgin (1982) was one of the few teen comedies I really enjoyed. The subject and the acting were well above the usual guts that Hollywood was (and still is) throwing. But for a while, the smaller studios produced films about teenagers that were neither attenuated nor relaxed for children. The men pulling the strings behind this production were those of your Cannon friends. <br /> <br /> Three teenage boyfriends are trying to lose their virginity while still in high school. They will do anything or anything to achieve the goal of their dreams. The sensitive group (Andrew Monsoon) has enough to find the good girl while his two best friends will take all they can get. One day, the boy finds his perfect daughter (Diane Franklin). But fate would play one of their draws. His best friend comes in and takes her off his feet. After having knocked her out, the sensitive girl helps the girl get up and pays for her abortion. He still has feelings for her and tries to win his heart. Meanwhile, her best friend has a very violent argument about the pregnancy of her dream girl. Yet he does his best to make him love him. Night comes when he asks him the question. But his heart breaks when he sees her dancing with her former best friend. In tears, the kid leaves the party. <br /> <br /> What I liked in this movie is that he did not shoot a punch. Instead of being filled with dummy situations, it was very realistic, honest and brutal. The film is full of funny moments and hysteria. I must recommend this film to fans of teen comedies. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
