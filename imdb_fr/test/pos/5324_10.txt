Each role, even the smallest one, has been interpreted with bravado. <br /> <br /> The extraordinary Jena Malone never makes a mistake. His two co-stars are equal in this film. Ryan Gosling is perhaps the best actor of his generation. Chris Klein gives his best performance so far. It is a film that inspires reflection and conversation and should be seen by teenagers and young adults. You will think and talk about this movie for days. Highly recommended.
