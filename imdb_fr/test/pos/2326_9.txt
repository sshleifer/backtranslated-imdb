"Down Periscope" is in our library since his arrival in VHS. Since then, we have acquired the DVD and a digital version of Cinema Now. <br /> <br /> This is an original film that does not go too far on the military side, whether for or against. It is primarily a comedy and, as a vehicle of the main characters, I am quite surprised that a suite has never been offered. <br /> <br /> The film has acquired an audience that borders on a cult obsession, even among the very young. I became aware of this during my visit to the USS Drum in Mobile, Alabama, in 2002. A group of Cubs, my grandson among them, had taken over the roles of the film and intended to relive overnight on board. /> <br /> It's a fun adventure that makes you proud of both our navy and Hollywood ... a rare venture. <br /> <br /> Thanks to Kelsey Grammar, Lauren Holly and Rob Schneider could have been an otherwise tasteless movie, such entertainment!
