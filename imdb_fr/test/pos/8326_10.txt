When Jurassic Park was launched, it was revolutionary in making films and special effects. For the first time, people are turning to a movie about dinosaurs and are convinced they are watching real animated dinosaurs. However, some dinosaurs were almost perfect examples of what true creatures looked like (T.Rex, Brachiosaurus, Triceratops, etc.), some have been modified to match the film (Velociraptor, Dilophosaurus) and the film is currently on a tropical island where they were not in their natural habitat. Walking with dinosaurs shows us the real animals in their real habitats millions of years ago. The amount of detail and scientific information used is excellent. Now we can see sites such as a Triassic Desert, an entire herd of Diplodocus, an Icthyosaurus giving birth, a MASSIVE sea monster, a pterosaur eye sight, dinosaurs thriving at the South Pole, two horned horns from Torosaurus, a roar of T.Rex to the camera and the impact of the comet that spelled out their fate. These dinosaurs walk, run, feed, fight, breed, hunt and swim. But the series also reveals other creatures with whom they shared the world. Two episodes are mainly devoted to two different types of animals, the flying Pterosaurs and the marine reptiles that lived under the waves. The places and landscapes are spectacular and look even more unique when CG Dino comes on screen. And as with CGI and animatronics, CGI dinosaur movements look totally natural, color is bright, and crews have taken meticulous steps to have CG animals interact with their environment in the same way that a creature does. real splashing in the water, grazing the bushes, lifting dust and casting shadows on the ground. Admittedly, the CG is not perfect with some brief cases where the animals seem too calculated but the rest of the time, they look breathtaking. The puppet is poor in some cases but she has her moments especially the scene with the Cynodonts in the first episode. Kenneth Branagh's narration is also excellent and provides us with essential and dramatic information at the same time. But of course, the real pleasure is to see a living dinosaur do what they did many years ago and see some really cute moments with puppies Cynodont (mammalian / reptile hybrid), Sauropodlets (baby Diplodocus ) and T.Rex chicks (Yes, even .Rex can be cute) and then reminds us that nature can be brutal and was even more so at the time. All this is a masterpiece of prehistoric nature that allows you to see a real dinosaur and take your breath away safely, all in the safety of your living room. If you love nature, dinosaurs, informative learning, stunning graphics or just to have a good view and have fun, then Walking with Dinosaurs is definitely for you. Easily recommended.
