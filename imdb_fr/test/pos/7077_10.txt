I saw this movie in September with my mother. I was expecting a good movie and I saw an excellent one. It is now my most precious film. He did not leave me after I left the theater. The situations in this film reminded me of my late grandmother. Meryl Streep and Renee Zellweger were equally incredible. This film made me realize the importance of family relationships. To rent. I can not recommend it enough.
