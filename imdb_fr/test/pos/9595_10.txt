As one commentator once commented, this TV comedy is one of the best football parodies of all time. But .... after failing to record the video when it first aired, I now find that this format is not available in any format. Okay, so it only got 17 votes, but an average of 9 years and over seems to suggest something special. Basically, I guess it's a case of bad luck if you missed it because it is no longer visible! Aaaaaaaargh.
