I caught this on the last Mexican cable and I have to complain about it. The title has been translated as "Secretos" (Secrets). Well, there is a secret that plays an important role in the movie, but hey, come on! We are not stupid. We know there is a novel behind that. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the film is quite interesting and carries with it solid performances. Jordana Brewster and Christopher Eccleston, always beautiful and breathtaking, offer excellent performances and offer such chemistry between them. Cameron DÃ¬az is also good, although she has little time on the screen. Blythe Danner is perfect and her last appearance in the film is touching, sad. Great performances. <br /> <br /> Jordana's character and her sister's ex-boyfriend travel to Europe to allow her to face her demons and understand why her sister is dead. Through backtracking, we learn the sad truth and we can only complain about the whole family. The end is really moving. <br /> <br /> There is nudity, but it is minimal. In fact, sex scenes are artistic and do not intend to be sexy or sexy. <br /> <br /> To be honest, I watched the scene for the charm and beauty of Joranda Brewster. And I ended up loving the story and the dramatic presentations. <br /> <br /> Try this movie if you like solid dramatic features. Super movie. The last, last scene was very sad .. The two little sisters through the flashbacks.
