The word impossible has led many to choose a particular point of view regarding an incredible task. In 1927, it was thought that no man could steal the breath of the Atlantic Ocean. Many have tried but failed and some have even given their lives to the effort. Nevertheless, this had to be done because every challenge had to be met with the same determination. This is the heart of this film entitled "The Spirit of St. Louis". The actor chosen for this historic film is none other than James Stewart, an American who convincingly embodies Charles Lindbergh. Although Lindbergh's life has many facets, the segment presented here is about his efforts to be the first man to fly over the Atlantic. The story is interesting and compelling for Stewards fans. Seeking enough funds to build a special plane, the fateful decision to begin the journey on a dark day in May 1927, "Luck Lindy" at the time of her baptism, bore enormous risks, which are described in this superb film. Murray Hamilton, who plays Bud Gurney, Bartlett Robinson as Ben Mahoney, Arthur Space and Charles Watts as O.W. Schultz. The total sum of this now famous film is that, despite the lack of approval it has made its debut, it has since become a classic in its own right. Good game! ****
