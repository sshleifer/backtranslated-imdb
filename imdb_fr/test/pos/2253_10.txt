"Everything is illuminated", it's as if you're looking at a museum-quality work of art. It absolutely floods emotions across a very broad spectrum. Jonathan Safran Foer is played with franchise by Elijah Wood. He is looking for his paternal heritage in Ukraine. His travels put him in touch with Alex, very well played and with an extreme humor of Eugene Hutz. His grandfather is the most emotional connection with this film and Boris Leskin aptly describes it. If we find little humor in the human characters of this cinema, just turn to Mikke, a real dog called Sammy Davis Jr. by Alex and his grandfather. They also call it "the eye seeing bitch". Cinematography is spectacular. The colors are a very important part of the patchwork of the film. It is a film that is worth the time and the emotional investment.
