I love that movie. The actors were all great in representing their different characters. Judith Ivey described the situation of a weak, fearful, addicted, aggressive and passive person in his complaining and self-involved character, that it was a relief to see the character's metamorphosis. Blythe Danner was also attractive in her role as a somewhat critical Jewish mother, devoted wife and loving sister. Jonathon Silmerman, Bob Dishy, ​​Stacey Glick and Lisa Walz performed well as well. <br /> <br /> If you like movies that tell difficult moments without losing your sense of humor or your hope, you'll love film.
