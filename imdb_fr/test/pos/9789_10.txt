I consider myself a big fan of horror film. One night, I just wanted to rent new horror movies that I would mock. Then I rented Milo. I was so surprised by this movie. It scared me. It's not something I can say very often. Usually, Halloween just scares me. <br /> <br /> Two other friends looked at me with me and stayed with a feeling of trouble. A positive feeling, if you ask me, after watching a horror movie. If you are not affected, then what is the problem? <br /> <br /> This film was original. It did not follow the normal guidelines of a horror movie. That's why movies like Valentine have been bombarded for me. <br /> <br /> Of course, many questions remain unanswered, as most horror movies do. This is worth the rent though.
