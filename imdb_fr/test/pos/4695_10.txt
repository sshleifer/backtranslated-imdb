To quote Jason Connery and Mark Ryan in one of the many comments on DVD, this "flickering music" on the HTV logo was enough to make me jump from what I was doing to stick my face against the screen for an hour. The individual stories contained in the series were excellent and the character development was wonderful. Robin of Loxley makes a very convincing trip on the two series in which he appears, even if his departure from the program was unforeseen. Marian is also developing her relationship with Herne's two sons very well. <br /> <br /> Having spent many years in the televised desert, I found the series on Sky 1 in the UK in the mid-90s and it was even more impressed that the series seemed even better that I remembered. This is not a children's TV show, it deals with witchcraft, treason, rebellion and injustice. And, he manages to do it without showing too much blood. As far as I can remember, you only see a small part of the red traces in the movie Pilote (Episodes 1 and 2 on the DVD). The DVDs are excellent and contain a wealth of extras, including comments on the Series 3 only (Jason Connery Robin) and the team's comments on Series 1 and 2. The quality of the picture is very good. good and the remixed and remastered surround sound is amazing. <Br /> <br /> The idea of ​​freedom is important, freedom prevails. Nothing is forgotten. Nothing is ever forgotten.
