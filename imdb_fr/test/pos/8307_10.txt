This film was the second film I saw at the cinema when I was a child. It scared me of shit alive. So much so that I asked my father if we could go half way. <br /> <br /> Nowadays, the only people who leave at mid-term are those who have a good taste in cinema. <br /> <br /> However, I still have fond memories of this imperfect masterpiece of atrocity. Doug McClure and Peter Cushing in the same movie! Awesome! Monsters in polypropylene substitute. Scary things. A rubber monster is, when you think about it, even more frightening than a real monster. <br /> <br /> What is amazing in this film is the quality of the score. Really catchy stuff. <br /> <br /> There are also plenty of prehistoric tits. Pleasant.
