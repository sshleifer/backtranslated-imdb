The Scandinavians know how to make me laugh in the dull nothingness of my soulless life, eh. <br /> <br /> The making of the film was incredibly meticulous, each framing, each dead look, each color element palette, each extract of muzak or street cleaners was there to pound the calm emptiness of that world. <br /> <br /> In fact, I think I might have found the general feeling of emptiness empty if his nonsense had not been really funny and relatable. For example, when Andreas tells his boss that the children are missing, that he is looking at him and that the guy is smiling and that he is halfway there, it is a kind of sad but true reflection of working with people, to spend 7/8 hours a day with them, to see more than the people you love, but knowing deep inside, they do not care about your troubles and you. Same thing. <br /> <br /> It could have been a film that the Coens had made if they were born in Oslo and not in Minnesota. I think that their humor is more aggressive and more wrapped in the past of cinema but they have the same technical mastery and their films have the same underlying meaning that life is quite inconsequential. <br /> <br /> I'll stop before I persuade myself to take a bus in the winter nature.
