"Icky Flix" is a great starting point for anyone with a vague interest in the residents. Most of their classic videos are present (although "Earth vs. Flying Saucers" and "Do not Be Cruel" are oddly missing), and the "concentrates" of their various CD-ROM projects offer a tantalizing glimpse of how whose orbed have spent their time since they realize that MTV does not put them in an intense rotation (or even in the projection of videos). <br /> <br /> All the videos in this compilation feature striking images and idiosyncratic music (with a choice of original and newly recorded tracks). And two of them - "The Third Reich 'Roll" and "One Minute Movies" - are part of the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art. Check out this DVD and find out why.
