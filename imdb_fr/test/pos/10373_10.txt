For those of you who are still in the dark, I will not spoil this Christie, because this is without a doubt one of her finest works, and I insist you should see it whenever you have free time! If any of the adaptations should be viewed before (or instead of) reading the book, I would suggest "After the funeral" for the following reasons. <br /> <br /> I would like to rent the performance of Monica Dolan. (Miss Gilchrist), whose employer partner Cora is brutally murdered at the beginning of the film. Her portrait of a shocked, nervous and insignificant woman is actually moving, especially when she has a moment of personal connection with Poirot, another person who travels alone in "the journey of life". And when the murderer is revealed in the typical manner of the Poirot denouement, Dolan's reactions to the revelation work at his best: you also feel angry for the murderer that you sympathize with Miss Gilchrist ... something occasional in the Christie tradition. <Br /> <br /> Although there are some differences between adaptation to the novel and the cinema, as usual (the activity of the will may have less meaning in the film), recreation incredibly sumptuous post-war England, of very high caliber the role and direction, and the preservation (if not exacerbated) of Christie's mystery and intrigue make these discrepancies insignificant. <br /> <br /> Bravo Suchet, Dolan and all the team that created this masterpiece of the mystery murder theater, and the producers who gave it the green light! Bis!
