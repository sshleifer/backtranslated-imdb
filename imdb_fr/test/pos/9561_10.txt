This movie was even better than "Waiting for Guffman". The great strength of these two films lies in the brilliant character played by Guest and the small troop of second-second city of Levy. If anyone finds this film boring or useless, God helps them, they just did not understand it. It's a fake documentary, something for which Guest and Levy have a genius. At the end of the film, where Guest Lover from the South of the Country, Guest tells us that, to relax after the show, he went to Israel to work on a "caboose" or if he tells us that the ventriloquism is an ancient Egyptian art <br /> <br /> of an ancient Egyptian holding in his hand a tiny ancient Egyptian, I realized that this is what makes life worth living. Thank you Mr. Guest and Mr. Levy, and God bless you.
