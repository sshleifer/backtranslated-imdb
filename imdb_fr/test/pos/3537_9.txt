Obviously inspired by Se7en and sometimes even more macabre; more bloodshed and very graphic details (a bit too much for my taste). Excellent script and acting (Ken Stott particularly impressed me and there was no weak point in the cast). Good cinematography and very realistic stereo sound. One of the best thrillers I've seen in years. Although programmed on BBC in three parts, I watched Messiah video in one take. A point of criticism; the villain's motivation was not very convincing.
