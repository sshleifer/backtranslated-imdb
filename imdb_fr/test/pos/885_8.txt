I must say that all modern Korean martial arts movies are worth watching. It was not as epic as Musa-The Warriors and did not develop the characters too, but he had a lot of good ideas. Simple story: An elite soldier, dead dead, returns after years to end the reign of the Japanese in Korea in medieval times. His counterpart was once the best friend he had and now he is ready to stop him. The fight scenes are all with a sword or different weapons and very fun to watch. The characters' motifs are first discovered near the end. You may need to look again so that all connections are well established. And me personally ... I loved the end. I could watch it again and again. Maybe a little pathetic, but a true story of freedom fighter ... People can be killed, but not the ideas they defend ...
