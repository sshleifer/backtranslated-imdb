Well, where to start? I came across this one in 1993 and I just hit "record" on the VCR out of habit, more than anything else. "Citizen Kane", that's certainly not the case ... but if you've had a bad day and you're in the mood to crash into something that is not too intellectually stimulating, then I suggest maybe it's your "thing". . <br /> <br /> We have everything we need here: excellent title song, more stereotypes than we might think, unconscious comedy, the slutiest fight scene of all time and more, more , more! David Hemmings plays the diametrically opposite opposite of his role in the classic 60s, "Blow Up" - always a photographer, always stimulated by the hormones but not "quite" of the same thing. <br /> <br /> John Philip Law is an easy-to-snap actor who makes an unwooded log appear but that would not be fair considering he had about 5 minutes notice before accepting the role. <br /> <br /> Wexler like "Amanda"? In other words, it was his one and only movie role! The real star of this movie, however, is Ethel Evans who plays a, shall we say secretary (?), With the morality of a street cat and an ambition to match. The way she manages to reconcile her present life with that of a future with her future actor is in fact quite moving, in an earthy, rocky way, of what is to become. <br /> <I love this movie when I'm in the mood to watch it ....... and I will not touch it at the proverbial houseboat when I'm not. <br /> <br /> Congratulations to the cast to keep (relatively) right face during the shooting. <br /> <br /> A "classic" at the Edward D Wood Film School!
