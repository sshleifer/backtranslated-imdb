"Stripperella" is an animated series about a girl named Erotica Jones (voiced by Pamela Anderson) who lives a double life as a stripper in a gentleman's club known as "The Tender Loins" and as a fighter sexy crime known as Stripperella. Agent 69 who works for a government agency. As a Stripperella, Erotica fights crime and the forces of evil, such as a plastic surgeon who gives women breast implants that explode or magnify them, and Cheapo, a criminal who steals from stores over 99 cents and shares his weapon to his two henchmen. The creator of the character and series is Stan Lee, famous for Marvel (and creator of Spider-Man). <br /> <br /> At the end of June 2003, Spike TV (then known as The New TNN) has Thursday night block of three animated shows. These shows were "Ren & Stimpy: Cartoon Party for adults"; new adventures of classic characters from the Ren and Stimpy adult children's show by original creator John Kricfalusi, "Gary the Rat"; on a lawyer who is transformed into a human-sized rat featuring Kelsey Grammar celebrations "Cheers" and "Fraiser", and "Stripperella"; the adventures of a stripper who plays the role of superhero voiced by Pamela Anderson and created by Stan Lee. I remember seeing the three prime ministers. I could not wait to see Ren and Stimpy because I love the original show. I was a little disappointed. It was ok but it seemed to go a bit too far; Seeing both gays together was a bit too much. Although Gary the Rat is not bad, the best of the three was easily Stripperella. The animation was really good, there was a great intro song, there was a good talent behind, and it was funny like hell! The show was so stupid, I do not even know how to start explaining it! After four or five weeks (if not a little less), the animation block disappeared, which was odd because I know he got good ratings and was announced everywhere. I was disappointed to see Stripperella go, but several months later, I discovered new episodes aired at 1:00 am. I saw only one, and although it was funny as good morning and I was happy to see the show come back after all this time, something seemed a little weird .... <br /> <br /> At the beginning, it's short Run, "Stripperella" had an excellent animation. It was dark, sullen, realistic and rather sexy. Stripperella's costume looked good too, the character was well drawn. After the long pause and during the rest of the episodes, the animation was very different. Instead of appearing dark and realistic, at the beginning everything was very colorful and caricatural. Stripperella has however undergone the biggest changes. Before she had normal long hair, she now had bigger hair than Peggy Bundy (married with children), if possible. In addition, the mask for the eyes shows his eyes now; before it was just white you saw what was cool since it was more superheroish. In addition, the upper part of his costume was a kind of vest with a collar and his suit was dark blue; that changed for his costume being a bluish purple color and his suit top was really nil in comparison. In short, the series was a very ridiculous cartoon in advance, but in the second half, it became more caricatural and, although it was still funny to laugh, it also became more crazy; for example, there was a later episode about a beaver ... yes, a beaver. <br /> <br /> Anyway, instead of complaining about the changes in the middle of the series, "Stripperella" ran only one season, but it was a very good show. Like in the movie "Bordello of Blood" from Tales from the Crypt, maybe it's really campy but it's really fun. As long as you are not prudish, you will find yourself laughing at this show several times. I have not seen all the episodes because I do not have the DVD yet for two reasons: # 1. Paramount is out and they have this policy botched not to include extras in almost all the TV series published, even if it was the entire series (I would have liked to see a comment commented on the change of animation and interviews with Pamela Anderson and Stan Lee) and # 2. the great song of Kid Rock at the opening has been replaced. Now I'm not a fan of him, but this intro sang was the theme of the series! If you do not pay to have extras, pay at least to have the original introductory song. The show also featured some interesting stars such as John Lovitz (Cheapo) and Mark Hamil (the plastic surgeon) who hates models. In addition, Tom Kenny (SpongeBob) was on the bill as the owner of the strip club in almost every episode. Stan Lee also played a role in an episode. <br /> <br /> The distribution: <br /> <br /> BENEFITS: At first glance, it's great, FUNNY AS HELL, a very fun, awesome show The talent of the voice for the most part, Chef Strogenoff (watch the show and see what he's doing), is unquestionably the best of the three animated shows mentioned earlier. <br /> <br /> CONS: The intermediate animation change series and the shit DVD described earlier. Aside from the fact that some of the humor can be a bit silly sometimes, I have nothing really negative to say about it. <br /> <br /> IN GENERAL: Stripperella is a huge guilty pleasure that I find really pity. ran a season. It was a very funny, sexy and full of activity cult series that I hope to see one day on Adult Swim with the original introduction intact and maybe give it another season as Family Guy. Check even if it's on the lousy DVD. You'll laugh ridiculously. <br /> <br /> Rated TV-MA: Gross and Sexual Humor and Nudity, Duration: About 25 minutes per episode, Score: 9/10
