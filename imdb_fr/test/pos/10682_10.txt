The first incursion of Gerry Anderson in a major film enjoying an incredible work on the FX model and an excellent score of Barry Gray. Analog reel computers, in the last year "2069" (I guess Anderson really wanted a safe date 100 years later!) Are really interesting to watch, just like the modes in guru, but we could easily accuse 2001 of same violations, but no one could have foreseen certain things as they occurred. This film was the springboard of the UFO series the following year, and in fact, it did not have the same people, but the producers, but many actors of the distribution, were regulars of this emission. an "alternative story" future more than anything else - the "Apollo" rocket used during takeoff, it still seems like it's really another planet than the Earth. Given the "alternative plot of the earth", one could assume that was the feeling they wanted. We are left with an end that asks more questions than answers. Because "the other earth" exists, every movement, event and thing said is duplicated, as happens in both worlds. Because of this, and the sun between them, both versions of the same person (in this case, Glenn Ross, astronaut) can never meet. A complete accident discovered the planet in the first place while it would probably remain secret forever. <br /> <br /> Filmed mainly in Portugal with special effects in England, it is a must for any fan of Gerry Anderson. The Image Bones DVD of a few years ago is out of print, but it is hoped that Universal will reissue it with perhaps some supplements and even a commentary from Gerry Anderson.
