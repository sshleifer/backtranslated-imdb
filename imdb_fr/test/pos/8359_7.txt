When the episode was made and broadcast, Eisenhower was president. Kennedy was elected president. <br /> <br /> As for the episode, it was a passable episode, if not a serious one. "The Professor" does not show much scope here, and everything seems a little hasty (many episodes of the TZ do not seem to fit the time slot, some seem to be piled up and rushed, others with little or nothing to spread out on the half hour, and some, of course fit). I guess you're just waiting for a little more tension than being brought back to some rooms and drugged. But all in all, a decent episode. Indeed, the motive "And if" of time travel is a nugget in itself and sets the table with a fundamental interest. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10, considering the number of TZ episodes that have been worse, and some much better.
