This film is the greatest ninja movie ever made in my opinion and if you have not seen it, then it's worth it to watch it. I would say that this movie is 10/10 if you want to see more, so check out http://uk.geocities.com/ninja3thedomination The opening sequence where the evil ninja kills everyone in his way is excellent, his character is the best. He must have a young woman who finds him dying. She must then take revenge on the police officers who killed her, which means more killings and more actions. But only a ninja can destroy a ninja, so she and her boyfriend, who is also one of her targets, seek help from Yamad (Sho Kosugi) to free the evil ninja spirit and destroy it.
