I was very curious about Anatomy (aka Anatomy) and if I went to see her, I was going to have to buy it because no video store in my area was wearing the movie. As it was not a cheap DVD, I tried my luck and thought to take a look at other comments on IMDb. Many comments left me with little hope of making a lot of money for a movie I had never seen and no clue. Basically, I got the idea that it was a sexy youth-oriented adventure, compared to many predator teen thrillers. Well, something in my mind told me to ignore such comments and buy it! I did it and I was pleasantly surprised! <br /> <br /> If it has to be compared to other movies, I'd say it's a variant of Coma and Extreme Measures. I could not make any comparison with films like Scream, Urban Legends, et al. Yes, the cast is young (this is because they are medical students! At least they are not high school type characters more and more boring), and yes, some are vigorous (basically, the character played by Anna Loos is, and it is managed Anatomy is well built, the atmosphere is tense, the sets are incredible, the effects of fantastic makeup, and Franka Potente is very credible in his role.I found myself enjoying all this despite gaping holes in the plot The story of a student discovering a kind of secret society practicing autopsies on patients still alive is a rather worrying scenario and what happens to these patients afterwards is enough Of course, you could ask why she did not come out of this city? Ok, but the film would be finished in half an hour. <br /> <br /> It was the first effort of the game German Columbia Pict ures, and that's actually quite impressive. The production has been a little care and offer real thrills is a feat. He is a little mature in his mind, because he does not resort to constant occasions of sexual encounters (a feast of the breast) or jokes about juvenile drugs. The character of Anna Loos, although often making sexual remarks and looking for fun, was actually a good idea - to have a character who was a smarter woman than all the men in the school. She discovered that sex was really a distraction for her and that men were missing her instead. <br /> <br /> THE STUFF IMPORTANT: See this movie in original German with English or French subtitles is the BEST way to enjoy it. I saw the theatrical trailers dubbed in English and I was disgusted by the change in tone of the film. I've never seen a properly dubbed movie in my life - they can never find suitable voices for actors or characters in the film. Actually, I tried to watch a part of the Anatomy doubled in English and the intelligence level of it fell sharply, making it a semblance of comedy. A good example is when a guy was panicked after being cut and shouted for being stitched up. To hear that in German seemed frantic, but nicknamed in English, he looked like a comedian. Frankly, I'm tired of hearing people say that they can not read subtitles or watch a movie "in mailbox". Anatomy is ridiculous with doubled voices that seem octaves too high for all the characters you see in the movie. Anna Loos's sexual comments sound like horrible words in Fast Times At Ridgemont High. I wonder if the negative reviews on Anatomy come from people who watched it dubbed, it just does not look like the same movie! This is not a cheap horror movie and deserves to be seen as it was created. It is interesting to note that some English subtitles differ in the scenes of the feature film and the making of supplement. <br /> <br /> In the end, I played and won with Anatomy. It is a competent thriller with nice characters and does not try to make shivers cheap.
