An unusual film for an audience outside the United States. Lena Horne looks fabulous and Ralph Cooper too. There is no background of added slaps as in other musicals, so you do not hear the beat of taps, which is very realistic. The music is muffled to hear the dance steps. The filming is a bit scalded and the actors speak slowly, so you think the film is older than it is. The costumes dare time in the dance routines at the end. We often have the impression of being part of an audience during a show. The furniture you see is very modern, which adds to the film a sensation of another world. A must for all moviegoers.
