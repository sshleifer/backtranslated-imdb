TEP is like a long glass of cool water after crawling across the Sahara for classic movie buffs who have been deprived of this cinematic magic for too long! Not only is it beautifully photographed, but the characters are perfectly represented. If you want the film to be a mirror of the book, you will be seriously disappointed. Instead, it's an excellent "companion" to the book, and I think that was what Anthony Minghella wanted. Ralph Fiennes is probably the most beautiful man in the world. not to mention a brilliant actor. Juliette Binoche is the posterior of vulnerability and childlike enthusiasm. And, of course, I will go see all the movies in which Kristin Scott Thomas is presented. She just has to be THE best actress since Deborah Kerr. Much has been promised with this movie, and a lot is delivered!
