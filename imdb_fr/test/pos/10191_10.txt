This film is amazing. You will never laugh harder. It's a target. No, I think it's ... yes it's ... a boob! This film becomes more and more funny in the second second, as when the character of Jackie Chan dies in his last fight scene. This movie is velly velly seekwet like treasha! Congratulations if you buy or rent this. You will never return it, in my opinion. I did not do it and I have not found it in a store since. I watched this movie once and I was still in love with Kung-Fu action movies. If you're looking for an amazing film that produces high production value, a quality game, or even mediocre, and good special effects ... it's NOT this movie. If you're looking for laughter and timeless wonder, buy it for a buck and you'll probably never let it go. With friends, popcorn and drinks, it's the perfect night.
