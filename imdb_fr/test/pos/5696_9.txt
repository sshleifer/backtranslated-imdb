Although many people have found this film simply too slow and simplistic, I really connected to this movie. There is no conspiracy as such, but the film takes the form of a story of human survival about three people trapped in a tree with a man eating crocodile lurking somewhere in the water under them . <br /> Personally, I thought the acting was generally very good, despite quite demanding roles at times, and I felt a sense of warmth for the characters. The situation they were in was pretty terrifying and I felt really nervous for them. I find the entire film very nerve-wracking because of the desperate situation and the constant threat to their survival. <br /> <br /> Crocodile effects have been treated surprisingly for a low-budget movie, and believe me, I've seen my fair share of wacky movies. The creature moved and was really threatening and, although the audience I was with did not seem very enthusiastic about the film as a whole, they still jumped and gasped every time the crocodile appeared. I would have made some changes, especially towards the end, but it was not a major problem. For slow-decay survival horror fans in the realm of reality, this movie will be appealing, but unfortunately, I think for many audiences looking for thrills and greater production values ​​drawn from their experience cinematographic, this point will simply be forgotten.
