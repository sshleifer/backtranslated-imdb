I knew Walter would never do another set. I was in my thirties when I saw this film sweet, endearing and unashamedly romantic. I loved this movie from the first scene to the end. Art Carney was his stupid self; Glenda matched Walter step by step with witty words, and Richard Benjamin provided the sarcastic voice of the reason he does so well. There are many actors that we all recognize, making their usual brilliance. There are a few lines in the movie that my SO and I have used over the years, but I will not say anything about them here. I'm pretty sure you'll know what I'm talking about. Take this movie. Make popcorn, take your pressure (if it's as severe as mine, for which I'm grateful), and enjoy this out-of-the-ordinary romantic comedy from the 70s. You will not be disappointed. However, I feel that I preach at the choir here because anyone who loves Walter will already have it. I am very happy that the DVD is finally available.
