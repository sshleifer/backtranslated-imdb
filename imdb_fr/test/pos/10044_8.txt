George Armstrong Custer is known throughout history as an inept general who drove him to death during the Battle of Little Big Horn. "They are dead with their boots", draws a different portrait of General Custer. In this film, he is described as a Flamboyant soldier whose mistakes and misdeeds are mainly due to his love for adventure. <br /> <br /> Errol Flynn plays George Armstrong Custer, whom we meet for the first time as a too confident rookie at West Point. Custer is quickly different from other cadets as a poor student who always seems to have problems. In one way or another, it never seems to bother Custer and seems to confuse him only to the extent that he does not really know how he finds himself in such situations. Despite his poor reputation, he eventually graduated and became an officer of the United States Army. By mistake, Custer receives a rank promotion. Before that can be corrected, he leads a Union regiment in combat against the Confederates. His campaign is successful and Custer becomes an unlikely national hero. Custer returns to his hometown, marries his friend Libby, who is played by Olivia De Havilland. Libby is an understanding and understanding woman who remains resolutely at his side and follows him to the border as he assumes the leadership of the Seventh Cavalry Regiment. Custer becomes a man of honor who strives to maintain peace with the Amerindians. To prove his intentions, he concluded a treaty with Crazy Horse, the leader of the Sioux. When this treaty is compromised by a plot to spread a false rumor about the discovery of gold in the Black Hills, Custer sacrifices his own life as well as that of the men under his command to prevent the killing of thousands of innocent settlers. /> <br /> Errol Flynn dominates every scene in which he appears. He successfully describes Custer as flamboyant, arrogant, romantic and funny depending on the mood of the scene. The representation of Libby Bacon Custer by Olivia De Havilland while the love of her life lets us see her soft and tender side. The chemistry between DeHavilland and Flynn, who have played together in several other films, is so smooth and gives the viewer the feeling of playing with himself and not with Custer and his wife. The representations of their characters by the other actors really reinforce the performances of Flynn and De Havilland. Anthony Quinn as Crazy Horse, Sidney Greenstreet as General Winfield Scott, Arthur Kennedy as Edward Sharp are some of the other actors whose roles have made this film entertaining. <br /> <br /> The critic called it a 4-star movie. Although it is not historically accurate, it is very amusing. The film has a bit of everything. There is adventure, comedy and romance, so it is aimed at a wide range of audiences. The casting of the characters is excellent and the actors give credible performances, which makes you forget that it is largely based on the fiction rather than the facts. The critic particularly likes the fact that Native Americans have not been shown to be evil, but simply as a desire to protect their sacred land. <br /> <br />
