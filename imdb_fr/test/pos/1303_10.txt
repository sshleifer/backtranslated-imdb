GLORIFIER, NOT GLAMORIZING the Second World War. <br /> <br /> We had a lot of documentary series about the Second World War in the usual television shows. Without looking for any information in an encyclopedia or a film book, it seems that this ancient memory can remember most names by itself. <br /> <br /> There was CROISADE IN EUROPE, title of war memoirs of an army general and later the 33rd president of the United States of America, Dwight D. Eisenhower. This told the story of the conflict in Europe as perceived by the Supreme Allied Commander. <br /> <br /> Then there was a CRUSADE IN THE PACIFIC (a subject that is self-explanatory), which I do not remember very much. Journalist / Author, Jim Bishop was BATTLELINE's host / navigator. <br /> <br /> And there was the excellent WINSTON CHURCHILL, THE VALIANT ANS. * The series was a co-production of the British Broadcasting Corporation and the American Broadcasting Company. It aired for the first time in the 1960-1961 season here in the United States and boasts of having Richard Burton uttering the words of Sir Winston. <br /> <br /> This is the production of our 1952 subject by NBC Television Network, THE SEA wins the cigar, hands down. <br /> <br /> For starters, it took years of production, carefully, to literally sort through thousands of hours of film. The film in question here is the official filmed footage taken by members of the United States Armed Forces, an independent news film, the recording film of our other Allied partner countries, as well as captured images of the Axis of Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy and Imperial Japan. <br /> <br /> Once this was done, the different films had to be cut and edited in a series of half-hour slices. This has been done with great skill, since there have been so many scene changes, whether suddenly or in dissolution. The look of each episode appears as smooth as if it were a unique film project. <br /> <br /> The writing of Spoken Word to accompany this film of the most beautiful real life was no less amazing and unique. Highly polite and meaningful eloquence does not lose a word and sometimes even minimizes the description of the action, rather than exaggerating it. The narration goes to Mr. Ralph Graves, a talented actor of the stage, film, radio and television. He certainly acquired a certain immortality by repeating the written descriptions of the episodes. <br /> <br /> Finally, VICTORY AT SEA enjoys the luxury of having an original score, both open and incidental. by Richard Rodgers, famous Broadway celebrity. (Rodgers & Hart, Rodgers & Hammerstein) His compositions are complex, complete, variable and even "classic" in the true sense. <br /> <br /> The classic arrangement was played by the NBC Sympphony Orchestra under the direction of Robert Russell Bennett and as a soundtrack / CD / cassette, it is continuously available and in demand since its first release , 55 years ago! And, really, a marvel, because it is this musical score that so fascinates the viewer / listener. He really puts the icing on this cake. <br /> <br /> * SIR WINSTON CHURCHILL, THE VALIANT YEARS also got a beautiful and original memorable score. This was also composed by Mr. Rodgers. <br /> <br /> ** We also had an "Ace in the hole" in our house in the person of our father, the late Clement J. Ryan (1914-1974). Dad was in the US Navy during the war and was inducted in 1943 or 1944. Our Pop was always available to further explain and clarify the situations described in the series. <br /> <br /> He and our mother, Bertha (n√©e Fuerst), 90 years old, already had my older sister. , Joanne (1942-90) as a dependent.
