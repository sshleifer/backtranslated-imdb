Here is a film of adventure, determination, heroism and bravery. In addition, it was set up in the late 1800s, which makes it even more interesting. It's a wonderful and adventurous story, and Alyssa Milano is wonderful for playing the healthy, confident and sensible Fizzy ... an excellent model. This is one of my favorite movies. It's a movie to watch over and over again and will inspire you and enrich your life without a doubt. The screenplay is not only excellent, but the film also presents a fabulous landscape and music and is wonderfully realized. This film is as good as gold!
