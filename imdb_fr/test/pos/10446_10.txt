"The Last American Virgin" and "Fast Times at Ridgemont High" are some of the latest great teen movies ever made. It is a tender story of envy and unrequited love that took place in the early eighties. Well criticized by critics as a trivial and sophomoric attempt to recreate the magic of "Fast Times at Ridgemont High", these same critics fail to recognize that both films were shot simultaneously towards the end of 1981 and went out at slight intervals from each other. In any case, the studios would never allow such a bold and uncompromising portrayal of the problems that many teens face as they reach sexual maturity. Especially given the heartbreaking discovery that the protagonist, Gary is facing in the end. American Pie it is not. The story revolves around a trio of teenagers and their mostly unsuccessful sexual activities. Gary is the least successful of the group, hence the slogan LAST AMERICAN VIRGIN. In secret, Gary covets Karen, who is involved with Rick, his best friend. Rick and Karen start having sex and Karen gets pregnant, but Rick drops him, who is not interested in the obvious responsibility that awaits him. Gary slides into Karen's help, which leads to the unexpected conclusion mentioned above. Overall, as a film, I find that the film has been very successful as a comedy, as a commentary on the sexual dilemmas of young men, and in a remarkable novel dealing with topics such as envy, love not shared and abortion, which are just as relevant. today as they were over twenty years ago. In addition, it has one of the most rocking soundtracks ever made !!!
