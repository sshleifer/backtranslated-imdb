In an article published in the New York Times in March 1947, Crossfire is one of the first Hollywood movies of the 1940s to "deal with issues of racial and religious prejudice with more frankness than the public expects." . While RKO was producing Crossfire, Twentieth Century-Fox was making Gentleman's Agreement another story of anti-Semitism. The RKO ran to beat Fox's image much "ballyhooed" on theaters, releasing Crossfire several months before Gentleman's Agreement. In July 1947, the RKO screened Crossfire for representatives of various religious groups in Los Angeles. In addition, several surveys aimed at assessing public prejudice were conducted before and after the screening of the film. Crossfire has received praise and criticism for describing anti-Semitism in America and has been the subject of numerous editorials. Crossfire was nominated for Oscars for best film, but was defeated by Gentleman's Agreement. He has also been nominated for Best Supporting Actress (Robert Ryan), Best Secondary Actress (Gloria Grahame), Best Director and Best Screenplay (Adaptation). In September 1947, Crossfire was named best social film in Cannes. In December 1947, Ebony magazine, an African-American publication, awards the film its annual prize for "improving interracial understanding". I loved this film. If you have the chance to watch it, see it.
