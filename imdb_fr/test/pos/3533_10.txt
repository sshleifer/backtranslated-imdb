Jeff Lieberman's "Just Before Dawn" is certainly one of the most underrated horror films of all time. The film, though slightly influenced by "Deliverance" and "The Texas Chain Saw Massacre", is extremely scary and memorable. The suspense is almost never The cast is excellent. Deborah Benson and Jamie Rose are excellent female stars. The consanguineous twins are scary and ruthless killers. The film is beautifully shot - it was shot on location at Silver Falls State Park in Oregon. There is very little coolness, but a murder, when Verchel is stabbed in the groin, is pretty nasty and unpleasant. A must for slasher fans. 10 of 10 - What else?
