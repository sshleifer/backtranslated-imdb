A great combination: - Shabbat humor - the world and characters of Uderzo / Goscinny - the limited presence of Christian Clavier <br /> <br /> The original comics were excellent - one of the best of a big series - and Alain Chabat, one of The funniest member of the famous French band Les Nuls was able to film, reproduce and complete the great work accomplished by Goscinny and Uderzo by skillfully applying the story, giving Djamel Debouze his better role (finally a little removed from its usual repeatable part), bringing together a group of great actors (Gerard Darmon is wonderful, as often, Chabat himself is a great Caesar). <br /> <br /> In addition, while being forced to continue with Christian Clavier as Asterix, Chabat has intelligently adjusted his role in the film to highlight Darmon and Debouze ... which is always a good idea! <br /> <br /> => Fantastic environment, fantastic scenario, great director, excellent actors, great humor, beautiful Cleopatra ... This film deserved a 10 if Clavier had not been involved.
