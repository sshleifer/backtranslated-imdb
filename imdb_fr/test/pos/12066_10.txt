This show is almost brilliant. It's a modern day married ... with children. The scripts are spiritual because they are sprinkled with intelligent sarcasm. They are also realistic and address the issues faced by many parents of adolescents. In addition to the current burden you might not be the world's biggest parent, and what's the best way to handle this? However, at the same time, he manages to stay light and fun. Which, with all the drama and action on TV these days, is a very nice and welcome change. It's something you can sit in front for 30 minutes and relax, laugh and tell yourself. This is not the most hilarious comedy in the world. but will make you laugh at least a few times an episode. Michael Rapaport is brilliant in the lead as Dave. He fills the big shoes that the very sarcastic script requires and more. He and Anita Barone (Vikki) have fantastic chemistry and rebel very well. This show has a promising future if it is marketed to the appropriate target audience and in the appropriate time slot. In addition, if Fox publishes it on DVD, the following items will be more powerful and bulkier. (As in the classic example with Scrubs.)
