I think this film is the most misunderstood movie of Jerry Lewis's career. It's a little slow at first, but after that starts to be very funny and the use of irony by Jerry like never before in his previous films ... a mock Dirty Dozen, instead of asking soldiers sentenced to death to do a suicide mission as in this movie, you have 4, 4-f's & 2. Willie Davis, the former star center player of the LD Dodgers, as Linc! HILARIOUS! Love this movie!
