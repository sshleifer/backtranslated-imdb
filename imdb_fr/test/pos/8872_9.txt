I thought the interaction between Crystal and DeVito was excellent. The film is rather on the wall, but there are some unforgettable lines. Ramsey as a "mom" is vulgar and overflowing, but also very entertaining and efficient. The character MUST be pretty awful, otherwise why would anyone think of killing his mother? Now, Crystal's wife - she's a "slut" that everyone would like to receive. His role, though minor, is also effective because he has to justify Crystal's ridiculous case of "author blocking". Although there are certainly some dark moments, the film is not depressing and, despite the murderous impulses felt by the protagonists, they also have redeeming qualities. <br /> <br /> All in all, this is one of the funniest movies I can remember, one that I do not mind looking at several times.
