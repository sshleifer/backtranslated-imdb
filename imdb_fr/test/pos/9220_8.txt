Uh, hello .. Rainbow Brite .. the name alone is hard to take seriously, as if it could be the cousin of Strawberry Shortcake .. but when you're a kid, it's definitely a serious business. <br /> <br /> Then, there's this vile, bratty, spoiled girl and she wants the Rainbow Brites belt, among other things, that is to say the light of the entire universe, and Rainbow Brite and her friend Cris are bound and determined to stop him. If I remember correctly, Murky and Lurky played a minor role in this production. Maybe they wanted too much money? <br /> <br /> Anyway, the evil little girl has a powerful jewel and she channels her power to take the Rainbow belt .. imagine? But one way or another, Rainbow recovers his belt and revitalizes it with "splash of stars" and kicks the bad girls with the help of Cree and his prism bracelet, which also save the entire universe. <br /> <br /> Good triumphs over evil, kindness overrides rudeness, and Rainbow Brite and children of color are safe again to spread the color and joy of all mankind.
