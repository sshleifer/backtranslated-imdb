Nazarin's famous surrealist Bunuel is clearly an attack on the Catholic Church and its loss of values. It's not a visual film and I think it would have played better on stage. Bunuel takes us through this man, the Nazarene who lives as Christ lived; a true disciple, that is to say, in poverty and without concern for property and what the next day brings. Some might call it a parallel with the story of Christ, but for all practitioners and practitioners of speech, life should look like Christ in a certain way. But in essence, Bunuel is also interested in the question of man's selfishness and his need to sin and the way in which goodness can save us all. It is a bold statement to make that can animate, or recite to memory the film for some. In truth, the Nazarene is also selfish because he gives without wanting it or asking for it. His selfishness is his madness and the two women who follow him represent the sides of a coin, with the same face on each side. In this film, many people represent the faces of a coin, the two faces being identical. But the film is not really memorable once it is over and we could tackle many of its perforations and ethical outbursts within its own doctrine. It is not Bunuel, but a sequence of "surrealist" dreams that Bunuel stages where the film's message is framed and worth noting, as it shows the director's abilities, Bunuel.
