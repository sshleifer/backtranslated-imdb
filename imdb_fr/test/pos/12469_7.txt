I loved the first part of this film in Africa for about an hour or so, until the cruelty to the animals of civilized humans in Scotland came to me in the second half and made me so sad that I can not watch a game. However, this was done by the filmmaker to make clear that the first natural scientists ruined everything they lived that they did not understand by literally "studying" to death without taking into account the rights and comfort of the animals studied; that we should not now. to be studied anywhere except in the natural world where they live, and as discreetly as possible. I recommend this film because it was an essentially serious and honest story of Tarzan, who wanted to show the cruelty to animals that reigned in the scientific world in the nineteenth century, as well as the pure and simple and wonderfully primitive life that Tarzan lived a young man found baby and raised by chimpanzees after the violent death of his parents in the African jungle. <br /> <br /> Christopher Lambert was wonderful and very inspired in his role life of Tarzan, just like Ralph Richardson in his last role as ultra-rich grandfather of Tarzan in Scotland. Andy MacDowell was pretty and pretty good as Tarzan's "civilized" Jane in her first movie role. Through his charismatic work in this film and his haunting eyes, I do not understand why Lambert did not become a big star afterwards, but his really bad movie choices may have made it later. The terrible Ian Holm, a wounded Frenchman in Africa helped by Tarzan and who then escorted Tarzan to his ancestral and unknown home in Scotland, was great, as always. <br /> <br /> I'm glad Tarzan got tired of it and did not stay in this cruel animal. civilized world at that time and went home to Africa in the end to live his life with his "parents" sweet and loving monkey who raised him instead of staying in Scotland and living like a king, which would have ruined him kill him first.
