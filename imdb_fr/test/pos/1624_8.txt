As I sat in the theater, crying almost in sorrow at the atrocity that Ron Howard and Tom Hanks call The Da Vinci Code, I could not see the light at the end of the tunnel that is Angels and Demons. <br /> <br /> Hanks and Company are back for the angels and demons of Sequel-Prequel and they learned their lesson. <br /> <br /> It is much better to act wisely. Aylet Zurer is very good as Vittoria Vetra and better than the girl who played Sophie Neveau. Tom Hanks is very good, as always, he is better in this area because he tries to give the film the feeling that it is a thriller. I think Ewan McGregor does the best job of all the actors. He may even deserve an appointment in March, but it is doubtful. He convinced me until the end. Dynamic and faithful, but rational, he realizes that the Church must put its past behind them. Minor actors also do very good work. <br /> <br /> Technically and visually, the film has improved a lot. Cinematography is much ... much better, and the visual effects are superb. The final explosion sequence at the end is excellent. Howard does a masterful job of showing you around Rome. <br /> <br /> Sage, Ron Howard does an incredible job this time to get the story moving and not get bored with a history lesson known to denounce Christianity. The film also gives you the impression that more is at stake. In our weak minds, to find out whether or not Jesus had children, is not as high in the list in relation to a cataclysmic explosion causing thousands of deaths, including including the Roman Catholic Church. Part of the reason I think the story is so fast is due to the excellent score. I can not say enough about the score. It was sometimes epic, like something from Lord of the Rings, but sometimes it looked like a Bourne movie, which is a good mix. <br /> <br /> My only complaint is that this film is ridiculously far. went looking for The chances of Carmelengo being a man of the same age as Ewan McGregors are highly improbable, and the chances of a cardinal with an adopted son being elected pope are even more ridiculous. Not to mention all about Antimatter, which has not been created yet, and Dan Brown wrote the book in 2003 ... <br /> <br /> Overall, Angels and Demons is much narrower, faster , more exciting and more important movie than the Da Vinci Code. It's a must-see thriller for anyone who loves history and mystery combined.
