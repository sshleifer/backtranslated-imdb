What is there to say about "Pink Flamingos"? It's beyond criticism or even explanation because it does not really aspire to look like another movie you've seen. You will understand it or you will not do it, you will make fun of him or you will roll disgusting eyes (or both). John Waters is a strange filmmaker (it's a euphemism), mixing both childish and innocent humor with shocking and offensive moments aimed at ... well, who knows what his intentions were. It's like a form of aggression, although amusing. <br /> <br /> What makes Waters' mood so contagious and effective is that his characters live in a world that may seem both foreign and completely familiar to the viewer, such as the small rivalries that form the world. plot of "Pink Flamingos". Everyone has surely experienced this kind of thing at some point, but it is almost certain that the case in question was not the title of "The Filthiest Person Alive". What makes the film captivating for me is the way Waters creates vertiginous and autonomous environments and does not let you into the joke right away. The characters in his films are perfectly in sync with each other. For example, when Cotton tells Babs that she does not want to accompany him to town because Crackers is taking his "girlfriend" to the trailer, Babs reacts with a smirk and tells him, in a conspiratorial conspiracy: "That's it. shed is PERFECT ... "At this point, we do not know yet that Crackers is planning to bring his" girlfriend "into the shed to propel live chickens on her naked body while Cotton looks orgasm through a window, but this strangeness is quite banal and understood by the characters of the fictitiously degenerate world created by Waters. <br /> <br /> Another example would be the conversations between the girls in the basement and Channing, the deviant butler of the Marbles. The first time we see them, Waters moves from a scene in Connie's comfortable office in Channing down to the basement, where we see there are two women there, one dead and another very alive and hurt. Susan is not a fearful victim, but is enraged and insulting to Channing, jumping on her own to launch a large-scale verbal attack on her jailer. They both have a strange understanding of the strange situation and she is not so intimidated by her kidnapping, she is violently insulted and furious. She does not give up a moment while Channing is in his eyes, and the two scenes featuring their delusional joke are two of the highlights of the film. Later in the film, when Divine and Crackers enter the Marble house and discover their crimes of keeping women abducted in their basement, this represents the total lack of support from Divine and her family for the kind of depravity that the Marbles are tracking down. -There is something Divine does not know, a corruption invented by her new rivals, and she despises it. Also, while the rapture does not seem to be a thing Divine would think twice, she is indignant that the girls are held there and liberates them with joy, relishing the vengeance they take for Channing. <br /> <br /> At the other end of the spectrum of impurities, Waters sometimes reminds us of the line of demarcation between his twisted imaginary world and the "real" world. The first time we see Connie, she belittles a minor character named Sandy Sandstone, who has never heard of Divine. On the contrary, Cookie reacts with a hilarious evaluation of the title of Divine as "the dirtiest person ever", revealing that she lives in this world of unspoken and understood madness. <br /> <br /> We must also say something about the way players are in touch with their respective roles, especially Divine, who does not miss a note. Not once, it does not falter in the ridiculous costume and character that has been assigned to it, and it takes "Pink Flamingos" to a higher level or a quirk. People really believed that Divine was like that in real life, and it's easy to understand why, because by watching the movie, you do not really think about the movie, you think about those people who did it. Since they really make scandalous things in the screenplay, you start to think that this may not be a story but a strange documentary. <br /> <br /> But more so, "Pink Flamingos" is not so much a movie as an event or something that happens to you. Even though its shock value is largely gone for me now (I say mostly because the scene of a hole ** and the chicken scene make me wince again), I still find that this film is hilarious and creates habits.
