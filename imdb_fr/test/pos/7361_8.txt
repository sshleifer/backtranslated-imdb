I can not believe I enjoyed myself as much as I did. The anthology stories were better than normal, but the bond story and its surprise ending caught me. Many familiar faces will make you wonder "where have I seen them before?" Forget the run time shown on the New Line band, it's also not 103 minutes, according to my VCR timer and IMDB. Space Maggot turns off the campfire in his own way and hikes.
