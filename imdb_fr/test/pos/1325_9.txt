The first season explained just about how all Marine Corps elements would work (for example, on the ground, in flight, helicopter and jet) as a team. This is the season to which I give the best rating! (Of course, there are still a lot of "liberties" taken in season 1, but the stories were more likely.) <br /> <br /> The following seasons were a frightening attempt at Melrose Place and Top Gun! <br /> <br /> I was a sailor stationed at Miramar at the time and I remember that they had filmed the show in the San Diego area. I had the opportunity to talk to Rod Rowland and James Brolin. <br /> <br /> Rowland's character was good to play. <br /> <br /> The Brolin character was good the first season only. For some reason, he relaxed after the first EP of the second season. <br /> <br /> If you want to get an overview of how the Marine Air Ground team works, the first season is the one to watch. <BR /> <br /> If you like Melrose Place and the soap opera, try merging them with Top Gun, and then look at the last two seasons.
