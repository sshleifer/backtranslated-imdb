This is another one of my favorite Columbos. It features leading actors, including John Cassavetes, never more handsome and sexier, Anjanette Comer, Myrna Loy and Blythe Danner. Now, here's something I've always wondered about - was Gwenyth Paltrow born when this episode was shot or was Danner pregnant at the time? Thanks to IMDb, I have my answer: she was five months pregnant. Now, I can really feel antique. <br /> <br /> Cassavetes plays a brilliant conductor whose marriage to Danner apparently had to use his mother's social ties (Loy). He has a mistress on the side, Anjanette Comer, a leading pianist, but she announces that she wants more. She is tired of being in the street. On the night of their concert, he gets rid of her and makes her look like a suicide. Columbo immediately detects some problems. One thing he notices: "You have a beautiful woman here - eyes in the bedroom - she has money, a body and a career Where is the man?" It's wonderful to see Falk and his good friend Cassavetes together. There is a very funny episode at the vet with Bassett from Columbo. Everyone in the cast is awesome. <br /> <br /> This is one of the episodes that made Columbo the classic series he has become.
