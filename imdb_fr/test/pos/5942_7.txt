I must be a bit skeptical when I went to the movies to watch OSS117: French comedies tend to be so satisfied nowadays that only the most stupid ones have a high national box office score. But I was surprised to see that even if the humor did not always reach the level of the Monthy Pythons, the many references to the French vision of the world of the 1950s, that represents OSS117, are hilarious and the director managed to recreate this time with astonishing fidelity. In short, a good surprise, without forgetting the excellent performances of various secondary actors. And at least for once, the style of Jean Dujardin (which can annoy a lot of people) corresponds perfectly to the character he interprets.
