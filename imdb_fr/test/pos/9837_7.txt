Years ago, I did not like and respect Jimmy Cagney's movies as much as they do now. I noticed that many Cagney films shot with Warner Brothers in the 1930s lacked realism and that his acting style was far from subtle. However, the more I watched these films, the more I found myself hooked despite these aspects. In fact, now I love them and I wait for them! Fans of old Hollywood movies probably understand what I say - teens and other young whippersnappers do not understand it! When it comes to entertainment, THE MAIRE OF HELL never gives up from start to finish. Although the idea of ​​a shady character such as Cagney played to lead a reform school is ridiculous, and if all the changes he made seemed far-fetched, they were all elaborated and gave you a solid entertainment. <br /> <br /> The gang of tough thugs was earlier than Dead End Kids and, instead of Leo Gorcey, Huntz Hall and Billy Hallop, Frankie Darrow and Farina play the same role. Yes, I said "Farina". This black actor was already famous for his roles in the comedies of Our Gang and was, believe it or not, one of the highest paid kids in Hollywood. All he needed to give up was to call himself a tasteless name and behave like a nice "Negro" stereotype. Here it was actually quite good and the usual black stereotypes are a little more moderate than usual. However, some will rub the very funny but horribly offensive court scene involving Farina and her father, Fred 'Snowflake' Toones. With terrible names like "Farina" and "Snowflake", do not say I did not warn you. <br /> <br /> Aside from this little complaint and this intriguing plot, the movie is exceptional and fun. The kids do a great job, just like Cagney and Dudley Digges in a despicable and exciting role as an evil guardian. In addition, you will see actor Allen Warkins, eternal actor of Warner, in his first role for the studio.
