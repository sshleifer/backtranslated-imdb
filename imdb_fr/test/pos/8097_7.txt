It must have been one of Chaplin's most ambitious projects; it infuses just about everything from visual gags to obscure comic sketches to social relevance, romance or even violence. The mix is ​​stimulating and intriguing, and the film contains many fun and intelligent sequences (like the one where Chaplin and four other guys try to avoid finding a coin that will order them to sacrifice themselves), but the ingredients are not always compatible. and the mixture (and tone) seems a bit disharmonious. As for the famous final speech, certainly honest without doubt, it also seems a little naive today, with its allusions to "a better world where man will overcome his hatred and brutality and where his soul will fly." Great performances of Jack Oakie and the beautiful Paulette Goddard. (***)
