It must be the ultimate movie for girls. We filmed it a few years ago and have watched it about 30 times over the years. I had not seen it for about 12 years and I had just watched this movie. I'm not lying, I cried from the opening credits to the end credits. This film tears your heart, even if you do not have children.
