It is a brilliant and sumptuous Czech film from Sverak's father and son team, which tells the story of two Czech pilots who fled to England to help the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain, but who also lost a woman (the beautiful Tara Fitzgerald). Presents excellent and incredibly realistic aerial combat scenes ?? probably the best and much better than Pearl Harbor or even the movie Battle of Britain - and a number of interesting general themes such as love, war, romance, camaraderie, loss and bondage. Also, the hardships and tribulations of moving abroad and learning a foreign language (although this is easier here with the great hardcore Anna Massey). <br /> <br /> The film contains beautiful little motifs such as the famous RAF bullseye camera. , shown everywhere and at a time well reflected in the black vinyl record, constantly rotating around you (the music is another theme of the film, of course). Plus, all the traditional icons of English life: padded beer glasses (unlike the classic post-war glasses used at Pearl Harbor), tea in a lovely porcelain tea set in a garden in the English countryside (well that shot in the Czech Republic?), the mascot dog, a vintage bottle of HP sauce, or even a dart board! <br /> <br /> Of course, the airfield and the surrounding countryside are ridiculously different from anything in the south of England, although virtuous airstrikes outweigh this, showing Eastbourne and the Seven Sisters , always synonymous with southern England and the Battle of Britain. But the best of all is Ondrej Soukup's sensational musical score, and nothing but Hans Zimmer's, but part of the tradition of the late Ron Goodwin, who recorded the original Battle of Britain film among other classic English war movies. There is even a nice little cameo role for the movie ?? Apparently ?? the famous Czech musician and actor (and Kevin Kline look-alike) Oldrich Kaiser, who plays piano the theme song, Dark Blue Sky. Excellent! <br /> <br /> It also contains some small Freudian devices, as funny as funny, as always to show an inflated condom that floats near the ceiling every time Karel (the callous but brilliant Krystof Hadek) gets stuck at the airfield rival rival and co-driver Frantisek (Ondrej Vetchy) is with Susan. <br /> <br /> Another great English actor in this movie! Charles Dance is of course very good as Wing Commander Bentley. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended and worth the detour / recruitment ?? get the DVD with special features (things like how they created dog fighting). Probably the only movie to combine subtitles with English, German, French and Czech speaking characters simultaneously.
