I loved this movie when I was younger and I was looking for it again !! I would like to watch again !! All the information is correct, but the cover does not seem to match, but I can not say for sure. To my recollection, the film spoke of these children (Alyssa Milano, Tina Yothers, etc.) while driving, and also showed their misdeeds outside the classroom. Edie McClurg was the mother of Alyssa Milano in the film. I remember that I really liked the movie. If anyone knows where to get a copy (preferably a DVD) of the film mentioned above (with these stars), I would like to know. Thank you :)
