It's easily one of the best films of the 1950s. Otto Preminger has only made four or five very good films, including this one. Frank Sinatra gives his best performance and Elmer Bernstein's score is dynamite. Opening tracks (Saul Bass) to the hysteria of drug addict Frank unexpectedly, it's a fascinating film! With Kim Novak (very good performance), Eleanor Parker (very bad performance), as well as Darren McGavin as reptilian pusher and Arnold Stang as Frank's signature buddy. Beware of bad impressions: this film is in the public domain, some copies are pretty rough
