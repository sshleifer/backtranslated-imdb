This production was a surprise to me. I love the obscure movies of the early '30s, but I was not prepared for the last 25 minutes of this story. If, by chance, you are not convinced in the first half, hang in there for the final. Of course, you have to consider blatant racism as purely current. A fascinating visual experience, but I think that THE CAT'S PAW is not yet available in video / DVD. Look at your PBS lists!
