I watched this series after Tipping the Velvet, for which I gave a rating of 10/10. I had read the user reviews about it and was expecting a series that was just as good, if not better, if possible. At this point, I must emphasize that this series is good and that it captured me permanently throughout my career and that it deserves to be watched. However, I did not appreciate as much as Tipping the Velvet, for the following reasons: <br /> <br /> 1. Less passion, love and related sexual content. Surprisingly, these elements were not put forward, which is for me a love story. Fingersmith looked like a diluted version of Tipping the Velvet. <br /> <br /> 2. Similarly, as in Tipping the Velvet, the story had three parts: the beginning, a shocking second part and the end. The second part should have been the culmination of the story (as in Tipping the Velvet), but it was almost totally forgotten, perhaps because of its inability to create shocking but credible asylum content. The series should have been in three parts, with two cliffhangers, with much more attention for the second part. <br /> <br /> 3. Almost no weight was given to what Fingersmiths are and how it affected their personality. I found it rather boring that the series does not treat this central topic properly. <br /> <br /> 4. The end was much faster than in Tipping the Velvet. Fingersmith has left many interesting intrigues open. <br /> <br /> Despite these shortcomings, Fingersmith is a good series, which is worth 7/10. However, it's not a classic like Tipping the Velvet.
