In response to "State of Confusion", the wounds of the dogs seem to disappear rather abruptly, but this may only be a continuity error. But when it comes to children trying to build a plane with junk, it's just a matter of imagination. They are two very young children who have an extremely active imagination and who must rely on this imagination not to be exposed to the reality of the abuses suffered by their father-in-law in their home. Regarding the stepfather, it is very interesting that the director has chosen not to show his face. It makes him look more monstrous. If you show his face, then this character becomes a person and not just this "monster" who terrorizes the childhood of these two innocent children. By showing only the consequences of his abuse and not focusing his scenes on this abuse, the children become the center of action of the film. This film has no end, but works exactly like a father's tale for his children. He has embellishments. It's a good American classic.
