A good film. No free gadgets like in most Hollywood movies. Everything supported the suspense of the plot. B & W also gave it a basic, no-nonsense feel. In short, he was visceral in his simplicity of cinematography and casting. <br /> <br /> The following is an interesting contrast with Memento. The characters used by both manipulation and subterfuge are intensive. In this sense, both remind me somewhat "In the company of men", also highly commendable. One difference between Nolan's two films is that Memento was a little easier to follow, as black-and-white scenes progress in a consistent chronological direction, as do the color ones. I do not think that this is true of the sequel, where scenes seemed to be shown at random. If you have a choice between a VCR and a DVD, I strongly recommend that you choose DVD, as this allows you to watch the movie a second time in chronological order, not just in the scrambled ) presented by Nolan. It is also easier, during a second viewing, to prepare the order for yourself, if you wish. <br /> <br /> As another viewer noted, one of the best things about this movie and this remembrance is that none of the actors was famous. They were characters, not known actors, who had brought characters developed in other films. <br /> <br /> Given some similarities in the storylines, I wonder if Memento is somehow a remake of the sequel, but intended to reach a wider public, as Edward Burns created She's the One in the mold of - and with about the same distribution as - The Brothers McMullan.
