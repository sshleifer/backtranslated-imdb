I really enjoyed "Random Hearts". It was shocking to see such a low rating on IMDB, but everyone has a taste of gout and all that. I'm a big fan of Harrison Ford, but I must admit that he was badly chosen in this movie, and the reason I gave him 9 instead of 10. Kristin Scott Thomas, however, was just fantastic . She was credible and beautiful, despite having been made up for half of the film, as if she had been crying for days. "Random Hearts" could it have been better? Of course, but it's definitely worth seeing.
