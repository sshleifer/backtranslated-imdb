This film is broadcast sporadically on the cable, and I've never really watched it, thinking it would look like Bruce Willis' "In America" ​​movie, with the mundane history of American freedom, and so on. But that was not the case; it was so much more! <br /> <br /> Of course, Martin Sheen is excellent; (I've never seen it in a movie I did not like, even though the screenplay is bad because it has so much talent). Kathy Bates is the domineering mother and does a great job. The real surprise is Emilio Estevez, who has not always been one of the greatest films, but who also directed this film. Please do not stereotype the movie "Breakfast Club"; he is so much better in this field and I hope he makes more atypical, non-commercial Hollywood movies. <br /> <br /> The film is realistic, as we see Emilio returning from Vietnam during Thanksgiving. Kimberly Williams is passable as a sister, who feels "disgraced and embarrassed" by the returning soldier, his brother; he is very alienated from the family and, especially at this time in the history of the United States, this story is VERY relevant. <br /> <br /> I have learned a lot about post-traumatic stress and you will really understand how you feel. character; This is not a violent journalistic portrait, like "Peloton" for example, it's more a study of character, which leaves us even more intrigued and preoccupied by the effects of war, especially if we take into account consideration the young age of the soldiers victims. With the violence of today, it is rare that a film really causes sadness and throws a tear; it does and deserves to be recognized.
