My choir Santa Lucia was chosen to be part of this film. Every 100 plus. When the time came to shoot the film, I was asked to choose only ten. Oh my God. We had a little girl who went early to get her tonsils because she wanted to be in the movie. Choices were hard to make. The people of Georgetown are as charming as the ones they show in the movie. Graceful, kind, believers. The city sponsors a Christmas market every year on the first two weekends of December. I was there this year and it was wonderful. The city is charming and people work hard to make it magical. The city appears today as when making the film. Much of the credit goes to the historical society that works hard to maintain the historical value. The Colorado State Governor awarded an award to the school principal who was transformed into a charter school.
