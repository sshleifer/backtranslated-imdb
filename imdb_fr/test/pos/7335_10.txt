Wow, what can I say it was a good movie, very different from all the boring remakes we see recently, the only thing I would have liked to see ended a bit more, like when Jane left her husband, I suppose she would go to Serena because she fell in love with her, not just her, but of all she is, I want the producers to show this sort of end instead of letting your imagination end, I really hate when they do it. The air numbers looked funny, but I guess you'd have to be light and muscular. I would like to see more movies like this one. Maybe they could make some sort of sequel to Jane and Serena.If I was in Jane's place would have gone for the girl so she was attractive.
