Bon Voyage is fun for the public because it combines the foolishness of a comedy with just enough sobriety for the viewer to be actively engaged and invested in the results. But above all, the film is historically instructive; it captures the tension of the so-called "fictitious war" and, later, the flight of Paris from the French aristocracy before the German attack. However, Bon voyage is not a "war movie". It's a comedy about the life of a handful of people in the context of extraordinary times. Bon voyage testifies to the chaos, confusion and emotional confusion of a nation on the brink of collapse and the wide range of French reactions to the new political order. This film is a comedy that entertains the audience, a romance that skillfully uses many clich√©s and the story of a handful of people whose nation collapses.
