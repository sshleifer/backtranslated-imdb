in his descriptions of CAA, Platinum cards in Hollywood, psychoanalysis, vacation to Provincetown that he never took, and free trips to Nicaragua, funded by Columbia Pictures. <br /> <br /> It sounds narcissistic, but Spalding Gray (possibly because of his unusual personality), the audience is trapped, makes fun of himself (maybe because he does not have taken the Hollywood thing seriously) and makes us worry about it. <br /> <br /> This monologue does not only concern "The fields of death" or "Swimming in Cambodia"; it's more of a pastiche of events, as he sees them. Some lines are classic, as when Gray meets talented agents esteemed at CAA. The conference table is ... "full of them, tanned, healthy, after drinking blue-green algae from an Oregon lake ... there are no drugs at Hollywood". <br /> <br /> It was before. the tragedy occurred. Many of us will miss his unbalanced humor. 9/10.
