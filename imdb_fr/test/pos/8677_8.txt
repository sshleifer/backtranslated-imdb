Imagine a world in which everyone gently treats anyone, no rude words are ever spoken, quarrels in the office are non-existent and your boss regularly invites the world of the office to dinner parties where you can discuss the latest design styles inside. Everything is neat, nice - good, simply. In other words: you are in hell. After being laid in the middle of nowhere, in his mid-thirties, Andreas (Trond Fausa Aurvaag) starts a new accounting job in a small, clean town. From the beginning, he feels alien in this impersonal world, properly superficial, superficial kindness, surrounded by a pleasant but lifeless interior architecture and colleagues. The food has no taste, the drinks do not get drunk, no children anywhere; After starting to integrate, Andreas looks for ways to escape the new, bland world. He does not know where he comes from, but always remembers his rich tastes, his true feelings - all that goes beyond the unadorned life he now leads. THE BOTHERSOME MAN echoes the ideas of Huxley and Kafka, but here the cruelty is the ubiquitous sharpness. Unlike PLEASANTVILLE, it is not a narrow bigotry, but rather a fable of our urban civilization of the free world. Above all, she recalls the ingenious FIGHT CLUB scene, in which Edward Norton walks through a fictitious IKEA catalog. Spiced with macabre humor, this Scandinavian laconic tale convinces at all levels: history, characters and relevance. A real gem of a screen. 8/10
