<br /> <br /> There is something about seeing a movie in a good old movie house that adds enormous appeal to each image. Fortunately, I had the opportunity to see at the Film Forum in New York a pair of comedies by Ernst Lubitsch during their three-week tribute to the legendary director. The double film I attended was a screening of Bluebeard's eighth wife in Lubitsch's 1938 comedy and the classic before the Code, Design for Living, which I had never seen before. Everything I read about Design for Living praised the movie, but I found no good reviews anywhere for Bluebeard's Eighth Wife. Leonard Maltin did not like that. VideoHound also gave a low rating to the comedy. His IMDB score was not free. And Pauline Kael (not a big surprise) criticized the movie in his scathing comment. So when I went to the city that day, I was expecting to appreciate Bluebeard's eighth wife slightly and completely love Design for Living. Bluebeard's eighth wife (who first showed up) started, while the eccentrics that populate the cinema took their place and the music of the thirties calmed down. `Adolph Zukor presents Claudette Colbert and Gary Cooper in Bluebeard's eighth wife Ernst Lubitsch ', reads on the title card. Then the picture started with a hilarious scene: Cooper wants to buy a pair of pajama tops, but he does not want any of the stockings! He argues with the clerk, who asks for the help of his superiors, and their dispute does not seem to have an end. Enter Claudette Colbert, one of the most beautiful, charming and talented film personalities of the 30s. "I'll take the bottom," she gently interceded. And here you may have Screwball-type comedies more beautiful than ever. The film kept my interest perfectly. I laughed almost all the time. When Colbert discovers, just before a family portrait is taken, that his future husband was married seven times, the entire theater erupted in history. When she negotiates money immediately after overcoming her shock, the laughter (which has not stopped) is intensifying. And Edward Everett Horton has also benefited from some hilarious reactions to the screenplay. When Cooper took inspiration from Shakespeare's Mastering Shakespeare to discipline his wife by slapping her face, I could not control my laugh when she slapped him. And the drunken scene with green onions is one of Claudette Colbert's funniest comic scenes. The most comic moment of the film happened when Colbert pushed a boxer to "teach a lesson to her husband". In the pure style of the job, he stuns the bad man and puts his friend David Niven in an icy sleep. He wakes up when Cooper arrives. In order to conceal the situation, Colbert poses himself at Niven in a moment of strong sexuality: "Where did this man hit you? Right here? Right here? Right here?' and then BAM! knocked out again! The movie was wonderful, from start to finish, it was a perfect treat. I also loved Design for Living, although I daresay I think that for pure laughter and entertainment, Bluebeard's eighth wife was the best and most enjoyable movie. See a vintage movie on the big screen has charm. And in the presence of others who laugh, you feel more comfortable doing it yourself. Maybe that's why I felt the same about Bluebeard's eighth wife.
