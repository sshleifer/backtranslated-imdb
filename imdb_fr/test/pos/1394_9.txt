packed action, with my favorite type of creature.I will not give anything if you have not seen it, because it's worth taking the time to sit down and break into the mystery of things such as presented in this film.It is sometimes slow and these were the moments that my mind was wondering what makes it easy anyway, but wet, it left me quietly excited, where you kept it in your head instead of let it out, probably the atmosphere in which I was at the time.Special effects and action sequences that you might feel for the occasional lulls. Of course, there is a multitude of films exactly like this one, the film still has its own style and flavor, which I respect anyway underground independent horror movies.
