Jackass Number Two is without doubt the most hilarious film of 2006, beating the hilarious Clerks II. This is one of the best sequels of recent memory, beating Jackass The Movie in every way. Now, this film is perhaps the funniest, but it is also the most shocking, the most appalling and the most disgusting. You will feel sick many times throughout the movie. I'm really serious when I say do not eat anything before watching or during this movie, because chances are it will come back literally haunt you. Keep drinking at a minimum, too. You have been warned, because, as the slogan indicates, he will make you implore mercy. <br /> <br /> Jackass number two follows the madmen of the hit series Jackass, Johnny Knoxville, Bam Margera, Ryan Dunn, Steve-O, Chris 'Party Boy' Pontius, Preston Lacy, Ehren McGhehey, Dave England Brandon DiCamillo and Jason 'Wee Man' Acuna (Chris 'Raab himself' Raab is absent) as they play the most outrageous life - menacing and revolting stunts imaginable. I'm not going to say what the stunts are, but I'll warn you that any scene with an animal will be disgusting or psychologically scary, and that one of the cast members (again, say nothing) will flirt several times with death in the fire. movie. <br /> <br /> What makes Jackass Number Two so entertaining is not the stunts themselves, but the way the cast responds to them and their realization. To put it simply, if they liked to do it and have fun, you will do it too (that's 99% of the stunts). All the stunts are very original and 90% of them are unpublished. You will witness some recycled, but they are amplified. You would not think that you are actually directing factors in a film like this, but it is; The management of Jeff Tremaine makes the film so much funereal because it guides the gang in their comic timing, which is just great on their part. He could have simply sat and slept during the filming (in fact, you'll see in the film that he slept after filming some filming), but he went there and helped those crazy guys to make the waterfall as well. funny as possible. I give Mr. Tremaine two thumbs up for that. Another great thing about Jackass is his profusion of celebrity cameos, which this time include BMX legend Mat Hoffman, skateboarding god Tony Hawk, director / actor Jay Chandrasekhar (Super Troopers & Beerfest), actor Luke Wilson and actor Jason Dolphins director / actor Mike Judge (Office Space). The scenes with Hoffman, Taylor and Chandrasekhar are some of the funniest in the film, as it is even more funny to see these men in the movie. <br /> <br /> Jackass number two is one of the most politically incorrect. , morally degrading, and just fake movies of all time, if not the most. Despite this, he is so original and so funny that you will not worry anymore. You will be out of breath laughing so hard that you will cry and jumping from your seat laughing throughout the movie. Due to the explicit and potentially disturbing graphic content of this film, no one under the age of 18 should watch this movie. You have been warned. I hope you enjoy Jackass Number Two as much as I do. <br /> <br /> 10/10 --spy
