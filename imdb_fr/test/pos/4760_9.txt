He plays straight but with a soft intensity that makes him one of the best cops in the history of cinema. Roy Scheider plays in the French Connection of a poor man who has a bit of the same appeal. FC is a better film, but I prefer to watch this one because 1) I think Scheider is awesome and it's his best movie, and 2) he has the best car chase ever, which makes Bullitt look like a cable production (thanks Bill Hickman, who plays the pilot). It does not hurt that Tony LoBianco goes (still) make a bad guy. Have fun.
