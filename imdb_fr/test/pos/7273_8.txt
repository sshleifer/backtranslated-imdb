** HERE IS SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> Recap: Macleane (Miller) witnesses a robbery committed by Plunkett (Carlyle) that goes wrong. Plunkett's partner gets shot (and killed), but not before swallowing a good ruby. Plunkett and Macleane then meet at the cemetery when both try to get the ruby. Unfortunately, they are arrested as tomb robbers and sent to prison, but not until Plunkett swallowed the ruby. The ruby ​​is the key to freedom and, once released, they form a partnership in the flight. Macleane must pretend to be a gentleman and find out who is worth stealing. Then they steal it (and steal it with style). But Macleane falls in love with the niece / daughter (?) Of their first victim, Rebecca Gibson (Tyler). And Mr. Chance (Stott) is ready to catch them, and his methods are not very pleasant ... <br /> <br /> Comments: A good action seasoned comedy and adventure. Carlyle and Miller are a good team, with lots of friction and friendship. And then there's the relationship between Macleane and Rebecca Gibson. The scene with the ball is very good, especially the use (anachronistic) of the music. In addition to these interesting characters, Cumming plays the best of all, Lord Rochester. The character and the game are both stellar and among the best of the film. In total, the film works very well, a nice balance between history and special effects, action and comedy. Very entertaining. <br /> <br /> 8/10
