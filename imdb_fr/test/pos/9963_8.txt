Venice, in 1596. The Jews are separated from the good Christians. Basanio, a young but poor Venetian, loves the beautiful Portia, a rich heiress. Propose Portia. All of Antonio's ships and merchandise are occupied at sea, so he turns to the Shylock lender, the Jewish lender. no interest, but if he will not pay the money at that time, he will own a pound of his flesh.Also, Shylock's daughter, Jessica, goes away with Christian Lorenzo. The Venice merchant is based on the play of William Shakespeare that was written between 1596 and 1598. I read the play last summer and now I saw the film, directed in 2004 by Michael Radford. I loved the piece and I do not quite agree with the accusations that he would be anti-Semitic. The Jewish character does not appear as an inhuman monster, even if He is ready to cut a piece of flesh from Antonio. His character has a lot of depth, which comes out in his speech: "If you prick us, do not we bleed?" There is much more human in the character of Shylock than in that of Antonio who spits on the good Jew.Al Pacino is unbeatable like Shylock.Il gives such a strong performance.Jeremy Irons is as formidable as Antonio.Lynn Collins is very handsome and awesome in the role of Portia.Zuleikha Robinson does a great job as Jessica, and Charlie Cox as Lorenzo is also very good.Kris Marshall plays Gratiano, and he does a good job.In the role from Nerissa, we see Heather Goldenhersh. Mackenzie Crook plays Launcelot Gobbo. As in Shakespeare, it contains the most brilliant dialogue. The film paints a fantastic picture of the time. It deals with great problems, in a shakespeare way.
