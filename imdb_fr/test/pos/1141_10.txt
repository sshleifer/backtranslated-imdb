I went to this movie without having any idea what to expect. In fact, I made an appointment in the movie theaters when it was released. We both enjoyed the experience and it was helpful to have someone to talk to after seeing it. <br /> <br /> I recommend to watch this movie only if you like unconventional movies. It's not as disjointed as Liquid Sky or as whimsical as the Forbidden Zone. The original plot is very easy to follow. There is a LOT of subtle humor. <br /> <br /> Here is a quick summary of the plot if you are completely lost: a big brother government is monitoring all members of society. Suddenly a new person appears and there is no data on him (he seems crazy). He may or may not be the second coming of Christ. The overly cautious government goes into a frenzy to find it and discover its true motives. The rule is also obsessed with immortality. <br /> <br /> Some scenes are frenetic while others are completely discrete. We follow the main character when he meets all kinds of people in society. <br /> <br /> I did not need to change my mind to enjoy the movie, but I know some of my friends felt it helped. <br /> Split was also filmed around Santa Cruz and San Francisco.
