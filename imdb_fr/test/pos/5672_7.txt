** SPOILERS ** Looking for a bit more excitement than seeing crocodiles fed in local game reserves, Grace and Pat, Diana Glenn and Maeve Dermody, and her boyfriend Adam, Andy Rodoreda, decide to make excursion upstream in the desolate Australian desert mangroves, deserted and inhabited. <br /> <br /> With their swamp guide, Jimmy, Ben Oxenbuld, at the helm of his motorized boat, the four find themselves upset by a giant saltwater crocodile that catches and drags Jimmy terrified to the bottom with him. Grace Pat and Adam find themselves stuck in a tree in the swamp, while Pat clings to life on the capsized boat. In the rest of the film, the crocodile, determined and hungry, plays a human and human game with the trio ending with a confrontation in a mud bank where Jimmy's body, dead and dismembered, finally fell to rest. . <br /> <br /> The director and the actors of the film take full advantage of the marsh, sometimes making it more frightening than the giant crocodile swimming there. We see the crocodile killer about half a dozen times in the movie, but everyone hits you, and Jimmy Grace Pat & Adam, in the bowels. <br /> <br /> Anyway, they have been held in suspense by the giant reptile still doing its damage from below, which is so unexpected that the attack crock has much more effect when you do not do not see then, as in the last ten minutes of the film, when you see them. You wonder from the outset who would survive the crocodile attacks and possibly live to talk about it. The end with the crocodile in the face of human confrontation was about the weakest and most unrealistic part of the film. <br /> <br /> The crocodile, which was both thin and efficient in previous scenes, seemed to have struck or swam, with neither the force nor the speed to grasp, with its deadly jaw, and to complete the only survivor of the expedition. In fact, the killer was so inefficient that even after stabbing his victim or victims, he simply could not hold them back. It ends up being fatal on his part. <br /> <br /> A bit like "Jaws", the movie "Black Water" has the crocodile killer, like the great white shark in "Jaws", more interested kills his human prey and then eats them. With all the food available in the marsh and the rivers he inhabited, the crocodile was only after the quartet, Grace Pat Adam & Jimmy, for having invaded his watery domain which he felt the great ruler. And for daring to do that, they had to pay with their lives!
