Neil LaBute takes a dramatic turn of his first two films, In The Company of Men & Your Friends and Neighbors, with this fun and original thriller / comedy / road movie. When Betty (Renee Zellwegger) attends the brutal murder of her scoundrel (Aaron Eckhart), she develops a strange kind of amnesia and runs away in her car, unaware that there are large quantities of drugs in the trunk. Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock are the big successes that follow. <br /> <br /> What Betty is pursuing, in addition to a fresh start (though she does not remember her past life anymore) is her beloved, Dr. David Ravell (Greg Kinnear). Only problem: Dr. David is not real, he is a soap opera series A Reason To Love and he is a selfish actor named George McCord. <br /> <br /> To know more about what is growing It would be too much, but the Betty nurse is certainly original. Like the assassins of Pulp Fiction, his hit-hits are both violent and philosophical. His performance is a great parody material, and his game is the best of all. It must be one of the best casting films of recent years. Renee Zellwegger is perfect for nurse Betty, with the constant gleam in her eyes that drives her on her quest. Morgan Freeman brings his constant state of grace to the role of a killer at the end of his career, and Chris Rock is his partner, a man of anger and great impatience. Greg Kinnear is his comedian as an actor / soap doctor. Actors such as Emmy winner Allison Janney (The West Wing), Harriet Sansom Harris (Bebe Glazer agent) of Frasier and Kathleen Wilhoite (Chloe on ER) also offer excellent performances. In fact, the cast is a Who's Who of the best TV actors. <br /> <br /> One-of-a-kind film, Nurse Betty is both funny and scary. scenario.
