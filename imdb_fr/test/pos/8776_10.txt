This film is a masterpiece of great actor and patriotic pride in America. The Nazi saboteurs of the 1940s are being replaced by the terrorists of the Middle East today. The intent is the same: terrorize, disrupt lives, destroy property and kill Americans! We see a Barry wrongly accused (Bob Cummings) on the lamm, trying to unravel the real Nazi terrorist plot, meeting the beautiful Pat (Priscilla Lane) and together they go to New York in pursuit of the devious sabotor Fry, played with expertise Norman Lloyd. Along the way, they meet the very sinister Otto Kruger playing the role of leader of the Nazi sabotage circle but disguised as a distinguished model citizen, where Barry in search of the saboteur Fry puts him in trust before handing him over to local law enforcement . He escapes, meets a blind gentleman and his niece, enters Priscilla Lane. From there, Barry and Pat go to the city of Soda City, in the west coast saboteurs gang, heading east. They hang out in the mansion of an improbable New York socialite. The situation becomes difficult when the villains kidnap Barry's Pat and he pursues her with indiscriminate abandon. The climax of the film is the famous scene of the Statue of Liberty which is extracted from many compilations. It's a real blue patriotic blue flag performance at its best and what's wrong with that! See this movie if you do not see another Hitchcock movie. You will be overwhelmed by the patriotic fury and love interest of Cummings and Lane will make you wish they were paired up in other movies. This is the ideal girl next door, often underestimated, his talent is reflected in this film. See and go to bless America!
