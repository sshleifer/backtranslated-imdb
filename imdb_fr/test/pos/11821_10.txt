I had seen The Cure when I was a child and I loved it then. Now, years later, I bought a copy almost by accident and looked at it again. As a child, you do not really have the ability to get what you want, it's usually a prerogative of your parents - but when I looked at it now, I felt sorry for not having do more to get a copy. of this film at the time, and therefore almost forgotten until today. <br /> <br /> It's really a beautiful film. It tells the story of the unlikely friendship between a hard-nosed kid - inspired by his horrible abusive mother - and his neighbor, a slightly younger boy with AIDS. <br /> <br /> Well, you say. Another of "those". A tearful. A bucket film. A tail of morality. Yes, I know, I hate them too. Only this one is not. It's one of the few films I've seen that pulls a very rare thing: it tells a really sad story (and yes, a story of morality) but without a single moment where we feel corny, forced or somehow. otherwise "hollywoody". This shows a real relationship between two real boys, who interact like real children do. And through this interaction, the loving and loving character of the older boy, Eric, begins to shine through his "tough guy" character, as he takes on some kind of fraternal care for Dexter, his younger and younger neighbor. HIV positive. . Together, they embark on an adventure to find a cure - which, for Erik, seems to be imminent - so that this silly story of AIDS disappears and they can be friends forever. <br /> <br /> The production is top. But, of course, what this movie really is, are the interpretations of the two main actors - Brad Renfro and Joseph Mazzello. Especially Mazzello, who is simply stunning, conveys the feeling of fragility that a sick boy needs, but at the same time manages to make Dexter a truly energetic and determined person. He shines on the stage where the boys are confronted with Pony: his desire to protect his older friend makes him move forward, pushes him to say what he says - and only after, the horror is depicted on his face, while he realizes that what he said himself is true: his blood is a poison ... Renfro also has his moments, especially the scenes with his mother: he describes perfectly how this macho kid on the street is completely frozen and numb in front of her violent and assaulting mother, and can not get a word to contradict her because she forbids her relationship with the sick boy out of fear and ignorance. Annabella Sciorra also gives a memorable performance as the mother of Dexter, who eventually becomes, in a sense, a maternal figure for Erik too. <br /> <br /> I saw this film for the first time when I was in school in America and loved it - not at all a given about movies like this. But the kids' behavior in this movie was so real that I could easily relate to them. Ironically, the teacher who showed us this movie (a wonderful woman, I'm still in touch with her) got in trouble because of this, because a stuck parent complained of seeing it unfold when the two boys were watching a Playboy. ... pathetic. Seriously, Americans will never overcome this ridiculous phobia, I do not know. There was a barely distinctive shot of a playboy cover in the movie and so it's not shown in schools ... what sadness. Children need to see this movie. It's more inspiring and informative than all the "official" specials after school together. <br /> <br /> Oh, and one more thing. I know I'm going astray, but nevertheless ... The score. It's good. I'm a musician so I know Dave Grusin from his records: he's a well-known jazz pianist and record producer. Until this film, I really did not know that he had also made scores, although later I checked that I had obviously seen several movies he had worked on. Really, a great job there. <br /> <br /> In total, a solid Ten. I would recommend this movie to anyone. And I will definitely see it with my younger siblings - they can watch a movie like this one among all the standard hysteria they usually see.
