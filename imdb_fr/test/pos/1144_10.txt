I saw this movie at school and I loved it. Based on a true story, it is an absolutely magnificent film masterpiece. Seriously, I did not find anything wrong with that. A definite advantage is the way it was filmed. Located in Morocco in 1904, the Wind and the Lion abounds with captivating images, such as the Great Raisuli on horseback in particular. The cinematography was irreproachable, the editing was impeccable, the costumes magnificent and the landscape breathtaking. And I have to mention Jerry Goldsmith's music, it was phenomenal. I used this phrase a lot recently, but Goldsmith is not my favorite film composer for nothing. His score is so catchy and exciting that it shows the true musical genius of this man and that this jewel of partition should be among the best scores of Goldsmith with Legend, Rambo: First Blood, Patton and The Secret of NIMH. <br /> <br /> The action is exhilarating and the scenario is intelligent and sophisticated. Management is treated with sensitivity too. The performances were also amazing. With Sean Connery, always an image of charisma and suavity, as magnificent as the Grand Raisuli, he dominates almost the entire painting alone. He is accompanied by Candice Bergen, cunning John Huston and captivating Brian Keith, in one of his most discrete performances. The story is quite precise, perhaps fragile in some areas, but with acting, music and graphics so good, I care more about the past. 10/10 Bethany Cox
