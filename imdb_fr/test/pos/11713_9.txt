In short, if you want to watch Burt Reynolds' best movies, this one has to be included. If you do not like Burt, you can still love it. If you love Burt, this can become one of your favorite movies of all time! Being from Atlanta, it strikes at home, but it's also nice to see a policeman / action / drama unfolding elsewhere than in New York City, Chicago, Miami or LA. The film is funny at times with good plot and good performance from a large distribution (each character is real and the bad guys are not one way, they are really well thought) A beautiful romance shifted in 2nd half time & she has some good old fashionable shootings and hand fights (no thanks CGI, REAL ACTION!) <br /> <br /> If Clint Eastwood had made his best impression of a Burt movie Reynolds with "Everyone but the bottom" Can "and then Burt responded with his best Clint movie with that, and it's great!
