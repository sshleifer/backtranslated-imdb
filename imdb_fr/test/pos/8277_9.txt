The CGI feature film has just been released this year, but while it will offer a lot of entertainment to kids, it's also aimed at Alvin's hardcore fanatics who grew up with the animated series 60 and 80, The Chipmunk Adventure. is probably the best animated film based on Alvin and the Chipmunks to date. <br /> <br /> For starters, the animation is as fantastic as ever, the characters' designs are as they should be in cartoons - unlike the motion picture itself, is just fun to watch. there are no celebrity voices, no effects generated by CGI, just pure 2D quality, hand drawn animation and fantastic colors - brilliant, bold and beautiful. The jokes and humor are typical of the chipmunk and the narration is perfect. In truth, the Chipmunk adventure is all that the live action movie should have been, but is not. Alvin, Simon and Theodore compete for hot air balloons with the Chipettes, Elenor, Jeanette and Britney. Along the way, children face all kinds of problems and dilemmas that they have to solve in their own way. And no chipmunk movie is complete without the strange renditions of classic rock and pop hymns. <br /> <br /> The Chipmunk Adventure is aimed at both children and adults - another advantage over the CGI movie, as it was in 2007. The version will win some new fans, the 1987 movie will appeal to fans from Chipmunk, young and older. Bagdarasian and Karman provide the voices of the trio of helium-like film. <br /> <br /> Overall, this film is a must for fans of cartoon shows, you will not be disappointed. If you have seen the live version, then you will feel that this movie is a much better effort in contrast. If you have not done so, you should go see it again, or even forget about Jason Lee's movie and, instead, stay with it.
