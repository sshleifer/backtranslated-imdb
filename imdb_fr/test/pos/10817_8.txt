I found this DVD in the library and, from the notes of the cover, I had the impression that it could be interesting: a black comedy taking place in 1940 in France, at the moment when the Germans are heading towards them. "alleys ??") But it does! It's a clever, original, suspenseful and funny movie. I do not remember seeing anything like that before ?? Foreign or American It is remarkable that the scriptwriter / director finds humor when we know that part of the result (the Germans will occupy France for four years) is remarkable. That he does so with such charm is part of the pleasure. What begins as a black comedy and down ends up having some serious moments ?? including a search for "heavy water" (which was part of the preliminary research for the atomic bomb) and a quick introduction of History 101 to the beginning of the collaborationist government of Vichy that will govern the south of France during a much of the German occupation. * But do not be fooled by this story: the film itself is funny, charming and romantic and moves at full speed. <br /> <br /> One of the best things about this is a combination of actors we've seen many times (Adjani and Depardieu) and others we've never heard of before. Along the way, Virginie Leydoyen and Grégori Derangère take turns. Both are impressive, but Mr. Derangère is particularly impressive. According to IMDb, he was in ten movies before this one ?? but he also won the César as "Most Promising Actor" for this role. He was apparently not very well known, even in France. It is a combination of leading actor and romantic comic ?? and it makes everything seem so easy. Can we remember Cary Grant in "Bringing Up Baby" and "Arsenic and Old Lace" ?? it is difficult to make comedy on film, because the risks are enormous that the actor can seem unfit. But Grant has succeeded, and this guy too. I think we will hear more about it in the future. <br /> <br /> To be sure, this movie will not please everyone ?? there is a bit of violence, although nothing is seen on TV every day. But if you're ready for something original, you may feel after seeing it that you've uncovered a cinematic gem. <br /> <br /> * The so-called "spoiler" of this comment.
