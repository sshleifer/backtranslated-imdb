The basic principle of Flatliners is quite simple. Many medical students are on the verge of death to know exactly what the brain does during treatment. It sounds like something that a bunch of bored students would make for a joke, but that forms the basis of some very scary sub-stores. In today's world, where Hollywood has to explore foreign markets to find a way to make a horror movie, Flatliners is one of those rare gems that shows Hollywood can do something different when it makes enough effort. <br /> <br /> Flatliners of many movies based on this premise that would be unveiled today is that it does not help to be condescending or arrogant. Flatliners recognizes that people go to the movies for entertainment and not to moralize. In this kind of supernatural thriller, the difference that this restraint makes is truly incredible. What is even more incredible is that Julia Roberts appears without being embarrassing or demonstrating that she can only play Julia Roberts. The theory of darkness, according to which performers perform their work with the smallest audience, is in force here. <br /> <br /> The subplots about what the characters found when they lost almost everything that makes them alive, and how it comes down to interfering in their present time are surprisingly good. The moments when William Baldwin's character discovers that his collection of personal video tapes come back to haunt him are particularly intriguing. That William Baldwin seems so perfectly interpreted in the role says a lot about the script or direction. I do not know which one. <br /> <br /> Kiefer Sutherland, on the other hand, really shines in the lead. You really feel for him the mystery of what past experience invades in the present and why is revealed. As Kevin Bacon's character goes off in search of an old school wharf that he made his life and tells him how sorry he is, the film becomes clearer. We can try to change the past as much as we want, but that's what we do with the present that matters most. <br /> <br /> Another positive aspect of Flatliners is the way it creates an atmosphere without using expensive, elaborate visual effects. Quite unusually for what is essentially a horror movie, Flatliners did not spend its budget in places where it did not need it. Much of what we see during the most surrealist sequences is a case of professional pretense, simple trick photography or footage. Sometimes the simplest things are the best. <br /> <br /> If there is a problem with the film, it is that it seems too short about ten minutes. The end seems more superficial than conclusive, as if someone from the studio asked the director to finish the film so he could be released at a certain time from the market. Of course, many movies have left painful traces for this very reason, so Flatliners should not really need to be different. The one hundred and fifteen minutes we have are very satisfying, but not too bright. <br /> <br /> I gave it to Flatliners seven. It works well as a date film or some sort of late-night popcorn movie. That said, it's a reminder that low-budget horror series were not always sad waste.
