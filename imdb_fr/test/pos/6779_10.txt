The game was created in 1996, but is still good today. the graphics are not so hot and the actors are not worthy of an Oscar, but the plot is distorted, diabolical and very pleasant. The dark story is compelling since the first film and continues throughout the play. We played several people together for several reasons: 1) use all our minds together. 2) not to be so scared. <br /> <br /> Play this game and you will not regret it, do not try to find an earthquake engine inside.
