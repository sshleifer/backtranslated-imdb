Kon Ichikawa had lived through the Second World War and saw the effects it had on his people in Japan. But the novelist Shohei Ooka, whose book was the inspiration for Ichikawa's film, Fires on the Plain. It's a movie about men in this war, or maybe more universally in wars in general, who are losing their humanity. The soldiers crossing these fields and the jungle of the Philippians in this story are almost totally hopeless, if not already so. Stone's platoon looks like a picnic: at least they had some things, like food, after all. <br /> <br /> They have little or no reserves or supplies or ammunition, no reserve, no sense of anything go their way in this fight in which they were pushed. They can not even get proper hospital care unless they can not walk at all or lose a limb (for example, if you have TB, you're on your way). But it is really through the prism of a soldier, a soldier Tamura, that we are fully aware of the futility of war, both in its sinister scenes of nothingness, boredom and decadence, and in these flashes of intense and brutal violence. > <br /> In the film, Tamura only wants to be treated. This is right at the beginning, and his senior officer tells him - he already has staring eyes and an expression that has been exhausted by years of battle - that he will die if he does not find a hospital. In fact, he does not have any, but he ends up ending up with soldiers: at the beginning, with a platoon that seems to be acting well, but is really driven by a power-hungry brute who just wants the Tamura Reserve, and then with two other wandering soldiers from a group that had been ambushed while crossing a road at night. <br /> <br /> The story is not entirely straight, but it is not necessary. be. The path of Tamura in Fires on the Plain is told in the form of vignettes, little stories like when he comes across an apparently deserted enemy village. Two people from the population come back for food and Tamura sneaks up to meet them. It's an atrocious scene, because until now with Tamura, we've never seen it do anything bad * badly, but it does in this scene, not so badly, but by fear and despair (It's also, without spoiling, how he gets a hiding place of salt). Small scenes are built with so much brilliance and devastation that a simple task: find a pair of shoes to walk, which seems not to have. Or when Tamura, later in the film, discovers that her teeth are tearing apart and crumbling from total lack of hygiene. It's a lot for food, it's good. <br /> <br /> It should also be mentioned that it is a film of Ichikawa, obsessively shot in a black-and-white view of the fields and woods, the cinematography filling everything we see in black-black and warm white. Ichikawa also makes sure to get from his actors all that is authentic, not only with emotion, but with their own emaciated air and their appearance of despair on their surface. It's as if Ichikawa were both to survive the film as well as characters surviving in the wild; By wild, by the way, I mean also cannibalism. The shock of this is twofold; The first is how a soldier says to half-joke to eat other soldiers at Tamaura, who asks him if it's true and who responds only by receiving a warning "do not ask", and the second with a representation of cannibalism itself, the hungry fool on the hill that pulls the guts from his lap and says with an impassive face to our hero that "you can eat me when I die." <br /> <br /> This makes it especially brutal when it comes to filming the short film "action scenes". These are, in my opinion, more brutal than "Private Ryan" in their description of combat violence, completely random carnage. One scene that I would like to point out, and which contains just one plan that is unbearable to watch, is the one where, when a wide angle presents itself, we see a group of twenty soldiers marching slowly, a shower of gunfire escapes and kills only four or five people. it happens so fast, and the soldiers continue to walk at the same speed. This is not the only horror of carnage that is shown - when you have to be bloody, but splashed on the screen like some kind of complete macabre - but that says a lot. <br /> <br /> the acting game is stunning (Funakoshi in particular, which seems to be both the most peaceful and the most horrified by what he sees most subtly in most cases), all the major sets bring something else to this horrible experience, and all of this comes down to the ultimate question of an anti-war film: how can or why do people fight in wars like this? It's almost too depressing to be put into words, and Ichikawa plunges our noses into mud, dirt and blood, and asks us to understand it. Maybe one day it will never happen again. Or we can hope that, at the end of a film as dark and as awesome as this one.
