Great artists, have always suffered when they were young. I could mention Mozart and Beethoven, but that's not the point. <br /> <br /> This film was directed by HG Clouzot, whose family wanted him to practice in the professions of law. <br /> <br /> His main star is Louis Jouvet, who studied and practiced as a pharmacist before becoming "The greatest actor" and also director of French theater before and after the Second World War. <br /> <br /> They both had health problems. Clouzot had tuberculosis in his youth, Jouvet had heart problems and died at the theater. <br /> <br /> Such events shape the character of men (and women, of course). One could even say that today's artists are so poor, because they have never suffered and fought for their lives. <br /> <br /> For me, it's the biggest film of Clouzot. "The salary of fear" is greater in the "suspense", "Diabolical" also has more "suspense" and a better plot and more concerns the "female evil". <br /> <br /> The Quai des Orf√®vres is more human. Clouzot was falsely accused by De Gaulle's entourage (mainly Communists and Jews) of collaborating with the Nazis and forbidden to make films until De Gaulle left the French government in early 1946. De Gaulle was returned in 1958 as president. The main characters are all good souls: Jenny Love can play as a "whore" on stage, but she is not a "whore" (dictionaries make synonyms of these words, but they do not are not the same), love her husband, and refuse the slight "advance of her friend (supposedly lesbian) Dora, the photographer. <br /> <br /> Maurice the husband is jealous and shy, but flees the scene of the crime He is a coward because he fell in love with a woman and exchanged his love for a career that was ultimately more chic. <br /> <br /> Antoine, the detective (played by the great Louis Jouvet , acting actor, plays in this French song "Gray" not Black, as well as EG Robinson in "Double Indemnity") shows talent for pseudo-criminals, tenderness for a negro son (?) and a compassion for the the author of the crime, because he remembers that his father had cleaned the latrines of a noble's castle !! <br /> <br /> Clouzot was able to slap an actor's face to put him in the right frame of mind, but deep down inside he was very human. <br /> <br /> I have his horoscope in front of me. He had Venus in Sagittarius, which means open-mindedness, devotion, charity, and altruism. For those who do not believe in astrology, my sincerest apologies ...
