The net is an excellent film! This is Angela Bennett (in a superb performance by Sandra Bullock), an IT expert who works for Cathedral, cleans viruses and tests client games. Angela is a typical nerd who has no friends outside of cyberspace, takes almost no vacations and does not go out, and is almost always connected. One day, her friend Dale Hessman (Ray McKinnon) asks her to help by sending Angela a disc containing a strange program containing a lot of confidential information. The same night, while Dale was to meet her, he was suddenly killed in a plane crash. Going to Mexico on vacation, Angela meets a superb man named Jack Devlin (Jeremy Northam) who turns out to be a cold-blooded bastard. and one of the guys behind the whole secret of floppy. <br /> <br /> His life turns into a nightmare: all his files are erased and given the new identity of Ruth Marx, a woman with serious problems with the police. <br /> <br /> This film is great because it shows how much we, humans, rely heavily on computers and machines (sometimes more than we should) and our vulnerability, if some day one decided to control and change our personal archives, without giving us the opportunity to prove the mistake.
