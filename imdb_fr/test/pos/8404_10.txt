scarlett, two different movies, they have never been compared. The original gwtw actors are all dead and deserve their own reward and praise. I loved GWTW and did not really expect a suite. up to half of gwtw's praise but to my shock, scarlett was just as well written and directed and acted like gwtw scarlett full deserves just as much reward as i can honestly say i do not know what i like it better, I think the script for Scarlett was a perfect number 1 as a sequel. Bravo! writer director producer and all actors Bravo! The AS suites are rarely up to their name, but this one is equal to its predecessor. For those who do not like it, you miss the goal and a beautiful ending for a phenomenal start
