The 1970s were marked by a rise and fall of what we now call "Blacksploitation Films". The term is a reference to a kind of wide catch-all, rather than a true genre of the film. In short, all western and urban comedies, dramas, adventures, cops and bandits are built and constructed to appeal to the large urban black urban population of the mid-twentieth century. This could indeed encompass the widest type of film, provided that the black population of the city center is inclined. <br /> <br /> It seems that the idea of ​​producing films that are of particular interest to black Americans has its genesis with the release of Easter 100 RIFLES (Marvin Schwartz Prod 20th Century-Fox, 1969). Jim Brown, a former American footballer at Syracuse University and a half-time pro champion for the Cleveland Browns, had a Billing Co-Starring. After appearing in many films, such as RIO CONCHOS (1964), THE DIRTY DOZEN (1967), (ICE STTION ZEBRA (1968) * and others, he began to give more meaning to "Studio Costumes". "That Jim was a property in vogue. <br /> <br /> Now, this 100 RIFLES brings a record number of black customers in the big city business districts on Easter Sunday to see Mr. Brown. start to film more These epics of adventure and other types of movies with more black players and stars? Why not, indeed. ** So we witnessed a succession of police and thieves, movies Private detective, comedies, comedies, along the road, we finally got more attractive, family-oriented films, with SOUNDER (1972), THE TAKE (1974), CONRACK (1974) and, finally, CLAUDINE (1974). <br /> <br /> In CLAUDINE, we do not find any stigmatization or This classification is easy as "Blackploitation", because the story is universal and could easily have been made as a story about no offspring, anywhere, not just in the 1970s in the United States. <br /> <br /> The story was told of a SINGLE mother, Claudine (Dianne Carroll), who was struggling to keep a family together after ".... two marriages and two almost weddings.", is far Harlem Style shoot-em-up style. The problems that affect the ordinary citizens of our nation are confronted and examined under the sociological microscope. <br /> <br /> But we also consider Claudine's psychological and physical needs as a woman. For "The woman needs the man and the man must have his master", *** and we concede this point. (This is the SEX we are talking about, Schultz!) Claudine meets a very masculine, broad-shouldered and athletic guy in Private Scavanger Garbage Man, Ruppert B. Marshall (James Earl Jones), and they go to an appointment . <BR /> <br /> The big welfare state intervenes with the couple while Miss Tayback (Elisa Loti), social worker of Claudine, comes to search to see who is this Male without ties, which gives suddenly so much attention to the Claudine's family. <br /> <br /> After a humiliating audit and "deduction" of the Social Welfare Office, which would be the norm for the family, both decide to marry with or without the blessing of Big Brother. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Claudine's eldest son was involved in a very active but not very active black activist group. But with the help of Ruppert, he passes all together through him. A.O.K. <br /> <br /> It ends on a happy, optimistic and hopeful note. We know it may not be exactly "... luckily, always after!", But we'll do it all together! If there is one criticism that we must assert is that sometimes, in a film like this, a misconception spreads to a large part of Urban Blacks. And that is to say the apparent myth that all whites are rich, never needing a hand, having no work, having no disability. <br /> <br /> Well, folks, that's just not true! NOTE: * At one point, Jim Brown's career was a real success as a robust player. He was even tense like "... The Black John Wayne." NOTE: ** The idea of ​​producing films with entirely black films, shot for black consumption, was not a new idea. In the 20s, 30s and 40s, we attended productions of characters like Noble Johnson, Spencer Williams, Jr. and Rex Ingram. <br /> <br /> NOTE: *** It's "Over time", you know, Schultz, he's from CASABLANCA (Warner Brothers, 1942).
