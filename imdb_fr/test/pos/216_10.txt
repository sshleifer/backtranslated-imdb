Leslie Nielsen - who had just started acting * - is inspired by Frank Drebin, an incompetent but heroic man, who must always resolve an absurd case. Like "Plane!" and the movies based on the series, the humor is based on gags and stupid comments to the Mel Brooks (including the remarks "yes, that's all"), as well as the fact that Nielsen remains very serious despite the absurdities that surround it. And of course, the final frame, in which something keeps moving. <br /> <br /> It's a shame that the series had only six episodes. At least that has spawned the movies. You can not go wrong with Leslie Nielsen in this kind of role. I suspect they all had fun filming it. Really funny. <br /> <br /> * Before "Airplane!", Leslie Nielsen had starred in movies like "Forbidden Planet", "Harlow" and "The Poseidon Adventure". In 1987, he played in "Nuts" alongside Barbra Streisand and Richard Dreyfuss. But since the first movie "Naked Gun", everything is still comic.
