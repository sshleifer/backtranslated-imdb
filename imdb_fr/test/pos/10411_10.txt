One of the reasons they call the 80s, "The Awesome 80's" is a quality television. Series like Wonder Years, War of the Worlds, V, Amazing Stories, and many others have always left the impression to each of our "lucky" to find a way to wake up. To top it off, here is Monsters! A unique series and a theme entirely dedicated to - monsters. Be it good, bad and morbid. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of classical shows or if you have the fascination of horror movies, then this one is for you. Provided you can find this rare gem. <br /> <br /> Even the most recent generations will be amazed by this episode by its gravity, its indiscriminate use of the effects of gore or its narrative that tells power and simplicity. I guarantee you, because I am 23 years old. <br /> <br /> Do not miss this opportunity! <br /> <br /> Although it is a seemingly forgotten show of the modern world, it will always be with those who can always remember ...
