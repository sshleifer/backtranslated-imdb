I was perhaps in a good mood when I watched this movie. but, for some reason, I really liked this movie. Was it terribly original? No, was it a little predictable? Yes. So what? It was always a very good movie. I always liked Bruce Willis (well, almost always, there was Hudson Hawk and The Fifth Element, after all), and he perfectly portrayed a selfish and sarcastic figure. Maybe this movie is not Oscar material, but it's really good. Go rent it.
