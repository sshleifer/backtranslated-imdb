I heard they were going to redo this French classic in 2007, and I see it is under development for 2011. It will be a shame, because Hollywood threw the screenwriter / director Jules Dassin because of the famous list black. They should not have the right to remake one of his films. <br /> <br /> I love the movies "capers" and "black film", which combines the best of both. <br /> <br /> Tony (Jean Servais) comes out after hurting himself and after beating his old girlfriend (Marie Sabouret), he plans a big score with his friends Mario (Robert Manuel) and Jo (Carl MÃ¶hner). Flick is the attention to detail in the planning of the flight. You see that reflected in the capers of George Clooney Vegas. Nothing is left to chance. <br /> <br /> The caper works very well but Grutter (Marcel Lupovici) sends his sons, Robert Hossein and Pierre Grasset after Tony and the gang. After blowing him up with Mario, they kidnap Jo's son. Many bullets fly before it is finished. <br /> <br /> A great film of a great director. The standard by which other caper films are measured.
