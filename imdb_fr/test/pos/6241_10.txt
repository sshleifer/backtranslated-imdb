This is one of my favorite horror movies of all time and I used to think he had never really had his due. That's until I read the rave reviews here. It seems that many feel the same as when I saw it for the first time. <br /> <br /> It's a terrifying movie, and I've spent most of my life watching scary movies. I have always found dolls, models and that kind of damn creepy! Discover the dolls in "Beyond the Door" and of course the great "Trilogy of Terror". And what about the wonderful episode of Twilight Zone "Living Doll". Hell, the dolls are scary! And Tourist Trap has moments that will make your hair stand on the back of your neck. All helped by an excellent soundtrack that makes Connors' performance even more exciting. <br /> <br /> I remember seeing the trailer of this late-night TV movie and the "Wow, I have to see this!" It was memorable. And it's one of the only caravans that I remember seeing as a child that scared me. It took me years to see it, but it was a treat. <br /> <br /> Stephen King also mentions this film in his book "Danse Macabre" and strongly recommends it. Very good company. <br /> <br /> This film will always feature prominently on my list of must-haves. It is a solid addition to the genre of the time and deserves a place among the best of the 70's schlockers.
