A beautiful film about the arrival of the first silent cinema in China. SHADOW MAGIC skillfully combines a love story with the drama of cultural confrontation between ancient Chinese traditions and modern Western film culture. An amazing first film by Chinese director Ann Hu. If I understood Ms. Hu's comments at the Sundance Film Festival in 2000, this film was produced as an American film with co-funding from the Chinese government and was shot in China. SHADOW MAGIC reminds me of movies like IL POSTINO and CINEMA PARADISO - not necessarily in a theme or plot, but it has a similar feel.
