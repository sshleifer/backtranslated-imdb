I saw this film three times. Let's go back to the VCR in the 1980s, then back to Encor last night (February 11, 2010). Based on a true story that I remember making the news in the early 80s, I decided that I found it too disturbing to be able to watch it again. Yet it's hard to look away from a car accident. The most scary character is Joshua John Miller, who plays Keeanu Reeves' younger brother. <br /> <br /> (The story on which this movie is based can be found anywhere on the Internet - try it on Google - Anthony Jacques Broussard who murdered Marcy Conrad in Milpitas , California, 1981.) The characters portrayed Pre-Grunge Generation X, Limit Sociopaths, with the exception of Keeanu Reeves, who becomes aware of his conscience. <br /> <br /> The old hippies did a great job raising this generation. <br /> <br /> Young child, I thought Joshua Miller was excellent as a serial killer. In reality, he went to Yale and wrote scripts as well as realized. His acting abilities in this movie were incredible. The way he treats his little sister by drowning his doll and tearing the grave of his doll gives me chills. It gave me nightmares. Even with what is happening in our world today, in 2010, it's still the most degenerate film I've seen to date. <br /> <br /> The apathy and dysfunction of these families are enough to induce vomiting. This chilling murder almost makes Manson's murders pale in comparison. <br /> <br /> Crispon Glover is a little too caught up in the character. He found himself in front of David Lettermen to discuss his role and almost kicked the host in the head. Glover had to seek psychiatric help after portraying his character. <br /> <br /> In addition, fight against the great Dennis Hopper. You are one of the best!
