From the actor to the direction of Cardone, this new version of the ghost's well-known ghost theme will keep you stuck to your seat. Slowly sometimes because it creates this tension "what will happen". Middle good on gore but what is nicely nasty. Spoiler: The death of the jock hole and the ensuing feast are a highlight for gore hunting dogs. <br /> <br /> Writers have written an old story but added twists and reinvented you. Cardone gives him life. . . uh. uh death. <br /> <br /> Lori Heuring, scout Taylor-Compton and the always fabulous Ben Cross are real, no sign of acting here. Everyone in the cast is engaged and is really not what any director aspires. The actors believe, we believe. <br /> <br /> Parallel to the traditional ghost story, the film is full of atmosphere, from the mine, the Hank House and the Tunny House. Frames at the last minute. <br /> <br /> Horror lovers, do yourself a favor and enjoy what makes it one of the true horror movies that exists today. <br /> <br /> I end with a big congratulations to Boaz Davidson (story) Ben Nedivi (screenplay) for no inventive writers, Hollywood would be nothing but an ugly reality TV party.
