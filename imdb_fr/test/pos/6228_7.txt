A group of friends collapses in the middle of nowhere (one of them has a puncture, the jeep on the other does not start mysteriously). One of them takes the tire to a dilapidated service station and this is the last time anyone sees it. When the four remaining members leave in search of their friend, they meet the kind Mr. Slaussen who offers to help him repair the jeep and offers cool drinks and a heat shelter in his house also in ruins, similar to a hermit, who is busy. by very realistic mannequins. He leaves with the guy from the group to work on the car and leaves the 3 girls in the house. Before leaving, he warned them not to leave and to get home behind his hut; he warns them about "Davy", his prowling brother who is not there. Of course, one of them decides to venture out looking for a phone that works and will never be seen again. Is it Slaussen? Is it Davy? The models ?? Tourist Trap has the usual horror requirements (jiggly big boobed girl, goody two shoes girl, curiosity taking the best of people and never working!), But it stands out from the rest of the genre of the 70s in its turn of an end. I started having pity on Slaussen (Chuck Conners is a fantastic, scary and disproportionate performance) at some point in the movie, and you almost see Molly's character doing the same. This is a jewel if you can find it; I had taped it with a cable when I was younger, and browsing a used video store, I spotted a VHS copy that was totally overpriced, but was worth it. Tanya Roberts fans will not be disappointed either. The best part of the movie for me was the scene with the soup (and the crackers !!) <br /> <br /> I gave it a 7 because part of the film was and still is difficult to explain.
