I loved this film. Mark Blankfield was perfect for this role. The more classic sci-fi / horror movies should be redone at this level of comedy, which is at the top of the line in my opinion. A film without drink, you laugh so hard that you will spill everything. Can we wait longer? Let's hope so. I would like to suggest a lot of movies for this type of remake. Mel Brookes made some remakes of classic movies. He made very strong contributions. An image of Dorian Gray would be a good suggestion. I hope that a producer or director will be able to embark on this idea and bring us a new comedy on our screens. we need a good series of comedies to keep our level of laughter higher than ever. A good comedy FIX.
