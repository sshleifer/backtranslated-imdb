The Cure is a fantastic movie about a boy with AIDS. I cried about 4 times watching this movie and it's so sad. I can not promise everyone will cry while watching this, but it will make you want to do it. Very emotional and very sad, The Cure is a must-see movie. This shows the meaning of friendship and love and it is a very good movie. <br /> <br /> At first, I did not think it would be so good and I wondered why my mother was still crying while looking at him. But now, I know it's a beautiful film, original and close to real situations, unlike most other films that make no sense. The words can not describe the greatness of The Cure, you just have to see it.
