I saw this film for the first time when it was released in 1980. According to other sources, I learned that the only broadcast of the 219-minute sequence was in New York, after which it was reduced at 149 minutes. So, I guess I first saw the shortest version that, at the time, was in my opinion a very interesting anti-Western, if a little confusing ... <br /> <br /> C So it was even more interesting that I finally got a DVD of the full version. I'm happy to have done so, because this second screening confirmed for me that the film is a real classic and that the critical criticism that provokes Michael Cimino was unjustified, to say the least. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's a long film, but many others too. For example: Once upon a time in America (1984) at 227 minutes; Cleopatra (1963) at 320 minutes; The Ten Commandments (1956) at 220 minutes; Spartacus {restored version} (1960) at 198 minutes; Party with the wind (1939) to 222 minutes and others. So it can not be running for a long time that has lathered so much foam when Heaven's Gate came on the scene. <br /> <br /> But note this: all of the above movies all reinforce myths about history and heroes. <br /> <br /> Not so heavenly: in this story, the American West is presented in all its harshness, injustice and poverty. And this is probably the first reason why so many people do not like this film: he describes the 1892 war in Johnson County, Wyoming, and shows how the Wyoming Stock Growers Association hired 50 assassins to hunt down and murder a large group of European immigrants with cattle thefts; and all with the assistance and complicity of the authorities, up to the President of the United States. For an essay on this war, with the history and what happened, there is a link on Wikipedia in the War Section of Johnson County. <br /> <br /> Very few people like to remember the really difficult times in their country's history, which go against what the country is supposed to be. If it had been a documentary, it would have been hardly acceptable for most; as entertainment, it was almost doomed to commercial failure and destruction by the highs and infamous. <br /> <br /> Leaving aside the socio-political diatribe that Cimino has launched here, what about the story? the story of the three main characters? Well, it was probably not unusual for men of that era to fall in love with a local prostitute, just as it is probably not unusual now. It's a pretty classic love triangle in which Ella has to choose between the two men and finally decides to choose the youngest man, Nathan, who, although not content to resort to cold-blooded murder when it suits, shows more wit and commitment than the old James (or Jim, as most people say in the movie). For some, this part of the story is filming too slowly, perhaps; However, in the broader context of the war, it is, I think, entirely appropriate. <br /> <br /> And this war is depicted graphically, viciously and cruelly with scenes of carnage extraordinarily staged and mounted flawless ?? although during the last massacre between the association and the immigrants, I am certain that some scenes of carts breaking up are repeated. A minor point and maybe caused when the cut of 219 minutes was reestablished? Anyway, it hits you in the face with the noise, the dust, the chaos and the confusion of the war ... <br /> <br /> Which brings me to another criticism from the others: the noise and dust is such that it is often difficult to hear the dialogue and even to see clearly what is happening. I'll admit I found it a bit boring at first, even going back to replaying parts to try to catch the picture or the words ?? until I realized that it was really not necessary if you accepted the director's intention: life is chaotic, it is difficult to hear and see in overcrowded situations and, in times of war, is the sine qua non of this staging. In short, it's as if you were really present in and in the scenes ... <br /> <br /> And what about the title? From Shakespeare, it refers to a figurative proximity of God and so, if you liken God to the natural world, the beautiful landscape that permeates the film ?? and it is amazing, strangely equal to that of Dr. Zhivago of David Lean (1965) ?? is a useful metaphor. I tend to think, though, that Cimino had something more to say, namely the idea that brave immigrants ?? the divine salt of the earth ?? have been denied entry to heaven on earth and the freedom to build a life in the country that wants to be the champion of freedom. <br /> <br /> Was it Cimino's intention? to empty the myth of the American West? To show how, in America, only the rich get rich while the poor are slaughtered, one way or another, in the course of history? Is this something new? Not really, as we all know. But what really hurts is to show that America was not and, implicitly, is not the country of the free and the home of the brave. Instead, after absorbing this story, we have the impression that the foundations of America have more to do with a country of dispossessed slaves and a home for rogues ...
