Just Before Dawn is one of those very good slashers that make you shiver every time you watch it! This film has a lot of suspense, an excellent interpretation, a camera work very well done (nice job, Mr. Lieberman!), Which makes it an extremely well done slasher! Although little gore for the 80s, it still has the effect after you. The killing (machete through the crotch) was so real! And the fist in my mouth death left me stunned! Overall, I give this classic lost 10 out of 10 stars! if you are looking for a gore party, do not look here. but if you want chills in the back, see this one. There are 6 dead and you do not see one of them, but it bothers you to think "how was she killed?" the failed theme reminded me of 1977, the Hills Have Eyes, which followed pretty much the same concept, but in the desert with canninbals. But, still fans of slasher, give this forgotten jewel, I promise you, you will be staisfied!
