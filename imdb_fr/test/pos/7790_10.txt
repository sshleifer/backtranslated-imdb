Well, to begin with, Rajkumar Santoshi is not a comedy director, and it's really unfortunate, because the only comedy film he has made is a masterpiece. This movie is really funny. Strong in pieces, exaggerated in a few scenes but still really laugh riots and characters r really full of fun The daughter of a billionaire comes to India to get married and two young men behind her, the story also has a special connotation with a Gangster. Amar plays the role of a clever guy in Amar Street played his role brilliantly and Salman has played the role of a stupid innocent to perfection.Raveena has done well, but Karshima is really irritating in some sequences. But the real thief of series r Paresh Rawal and Shakti Kapoor, they enter the frame and start to laugh automatically. Overall, such a nice movie that you can watch any no. many times without being bored.
