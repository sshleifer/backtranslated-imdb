The greatest period of cinema began in post-war Europe with the Italian neorealist movement. Over the next two or three decades, the French New Wavers caught the attention of everyone and there was always Bergman somewhere on his desolate Scandinavian island, producing bitter masterpieces. But in 1971, Luchino Visconti geographically geographically closed this form of art with his miraculous work * Death in Venice *, which could also be called * The death of European cinema *. After the late sixties, the great European filmmakers did the same, with a few exceptions, exhausted and passed the torch to a new American generation of Movie Brats (Coppola, Scorsese, & Co.). This film resembles a grand summary, not only of Visconti's particular obsessions, but of the general attempt of European filmmakers to realize the aesthetic ideal in films. And rest assured, you will not find a tougher task master than the Visconti revealed here. He does not play with the crowd, the people: either you follow him and you follow, or you find yourself behind. The pace is a challenge: slow, but never without emotional weight. "Incidents" are rare, but each of them seems charged with symbolic meaning in a cosmos of sturm-und-drang. <br /> <br /> We will probably never be in a company so rarefied, in terms of films: one of the great writers of the century that inspired the story (Thomas Mann), one of the greatest filmmakers the realist (Visconti), one of the greatest actors in the leading role (Dirk Bogarde), and who swells almost constantly in the background, that of Gustav Mahler 5th symphony. Taking full advantage of Mahler's ability to inspire romance even in the most cynical breast, Visconti transforms the main character, Aschenbach, into a decrepit composer of his original writer's character, even making Bogarde a LOOK like Mahler (mustache geek , hairy hair, duck-shaped walking). Bogarde, by the way, delivers what is probably the greatest performance of an actor in the history of cinema: it is a performance largely silent, and the actor must deliver tons of meaning in a gesture or a look - a Chaplin trick or simply acting like a bustling corpse. <br /> <br /> The cinema just does not get better than that. I will ignore the complaints of drug addicts to Ritalin who say it is too slow, but even the most legitimate criticism about some flashbacks of Aschenbach with his antagonistic friend is misplaced. Backtracking fits perfectly with the film's thematic concerns (ie what is the best path to aesthetic perfection: passion or discipline?), And the suddenness and strident nature of these interruptions serve to prevent the sleepiness of the spectators. (Of course, some viewers will sleep through this movie, anyway.) A continuous stream of Mahler and the beautiful endangered Venice would be nothing more than a beautiful picture; but this movie is actually about something. And it is above all suffering: the romantic suffering (capital R), in particular. As a suffering romantic, Visconti knew what he was talking about. <br /> <br /> [SPOILER. . . I guess] If it's nothing else, see * Death in Venice * for its opening credits. . . and for its unforgettable end, with the hair dye of a Bogarde jet black that fell from her dying, dying head on her whitish face. Meanwhile, in the distance, young Tadzio, object of the last desire of Bogarde, stands in the ocean and points to the horizon like a sculpture of Michelangelo. The climatic sequence summarizes with an atrocious economy all that is in question in the film: love, lust, beauty, loss, the end of a life against the beginning of another life and the cold death in the middle of a beauty hot and sunny. * Death in Venice * is a miraculous work of art. <br /> <br /> [DVD Tip: As with the Visconti * The Damned * masterpiece released simultaneously, I recommend that you turn on English subtitles while watching this movie. It's apparently in English, but the sound of the DVD seems muddy and there is still a lot of Italian spoken during the film.] <br /> <br />
