When HOPPITY goes to the city, he only finds bad news for his small insects near the Lowlands. Can this honest and good-natured grasshopper save his girlfriend, Miss Honey Bee, from the machinations of the evil C. Bagley Beetle - and also drive her friends to a new secure home - before it's too late? <br /> <br /> Although it is not one of the great animated films (an art quite new at the time of the creation of this film), HOPPITY is a nice film which should delight non-critical viewers. Technically, it is well done, with a generally high quality animation. The main drawback of the film is that none of the characters really have a "heart" - they are not "alive" on the screen as Jiminy Cricket had done a year earlier in PINOCCHIO. <br /> <br /> However, it's finally unfair to compare the release of Fleischer Studio to that of Disney. Max and Dave Fleischer had their own star to follow; their contribution - and that would be considerable - would be in the field of one-reel animation. With their POPEYE and BETTY BOOP series, they created alternative realities as viable as those produced by other comic studios. HOPPITY was their second experience in animating feature films (after GULLIVER'S TRAVELS in 1939), and they were now going to devote their energy to the short subject of the cartoon. In fact, the first of the highly acclaimed SUPERMAN series was already available. <br /> <br /> The story of HOPPITY owes a lot to Frank Capra, with his energy, go face powerful forces of society. Indeed, the original title of the film was MR. BUG GOES TO TOWN, which immediately evokes Gary Cooper or Jimmy Stewart and their capraesque adventures. <br /> <br /> Jack Mercer, famous for being Popeye's voice, is talking about two very different characters, the old Mr Bumble & Swat The Fly. The film's legends should surprise veteran voice actors Pinto Colvig and Mae Questel, both in uncredited roles. <br /> <br /> The film contains some nice songs provided by Hoagy Carmichael and Frank Loesser, of which `Be My Little Baby Bumble Bee 'is the most familiar. "We are the couple at the castle" is a beautiful romantic air that deserves to be rediscovered. <br /> <br /> It is unfortunate that the initial animation of the film, with its sweeping skyline and New York skyline past, is hidden behind the opening credits.
