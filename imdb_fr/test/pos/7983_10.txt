Batman Returns is more gothic and dark than its predecessor, and I like it a lot. In addition, the landscape is darker and the entire environment is saddening, as well as the chilling music composed by the talented Danny Elfman. <br /> <br /> However, I did not like the idea of ​​creating a monster Penguin, unlike comics, where he is human. Although he looks like a monster, he shows that he has a human dignity and I regretted it a lot when he saw the gravestones of his deceased parents. But it was still a dangerous bad guy and he had to be stopped. <br /> <br /> Michael Keaton made a "tour de force" with his return as a Dark Knight, and this time he is as powerful as in the original Batman. It's not difficult to understand why he is sometimes called Batman in public ... <br /> <br /> In addition, Michelle Pfeiffer is so sexy and good in her role, and she faithfully interpreted the role of the ugly / criminal dressed like a cat. Really, the actors did a masterful job with Batman Returns, which made it a successful movie. <br /> <br /> If you like Batman, look at his sequel, because it's really worth it for all the hard-core of the Dark Knight. lover. <br /> <br /> Steve Baillargeon
