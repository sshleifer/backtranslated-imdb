An excellent movie for those who simply need to go out and enjoy the beautiful Scottish landscape. Based on facts, the film takes you on a journey of love amid spectacular scenery. The actors are "disguised" for the roles they play, so no glamorous costumes or hair styled in this film where the acting is superb, realistic and down-to-earth. the time A time for those who have even the smallest drop of Scottish blood ..... because it will shoot the heart and stir the soul. Something that can be shared with the family and watched over and over again .................. a real classic, one that, I'm sure, will walk next to some of the big movies never die.
