Well, I just discovered IMDb from my twin sister, Carol. Carol and I played the "Fat Identical Twin" in Midnight Madness. We did not have to prepare much for the big party that came with us, and well and the rest was natural. ;) It was our first big film role and we had a blast doing it. We were 21 years old at the time and lived about an hour and a half from Disney Studio in Burbank and Hollywood, California. We grew up in front of the television and probably among the children of the first generation. Twenty years later, we still have a lot of fun and are always "heavy" or whatever is politically correct nowadays. We are no longer seeking action, but we know that we must "come back" when the opportunity arises. Carol is a chiropractor in our hometown of Southern California and I am in the information technology field in Georgia. <br /> <br /> I may be biased, but I thought the movie was cute, clean and fun. We knew it was neither a masterpiece nor an Oscar nominee. However, it was a film that the whole family can watch and have fun together. It's good not to have to worry if your young children can watch a video without having to move parts quickly. And nobody was more excited when it came out on video as Carol and I were. Carol found it at Kmart for $ 6.99! This is an inexpensive way to capture your memories and share them with others. <br /> <br /> Sincerely, Betsy Lynn and Carol Gwynn; Thompson's twins
