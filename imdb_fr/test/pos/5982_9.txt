A breathtaking account of the fate of two soldiers during the Second World War. This film tells the story of two soldiers with polarized morals, one surviving to Belarus, but the hardest natural elements. his own case, and the one who dies, after doing all that can be done with bullying and all that is possible to break his mind, is actually the ascendancy of the title. A film that should be seen by everyone, especially for the phenomenal performances of the main characters and the quivering sets (scenes of incarceration and hanging, in particular.
