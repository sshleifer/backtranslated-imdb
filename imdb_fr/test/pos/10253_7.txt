Coming in Chicago in the early '60s, this upcoming comedy drama follows a group of high school friends who navigate the ups and downs of their lives. The two main characters are Leroy "Preach" Jackson (Turman) and his best friend Richard "Cochise" Morris (Hilton-Jacobs.) Both boys have a promising future. Preach is a great writer but a lazy student and Cochise has just received a collegiate scholarship for basketball. When they do not hang out at local restaurants playing craps with their friends, spending time with friends, or chasing girls, they skip classes, take the train to Chicago, or go to parties at night. of the weekend. <Br /> <br /> Things go wrong when Preach and Cochise make the mistake of getting involved with two balaclavas and wander around in a stolen car. The police pursue them and they are arrested. But thanks to the efforts of a concerned teacher (Garrett Morris of SNL), they are released. But the two groups are not, and vow to take revenge on Preach and Cochise, thinking they blame them all. <br /> <br /> This film is very episodic, but it still works because that's what life is, a series of episodes. Funny, sad, romantic, weird. The movie never gets boring because all the characters are so well played and realistic, and the situations are believable and easy to relate. Like Preaching, chasing a beautiful girl in love, or a party that degenerates into violence when an asshole decides to fight, or takes care of a young brother too old. But even when a situation can not be told personally, such as those who claim to be undercover cops to shoot a bitch on money in order to get all their friends into a movie, the sequence remains hilarious. <br /> <br /> 'Cooley High' was the basis of the classic 70's sitcom 'What's Happenin!' which was broadcast on ABC from 1976 to 1979. Although the series is best known for the character Rerun, it is not part of this film and no character really looks like it. The humor of this show was very broad, but still funny. The humor of 'Cooley High' is more real than life, and therefore more entertaining. <br /> <br /> In addition, the soundtrack is beautiful. Classical songs from this period of Diana Ross & The Supremes, Temptations, Martha & the Vandellas and Smokey Robinson play throughout the film, adding to the fun, young and exuberant tone of the film.
