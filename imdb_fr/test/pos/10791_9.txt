Oliver Stone is not one to fear a movie or a theme for that matter. He is eager to confront people with their fears or to show them their ugly faces in the mirror. Look on his resume for proof! This film is no exception, on the contrary, it is another jewel that, unfortunately, few people have seen. <br /> <br /> You should be grateful for the controversial films. A film that should encourage you to think about yourself, the people next to you. The prejudices that exist and that each of us has in one form or another. Either we like to admit it or not, but it's easier to categorize people and to be like, "Ah he is 'xyz', yeah he must be like ...". Now I may be reading too much about it, but I do not think so. I think Oliver Stone is a very clever filmmaker and he was aiming for those things. And if it's something you want to explore (as a movie or in yourself), then watch this movie and get excited!
