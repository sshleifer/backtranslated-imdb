Having just borrowed the series 1 DVD collection from my somewhat obsessive brother, I was expecting to go through the first two episodes and return them. I just found myself screaming on the screen for ending the first season on a cliff - a week later and I watched the entire season. I have no idea where I found the time. <br /> <br /> This show is awesome. He does not take himself too seriously, he has nice characters that are well played and special effects (ignoring the strange sticky puppet here and there) are sufficiently "special" to give him this refined feeling. At first, I did not realize it was mostly shot here, and it seemed strange to hear so much Australian accents in a science fiction show - it was very entertaining for the main character ( John) to return to Sydney in the middle of the film. first season. <br /> <br /> I believe that the greatest strength of this show is the vision that the creators of the show obviously had. They have gradually introduced new aspects of the characters that explain the previous actions and continue to downplay John's conversations with slang in a fun and non-forced way. On top of that, after watching the Voyager and Next Gen series in their entirety, I do not see a lot of scams in the plot - so she managed to retain a sense of originality throughout the first season . I hope the rest is as good. <br /> <br /> Farscape is unlike any other science fiction that I have had time to live. I've heard that the fourth season was not as good as the first three and I'm now pretty annoyed to have it canceled before 5. I hope they relive this show - with the same actors in a movie or another series. It would be a shame to leave so many intrigues unfinished, while I suppose that with a show that provokes so much thought, dropping it without adequate warning would leave me feeling stolen. <br /> <br /> go now ... go back to my brother to bite the second season. <br /> <br /> V.
