He did one at Christmas to try to bring back a number one song, and now, the awesome Justin Lee Collins wanted to bring together cast members and maybe a team from one of his favorite TV shows when he was child, The A-Team. The only member he could not get was the late George Peppard who was playing the lead role, Colonel John "Hannibal" Smith, but he used some kind of medium to try to help him. He managed to get all the members together, including Dirk Benedict (Lt. Templeton "Faceman" Peck # 2) who went to Celebrity Big Brother in 2007, Dwight Schultz (Capt HM "Howling Mad" Murdock), Melinda Culea ( Amy Amanda Allen), William Lucking (Colonel Lynch) and Lance LeGault (Colonel Roderick Decker, the only member of the team to be dead). He did indeed speak to Mr. T (Sergeant Bosco "B.A." Baracus) during a scheduled interview, but he was not available to attend the meeting. It was really fun to watch him try to find them and talk to them, even if they probably did not want to, and the meeting, of course, is the big climax. Very well!
