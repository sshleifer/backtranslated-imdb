* MINI-SPOILERS * <br /> <br /> Need further evidence that Tsai Ming-liang is one of the most original and provocative filmmakers in the world? See this film. <br /> <br /> Based on slight variations of a theme from most of her work, THE HOLE represents a study of alienation and loneliness - in this case between a man and a woman next to up and down - and how the varied structures (real or psychological) of modernity separate men from each other. Here, the woman (the neighbor of the ground floor) tries to endure while his apartment is flooded by a prodigious leak of the upper floor. A plumber tries to locate the source of the problem, then disappears after creating a large hole in the ground. Already isolated and desperate (the two characters are among the few residents of a housing project who did not escape before a mysterious and almost apocalyptic epidemic). The hole that connects the two apartments first has a long succession of indignities, but begins to take on a significance with almost mythical proportions. <br /> <br /> Tsai's sense of humor and sense of cinematic history is displayed with a little more frankness than usual - the occasional daydreams of the woman turning around her neighbor's at the top are visualized as musical numbers (on the music of Grace Chang) that explode from the screen in brief touches of sensual and surrealistic romance and humor - quite reminiscent of the big screen PENNIES FROM HEAVEN. And despite all the boredom and alienation exposed here, Tsai's bias on the pre-millennial tensions of the late '90s is amusing, absurd and gives this film a very appealing finesse. The final scene is extraordinary. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Tsai typically subverts most of the usual expectations or preconceptions that Westerners bring to Asian cinema with a casual and casual frankness, focusing on both the trends absurd of the human spirit and the most absolute of worldliness. There is a complete and nonchalant demystification of almost anything about his characters, bypassing the background or most cultural signifiers (which amplifies the isolation of the characters), making THE TROLE - and his other films - rather confusing but always fascinating and insightful.
