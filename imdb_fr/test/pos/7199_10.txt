This film is the most intelligent comedy I have ever seen. Many jokes are either the parody of another movie (from star wars to dragon ball, rulers of power, kung fu, etc.), or something related to history. creates the elevator), many jokes are also related to the modern world and make fun of it because it was BC (Like the wheels of the spinning cart.) Other jokes are simply absurd but also hilarious (like the famous scene , where the dog runs after the Roman guy with the little music) In fact, in this film, they mix quite all sorts of humor. I have watched this movie 6 times and every time I look at it, I find other subtle jokes. (like the scene where waldo is part of the Egyptian crowd). This is the funniest film I have all appearances, finally a funny comedy, which includes neither the toilet nor the sexual humor. Numerobis is also what makes the film, everything that comes out of this mouth is hilarious. This film is almost perfect, except for some clichés, like the fact that Astérix recovers his power because he is kissed, it's stupid. But overall, it's a great movie !! 9.5 out of 10
