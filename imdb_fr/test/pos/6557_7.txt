A few weeks after seeing this film, he began to remind me of John Carpenter's In the Mouth Of Madness (not for the story!) With regard to the atmosphere, the quick elements of surprise and the dreamlike sequences. On the other hand, this film mixes very well the image and the music (note the 4th chapter of the film)
