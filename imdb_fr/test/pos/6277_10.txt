To be honest, this is probably the best version of my book as a sound version of the movie Jazz Singer. The 1927 version is truly a silent film despite the fact that it has become the first talking movie. <br /> <br /> Danny Thomas is a great actor and he sings very well. He does Jewish things with feeling. Peggy Lee is awesome and any film that keeps it is always fun. Allan Joslyn is not much fun and we could have done without it. A question: since when do the cantors live in such luxurious houses ???
