I saw that last night in Fort Lauderdale. In general, it was funny and I particularly liked the characters, Sabrina. The acting is good and the script is OK except for the end that leaves many chains in suspense and we were like (what?) I wanted to know what happened to the characters and it was a strange ending that could have been made so much better. <br /> <br /> The film described very well the life in the rules and we laughed a lot. There are flaws, but for Ash Christian's first film, I thought it was good. You may want to wait for the DVD on this one. But if you have the opportunity to see it, try your luck
