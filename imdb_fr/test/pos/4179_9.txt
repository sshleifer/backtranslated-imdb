That this film fell at the box office and that it still struggles to get the recognition it deserves today is really a pity, and yet rather appropriate. The commercial suicide committed by the Monkeys in making this film is reflected in the metaphorical suicide they commit on screen. To destroy so brutally their carefully constructed image as a healthy American alternative to the Beatles is courageous to the point of being reckless, as well as the confession of being no more than pawns of the entertainment industry, trapped ( literally) in their own facticity. The Monkees television series was not so conventional, but HEAD is totally devoid of intrigue ... although in the end there is a kind of circular logic to all this. Driven by a real scenario, the series of surreal events is hilarious and rather disturbing. The irony is that the Monkeys actually signed their death warrant as a commercial force at a time when they were reaching their artistic peak. Their exploration of psychedelia has reached its peak with the soundtrack of HEAD (all songs are inseparable from the film), which is one of the foremost albums of the sixties. The Monkees have begun to disintegrate after the failure of this box-office movie, but HEAD is a noble legacy.
