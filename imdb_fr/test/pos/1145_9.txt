The wind and the lion is a wonderful cinematographic film. It is a monument to what was once the cinema but no longer. <br /> <br /> Connery, despite the thick Scottish brogue, plays Raisulu very well. It inspires the viewer in a way that many main characters can not. <br /> <br /> Candice Bergen, in one of her leading roles, is wonderful in the role of the socialite kidnapped, Mrs. Pedacaris, showing courage in the face of the adversity of humor as well). A wonderful movie, rent it or buy it and you will not be disappointed.
