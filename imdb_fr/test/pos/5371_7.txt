Everyone does not like this movie. It's still one of the best "you must think" movies about Satanism ever made. The fact that MTV-era is not subject to sudden jumps or gores every seven minutes is irrelevant. Moreover, speaking as someone who really KNOWS satanists, the part of the film where the brotherhoods are exchanging their old bodies against those of pre-teenagers presents really scary scenes. The section where (second alert spoiler) Strother Martin orchestrates the change is almost hyper realistic in that it uses very few special effects, characteristic of this film. McEveety rarely had a big budget but was often efficient. It worked in this case too.
