When you read about this movie, you want to cringe. I have seen it countless times and yet I curl up! So, what is the attraction here? I think for me it's the shift of romance. I find it very refreshing to have a strange coupling between this New York columnist based on Jimmy-Breslin's style and an unlucky ballerina (in terms of health). You feel embarrassed for Paul Sorvino's discreet approach to woo this woman. Like the bar guy who does not understand anything. He is a little overweight (at least as a potential ballerina suitor, I hope it does not look mean) and maybe a bit too old for her. Good change of pace of the Greek god who woo the super-model. Bill Conti's score stayed in my mind all these years later, which is a pretty good sign. However, some of the actors are just terrible. A secondary plot involving a young Puerto Rican boy bound by the character of Sorvino is hilarious. But the opening scene where Ditchburn warms up for Carole King takes you right into this story. Good luck finding it. You might think that Lifetime would come back on this page or even on WE, but I had not seen it for several years.
