Come on. Anyone who does not understand the magnitude of this caricature here should be expelled from any panel of critics. They should not be allowed to be heard because they obviously have no sense of humor. <br /> <br /> Anyone who will not like this cartoon made here by Tex Avery should be chained to a chair and forced to watch episodes of "Huckleberry Hound" for 20 years in a row! <br /> <br /> The catch and the double catch of the wolf in this caricature are the most beautiful examples of this important past of comedy which has never been filmed. <br /> <br /> Tex Avery should receive a posthumous Oscar for this drawing. It's the best.
