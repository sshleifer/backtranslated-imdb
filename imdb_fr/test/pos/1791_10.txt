Like Margot in "Fear of Fear", victim of her ambitious husband, as Fox in "Fox and her friends" is committed suicide by her boyfriend who took all her money, like Xaverl Bolwieser in "The Stationsmaster's Wife" prison for to give his unfaithful wife a chance to get rid of him, like Hermann Hermann who fled into madness to flee his stupid wife and bankrupt society, Hans also Epp is also a victim of the German society "Wirtschaftswunder" after the Second World War in RW Fassbinder "The merchant of the four seasons". The simple fact that Fassbinder played through social abuse between men and women and between heterosexual and homosexual couples clearly shows that it does not favor any sex. <br /> <br /> In the case of Hans Epp, there are women who push him to despair, illness and finally death. When he returns from the Foreign Legion where he flew because he could not stand the pressure of his mother, she complained that he was still alive when his neighbor's brave boy had been killed. Then, Hans gets a job as a policeman, but is surprised by his foreman while he is seduced by a prostitute. After losing his job, he works as a fruit worker with little income, going from garden to garden "shouting" his products. Her mother, one of her sisters and her husband are ashamed of having such a "street worker" in their family. "The love of her life" (she has no name in the film) refuses to marry her because her work does not correspond to her social status and her origin. So, he marries Irmgard whom he does not like and who does not love him. From his constant pressure on him, he flees to drink. One evening, after his wife has followed him, he explodes and hits her. She fled to her family for which this event was exactly what they expected. When Irmgard calls a divorce lawyer, Hans has a heart attack. Imrgard decides to stay with him, but from now on, he is no longer allowed to do heavy work or drink alcohol. Then he begins to feel more and more superfluous, becomes quieter and more and more depressed. When he finds out that Irmgard is cheating on him, he chooses to end his life, but not like Hermann Hermann taking a tour in the light of madness, but he drank himself to death in front of Imrgard, their little girl and drunk buddies. . Fassbinder said in an interview that Hans knew what he was doing. The question, however, is: did Hans commit suicide because he could not stand his miserable environment anymore or did he self-proclaim?
