From the beginning, you'll love the character of Sam Elliott (Falon): a trusted policeman, especially faithful to his partner. But too loyal and too vengeful when he sees his dead partner in an alley, because he kills the one he thought was the assailant before giving him a chance to explain himself. Falon is an alcoholic, which prevents him from maintaining control of himself, even if he manages to direct his attention to the search for the true culprit of his partner's death. He wears a rookie as his new partner (which seems to be seen too often in the movies), but Esai Morales succeeds in accompanying Sam Elliot, although mysterious pieces are beginning to adapt to the point where Morales begins a self-inquiry. approved concerning Falon; he especially wants to find the answers because Fallon does not let him enter the whole story and does not like what he finds. There is not a last minute showing to whom are the bad detectives, which is correct; and they can not convince Falon to join them, leading to a dramatic end. A nice action with a touch of humor of Paul Sorvino, captain of the detectives. It's a good movie that will make you want to see it many times. so it's a good addition to a movie collection! (Filmed in San Francisco)
