Not much to say except that it's just a masterpiece. This film contains a myriad of messages that everyone should take to heart. in particular, women do not prevent your man's dreams from honoring them. Those who plan death will live in the grave. Those who carpe diem will wake those who live in fear. Even our Lord spoke of this when He rebuked Him who bury His talent in fear of making mistakes and displeasing Teacher. Take a risk, get out of the boat and walk on the water. Life is a journey that does not end in the grave but in our minds and souls.
