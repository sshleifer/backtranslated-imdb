I consider it not only the best movie Jon Voight (Midnight Cowboy, Coming Home) did, but also a real tribute to the teachers. <br /> <br /> Despite some incredible hardships, Pat Conroy (Voight) was able to reach a group of students and get them from nowhere to a basic reading and reading of the world. His methods have been criticized by bureaucratic dinosaurs such as Mr. Skeffington (Hume Cronyn), but teachers like Conroy will always be winners. <br /> <br /> Voight has truly demonstrated that he is passionate about teaching and that it's high for him. he did not exaggerate the role and I found it totally believable. Voight, it's Conrack. <br /> <br /> Besides the love of teaching, we also see another important point in this film. No matter how hard you are at work, if you swing the boat, the bureaucrats will understand you.
