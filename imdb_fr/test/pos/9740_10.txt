In the 1960s, Cleveland viewers could watch an episode of "Flash Gordon" as part of the Ghoulardi Show (23:30 Friday). It was the best simulation equipment we have ever seen in college. We would have regular "pajama nights" (even if we did not call them that) just to have fun watching this stuff with a group of friends. Then, the following week, we would quote our favorite replicas of the last episode. <br /> <br /> Watching it today is about the same thing. But if you can stop laughing dialogs, lame creatures, silly costumes and horrible spaceships long enough, there are some good things I did not appreciate the first time. The designers of the production have built excellent sets, both the rooms and the laboratory apparatus. The character of Charles Middleton's "Ming the Merciless" was the best villain of all time, certainly until then and debatable better than anyone ever since. Jean Rogers is incredibly handsome. <br /> <br /> Again, what do I know? I am only a child.
