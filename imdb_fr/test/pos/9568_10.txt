This must be the funniest movie I have ever seen. Chritopher Guest is really talented. He has a gift for humor. I almost died of laughter. In fact, when I saw this in theaters, I considered going out because the movie was so stupid. But it's silly in a good way. It's funny-beast. And it's a very good combination. You'll laugh from start to finish. <br /> <br /> This documentary-based film follows a host of characters all competing at the Kennel Club Dog Show. The cast includes Parker Posey, Fred Willard, Eugene Levy, Catherine O'Hara, John Michael Higgens, Michael McKean, Larry Miller, Bob Balaban, Jennifer Coolidge and many others. <br /> <br /> This is a really fun movie that will make everyone laugh. A person born without personality would mock this movie. It is presented in big screen to give the image that you are viewing a real documentary and that's probably what adds to the hilarity. BEST IN THE SHOW: 5/5.
