I just saw this movie last night and I must say that I loved every minute. Taken in the spirit of a parody of Bond-Esquire movies, he is really superior. The real comedy of the film is in its flagrant disregard for the politically correct. Misogyny, cultural insensitivity and the almost laughable machismo of such films are used for a major comic effect. It also challenges the illogical and formulated elements, the OSS agent constantly learning incredibly fast difficult things (like Arabic and playing a traditional instrument) while missing pathetically obvious clues. Some lines of the movie let me laugh for hours after the end of the movie ... and I must say that I learned a ... interesting ... French vocabulary that would have probably infuriated my teachers with me using. Overall, I found this film excellent. Intensely funny and the first movie I've ever seen that really parodies every aspect of the spy movie.
