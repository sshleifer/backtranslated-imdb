"Thriller" is great. It's a long video, but just brilliant. The song itself is ... excellent ... add Michael JAckson dancing and you have a golden phenomenon. Of all the videos I've ever seen, it's the best. If you have not seen the video yet, then I urge you ... <br /> <br /> The special effects are incredible, because it's time to talk ... from the wearwolf's transformation to the idea these scary zombies that slowly emerge from their graves are huge ... spookingly huge. Vicent Price has her line-up that shudders in the bones ... known simply as "rap" Ola Ray is doing well like Michael's daughter, and Michael JAckson himself ... dancing and singing (though not during the video itself) is second to none ... <br /> <br /> 10/10.
