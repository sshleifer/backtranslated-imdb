Believe me, I wanted this series to work, but Kevin Kilner's premature start was a fatal blow in the first season. Robert Leeshock just was out of place and Jane Heitmeyer did an admirable job as a lead, but the show became too confusing and confusing at the time. I do not know what happened in season five, what a mess. Sometimes it's time to drop the red cape and put the sword in the bull, if you know what I mean. The only unifying thread in the series is the astonishing performances of Leni Parker and Anita LaSelva as two Taelons in a quiet ideological conflict. Without their talents and their well-written dialogue, they would have been two strange bald-headed chicks in a B-movie series. If only this series could have ended in season 4 and later taken up by SyFy ...
