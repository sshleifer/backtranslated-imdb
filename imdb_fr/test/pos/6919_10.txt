First of all, what are some of you thinking about? It's the best movie I've seen in a long time! <br /> <br /> Secondly, I do not consider it a British film because it takes place in Dublin and mainly features Irish actors - Moran, Gambon, O Sullivan Aisling (Rita), Deirdre O'Kane, etc. . <br /> <br /> Third, I thought Moran was excellent. He was funny. Micheal Caine only seemed to be there to understand the context of Moran. Every character he took he perfected. <br /> <br /> Abigail Iversen I thought it was better than any other child actor I saw. She was credible as a smart kid, but also as a child and adult (yes, I know it sounds strange, but hey ...). Even she managed to eclipse Caine. <br /> <br /> Iversen and Moran worked very well together and were very entertaining in the preparation scene. <br /> <br /> Barreler (Gambon) was very funny in his ineptitude.
