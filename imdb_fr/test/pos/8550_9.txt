It is a finely crafted film with moving sequences, humor and above all a love story. Anthony Quinn is wonderfully portrayed, and having seen many of his films, he must be ranked among his best performances, apart from Zorba. The film makes you wonder if it's filmed in Romania, which is apparently not the case. It is certain to deceive even the native Romanians, with its landscape, its costumes and its authentic way of life. According to IMDb, it was shot in France and Yugoslavia, hmmm. The story is compelling, making you want to watch the entire movie, to see if you've forgotten anything. It provoked me in the research to know if it was a film based on the truth, but to my disappointment, it's a novel-based film, apparently a fiction. It seems a little fanciful, but you never know ... The problem with this film is that there do not seem to be any Romanian actors and it's a film about a Romanian character. There are probably a lot of Romanian replacements at the beginning, but maybe not, it's filmed elsewhere. The author of the book was Romanian, at least it is a cinematographic masterpiece.
