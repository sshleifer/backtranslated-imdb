Chris Nolan's black labyrinth on voyeurism and identity is amazing from start to finish. A first film is as complex as "Memento" or "The Prestige", although it may be a little harder to understand. Yet, he feels originality and creative motivation, and has a "twist" as intellectually stimulating as realistic. Few filmmakers have made as good use of their editors and the attention to storytelling as Nolan. The story tells the story of a bored writer who likes to follow strangers randomly in the street, until he follows someone who has noticed after the others and who has been following him ever since. complexity is increasing and identities are beginning to organize. More naturalistic and realistic than the last work of Nolan, but just as clear.
