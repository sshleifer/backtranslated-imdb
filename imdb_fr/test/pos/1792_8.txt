The four-season merchant is not what I would call a happy movie, or even a movie that impressed me to the point of praising it to heaven (there are other Fassbinder movies for that, like Veronika Voss and Satan Brew). But it's certainly no less than a fascinating experience of looking at those of a society that you and I and others we know may be familiar with or do not want to really know. I imagine that in the early 1970s, in Germany, a generation from the Second World War had a stigma to live, but was doing its best to get by. It's a stigma that floats throughout the film, and often in Fassbinder's work in general, but mostly because with Four Seasons, he looks closely at the middle class and a particular married couple - Hans the distant, depressed , depressed fruit salesman and his long-suffering wife - it's nothing less than trying to achieve realism under the guise of a melodrama. If Cassavetes was a crazy German, he could make this film, maybe even like a lark. <br /> <br /> The story looks pretty simple, where Hans's alcohol gets out of control, he beats his wife (this scene is one of the most difficult to take, maybe in n ' any film, Fassbinder's camera lingers unbroken while his wife is left defenseless and her daughter tries to stop her in her frenzy) and she is ready to leave him. As he stands in the room, his family holding him back, she files for a divorce and he suffers a heart attack. He recovers, his business suddenly starts to prosper again with the help of some good (or less good) employees - and yet it only continues his longing for another woman and her despair in general. <br /> <br /> And yet it is in this simplicity that Fassbinder tries and succeeds, for the most part, in creating an atmosphere of terror, of tension in a kitchen, in the room or in the street, that you can cut with a knife and bleed. The weakest part of all this can be the acting game ... at least that was my initial impression. Hans, played by Hirschmuller, can be an elevated presence, with only the slightest movements of his face and eyes, and for a moment he does not look like a good actor anymore. The actress playing her wife, Irm Hermann, and her sister (Fassbinder Hanna Schygulla) are doing better, but only because they are given more things to do conventionally, like crying or looking worried. It takes a bit of time to adjust to what is essentially empty in his guy Hans, because of something of his own psychological torment or self-pity and of those around him who seek to regain the sense of normality. especially once Hans has been successful. <br /> <br /> Everything is not unanimous in The Merchant of Four Seasons, but enough for me to recommend to those looking for a slice of life different from what you might be used to with American movies more modern. The world of Fassbinder is here a fight between the melodrama he loves in cinema and the acute and overwhelming sense of humanism that he personally feels and that he puts into characters to whom, for better or for worse, we identify ourselves. Are Epps a family you know? Or could you even be them? Which is to say. It is a methodical study of the tragic emptiness in the human mind, and its objectives are all attained.
