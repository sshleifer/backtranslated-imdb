This film is not your typical Hollywood dish, although the selection is so bad that I often prefer to stay away from movies rather than being disappointed. However, this little budget gem is really sweet, nice and definitely a keeper. The actors are as varied as the characters they represent, the setting of Buffalo is charming (what a pretty city) and the story shines. The absence of gratuitous violence, the sex and the word "f" do not remove anything at least! Take the kids, take grandma, take a break in Hollywood! I give it a 11 out of 10!
