I watched this because a friend told me it was pretty good, and I watched a video on it, so I really wanted to watch it. I watched it and, damn, the fight scenes are really good. If guys can not fight like that in real life, they must have fooled me. I must say that there is not as much fighting as I would like, but the fights in the film are quite spectacular. They do not show much, but you can say it's violent and cool. But there is also the plot, which revolves around a love triangle between the main characters, although it is a little twisted. Tae-sung is a carefree guy who seems to like having trouble, as well as fights. He is the head of his school and the rival of Hea-won, who is the head of his own school - a bit like a playboy, a crazy and rich boy. Then there is Han-kyung, a girl who does not want much - her father just passed away and she came back with her mother, the guy she liked was dating her old friend - and then she met Hea -won, who goes to school and Tae-sung, who calls her "nuna" (elder sister). Finally, she discovers that Tae-sung is his brother, the fruit of his father's affair, and that he loves him despite their blood relations. Meanwhile, Hea-won falls in love with her and takes her for her boyfriend. But she is torn between her boyfriend and her little brother, who confesses his love. Overall, it's a wonderful film, but if I was really depressed after the end, and I could not help but think, damn it, is there a Korean movie I'm watching about fighting / death / depressions / incest ?? Because it was the case with Old Boy and Temptation of Wolves. It's a very good movie, but people have to be ready to cry at the end.
