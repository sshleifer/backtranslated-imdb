What kind do I say about this movie? Well for starters, I thought this movie was fine, not the best, not the worst. I said that because I thought the script was great and original, really different and refreshing. Now, I would not say it's the biggest movie I've seen as an actor. The actors who played each role seem to have played them without emotion, as if they took their life. When the woman laughed or cried, it did not seem real to me for any reason, it's just an example, but honestly, not all the characters acted in any real way. I wish I could say more positive things about this film so that you can see it at least once, but how can I do it since I know I will not see this movie again? I rented this film at my school library, without hearing anything about the film itself or the director. I took a chance because the story that was described at the back seemed really interesting and it really was.
