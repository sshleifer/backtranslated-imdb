It's an amazing film: a romantic thriller with a complex but perfectly constructed intrigue and devastating symmetry, brilliantly supported by the use of recurring visual motifs. Everything is beautifully filmed: women, apartments; but the most surprising is the devastating juxtaposition of images, almost every scene has echoes of another. It's a story told in light, in color, in many parallels. Every time I look at it, it fills me with joy. <br /> <br /> The acting game is very good too. Romane Bohringer is beautiful as a woman on the verge of a nervous breakdown: everything about her changes with her mood. Vincent Cassel plays a very different role in his role at La Haine; but not less excellently: shifty and friendly at the same time. And Monica Bellucci - ah!, Monica Bellucci, in short, she plays (is?) The most perfect woman in the world. There is a small scene three-quarters of the way where she only smiles. yet, at this moment, there remains more than a few hours of Hollywood waste. <br /> <br /> We can not do justice to this film without at least mentioning the superb sequential climax: sad, shocking, ironic and subtle in its turn. But if one moment captures the brilliance of this work, it is the scene at the beginning of this fabulous denouement, whose perspective has been mockingly presented to us throughout history. Yet when the moment comes, it is treated so delicately, so briefly, so skilfully, that on reflection, it makes you gasp. Only a director whose confidence is dazzling would dare to minimize this essential point. But trust is justified. The cinema does not come much better than that.
