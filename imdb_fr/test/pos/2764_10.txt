As a child, I saw this movie on the big screen and I loved this show. Recently, I found a video copy and extracted it again. Badly done, of course ... fun, absolutely. He always packs an entertaining punch. It's a lot more fun than the dull Disney version ("Alive"). The only thing that "Alive" did better was the special effects. If you like B-movies, I highly recommend "Survive", not to mention all the other Rene Cardona Jnr movies ... and Mexican wrestling movies made by his father (Rene Cardona Snr). "Survive" is long awaited for the special DVD edition. Do you listen, all of you kind, to Anchor Bay ...?
