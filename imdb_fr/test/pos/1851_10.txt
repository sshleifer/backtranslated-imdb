I love that movie! He has everything! Bonnie Hunt did a fantastic job in co-writing, directing and co-starring in this movie. David Duchovny is just hot. and Minnie Driver is as cute as ever. combine all this talent with David Allen Grier, Carol O'Connor, Robert Loggia, Joley Richardson and Jim Belushi, you get a movie worthy of an Oscar! I'm surprised they did not have one. if you have not seen it, rent the DVD, watch it once, then comment on the directors ... Bonnie Hunt is Fabulous!
