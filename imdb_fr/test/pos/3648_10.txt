People who say that some of the images in Looney Tunes' drawings are inappropriate for children have apparently forgotten something: they were not originally intended for children. They were produced for the cinema, to be shown before the feature films, in order to be able to show everything they wanted. "S.O.S. of Tweety" Sylvester finds Tweety aboard a liner and boarded the ship to try to join him. But two things work against Sylvester: Granny protects the canary vehemently and Sylvester easily seasick (we do not see him vomiting, but with his green face, it is perfectly clear that he did exactly that!). And then, of course, Tweety, who looks pretty cute, has a bad pass. <br /> <br /> It's great to see that these drawings are not afraid to do everything; Whatever they thought to show, they showed. We must understand that cartoons are not always supposed to be a fun entertainment for kids. Very funny.
