I have not seen a film of Van Damme for a while, pleasantly surprised, he still has it, he looks older, but harder, a little like Sly, becomes more robust with age. It's a good film that made me take a look at all the Van Damme films I've missed in the last ten years. I would like to see a good director put Van Damme on the big screen with a good script. Van Damme always wants to amaze the audience, the last film seen with Van Damme was Legionnaire, it was also a good movie. In addition, I took a look at the history of the first battles of Van Damme and, too, my astonishment, I realized that he was the true martial artist very accomplished in his youth.
